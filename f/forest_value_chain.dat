The research was performed through a systematic analysis by integrative contextualista approach, where were identified information on the recognition of the final consumer in relation to forest certification process in seven different countries. The results showed that only a small fraction in the consumer market is aware of the certification process in the forestry sector even in the economically developed regions. The findings show that one of the possible reasons for the increase of production of forest certified products in the last years is less by a requirement of final consumer and more for to a source of the product warranty along to intermediate actors in the <b>forest</b> <b>value</b> <b>chain.</b> There is also the possibility of requirements of forest certification made by intermediaries agents, in forest supply chain, figure as non-tariff barrier.

40|$|Engineered wood {{products}} for structural use must meet minimum strength and stiffness criteria. This represents {{a major challenge}} for the industry as the mechanical properties of the wood resource are inherently variable. We report on a case study that was conducted in a laminated veneer lumber (LVL) mill {{in order to test}} the potential of an acoustic sensor to predict structural properties of the wood resource prior to processing. A population of 266 recently harvested aspen logs were segregated into three sub-populations based on measurements of longitudinal acoustic speed in wood using a hand tool equipped with a resonance-based acoustic sensor. Each of the three sub-populations were peeled into veneer sheets and graded for stiffness with an ultrasonic device. The average ultrasonic propagation time (UPT) of each subpopulation was 418, 440 and 453 microseconds for the green, blue, and red populations, respectively. This resulted in contrasting proportions of structural veneer grades, indicating that the efficiency of the <b>forest</b> <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> could be improved using acoustic sensors. A linear regression analysis also showed that the dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) of LVL was strongly related to static MOE (R 2 = 0. 83), which suggests that acoustic tools may be used for quality control during the production process...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{planning}} {{to optimize the}} <b>forest</b> <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> requires accurate and detailed information about the resource; however, estimates {{of the distribution of}} fibre properties on the landscape are largely unavailable prior to harvest. Our objective was to fit a model of the tree-level average fibre length related to ecosite classification and other forest inventory variables depicted at the landscape scale. A series of black spruce increment cores were collected at breast height from trees in nine different ecosite groups within the boreal forest of northeastern Ontario, and processed using standard techniques for maceration and fibre length measurement. Regression tree analysis and random forests were used to fit hierarchical classification models and find the most important predictor variables for the response variable area-weighted mean stem-level fibre length. Ecosite group was the best predictor in the regression tree. Longer mean fibre-length was associated with more productive ecosites that supported faster growth. The explanatory power of the model of fitted data was good; however, random forests simulations indicated poor generalizability. These results suggest the potential to develop localized models linking wood fibre length in black spruce to landscape-level attributes, and improve the sustainability of forest management by identifying ideal locations to harvest wood that has desirable fibre characteristics...|$|E

40|$|<b>Value</b> <b>chain</b> {{analysis}} (VCA) {{has emerged}} since the 1990 s as {{a novel approach}} for understanding how power, benefits and costs are embodied and distributed to various actors. The Indonesian furniture industry demonstrates a long chain of production to consumption, from raw material producers (tree growers), semi-finished producers, finished product producers, and retailers to exporters. Each actor is connected by intermediaries. Indonesian furniture, dominated by teak, contributed 2 % of the global wood furniture trade (valued US$ 85 billion in 2007). Indonesian forest includes more than 35 % of the world’s teak forests. The furniture industry provides employment and livelihoods to millions of people. This paper describes the value added distribution to all furniture actors, actions to strengthen small-scale producers, and global comparisons with other <b>forest</b> product <b>value</b> <b>chains.</b> The furniture <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> connects producers from Jepara District, the center of Indonesian furniture with annual exports of US$ 150 million, with furniture retailers in Europe, the USA, Australia and Japan. The problem is power imbalance throughout the <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> and unhealthy competition among producers, which result in poverty of small-scale producers, product quality degradation and an unsustainable furniture industry. The adaptation of small-scale producers to market demand is low. They are price takers rather than the price setters, as indicated by their decreasing bargaining power. We used VCA to hypothesize governance and institutional arrangement scenarios for more equitable power and income to sustain both the forest and the furniture industry. Following the VCA analysis, action research is being conducted. Researchers and furniture stakeholders have jointly developed plans and actions to strengthen the industry structure, improve value addition and improve livelihoods. To ensure local and national impacts, we have collaborated with the Jepara Furniture Multi-stakeholder Forum, the Jepara local government, the Forestry Research and Development Agency (FORDA) of the Indonesia Ministry of Forestry, and Bogor Agricultural University.

Social thresholds, a key concept in SES, are consistent with multiple social economic forces experienced by forest communities. Detrimental feed-back effects of SES can be confronted when innovative exploration mechanisms, such as new productive chains are developed, or the agro-extractive cycles of current productive system are expanded.

Overall net transfers to the atmosphere totaled 91. 8 and 103. 5 TgCO 2 -eq. in 1990 and 2005, respectively, although the difference between these net transfers may not be statistically significant. Net transfers were higher in 2005 primarily because additions to carbon stored in forest products were less in 2005. Over this same period, energy-related manufacturing emissions decreased by almost 9 % even though forest products output increased by approximately 15 %.

40|$|Accurate {{information}} on the wood-quality characteristics of standing timber and logs is needed to optimize the <b>forest</b> production <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> and to assess the potential of forest resources to meet other services. Physical and chemical characteristics of wood vary with both tree and site characteristics. At the tree scale, crown development, stem shape and taper, branch size and branch location, knot size, type and placement, and age all influence wood properties. More broadly, at the stand level, stocking density, moisture, nutrient availability, climate, competition, disturbance, and stand age have also been identified as key determinants of wood quality. Such information is often captured in polygon based forest inventory data. Other terrain-related spatial information, such as elevation, slope and aspect, can improve assessments of site conditions and limitations upon plant growth which impact wood quality. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is an emerging technology, which directly measures the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies using ground or airborne laser instruments, and can provide highly accurate {{information on}} individual-tree and stand-level forest structure. In this paper, we explore the potential of LiDAR and other geospatial information sources to model and predict wood quality based on individual-tree and stand structural metrics.
