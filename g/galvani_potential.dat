25|$|When solids of two {{different}} materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the contact potential. Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact electromotive force or <b>Galvani</b> <b>potential.</b> The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and {{there is now a}} built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.|$|E

When a voltmeter is connected between two different types of metal, it measures not the electric potential difference, but instead the potential difference corrected for the different atomic environments. The quantity measured by a voltmeter is called electrochemical potential or fermi level, while the pure unadjusted electric potential is sometimes called <b>Galvani</b> <b>potential.</b> The terms [...] "voltage" [...] and [...] "electric potential" [...] are a bit ambiguous in that, in practice, they can refer to either of these in different contexts.|$|E

In accord with simulation but contradicting integral equation and field theories, the reduced critical temperature falls when z increases while the density rho(c) rises steeply. These trends {{can be explained}} semiquantitatively by noting that 80 %- 90 % of the ions near T-c are bound in neutral or charged clusters, depleting the ionic strength.

50|$|The {{electric}} field {{is not the}} only factor determining charge flow in a material, and different materials naturally develop electric potential differences at equilibrium (<b>Galvani</b> <b>potentials).</b> The electric potential of a material is not even a well defined quantity, since it varies on the subatomic scale. A more convenient definition of 'voltage' can be found instead in the concept of Fermi level. In this case the voltage between two bodies is the thermodynamic work required to move a unit of charge between them. This definition is practical since a real voltmeter actually measures this work, not a difference in electric potential.|$|R

40|$|An {{increasingly}} comprehensive body {{of literature}} is being devoted to single-molecule bridge-mediated electronic nanojunctions, prompted by their prospective applications in molecular electronics and single-molecule analysis. These junctions may operate in gas phase or electrolyte solution (in situ). For biomolecules, the latter is much closer to their native environment. Convenient target molecules are aromatic molecules, peptides, oligonucleotides, transition metal complexes, and, broadly, molecules with repetitive units, for which the conducting orbitals are energetically well below electronic levels of the solvent. A key feature for these junctions is rectification in the current–voltage relation. A common view is that asymmetric molecules or asymmetric links to the electrodes are needed to acquire rectification. However, as we show here, this requirement could be different in situ, where a structurally symmetric system can provide rectification because of the Debye screening of the electric field in the nanogap if the screening length is smaller than the bridge length. The <b>Galvani</b> <b>potentials</b> of each electrode can be varied independently and lead to a transistor effect. We explore this behavior for the superexchange mechanism of electron transport, appropriate for a wide class of molecules. We also include the effect of conformational fluctuations on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels; that gives rise to non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the conductance, affected by the molecule length. Our study offers an analytical formula for the current–voltage characteristics that demonstrates all these features.

40|$|We {{study the}} phase {{behavior}} of polyelectrolyte (PE) solutions with salt using a simple liquid-state (LS) theory. This LS theory accounts for hard-core excluded volume repulsion by the Boublik–Mansoori–Carnahan–Starling–Leland equation of state, electrostatic correlation by the mean-spherical approximation, and chain connectivity by the first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory. We predict a closed-loop binodal {{curve in the}} PE concentration-salt concentration phase diagram when the Bjerrum length is smaller than the critical Bjerrum length in salt-free PE solution. The phase-separated region shrinks with decreasing Bjerrum length, and disappears below a critical Bjerrum length. These results are qualitatively consistent with experiments, but cannot be captured by the Voorn–Overbeek theory. On {{the basis of the}} closed-loop binodal curve and the lever rule, we predict three scenarios of salting-out and salting-in phenomena with addition of monovalent salt into an initially salt-free PE solution. The <b>Galvani</b> potential—the electric <b>potential</b> difference between the coexisting phases—is found to depend nonmonotonically on the overall salt concentration in some PE concentration range, which is related to the partition of the co-ions in the coexisting phases. Free energy analysis suggests that phase separation is driven by a gain in the electrostatic energy, at the expense of a large translational entropy penalty, due to significant counterion accumulation in the PE-rich phase...|$|R

50|$|First, {{consider}} the <b>Galvani</b> <b>potential</b> between two metals. When two metals are electrically isolated from each other, an arbitrary voltage difference may exist between them. However, when two different metals are brought into electronic contact, electrons will {{flow from the}} metal with a lower voltage to the metal with the higher voltage until the Fermi level of the electrons in the bulk of both phases are equal. The actual numbers of electrons that passes between the two phases is small (it depends on the capacitance between the objects), and the occupancies of the electron bands are practically unaffected. Rather, this small increase or decrease in charge results in a shift in all the energy levels in the metals. An electrical double layer is formed at the interface between the two phases.|$|E
50|$|The first {{demonstration}} of the photovoltaic effect in 1839 used an electrochemical cell, but the most familiar form of the photovoltaic effect in modern times though is in solid-state devices, mainly in photodiodes. When sunlight or other sufficiently energetic light is incident upon the photodiode, the electrons present in the valence band absorb energy and, being excited, jump to the conduction band and become free. These excited electrons diffuse, and some reach the rectifying junction (usually a p-n junction) where they are accelerated into a different material by a built-in potential (<b>Galvani</b> <b>potential).</b> This generates an electromotive force, and thus some of the light energy is converted into electric energy. The photovoltaic effect can also occur when two photons are absorbed simultaneously in a process called two-photon photovoltaic effect.|$|E

The hole transfer is mediated via the generation of OHs ¥ at the particle surface. On the other hand, photocurrents of the opposite sign were observed in the presence of TCNQ at pH’s higher than 10.
