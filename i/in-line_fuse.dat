5000|$|Unofficially, the [...] "low-profile mini" [...] fuse is {{sometimes}} incorrected called [...] "micro" [...] since the term means smaller than mini, but recently fuses using the micro name have been released. Regular blade-type fuses, {{also known as}} standard fuses, were developed in 1976 for low voltage use in motor vehicles. The mini fuses were developed in the 1990s. Blade type fuses can be mounted in fuse blocks, <b>in-line</b> <b>fuse</b> holders, or fuse clips.|$|E
40|$|Detecting and {{extinguishing}} electric arcs ultra-fast within some milliseconds, a novel modular {{protective device}} provides efficient personal {{protection against the}} hazards of an electric fault arc particularly in case of direct exposure due to opened LV installations during live working or working {{in the vicinity of}} live parts. It is part of the electric power equipment or can be used as mobile unit connected to the electric system before starting work. The paper is reporting on laboratory tests for proving the protective system tripping safety and immunity against malfunctions. Main focus is directed to the optical detection unit of the protective system. Based on an optimized design of the optical detectors unit the modular protective device is prepared for use in the practical work. A couple of test series were directed to evaluate the system response in case of different disturbing optical sources. Among others the system immunity was analyzed when fuses are withdrawn in LV distribution centers with fuses or <b>in-line</b> <b>fuse</b> switch-disconnectors. The switching arcs occurring in such cases may not trip the protection system...|$|E
40|$|Power and {{ignition}} sense are {{supplied to}} the radio through J 650. Since the power is connected directly to the vehicle battery, the ignition sense line tells the radio when the vehicle ignition is on. The PA board connects to the RF board via J 600, a 10 -pin socket. This connector supplies power to the RF board through F 600 and provides control over the PA board. CR 600, a transorb prevents negative voltages and extremely high positive voltages from damaging the radio by conducting and blowing the 12 A <b>in-line</b> <b>fuse.</b> The main antenna {{is connected to the}} PA board through J 630, a mini-UHF connector. The transmitter output and main receiver input are provided through this 50 Ω connector. The main receiver signal is passed to the RF board through P 200, a 50 Ω through-chassis connector. The transmit drive input comes from the RF board through P 500, another 50 Ω through-chassis connector. PA TEMPERATURE SENSE One control signal provided to the RF board microprocessor is temperature sense. A thermistor (RT 680 for 10 W models, or RT 690 for 40 W models) is placed next to the final amplifier on the PA board and its resistance changes with the final amplifier temperature. The thermistor is biased by R 405 on the RF board providing a voltage that varies linearly with temperature from 15 °C to 125 °C, the normal temperature range of the PA during use. If the final amplifier temperature exceeds a preset threshold, the microprocessor will fold back the power to preven...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} pose-based {{algorithm}} {{to solve the}} full SLAM problem for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), navigating in an unknown and possibly un-structured environment. The technique incorporate probabilistic scan matching with range scans gathered from a Mechanical Scanning Imaging Sonar (MSIS) and the robot dead-reckoning displacements estimated from a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and a Motion Reference Unit (MRU). The proposed method utilizes two Extended Kalman Filters (EKF). The first, estimates the local path travelled by the robot while grabbing the scan {{as well as its}} uncertainty and provides position estimates for correcting the distortions that the vehicle motion produces in the acoustic images. The second is an augment state EKF that estimates and keeps the registered scans poses. The raw data from the sensors are processed and <b>fused</b> <b>in-line.</b> No priory structural information or initial pose are considered. The algorithm has been tested on an AUV guided along a 600 m path within a marina environment, showing the viability of the proposed approach. I...|$|R
