To develop this method of encryption technique, one of the simplest methods of random number generator methods called Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) has been used. Playfair cipher method based on polyalphabetic cipher. It {{is relatively easy to}} break because it still leaves much of the structure and a few <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> ciphertext are sufficient. Here we are mapping random numbers to secret key of Playfair cipher method and corresponding numbers will be transmitted to the recipient instead <b>of</b> alphabetical <b>letter.</b> This method rapidly increases security of the transmission over an unsecured channel.

5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years with a heart tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> from fans asking him to publish more stories about Lad, and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong, abuse of authority, and justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book he would write about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad. Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would change his mind and release one more Lad novel, Lad of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E

[...] Few recognised the tongue-in-cheek aspect; Mitford received <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> from [...] worried readers desperate to know if they were snobs or merely [...] "common".
