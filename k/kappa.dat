5|$|After the war, <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi {{began an}} ambitious {{expansion}} program to reactivate old chapters and install new ones. The fraternity had been divided into 11 districts since 1941, which {{were led by}} a Grand Counselor (now called Governors). With the revitalization of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history. District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful—in the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 {{by the end of}} 1957.|$|E

5|$|Bowling {{was elected}} Grand President of <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi in 1941 and {{presented}} {{a plan to}} hold a national intercollegiate band concert, modeled after the Rocky Mountain intercollegiate bands. The delegation endorsed the plan, {{which was to be}} executed at the next biennial national convention in Stillwater in 1943, the silver jubilee of the fraternity. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and so the next biennial convention was held in 1947. The first National Intercollegiate Band gave a concert on the evening of Friday, March 7, 1947. All delegates, officers, and visitors to the convention performed in the ensemble, which was augmented by <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi members from the Oklahoma A Symphonic Band so the band had a balanced instrumentation.|$|E

These are the North Central, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western Districts. Although an International District is provided for, it has no chapters.|$|E

5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa <b>Kappa</b> Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E

DeForest Cline's <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi march. The 1947 NIB was recognized as the first-ever intercollegiate band assembled with a national scope in the United States. Since 1947, the fraternity has presented the F. Lee Bowling Participation Award to the college or university who has had the most students participate in the National Intercollegiate Band, regardless of membership in <b>Kappa</b> <b>Kappa</b> Psi or Tau Beta Sigma. In {{the case of a}} tie, multiple awards are presented.|$|E

Her mother, who owns a real estate agency along with her husband, some would say unhelpfully, does most of her homework. The Chi <b>Kappas</b> attempt to woo Fritzi away from the PACK after she wins homecoming queen, using the same democratic system that the Pack stands for, and was spearheaded by Tracy.
