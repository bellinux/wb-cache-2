40|$|Pile set-up and pile {{relaxation}} {{refer to}} the time dependent increase and decrease in the load carrying capacity of <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> respectively. These two phenomena are governed mainly by the dissipation of excess pore pressure. In the case of pile set-up, the initially induced positive pore pressure within the soil mass becomes almost zero after some time, resulting {{in an increase in}} effective stress, whereas in the case of pile relaxation, the reduction of initially induced negative pore pressure causes a decrease in effective stress with time. For the safe and economical design of <b>driven</b> <b>piles,</b> a reliable prediction of the variation in pile capacity is essential. The researchers have tried to understand set-up and relaxation in the past, and attempted to predict the variation in pile capacity. This paper presents an insight into the pile set-up and the time dependent increase in load carrying capacity of <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> along with some details of pile relaxation through a critical review of experimental and mathematical studies reported until recently. The review shows that the most studies are related to the set-up of <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> because the <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> are generally used in loose sandy and soft clayey grounds where set-up phenomenon is often observed. Some empirical relationships have been reported to predict set-up, and demonstrated reasonable success in a number of studies. A number of exploration phase field tests offering potential value in predicting setup have been identified. A possibility of estimating pile set-up during design stage with the help of relevant subsurface exploration program is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional dynamic pile installation methods, pile jacking is an environmentally friendly technique that could become more widely accepted. Great concern has arisen over the performance of jacked piles as {{compared with that of}} <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> This paper describes a comprehensive field study that was aimed at investigating the differences and similarities between the behaviour of jacked H-piles and that of driven H-piles. The instrumented piles, varying in length from 32 to 55 m and having a design capacity of up to 3540 kN, were installed in residual soils whose properties are close to silty sands. The load test results indicate that the shaft resistance of jacked piles is generally suffer and stronger than that of <b>driven</b> <b>piles,</b> but the base resistance of jacked piles is weaker than that of <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> At a load level of twice the design capacity, the percentage of pile head load carried by base varies from 2 % to 10 % for jacked piles, with a mean value of 6 %; for <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> the percentage varies from 6 % to 61 % with a mean value of 38 %. The back-calculated values of the shaft friction coefficient, β, were found to be in a range of 0. 25 - 0. 6 for both jacked and <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> A correlation was also observed between the ultimate shaft friction and the mean standard penetration test N value (N̄), which suggests that the shaft friction can be taken as 1. 5 N̄ to 2 N̄ (kPa) for both jacked and driven H-piles. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

The drilled shaft methodology is based upon Federal Highway Administration reports. <b>Driven</b> <b>pile</b> methodology utilizes two types of analyses: SPT and CPT. SPT methodology is based on empirical correlations between cone penetrometer tests and standard penetration tests for typical Florida soil types. Unit end bearing resistance and unit skin friction resistance versus SPT N values are given in the FDOT research bulletin RB-121, for the different soil types. <b>Driven</b> <b>pile</b> capacity calculated using CPT data can be determined by three separate methods. The first method is the Schmertmann method proposed by Schmertmann in 1978 (AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Manual).

2500|$|Prefabricated <b>piles</b> are <b>driven</b> {{into the}} ground using a <b>pile</b> driver. <b>Driven</b> <b>piles</b> are either wood, {{reinforced}} concrete, or steel. Wooden piles are made from the trunks of tall trees. Concrete piles are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like Franki piles). They are reinforced with rebar and are often prestressed. Steel piles are either pipe piles {{or some sort of}} beam section (like an H-pile). Historically, wood piles used splices to join multiple segments end-to-end when the driven depth required was too long for a single pile; today, splicing is common with steel piles, though concrete piles can be spliced with mechanical and other means. <b>Driving</b> <b>piles,</b> as opposed to drilling shafts, is advantageous because the soil displaced by driving the piles compresses the surrounding soil, causing greater friction against the sides of the piles, thus increasing their load-bearing capacity. <b>Driven</b> <b>piles</b> are also considered to be [...] "tested" [...] for weight-bearing ability because of their method of installation; thus the motto of the <b>Pile</b> <b>Driving</b> Contractors' Association is [...] "A Driven Pile...Is a Tested Pile!".|$|R

40|$|Through {{the past}} years {{unexpectedly}} large settlements {{of the existing}} structures have been registered {{as a result of}} geotechnical site works, and especially, due to the boring and installation of steel core piles. One of the recognized effects related to the bored piles which may lead to the settlements, is remoulding and reconsolidation of soft clay in a limited zone around the pile shaft during installation phase. The radial extent of the remoulded clay around the bored shaft remains unknown, but the pore pressure measurements from recent projects indicate that installation of bored shafts may have larger impact on the surrounding soft soil than what is known for the <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> During the past decades, large amount of research has been done on the effects of pile driving and axial capacity of <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> The research has resulted in several analytical and numerical methods for prediction of strains, stress changes and consolidation times due to the installation of <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> Contrary to the <b>driven</b> <b>piles,</b> there is fairly limited amount of research dealing with the effects of bored shaft installation. Through an extensive laboratory test programme, the thesis investigates how installation of bored shafts may affect strength and compressibility properties of the surrounding soft soils. The simulation of pile installation effects is achieved by subjecting different clay types to different levels of pre-straining through extrusion. The strength and compressibility properties of pre-strained samples are respectively evaluated by falling cone and oedometer testing. The same tests are also carried out on manually remoulded material. Furthermore, an attempt is made to identify the correlation between different levels of reconsolidation stresses and increase in shear strength of pre-strained reconsolidated samples, as well as volume changes due to the reconsolidation.

Meanwhile, helical piles are gaining popularity {{as a foundation for}} new structures and retrofitting solution for existing deficient foundations due to their immense advantages over conventional <b>driven</b> <b>pile</b> alternatives. In addition, helical pile foundations performed well in recent earthquakes, proving they can be a suitable foundation option in seismic regions. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the seismic performance of helical piles by conducting full-scale shaking table tests and nonlinear three-dimensional numerical modeling using the computer program ABAQUS/Standard. The experimental setup involved installing ten steel piles with different configurations and pile head masses in dry sand enclosed in a laminar shear box mounted on the NEES/UCSD Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table. The loading scheme consisted of white noise and two earthquake time histories with varying intensity and frequency content. The performance of different moment curve fitting techniques used for reduction of shake table experimental data are compared. The experimental results are presented in terms of natural frequency and response of the test piles. The effects of the loading intensity and frequency and the pile’s geometrical configuration and installation method were evaluated. The dynamic numerical model constructed accounted properly for the test boundary conditions, employing tied vertical boundaries. In addition, the nonlinear behavior of the soil during the strong ground motion was simulated by considering a strain-dependent shear modulus and applying Masing’s loading-unloading rules by the overlay method to account for the soil non linearity more realistically. The numerical model was verified employing the full-scale experimental results, then was used to conduct a limited parametric study that investigated the effect of pile stiffness and the location of helix on its lateral response. The experimental results show that the natural frequency of the <b>driven</b> <b>pile</b> was slightly higher than that of the helical piles. However, the response of the helical pile was close to that of the <b>driven</b> <b>pile,</b> which illustrates the ability of helical piles to perform as good as conventional piles under seismic loading...|$|E
