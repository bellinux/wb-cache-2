50|$|Chemically, <b>efungumab</b> is a {{single-chain}} {{variable fragment}} {{of a human}} monoclonal antibody.As such, it potentially act similarly to an IgA - inhibiting by binding and blocking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efungumab</b> (trade name Mycograb) {{is a drug}} {{developed}} by NeuTec Pharma (a subsidiary of Novartis), intended to treat invasive Candida infection in combination with amphotericin B. The European Medicines Agency has twice refused to grant marketing authorization for Mycograb, citing product safety and quality issues.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Heat shock protein 90 (hsp 90) is {{targeted}} by the humoral response in invasive candidiasis. This paper tests for synergy between caspofungin and efungumabâ€”a human antibody fragment against hsp 90. Methods: The MIC- 0, MIC- 2 values and FICI were determined {{for a range of}} yeasts against <b>efungumab</b> and caspofungin. These yeasts were injected intravenously into mice with: 100 mL of saline plus 100 mL of formulation buffer; 100 mL of caspofungin (1 or 4 mg/kg) plus 100 mL of formulation buffer; or 100 mL of caspofungin (1 or 4 mg/kg) plus 100 mL of <b>efungumab</b> 2 mg/kg. Yeast counts were deter-mined for kidney, liver and spleen. Electron microscopy was performed on efungumab-stained Candida grown with and without caspofungin...|$|E
