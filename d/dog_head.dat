5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a <b>dog</b> <b>head</b> resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.|$|E

500|$|The Board of Health {{was led by}} Chief Health Officer Walter R. Nursey. All matters {{regarding}} quarantine {{within the}} district were handled by Edmund A. Struthers. The board was established to confine and treat the smallpox epidemic in the territory, and had wide powers {{to carry out this}} mission. The Board of Health established vaccination programs among native populations in the District of Keewatin based on legislation that continued well after the Council was dissolved. [...] Mr Nursey was despatched by Governor Morris in February 1877 with a quarantine party to Lake Winnipeg to establish a northern quarantine and sanitary cordon between the City of Winnipeg and the infected area.

There were no supplies, money or instruction on arrival. The quarantine party returned to Winnipeg in July 1877 half starved.|$|E
