5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> that the name came into these languages from British Celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as * or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, already before English had become widely spoken in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Scholars debate {{when the}} third Lombard–Gepid War started; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> {{that it took}} place {{two years after the}} second war. The {{possible}} dates are either 551 or 552. The 551 date is upheld by those who argue that since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5,500 of his warriors to Narses' Italian campaign, the third Lombard–Gepid War must have already ended by then; against this scholars such as Walter Pohl protest that this is in contradiction with Audoin's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the Gepids, despite his massive support to Narses.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's {{rejects the}} ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on {{individual}} participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots. The exception is , Que valor! (What courage!), which depicts Agustina de Aragón (1786–1857), the heroine of Zaragoza, who brought food to the cannoneers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000 Spaniards died. When all the cannoneers had been killed, Agustina manned and fired the cannons herself. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> that Goya could not have witnessed this incident, Robert Hughes believes {{it may have been}} his visit to Zaragoza in the lull {{between the first and second}} phases of the siege that inspired him to produce the series.|$|E

50|$|In the treaty, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> that Ruler of Mewar, {{will not}} be bound to present himself in person at Mughal court, instead, a son or brother of the Rana would wait upon the mughal emperor and serve him.

Further, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> that Mewar would have to keep a contingent of 1500 horsemen in the Mughal service. Finally, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>agreed</b> that the fort of Chittor would never be repaired. The reason for this last condition was that the Chittor fort was a very powerful bastion and the mughals <b>were</b> wary of <b>it</b> being used in any future rebellion.|$|R

25|$|An {{experiment}} on the California drift gill net fishery demonstrated how acoustic pingers reduce marine mammal bycatch. It was shown that bycatch was significantly reduced for common dolphins and sea lions. Bycatch rates were also lower for other cetacean species like the Northern right whale dolphin, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Risso’s dolphin and Dall's Porpoise. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> upon {{that the more}} pingers on a net, the less bycatch. There was a 12-fold decrease in common dolphin entanglement using a net with 40 pingers.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> {{that the}} present church was built under Pope Sixtus III (432–440).

As well as this church on the summit of the Esquiline Hill, Pope Sixtus III is said to have commissioned extensive building projects throughout the city, which were continued by his successor Pope Leo I, the Great.|$|E
25|$|The {{permissibility}} of {{depictions of}} Muhammad in Islam {{has been a}} contentious issue. Oral and written descriptions of Muhammad are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions.

25|$|Aphasia affects {{both the}} {{expression}} and reception of language. Both two most common types, expressive aphasia and receptive aphasia, affect speech perception to some extent. Expressive aphasia causes moderate difficulties for language understanding. The effect of receptive aphasia on understanding {{is much more}} severe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> upon, that aphasics suffer from perceptual deficits. They usually cannot fully distinguish place of articulation and voicing. As for other features, the difficulties vary. It {{has not yet been}} proven whether low-level speech-perception skills are affected in aphasia sufferers or whether their difficulties are caused by higher-level impairment alone.|$|E
25|$|The NAALC {{supplement}} to NAFTA aimed {{to create a}} foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems, {{as well as to}} promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries, in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions. Though most economists agree {{that it is difficult to}} assess the direct impact of the NAALC, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> that there has been a convergence of labor standards in North America. Given its limitations, however, NAALC has not produced (and in fact was not intended to achieve) convergence in employment, productivity and salary trend in North America.|$|E
25|$|With his underlings {{attending}} to the seizure of Vientiane, Thao Ma commandeered an AT-28 fighter-bomber. Accounts disagree {{on the number of}} sorties flown by Thao Ma and his wingmen. While contemporary news accounts state Thao Ma flew at least three times, historians note only that he was accompanied by six loyal pilots. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> that his principal target was a fellow general whom he hated, Kouprasith Abhay. Both Kouprasith's home and office were bombed by the AT-28s, but missed him. As Royalist troops began to rally against the coup, American colonel Al Degroote drove to the home of the commanding general of the Air Force.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> on by some psychologists that {{experiences}} {{during early}} sexual development {{can have a}} profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposed}} act of law {{begins its}} life when a particular government minister or ministry prepares a first draft {{with the assistance}} of the Attorney-General's Department. The draft, known as a bill, is then discussed by the Cabinet. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>agreed</b> to submit it to Parliament, the bill is distributed to all MPs. It then goes through three readings before the Dewan Rakyat. The first reading is where the minister or his deputy submits it to Parliament. At the second reading, the bill is discussed and debated by MPs. At the third reading, the minister or his deputy formally submit it to a vote for approval. A simple majority is usually required to pass the bill, but in certain cases, such as amendments to the constitution, a two-thirds majority is required. Should the bill pass, it is sent to the Dewan Negara, where the three readings are carried out again. The Dewan Negara may choose not to pass the bill, but this only delays its passage by a month, or in some cases, a year; once this period expires, the bill is considered to have been passed by the house.|$|E
