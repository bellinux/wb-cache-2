5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted {{with a mixture of}} <b>floribunda</b> <b>roses</b> and herbaceous perennials. Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|R
50|$|When {{selecting}} the rose varieties, {{one of the}} goals was to show different groups of roses: Species roses - the original species from which varieties were bred 300 years ago; Old Garden Roses - the products of early breeding of roses; and modern roses such as Hybrid tea <b>roses,</b> <b>Floribunda,</b> Polyanthas, miniature <b>roses,</b> rose shrubs, and modern climbers.|$|R
50|$|The {{collection}} of roses include Miniature Roses, Ramblers, Hybrid Tea Roses, Yakimour, Polyanthas, Papagena, <b>Floribunda</b> and <b>roses</b> of unusual colours like green and black. The varieties of rose plants planted here were assembled from different sources around the world.|$|R

In 1939, Boerner increased J&P's stock of roses by collecting 10,000 cuttings from growers in Europe. These cuttings were instrumental in the successful propagation of new varieties.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, roses are {{identified}} {{by a number}} during the trial period, with their identity not revealed until after final judging. A local panel of judges may assess them throughout the trial period, although at some trials {{there may be an}} invited national or international panel. Roses are generally judged within a category, such as Hybrid Tea, <b>Floribunda,</b> or patio <b>rose,</b> to fairly compare like styles. There are specific awards for fragrance, which are judged across all categories.|$|R
50|$|Sundial Garden {{that has}} the actual sundial {{in the center of}} it. It was {{believed}} to be used for tea and <b>floribunda</b> type <b>roses.</b> The Sundial Garden is similar changes to the gardens as summer sunflowers, fall mums, and winter cabbage and kale. The last garden is the Sunken Garden in end of the line of gardens. The Sunken Garden was constructed in 1934 and completed in 1936 as an amphitheatre area for small concerts and entertaining but now it is a garden. Kwansan cherry trees (which were given by the Emperor of Japan in the 1930s) and collection of day lilies (given by the Georgia Day Lily Society in the 1980s) are in the garden with the changes of the seasons, annuals, and ornamental grasses (summer), mums (fall), and pansies, violas, cabbage, and kale (winter) in the beds.|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of a new rose variety is a process that takes at least five years. A general prerequisite for a successful breeding programme is to obtain wide offspring on which selection of seedlings with the desired traits can be performed. However, rose cultivars are characterised by low seed set and poor seed germination which hinder the achievement of a high number of seedlings. The main objective {{of this study was to}} explore the potential of improving seed production efficiency during the first phase of the breeding process. Experiments were initially conducted to gain insight into the fertility of pollen donors and their effect on a successful hybridization. To this end, we studied the crossing results of a 14 years old private company breeding database. High correlations were found between the number of seeds produced per hybridization and either the pollen diameter or the percentage of normal pollen, thus allowing the development and validation of a prediction model for seed set based on pollen quality. Subsequently, to deepen the knowledge about embryo development in hybrid roses, we studied the embryo morphogenesis of two <b>floribunda</b> <b>roses</b> at seven time points, from 3 to 60 days after pollination (DAP). Embryos were fully developed at 15 DAP while seeds at 30 DAP. In parallel, the abscisic acid (ABA) content in the developing embryos decreased to basal level from 30 DAP on. Finally, since rose breeders need reliable and efficient germination protocols to exploit all vital embryos, a third experimental work was set to evaluate practice oriented treatments to enhance seed germination. Both chemical and microbial seed scarifications were carried out. It is clear that a complex combination of multiple treatments needs to be applied to overcome the physical restrictions of the seed coat and the physiological dormancy. As a result of this multi-objective approach, which addressed the main aspects of the first year of the rose breeding programme, a number of practical-oriented solutions are proposed...|$|R
50|$|Today {{the gardens}} include labeled flower {{displays}} of annuals, chrysanthemums, perennials, and tulips, with over 40,000 bulbs blooming each spring. The rose collection includes a formal rose garden with hybrid tea, <b>floribunda</b> and grandiflora <b>roses,</b> {{as well as}} climbing roses along a perennial border walk. Botanical and shrub roses are represented throughout the site. The gardens also contain a variety of labeled trees and woody shrubs, with collections of European beech, dwarf conifers, hollies, and rhododendrons, {{as well as an}} observation tower with a fine view of Lake Glacier.|$|R

5000|$|Demetriou left South Africa for London {{with fellow}} {{musician}} John Kongos and the pair formed the psychedelic rock group <b>Floribunda</b> <b>Rose.</b> However, the band soon {{changed its name}} to Scrugg and recorded a number of singles on the Pye label with producer John Schroder and new drummer Henry Spinetti. Scrugg enjoyed limited success, with their double A-side [...] "One Way Street" [...] and [...] "Linda Loves Linda" [...] receiving significant airplay but failing to perform well in the charts. The songwriting partnership of Kongos/Demetriou proved to be more successful than the groups they were in - with two songs reaching the top five in the UK charts and another, sung by Bond girl Daliah Lavi, reaching number one in Germany and Switzerland. Some of their early work, including recordings by <b>Floribunda</b> <b>Rose</b> and Scrugg, were released on the compilation Lavender Popcorn in 2001. They also wrote the music for the British cult film A Promise of Bed directed by Derek Ford and starring John Bird, Victor Spinetti and Dennis Waterman.|$|E
5000|$|This variety was bred by the American Tom Carruth in 2004. It was {{introduced}} into the United States by Weeks Wholesale Rose Grower, Inc. In 2006, and in Australia by Swane's Nursery/Swane Bros Pty Ltd as [...] "Soul Mate" [...] in 2009 In the United Kingdom, the rose was renamed after the popular TV show Absolutely Fabulous. The stock parents of this rose are (Voodoo x R. soulieana) x (Summerwine) x Topnotch. Celebrity chef Julia Child personally chose this <b>floribunda</b> <b>rose</b> to bear her name.|$|E
