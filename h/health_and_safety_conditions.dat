However, there is few information concerning cattle husbandry unit sanitations <b>and</b> workers <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>condition.</b> The aim of this project was to investigate the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> of cattle husbandry units and their workers in Babol.. Material and Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among all the traditional and industrial cattle husbandry units (n= 52) in the rural area of Babol city during winter 2010. The data were collected from all of the active cattle husbandry units, and inactive units were omitted from the sample list. The data were gathered by means of tailor-made data collection sheet through an interview and direct inspection done by the environmental health technicians. The data analyzed using descriptive statistical indexes and Chi- square test, and p< 0. 05 was considered as significant.. Result: The findings indicated that the mean value of years of work experience was 15. 1 ± 12. 9 years and 30 % of workers were illiterate. Immunization against tetanus was 43 %. Only one fourth of the workers had <b>health</b> card <b>and</b> 36 % had periodic medical examinations. More than 55 % of the participants had not passed <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> orientation courses. Almost half of the workers experienced work related accidents and 60 % of the units had no hygienic toilets. According to Chi-square test result, there were significant statistical correlations between the level of education and years of experience by complying with some <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> rules..

50|$|In {{addition}} to the environmental consequences of extractivism, social impacts arise as well. Local communities are often opposed to extractivism occurring. This is because it often uproots the communities or cause environmental impacts that will affect their quality of life. Indigenous communities tend to be particularly susceptible to the social impacts of extractivism. While employment opportunities are brought to local communities as a pillar of neo-extractivism projects, the conditions are often unsafe for workers. TNCs {{can take advantage of}} more lenient <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>conditions</b> in developing countries and pay inadequate wages in order to maximize their profits. As well, foreigners usually fill the highest paying managerial positions, leaving local community members to do the most labour intensive jobs. Frequently, the enclaves where extractivism occurs are distanced from government involvement, therefore allowing them to avoid being subjected to the enforcement of national laws to protect citizens. This can result in widespread human rights violations. It is argued that prolonged social transformation cannot thrive on export dependent extractivism alone therefore making neo-extractivism a potentially flawed development method on its own.|$|E
