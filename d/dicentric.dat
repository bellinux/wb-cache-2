25|$|One type of non-homologous based {{mechanism}} is the non-homologous end joining or micro-homology end joining mechanism. These mechanisms are {{also involved in}} repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology. When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that retrotransposons are inserted into the genome through this repair system. If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another {{mechanism is}} the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one <b>dicentric</b> chromosome, and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the <b>dicentric</b> chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading {{to an increase in}} copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required to unclamp and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be ‘confused’ when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and {{it is unlikely that the}} polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.|$|E

40|$|PurposeTo combine {{telomere}} and centromere (TC) staining {{of premature}} chromosome condensation (PCC) fusions to identify <b>dicentrics,</b> centric rings, and acentric chromosomes, making possible {{the realization of}} a dose–response curve and automation of the process. Methods and MaterialsBlood samples from healthy donors were exposed to 60 Co irradiation at varying doses up to 8 Gy, followed by a repair period of 8 hours. Premature chromosome condensation fusions were carried out, and TC staining using peptide nucleic acid probes was performed. Chromosomal aberration (CA) scoring was carried out manually and automatically using PCC-TCScore software, developed in our laboratory. ResultsWe successfully optimized the hybridization conditions and image capture parameters, to increase the sensitivity and effectiveness of CA scoring. <b>Dicentrics,</b> centric rings, and acentric chromosomes were rapidly and accurately detected, leading to a linear-quadratic dose–response curve by manual scoring at up to 8 Gy. Using PCC-TCScore software for automatic scoring, {{we were able to}} detect 95 % of <b>dicentrics</b> and centric rings. ConclusionThe introduction of TC staining to the PCC fusion technique has made possible the rapid scoring of unstable CAs, including <b>dicentrics,</b> with a level of accuracy and ease not previously possible. This new approach can be used for biological dosimetry in radiation emergency medicine, where the rapid and accurate detection of <b>dicentrics</b> is a high priority using automated scoring.

Presence of such CA in the normal Peripheral Blood Culture (PBC) could be used to identify individuals in high-risk groups.

Hence, a primary screening of Breast Cancer (BC) patients with highly sensitive marker(s) using a less expensive methodology namely PBC, was carried out in the present study. Our earlier studies indicated that there is a high frequency of BC compared to other types of cancers in females reported in Goa Medical College (GMC).
