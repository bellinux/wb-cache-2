5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, {{and the nature of}} the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heartland</b> of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.|$|E

25|$|According to Hardy, the Muslim rulers {{were not}} {{concerned}} {{with the number of}} converts, since the stability and continuity of their regime did not depend on the number of Muslims. In general, religious conversion was a gradual process, with some converts attracted to pious Muslim saints, while others converted to Islam to gain tax relief, land grant, marriage partners, social and economic advancement, or freedom from slavery. In border regions such as the Punjab and eastern Bengal, the share of Muslims grew as large as 70% to 90% of the population, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heartland</b> of Muslim rule, the upper Gangetic Plain, the Muslims constituted only 10 to 15% of the population.|$|E
25|$|Ivo Taillebois, when {{he married}} Ranulf's future wife Lucy, had {{acquired}} her Lincolnshire lands but sometime after 1086 he acquired estates in Kendal and elsewhere in Westmorland. Adjacent lands in Westmorland and Lancashire {{that had previously been}} controlled by Earl Tostig Godwinson were probably carved up between Roger the Poitevin and Ivo in the 1080s, a territorial division at least partially responsible for the later boundary between the two counties. Norman lordship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heartland</b> of Cumberland can be dated from chronicle sources to around 1092, the year King William Rufus seized the region from its previous ruler, Dolfin. There is inconclusive evidence that settlers from Ivo's Lincolnshire lands had come into Cumberland as a result.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{lies in the}} north-central part of Belgium, about 110km (68mi) {{from the}} Belgian coast and about 180km (111mi) from the {{southern}} tip of Belgium.

Its average elevation is 57 meters (187ft) above sea level, varying from a low point in the valley of the almost completely covered Senne, which cuts the region from east to west, up to high points in the Sonian Forest, at the southeastern side. In addition to the Senne, tributary streams such as the Maalbeek and the Woluwe, to the east of the region, account for significant elevation differences. Brussels' central boulevards are 15 meters above sea level. The highest point lies at a height of about 108 meters (354ft), near Place de l'Altitude Cent/Hoogte Honderdplein, in Forest.|$|E
