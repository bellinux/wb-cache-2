25|$|In Michael Chrichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park, which {{spawned a}} series of Jurassic Park feature films, a {{bioengineering}} company develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of dinosaurs by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from fossils. The cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the eponymous Jurassic Park wildlife park for the entertainment of visitors. The scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escape their enclosures. Despite being selectively cloned as females {{to prevent them from}} breeding, the dinosaurs <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to reproduce through parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The IGMDP was {{launched}} by the Indian Government to <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to develop and design a missile locally, and manufacture a range of missile systems for the three defence services. The programme has seen significant success in its two most important constituents – the Agni missiles and the Prithvi missiles, while two other programmes, the Akash SAM and the anti-tank Nag Missile have seen significant orders. The Trishul missile, a programme to develop a tri-service short-range SAM faced persistent problems throughout its development, and was shut down in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{classified}} as an adenocarcinoma, or glandular cancer, that begins when normal semen-secreting prostate gland cells mutate into cancer cells. The region of prostate gland where the adenocarcinoma is most common is the peripheral zone. Initially, small clumps of cancer cells remain confined to otherwise normal prostate glands, a condition known as carcinoma in situ or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Although {{there is no proof}} that PIN is a cancer precursor, it is closely associated with cancer. Over time, these cancer cells begin to multiply and spread to the surrounding prostate tissue (the stroma) forming a tumor. Eventually, the tumor may grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the seminal vesicles or the rectum, or the tumor cells may <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to travel in the bloodstream and lymphatic system. Prostate cancer is considered a malignant tumor because it is a mass of cells that can invade other parts of the body. This invasion of other organs is called metastasis. Prostate cancer most commonly metastasizes to the bones, lymph nodes, and may invade rectum, bladder and lower ureters after local progression. The route of metastasis to bone is thought to be venous as the prostatic venous plexus draining the prostate connects with the vertebral veins.|$|E

500|$|Bill Bentley {{believed}} that all six boys {{could have played}} in the National Hockey League (NHL), though responsibilities on the family farm resulted in the eldest four boys spending {{the majority of their}} careers playing senior hockey on the Canadian Prairies. [...] Doug was a small, slender player, weighing only 145lbs {{at the peak of his}} career, but he was an exceptionally fast skater and his father taught him to use his speed to avoid larger opponents. He learned his trade with his brothers as they constantly played street hockey in the summers and on the ice in the winters.

He was nicknamed the [...] "Dipsy Doodle Dandy from Delisle" [...] in reference to his ability to skate around opponents who often found {{that the only way to}} stop him was via rough play. [...] Bentley was able to score from nearly any angle, an ability that confounded even his brother Doug. [...] Long-time prairie hockey promoter Bill Hunter said Bentley was [...] "a phenomenal hockey player, an absolute artist with the puck". [...] Opponents occasionally attempted to use Bentley's hypochondria against him, making remarks on how he looked ill in a bid to distract him during the game.|$|E

500|$|Tanner {{was born}} on August 8, 1904 in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of Felix Elmo Tanner and Willie Mae (nee) Moore. He grew up in Detroit, and moved to Memphis with his family by 1926. [...] As a young boy, Tanner studied the violin and was {{successful}} with it until eye trouble {{made it difficult for}} him to read notes. [...] His musical training helped Tanner to <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to scan music or lyrics quickly and then either sing or whistle what he had just read. On his walk home from work, Tanner passed a cemetery each night and started whistling as he passed by. Not everyone appreciated Tanner's whistling in the evening; he was once jailed in Albuquerque, New Mexico for whistling after 10pm. A graduate of the University of Tennessee, Tanner raced automobiles and worked as a mechanic in Memphis. While performing the duties of his employment he liked to whistle and sing. [...] One day in 1928, he had a repair job for a customer who happened to work at WMC radio. After hearing Tanner singing while working on his car, the announcer suggested Tanner audition for the radio station. His consequent on-air appearance brought a call from Paramount Records, which had offices in Chicago.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{previously}} thought that most cancer cells {{have a low}} metastatic potential {{and that there are}} rare cells that <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to metastasize through the development of somatic mutations. [...] According to this theory, diagnosis of metastatic cancers is only possible after the event of metastasis. [...] Traditional means of diagnosing cancer (e.g. a biopsy) would only investigate a subpopulation of the cancer cells and would very likely not sample from the subpopulation with metastatic potential.|$|E

[...] Statistical learning acquisition claims that infants language learning is based on pattern perception rather than an innate biological grammar. Several statistical elements such as frequency of words, frequent frames, phonotactic patterns and other regularities provide information on language structure and meaning for facilitation of language acquisition.|$|E

Diagrams and eyewitness recollections agree that Pearse placed controls for {{pitch and yaw}} at {{the trailing edge of}} the low-aspect-ratio kite-type permanently stalled wing. This control placement (located in turbulent air-flow, and close to the centre of gravity) would have had minimal, possibly inadequate, turning moment to control the pitch or yaw of the aircraft. The Wright brothers, in comparison, successfully applied the principles of airfoil wing-profile and three-axis control to produce fully controlled flight.|$|E
