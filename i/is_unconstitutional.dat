500|$|On appeal, Aguilar again {{argued that}} the AUUF statute <b>was</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> on its face.

50|$|The District Court {{decided that}} because Newsome was searched on {{suspicion}} for probable cause during an arrest for {{the violation of}} a statute subsequently found to <b>be</b> <b>unconstitutional,</b> Newsome's search <b>was</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> and the evidence should be suppressed. The District Court granted the writ of habeas corpus.|$|R
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

5|$|In January 2014, Mam Sonando {{organized}} a mass demonstration, which demanded {{the government to}} expand his radio reach and open a TV station. The Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith denied the permission for the expansion but Mam Sonando told reporters the denial <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional.</b> Protesters clashed with police on January 28, injuring at least 9 of the demonstrators. In response to the violence, Human Rights Watch calls for the United Nations to pressure the Cambodian government. Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House have also condemned the violence.|$|E
50|$|On April 19, 2012, Cardona filed a brief {{with the}} court, arguing that Title 38 and Section 3 of DOMA <b>are</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> because they violate the Tenth Amendment and the equal {{protection}} component of the Fifth Amendment. Cardona also argued that the statutes <b>are</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> bills of attainder.|$|R
50|$|Hepburn v. Griswold, 75 U.S. 603 (1870), was a US Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Chief Justice of the United States, Salmon P.

5|$|In January 2006, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, ACLU v. NSA, in {{a federal}} {{district}} court in Michigan, challenging government spying in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy. On August 17, 2006, that {{court ruled that the}} warrantless wiretapping program <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> and ordered it ended immediately. However, the order was stayed pending an appeal. The Bush administration did suspend the program while the appeal was being heard. In February 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an appeal from the ACLU to let it pursue a lawsuit against the program that began shortly after the September 11 terror attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to {{the free exercise of}} religion. The court found that it <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E
5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional.</b> Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E
25|$|Barton O'Connor and Isaacs JJ {{declined}} {{to express a}} view on whether the common rule provisions were invalid, holding that {{on the assumption that}} the common rule provisions <b>were</b> <b>unconstitutional,</b> they <b>were</b> severable from the Act. That is the Award was valid, even if the common rule aspect <b>was</b> <b>unconstitutional.</b>|$|R

5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation <b>is</b> <b>unconstitutional</b> and invalid.|$|E
