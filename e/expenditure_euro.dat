SettingPopulation-based survey in Finland. ParticipantsFinnish people aged 15 - 74 years drawn randomly from the Population Information System. The {{participants in this study}} were past-year gamblers with gambling expenditure data available (n = 3251, 1418 women and 1833 men). MeasurementsExpenditure shares, means of weekly gambling <b>expenditure</b> (WGE, <b>Euro)</b> and monthly gambling expenditure as a percentage of net income (MGE/NI, %) were calculated. The correlates used were perceived health, smoking, mental health [Mental Health Inventory (MHI) - 5], alcohol use [Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) -C], game types, gambling frequency, gambling mode and gambling severity [South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) ].

25|$|Data {{released}} by the Constitutional Courts indicated that the PS was the party with the largest budget, with almost 996,000 Euros in its war-chest, followed by the PSD, with 651,000 Euros, while the PPM was the group with the smallest budget, with only 3,000 Euros. It was anticipated that the PS would spend 261,000 Euros in its campaign; followed by the CDU, with 65,000 Euros; and the CDS-PP, with 61,000 Euros, while the PPM little more than 1,450 Euros. The Platforma de Cidadania (the alliance between the PPM and PND), with a global budget of 48,000 Euros, dedicated {{the majority of their}} cash reserves to public relation firms and market studies (where they spent 26,000 Euros). For the PSD, which received 350,633 Euros of state subsidies, the highest <b>expenditure</b> item, 180,000 <b>Euros,</b> was devoted to purchase giveaways and other offers.

40|$|Short-term fiscal {{indicators}} {{based on}} public accounts data {{are often used}} by European policy makers. These indicators represent {{one of the main}} sources of publicly available intra-annual fiscal information. Nevertheless, they are not formally included in the European multilateral fiscal surveillance process, and have received limited attention from the academic literature analysing fiscal policies and fiscal forecasting in Europe. By focusing on a broad set of indicators (some 50 fiscal revenue and <b>expenditure</b> items for <b>euro</b> area countries) and a mixed-frequency state-space econometric model, we make a case for the use of monthly cash indicators for multilateral fiscal surveillance at the European level. Their formal use in the public discussion would certainly enhance the pre-emptive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, making possible to acknowledge fiscal slippages early enough so that pressure to take corrective measures could be set on governments by EU institutions and the public at large.

40|$|Intermittent and {{continuous}} renal replacement therapies (RRTs) {{are available for}} the treatment of acute renal failure (ARF) {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Although at present there are no adequately powered survival studies, available data suggest that both methods are equal with respect to patient outcome. Therefore, cost comparison between techniques is important for selecting the modality. Expenditures were prospectively assessed as a secondary end point during a controlled, randomized trial comparing intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). The outcome of the primary end points of this trial, that is, ICU and in-hospital mortality, has been previously published. One hundred twenty-five patients from a Swiss university hospital ICU were randomized either to CVVHDF or IHD. Out of these, 42 (CVVHDF) and 34 (IHD) were available for cost analysis. Patients' characteristics, delivered dialysis dose, duration of stay in the ICU or hospital, mortality rates, and recovery of renal function were not different between the two groups. Detailed 24 -h time and material consumption protocols were available for 369 (CVVHDF) and 195 (IHD) treatment days. The mean daily duration of CVVHDF was 19. 5 +/- 3. 2 h/day, resulting in total <b>expenditures</b> of <b>Euro</b> 436 +/- 21 (21 % for human resources and 79 % for technical devices). For IHD (mean 3. 0 +/- 0. 4 h/treatment), the costs were lower (Euro 268 +/- 26), with a larger proportion for human resources (45 %). Nursing time spent for CVVHDF was 113 +/- 50 min, and 198 +/- 63 min per IHD treatment. Total costs for RRT in ICU patients with ARF were lower when treated with IHD than with CVVHDF, and have to be taken into account for the selection of the method of RRT in ARF on the ICU...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1994 {{a change}} in drug {{reimbursement}} status was implemented in Italy according to cost-effectiveness criteria. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the impact of these changes on the use of antipsychotic (AP) drugs. METHODS: Data concerning actual quantities of antipsychotic agents dispensed in Italy from 1995 to June 2003 were obtained from the Italian Ministry of Health. For each antipsychotic agent, the number of defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1, 000 inhabitants per day was calculated, as well as the annual <b>expenditure</b> in <b>Euros.</b> RESULTS: From 1995 to June 2003 prescriptions for first-generation antipsychotic agents (FGAs) progressively decreased from 2. 54 to 2. 0 DDD/ 1, 000 /day; in contrast, prescriptions for second-generation antipsychotic agents (SGAs) progressively rose up to 1. 75 DDD/ 1, 000 /day in 2003. Overall, from 1995 to 2003 antipsychotic prescriptions rose from 2. 54 to 3. 75 DDD/ 1, 000 /day. In 2003 the antipsychotic drug most frequently used was haloperidol, followed by olanzapine and risperidone. In 2003 the use of SGAs accounted for nearly 50 % of overall DDD/ 1, 000 /day of AP agents. The cost of these new drugs, however, accounted for more than 80 % of the total AP expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, the progressive increase in the utilisation of SGAs has been accompanied by a moderate decrease in the utilisation of phenothiazines and by an almost constant use of butyrophenones. The policy of reimbursing the use of SGAs only in subjects who could not tolerate FGAs eventually failed to significantly affect the pattern of antipsychotic consumption and expenditure; moreover, when this policy was eliminated at the beginning of 2001, the pattern of consumption and expenditure did not change...|$|R
40|$|In April 2007 UEFA's Executive Committee {{announced}} that the 2012 European Football Championship, {{commonly referred to as}} Euro 2012, will be hosted by Poland and Ukraine between 8 June and 1 July 2012. The UEFA's decision gave rise to expectations that the organization of such a prestigious international sports event would be a great opportunity to improve the tourist and investment attractiveness of the host regions. It was primarily expected that Euro 2012 tournament will speed up building and modernization of communication, sports and touristic infrastructures which 2 ̆ 013 in turn- will spur economic development of the Polish host regions. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} present the quantitative impact of public investments and tourist <b>expenditures</b> associated with <b>Euro</b> 2012 on the development of the four Polish host regions- Dolno 1 ̆ 5 bl 1 ̆ 05 skie, Mazowieckie, Pomorskie and Wielkopolskie. The analysis is carried out on the basis of the two main baseline scenarios: 1) Non-Euro 2012 scenario assuming that all the investment associated with the tournament would have been undertaken in any case with a 4 year delay due to the fact that most of them is financed form the EU funds which must be implemented until 2015; 2) Euro 2012 scenario assuming that the tournament has accelerated public investments up to 4 years in comparison to the non-Championship scenario. Moreover, within the Euro 2012 -scenario two sub-scenarios regarding the potential number of tourists are constructed. The analysis is conducted using the regional HERMIN models and concentrates on such macroeconomic indicators as GDP per capita, employment and investment. The research period is 2008 (beginning of investment) - 2020 in order to derive both short-term (demand) and long-term (supply) effects. The results are compared and confronted with the analogues effects for other European regions in order to formulate general conclusions on the role of such events in the regional development...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Asthma {{and chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are common chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, which impose a substantial burden on healthcare systems and society. Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABA), often administered using dry powder inhalers (DPIs), are frequently prescribed to control persistent asthma and COPD. Use of DPIs {{has been associated}} with poor inhalation technique, which can lead to increased healthcare resource use and costs. METHODS: A model was developed to estimate the healthcare resource use and costs associated with asthma and COPD management in people using commonly prescribed DPIs (budesonide + formoterol Turbuhaler((R)) or fluticasone + salmeterol Accuhaler((R))) over 1 year in Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK). The model considered direct costs (inhaler acquisition costs and scheduled and unscheduled healthcare costs), indirect costs (productive days lost), and estimated the contribution of poor inhalation technique to the burden of illness. RESULTS: The direct cost burden of managing asthma and COPD for people using budesonide + formoterol Turbuhaler((R)) or fluticasone + salmeterol Accuhaler((R)) in 2015 was estimated at euro 813 million, euro 560 million, and euro 774 million for Spain, Sweden and the UK, respectively. Poor inhalation technique comprised 2. 2 - 7. 7 % of direct costs, totalling euro 105 million across the three countries. When lost productivity costs were included, total <b>expenditure</b> increased to <b>euro</b> 1. 4 billion, euro 1. 7 billion and euro 3. 3 billion in Spain, Sweden and the UK, respectively, with euro 782 million attributable to poor inhalation technique across the three countries. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model results were most sensitive to changes in the proportion of patients prescribed ICS and LABA FDCs, and least sensitive to differences in the number of antimicrobials and oral corticosteroids prescribed. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of managing asthma and COPD using commonly prescribed DPIs is considerable. A substantial, and avoidable, contributor to this burden is poor inhalation technique. Measures that can improve inhalation technique with current DPIs, such as easier-to-use inhalers or better patient training, could offer benefits to patients and healthcare providers through improving disease outcomes and lowering costs...|$|R
40|$|The present work investigates {{epidemiological}} {{and health}} economic aspects of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, {{as well as}} the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological preventive strategies. Findings show that the marked reducation in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in Germany between 1980 and 2007 was by no means uniform but presents a complex picture, with substantial variations between men and women, different age groups, socioeconomic and regional factors. Compared to other industrialized counters, the decline in CHD mortality was smaller and delayed by many years. Increases in CHD mortality in certain population subgroups, as identified in the US and the UK, were not observed. In view of the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in German youths and their substantial increase with age, it seems possible, however, that similar developments will also be observed in Germany in the future. Present findings also highlight the major societal implications of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. For instance, expenditures of up to 0. 6 % {{of the gross domestic product}} are attributable to obesity in Europe. In Germany alone, this equals more than 10 billion <b>Euros.</b> <b>Expenditures</b> attributable to cardiovascular diseases in Germany are estimated at about 53 billion Euros, reflecting nearly one third of the health care expenditures for cardiovascular disease in the entire European Union. Regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different individual non-pharmacological primary- and secondary preventive strategies it was found, that widely recommended risk stratification tools, so called risk scores, are currently underutilized by general practitioners due to substantial factual and structural barriers. Among other barriers, the missing link between risk score results and individualised lifestyle recommendations was emphasized by physicians. There is, however, evidence for the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of such lifestyle interventions in the primary- and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, as was highlighted in two systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Despite positive trends in cardiovascular mortality and proven effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of individual non-pharmacological strategies, the present findings suggest, that on a population bases, individual strategies may not be practical and sufficiently effective. A continuation of the positive mortality trends in the future is therefore questionable. Also, a reduction in existing social inequalities through individual strategies seems unlikely. A strengthening of population based strategies is therefore warranted in addition to the more widespread dissemination of individual preventive strategies. Recently published recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence had a similar emphasize. The existing evidence suggests, that this additional strengthening of population based strategies can, to a greater extent, lead to reductions in risk factor prevalence, cardiovascular disease incidence, and social inequalities...|$|R
40|$|During the {{financial}} crisis it was observable, significant increase in budgetary <b>expenditure</b> in the <b>euro</b> area. This was associated with an increase inter alia in public investment expenditure. Fiscal authorities trying {{to stimulate the economy}} have decided to increase spending to inhibit the effects of {{the financial}} crisis such as the decline in investment, employment and overall GDP in the euro area. Also, the monetary authorities cutting interest rates to the lowest levels in history, aimed at encouraging businesses to borrow and invest. However, {{the financial crisis}} is causing too much uncertainty in the financial markets, causing aversion of entities to borrow, invest, increasing spending. Thus, the level of investment in the economy has been significantly reduced. Gross fixed capital formation of businesses fell up to about - 20 % of GDP. During the financial crisis, despite a coordinated fiscal and monetary policy in the euro zone, the economic authorities did not prevent EMU, before a significant decline in investment and economic activity. However, {{it should be noted that}} without the ECB's anti-crisis measures and the fiscal authorities the recent financial crisis could even lead to the collapse of the euro zone. The study presents the impact of monetary-fiscal policy mix on economic growth, mainly for the investments of euro area in financial crisis. Fiscal policy and monetary policy play an important role in the economy, influencing each other and on a number of economic variables as well. In the face of the recent financial crisis, which turned into a debt crisis, fiscal and monetary authorities have been working together to revive economic activity. There was a significant economic impact on the level of government investments. The central bank kept interest rates at very low levels and used nonstandard instruments of monetary policy. Fiscal authorities have increased government spending to stimulate investment and economic recovery. The paper concludes that the management of the fiscal and monetary authorities in a crisis situation has been modified compared to the period before the crisis, when the coordination of these policies was clearly weaker. Appropriate coordination of monetary and fiscal policy has a positive impact on many economic variables. The lack of cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities can lead to many adverse effects on the economy. Using graphic presentation method there were analysed presented economic variables, reflecting the strength at which the financial crisis has affected the economy in the euro zone. It also highlights the impact of the policy mix for investment and economic growth. Analyzing in this article the macroeconomic policy mix, there is emphasized that the ECB (European Central Bank) focuses too much on low inflation target and price stability. The object of the research is the extent of cooperation between monetary and fiscal authorities in the face of the financial crisis. The purpose of the research is to highlight the importance of cooperation between monetary and fiscal policies for the growth of investment and economic activity. Tasks of research: to analyze the impact of monetary and fiscal decisions on the level of economic growth in euro area; to point to the size of government expenditure and investment during the financial crisis, to present the factors which influence on the level of the investment in the economy of the Eurosystem in the financial crisis. Following methods were used in this research: review of scientific literature, statistic research methods, graphic presentation methods and others. Stebint ECB ir euro zonos fiskalinių institucijų politiką, galima daryti išvadą, kad mišrios politikos koordinavimas finansų krizės metu pasiekė aukštą lygį. Bet ar tai buvo pakankama? Ar galima būtų išvengti skolų krizės euro zonoje? ECB, Europos Komisija ir nacionalinės vyriausybės siekia skatinti investicijas ir vartojimą. ECB reikšmingai sumažino palūkanų normas ir taikė kiekybines nestandartines sušvelninimo priemones. Nepaisant to, kyla klausimas, ar rinkos likvidumo palaikymo veiksmai buvo būtini ir efektyvūs. Žinoma, pinigų politika, apimanti tik palūkanų normų kontrolę, pasirodė esanti nepakankama. Tuo tarpu mokesčių institucijos darė stimuliuojantį poveikį ekonominei veiklai euro zonoje.
