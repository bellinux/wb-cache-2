5|$|The way {{the game}} unfolded, Kippax had little {{responsibility}} with the bat. A record partnership of 451 between Bill Ponsford and Don Bradman meant that Australia was four for 574 {{by the time}} <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease. Kippax made 28 in just under an hour as Australia amassed 701runs. He scored just 8 in the second innings, but Australia were victorious by 562runs and regained the Ashes. Six days later, Kippax celebrated by making 250 against the Sussex bowling attack, his highest score in England and his first double century {{for more than five}} years. This boosted his first-class above 50 on what had been a tour of mixed fortunes.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the chief}} engineer, {{who was in the}} engine control room {{at the time of the}} accident, the vessel {{suddenly}} heeled port around 12:30 and would not righten itself. Within the next 10–15 seconds, the list increased to 4–5 degrees and, after briefly stopping at 10 degrees, Finn-Baltic capsized. At the same time, the chief officer noticed that the ship had developed a permanent list to port, realized that something was wrong and decided to head to the bridge. However, when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door of his cabin, the combination turned over and he was washed away by the water flowing through the broken cabin window.

Unitas was hurt later in the fourth quarter while trying to run the ball. On his way off the field, he received a standing ovation.

Louisville ended the season with a 20–13 loss to Eastern Kentucky. In his junior year, Unitas completed 49 of 95 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E
