5|$|Peter, Brian, Cleveland and Joe are annoyed when Quagmire {{adopts a}} stray cat named James and prefers {{to spend more}} time with him than with them. When Quagmire goes to Vermont to buy him a {{birthday}} present, they decide to shave James as a prank, but it backfires when Peter accidentally kills him. He and Brian decide to hide his body, but are pulled over by the police who, after ignoring Peter's blood stains and beer, arrest Brian when they find him in possession of cannabis. He is bailed out by the family and put on probation for drug use. He attempts to use Stewie's urine when Joe arrives to perform a drug test, only to be caught by Lois, who chastises him for going to such lengths and tells him that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> if he intends on doing so. However, Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog. He and Stewie perform an enthusiastic musical number, and soon after the entire town rallies behind them in their cause.|$|E

500|$|According to Amy Lee, [...] "Going Under" [...] {{is about}} a {{previous}} emotionally [...] and physically damaging relationship: [...] "And when you're {{at the end of}} your rope, when you're at the point where you realize something <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> that you can't go on living in the situation that you're in. It's cool. It's a very strong song." [...] "Going Under" [...] was Fallen second single. [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] is a nu metal-rap rock song written in common time and performed at a moderate tempo (96 beats per minute). Written by Lee, Ben Moody, and David Hodges, the song was conceived when an acquaintance asked Lee in a restaurant if she was happy in her current relationship. When Lee realized that she was not, the lyrics [...] "wake me up inside" [...] were inspired. The singer confirmed that the song was about longtime friend Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and it absolutely <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> We can't keep doing the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week that we feel we have to conform to. ... I want people not to know what to expect when they tune in every week. We're not formulaic." ...|$|E

Scully says that Linda has been taken home, at which an annoyed Mulder leaves to see Modell in the {{hospital}}. A nurse enters the hospital room and tells Mulder that she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the patient's bandages. When Mulder leaves, it is revealed that the nurse is actually Linda Bowman wearing a paper with [...] "Nurse" [...] written on it. Linda then talks Modell's heart into stopping. A nurse runs past Mulder and he follows her into Modell's room, where Modell is pronounced dead. Mulder notices the [...] "Nurse" [...] paper has [...] "214 Channel Avenue" [...] on the back. That night, Mulder visits the address and finds Scully, pointing a gun at him and claiming to be controlled by Linda; she kills herself. Mulder hears footsteps behind him and turns around to see Linda Bowman pointing a gun at him; [...] "Linda" [...] states personal information about Mulder, revealing herself to indeed be Scully despite what Mulder sees. She fires a shot at a figure moving behind Mulder, and he then sees Scully in front of him, and a wounded Linda behind him. In Skinner's office, Linda Bowman's brain scan shows an advanced temporal lobe tumor, just like her fraternal twin, Robert Modell; the two had been separated at birth. Mulder has misgivings about nearly killing Scully and feels that he ultimately lost Linda's game.|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E
