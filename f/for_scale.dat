This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{also helps}} reduce income {{inequality}} measured after taxes, due to higher {{taxes on the}} top 5% of income earners and both subsidies and Medicaid expansion for lower-income persons. CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. <b>For</b> <b>scale,</b> the subsidy for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those health insurance premiums paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market. The employer market subsidy was not changed by the law.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. <b>For</b> <b>scale,</b> during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} the physical size and global three-dimensional (3 -D) {{shape of an}} object, retinal size and retinal disparity have to be scaled {{in accordance with the}} object's distance. We examined whether the distance used <b>for</b> <b>scaling</b> retinal disparity {{is the same as the}} distance used <b>for</b> <b>scaling</b> retinal size. Subjects adjusted the 3 -D shape (size and depth) of a computer-simulated ellipsoid to match a tennis ball. Analysis of the errors when only the ellipsoid was visible in an otherwise completely dark room suggests that the distance used <b>for</b> <b>scaling</b> retinal disparity is indeed the same as that used <b>for</b> <b>scaling</b> retinal size. This was confirmed by showing that the correspondence between the distance used <b>for</b> <b>scaling</b> retinal disparity and that used <b>for</b> <b>scaling</b> retinal size does not improve when more information about distance is available (room lights on), although both distances are then much closer to the simulated distance. Finally, we show that this correspondence is not due to the use of distance-invariant higher order binocular information. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|In 2013, CBO {{estimated}} {{that more than}} half of the combined benefits of 10 major tax expenditures would apply to households in the top 20% income group, and that 17% of the benefit would go to the top 1% households.

25|$|Summing {{over all}} {{possible}} oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. Since only differences in energy are physically measurable (with {{the notable exception}} of gravitation, which remains {{beyond the scope of}} quantum field theory), this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of renormalization. Dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists before the development in the 1970s of the renormalization group, a mathematical formalism <b>for</b> <b>scale</b> transformations that provides a natural basis for the process.|$|E

25|$|The ACA also {{provided}} subsidies to help lower-income families afford insurance.

25|$|Administrative costs. About 25% of U.S. {{healthcare}} costs relate to administrative costs (e.g., billing and payment, {{as opposed to}} direct provision of services, supplies and medicine) versus 10-15% in other countries. For example, Duke University Hospital had 900 hospital beds but 1,300 billing clerks. Assuming $3.2 trillion is spent on healthcare per year, a 10% savings would be $320 billion per year and a 15% savings would be nearly $500 billion per year. <b>For</b> <b>scale,</b> cutting administrative costs to peer country levels would represent roughly one-third to half the gap. A 2009 study from Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated $210 billion in savings from unnecessary billing and administrative costs, a figure that would be considerably higher in 2015 dollars.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, on December 7, Webb engaged two hobbyists, Edgar Van Horn and Ernest Howatt, to {{photograph}} the carcass for posterity.

25|$|The sooner {{austerity}} {{steps are}} taken (e.g., raising revenues or reducing spending {{or a combination}} of both), the smaller those changes can be to maintain or reduce the debt level projected in 2039. For example, under the baseline scenario, stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP at 74% (its current level) would require non-interest spending cuts and/or tax hikes of 1.2% of GDP annually if implemented in 2015, or 1.5% of GDP annually if begun in 2020. To bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its 40-year average of 39%, the austerity measures required would be 2.6% GDP if begun in 2015 and 3.2% GDP if begun in 2020. Over the 1974 to 2013 period, federal spending averaged 20.5% GDP and revenue 17.4% GDP. <b>For</b> <b>scale,</b> a 2% GDP reduction in spending would be approximately a 10% spending cut.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%). U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than other OECD countries, at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP {{for the next}} most expensive country (Switzerland). <b>For</b> <b>scale,</b> a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare. Healthcare costs are a fundamental driver of health insurance costs, which leads to coverage affordability challenges for millions of families. There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a vertical cylindrical drum, heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most active region for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual pipe unions through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual scaling hammer. This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus <b>for</b> <b>scale</b> or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by thermal shock, by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid heating coils flexed continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the design, thanks {{in no small part}} to the passionate enthusiasm of Mignet himself, the original HM.14 revealed design flaws that could lead to an unrecoverable and often fatal dive under certain conditions; when the front wing was put in a high attack angle for climbing, the high-speed flow of air deflected by the front wing went to the rear wing upper surface, greatly increasing the rear wing's lift, and putting the nose down, the instinctive reaction of pilot being pulling even more the stick, this worsened the situation, as the way to go out of this 'vicious circle' was reducing the front wing incidence, as to command a nose down descent. Also some homebuilders attempted to simplify construction by modifying components such as the wings tips curving up, resulting in extremely dangerous airplanes and deadly accidents that forced the air authorities to ban building more of them. Studies in the UK and France revealed the problem (the HM.14 was small enough to fit in wind tunnels in both countries usually used <b>for</b> <b>scale</b> models of larger aircraft) and corrections were made to the design. Unfortunately, the wave of bad publicity created by the crashes dogged Mignet {{for the rest of his}} life and continues to be associated with the design today despite the fact that the basic Mignet configuration has proven to be safe in hundreds of successful homebuilt aircraft and factory built microlights.|$|E
