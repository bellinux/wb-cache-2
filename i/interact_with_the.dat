5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the protagonist Jill Valentine from a third-person perspective to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> environment and enemies. Aside from Jill, the player takes control of another character {{for a brief}} portion of the game. To advance through the game, the player has to explore a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating various types of enemies. The player can <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected {{and put in the}} player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to a storage box located in special rooms to manage space.|$|E

The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees.|$|E

This allowed him to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dancers and musicians much more freely, and as such the set included 3-story high mobile scaffolding, onto which Bowie and his dancers would occasionally climb during the show.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E
5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E

The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E

At save points, the player may opt {{to take one of}} the available side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E
