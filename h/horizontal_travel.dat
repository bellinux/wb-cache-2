50|$|A man-aboard {{system can}} provide {{significant}} floorspace savings over manual or fork lift operations {{but is not}} truly an AS/RS, as the operation is still manual. Storage system heights are not limited by the reach height of the order picker, as the picker rides along on the platform as it is moved vertically or horizontally to the various storage locations. Shelves or storage cabinets can be stacked as high as floor loading, weight capacity, throughput requirements, and/or ceiling heights will permit. Man-aboard storage and retrieval systems are {{far and away the}} most expensive picker-to-stock equipment alternative, but are less expensive than a fully automated system. Aisle-captive storage/retrieval machines reaching heights up to 40 feet cost around $125,000. Hence, there must be enough storage density and/or productivity improvement over cart and tote picking to justify the investment. Also, because vertical travel is slow compared to <b>horizontal</b> <b>travel,</b> typical picking rates in man-aboard operations range between 40 and 250 lines per person-hour. The range is large because there is a wide variety of operating schemes for man-aboard systems. Man-aboard systems are typically appropriate for slow-moving items where space is fairly expensive.|$|E
50|$|The M5 {{departed}} from the traditional silhouette of the Leica rangefinders, that had few changes since the M3 (1954). The height and width of the body were larger (H 84 mm x W 150 mm x D 36 mm), and the body heavier (ca. 100 g more than other M cameras). The folding film rewinding crank hides in the bottom plate. The self-timer arm and the field-of-view preselector (now on the M5 additionally with battery test function) are of the same design as the Leica M4 (1967). The M5 was the last M to feature a mechanical self-timer (duration 5-10 seconds). The M5 incorporates an improved rapid film loading spool design over the M4. The M5 has a rapid transport lever which winds the shutter and advances the film and the frame counter in one single motion, or {{in a series of}} shorter motions.

40|$|Violent crimes often {{result in}} blood-shed events {{associated}} with blood spatter. Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) {{serves as a}} good tool and effective approach to reconstruct the events that occur in a crime scene. Among other bloodstain patterns, impact spatter patterns are commonly found at crime scenes. An impact pattern {{is formed as a}} result of an impact force striking an exposed blood source and can be described as a radiating pattern of small individual drops. In most cases of BPA, the reconstruction of the events taken place involve investigating the blood drop flight dynamics and the mechanics of impact spatter generation to determine the origin of the impact. Thus, the discipline of Fluid Dynamics (FD) is also involved in most BPA cases. However, in the cases of multiple impact spatter generation events within a crime scene, it complicates the interpretation and analysis of the impact spatter pattern. There are many variables of blood drop flight dynamics and mechanisms of impact spatter generation in which a blood drop is exposed to and generated from. The variables of blood drop flight dynamics such as drop deformations/oscillations, breakup, diameter with respect to velocity and air/wind currents do affect a drop while in flight which may alter the trajectory curvature of a blood drop. However, it is relatively unknown in scientific literature how the variables of impact spatter generation setup such as the height of the blood source and impact force applied would affect the <b>horizontal</b> distance <b>travelled</b> by a blood drop generated from an impact spatter. Theoretically, there is also limited literature with regards to the correlation of blood drop flight dynamics to maximum <b>horizontal</b> distance <b>travelled</b> by blood drop.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 This thesis investigates {{a simple}} dynamic {{model of the}} hind leg of a beetle during {{initiation}} of a step. The primary assumption was that the full load of the body was carried on the hind leg during this time. That is, the only forces on the body were that of the hind leg and gravity and their resultant produced forward acceleration. Only two dimensional models were used in this study. This was justified since the beetle is bilaterally symmetrical. However, it required the assumption that hind legs were positioned symmetrically and it limited the investigation to forward acceleration in a straight line. Models with two and three links were tested. The two link model assumed the body has no motion relative to the upper legs; that is the muscles were strong enough to prevent movement at the joint between body and leg. The three link model assumed only friction prevented movement at the joint between body and leg. Dynamic equations were developed using Lagrangian mechanics. These equations were integrated using the 4 th order Runge-Kutta algorithm. Both models were driven by applying a constant torque at the joint between upper and lower segments. Driving torque was adjusted to minimize verical movement of body center of mass. Initial position of body center of mass relative to foot was varied to examine it's influence on both <b>horizontal</b> <b>travel</b> of body, center of mass and driving torque required for this travel. For both models <b>horizontal</b> <b>travel</b> was less dependent on initial height of body center-of-mass than on initial horizontal position. For both models required driving torque increased with decrease in initial height of body center-of-mass and with increase of initial horizontal distance from foot to body center-of-mass. For both models maximum <b>horizontal</b> <b>travel</b> was attained with minimum initial height of body center-of-mass and minimum initial horizontal distance between foot and body center-of-mass.

40|$|The {{design of}} an order picking {{system in a}} {{distribution}} center depends on several decisions, where a key decision is determining the optimal storage system configuration (the number, length, and height of the storage aisles).

In this paper we extend prior research that considers <b>horizontal</b> <b>travel</b> for a given number and length of the storage aisles so that we are also able to consider {{the height of the}} aisles as well. Such a model will provide a more accurate estimate of the throughput of an order picker and it will also permit an examination of the tradeoff between the length and height of the aisles. The analytical model we develop to estimate throughput is based on probability models and order statistics results assuming random storage. It is intended for person-onboard order picking systems and we consider both Tchebychev and rectilinear travel. We illustrate the use of our travel-time model by incorporating it into a simple, cost-based optimization model to recommend the height of a one-pallet-deep storage system.

This paper {{reports on the}} use of a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database, compiled primarily from existing digital maps and aerial photographs, to describe the physical characteristics of landslides and the statistical relations of landslide frequency with the physical parameters contributing to the initiation of landslides on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>travel</b> length and the angle of reach, defined as the angle of the line connecting the head of the landslide source to the distal margin of the displaced mass, are used to describe runout behavior of landslide mass. For all landslides studied, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>travel</b> length of landslide mass ranges from 5 to 785 in, with a mean value of 43 in, and the average angle of reach is 27. 7 degrees. This GIS database is then used to obtain a logistic multiple regression model for predicting slope instability. It is indicated that slope gradient, lithology, elevation, slope aspect, and land-use are statistically significant in predicting slope instability, while slope morphology and proximity to drainage lines are not important and thus excluded from the model. This model is then imported back into the GIS to produce a map of predicted slope instability. The results of this study demonstrate that slope instability can be effectively modeled by using GIS technology and logistic multiple regression analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the numerical modelling of discharges where density differences {{play an important}} role, in particular positive buoyant cooling water discharges. Two regions, in which the hydrodynamics {{are influenced by the}} discharge, can be distinguished; the near-field and the far-field. In the former region the initial jet characteristics of momentum flux, buoyancy flux and outfall geometry influence the jet trajectory and mixing. In the far-field the discharge characteristics become less important and ambient conditions will control trajectory and dilution through buoyant spreading and diffusion due to ambient turbulence. Density differences between the discharged and the ambient water are even smaller than in case of salt and fresh-water problems when cooling water problems are considered. Gravitational forces are therefore less dominant and turbulence {{plays an important role in}} heat transport. Laboratory experiments are used to verify the results from the 3 -D shallow water model TRISULA, which computes the far-field hydrodynamics and mass transport. The turbulence model used, a common isotropic k-e model which takes stratification into account, seems not appropriate to simulate the (low Reynolds number) laboratory experiments. Vertical mixing is overestimated and the front lags behind and is very steep. The consequences of assuming hydrostatic pressure for the front shape are investigated, by developing a 2 -DV model in which a non-hydrostatic pressure correction term, is incorporated. A significant improvement is gained as far as the shape of the front and the flow pattern is concerned. This is especially true for thermals.
