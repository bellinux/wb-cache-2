40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the main metabolic parameters of 11 -β-hydroxy-androstenedione (11 OHAD) in man. Seven normal subjects were investigated at 1 - 3 months interval by 2 types of isotope dilution techniques using a tritiated tracer: constant infusion and bolus iv injection. 3 H- 11 OHAD and 3 H- 11 -β-hydroxy-androsterone (3 H- 11 OA) were isolated by gel column chromatography, unlabeled 11 OHAD was determined by RIA, unlabelled 11 OA by GLC. The results included computation of free and conjugated catabolite fractions. 3 H- 11 OHAD MCR determined from the infusion or the injection data averaged ca 1250 ml/min or 1800 L/d(CV:± 10 %) providing a mean estimation of unlabelled 11 OHAD BPR of 1. 5 ± 0. 15 mg/d. UPR estimations gave similar values. 3 H- 11 OHAD fractional catabolic rate drawn from the postinfusion or the <b>injection</b> <b>curve</b> averaged ca 1. 4 % per min (CV:± 7 %). Mean total distribution volume ranged between 90 and 120 L according to the type of experiment. Extrapolation to time zero of the <b>injection</b> <b>curve</b> (2 exponentials) provided an estimation of 32 ± 5 L for rapid exchange compartment. Urinary recovery of labelled compounds was complete within 24 h whereas the excretion of undegraded 3 H- 11 OHAD was undetectable; urinary clearance rate of 3 H-conjugates approached that of creatinine. The present data show that: the secretion rate of 11 OHAD is equivalent to that of its direct precursor, adrenal androstenedione; its large MCR value results from the size of its exchange volume-equivalents. Comparison between 3 H- 11 OHAD and 3 H-conjugates disappearance curves reveals that the rate limiting factor of the irreversible 3 H loss is the renal excretion of the conjugates and not the processess of ring A reduction and of conjugation of the hormone itself.

Here, the multifractal formalism {{was employed to}} describe both mercury injection porosimetry (MIP) and nitrogen adsorpti on isotherms (NAI) curves, measured in a Mollisol and in a Verti sol. Four different soil use intensifies and three replicate samples per treatment were analyzed. Mercury injection and nitrogen adsorption were used to measure PSDs for equivalent pore radii 150 to 0. 005 μm and 0. 1 to 0. 001 μm, respectively. The scaling properties of all the Hg <b>injection</b> <b>curves</b> and N 2 adsorption isotherms could be fitted reasonably well with multifractal models. A generalized dimension spectrum, Dq, led to a better definition of multifractal scaling than a singularity spectrum, f(α). Parameters derived from these two functions showed highly significant differences between MIP and NAI in both soil types. Thus, mean values of entropy dimension, D 1 and correlation dimension, D 2, were significantly higher for mercury injection than for nitrogen adsorption. On the contrary, Hölder exponents of order zero, α 0, were on average significantly higher for nitrogen adsorption. Also, mean widths of the f(α) spectra were much larger for nitrogen adsorption. These results indicate heterogeneity due {{to the presence of}} different porous domains at the scale of primary soil aggregates.

30|$|Research on the Gangxi III {{area in the}} Dagang Oilfield {{shows that}} {{there was still a}} {{significant}} amount of oil remaining in oil reservoirs after many years of polymer flooding. This is a potential target for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Surfactant–polymer (SP) flooding is an effective chemical EOR method for mobilizing residual oil and improving displacement efficiency macroscopically, but the microscopic oil displacement efficiency in pores of different sizes is unclear. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an efficient method for quantifying oil saturation in the rock matrix and analyzing pore structures. In this paper, the threshold values of different pore sizes were established from the relationship between mercury <b>injection</b> <b>curves</b> and NMR T 2 spectrums. The distribution and migration of residual oil in different flooding processes was evaluated by quantitatively analyzing the change of the relaxation time. The oil displaced from pores of different sizes after the water flood, polymer flood, and the SP flood was calculated, respectively. Experimental results indicate that (1) the residual oil in medium pores contributed the most to the incremental oil recovery for the SP flood, ranging from 40  % to 49  %, and small pores usually contributed < 30  %; (2) the residual oil after the SP flood was mainly distributed in small and medium pores; the residual oil in medium pores accounted for 47.3  %– 54.7  %, while that trapped in small pores was 25.7  %– 42.5  %. The residual oil in small and medium pores was the main target for EOR after the SP flood in oilfields.|$|R

The optimized omega combustion chamber geometry was used in the diesel engine model instead of baseline cylindrical geometry and the results were verified for this improved combustion chamber geometry. Results for different injection modes indicate that using the ramp <b>injection</b> rate <b>curve,</b> the spray-wall impinging is increased due to higher injection rate at the end of injection duration. Also the increased in-cylinder temperature, piston surface temperature and higher turbulence intensity leads to enhanced wall-film evaporation. Soot mass fraction also decreases due to improved air-fuel mixing and evaporation of wall-film by reduction of the fuel rich zones especially in the impingement regions. Results for different injection modes indicate that using the ramp injection rate shape slightly retards the combustion process and improves combustion characteristics while maintaining lower NOx and considerably lower soot emissions compared to the boot and rectangle injection modes. Also, in this injection mode, because of the high pressure injection, higher spray droplet velocities (higher Weber number) and increased wall spray height than the other modes, it could be said that the dominant impingement regime may be the splashing regime.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel model to produce ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) in gamma-ray burst jets. After the prompt gamma-ray emission, hydrodynamical {{turbulence}} is excited in the GRB jets at or before the afterglow phase. The mildly relativistic turbulence stochastically accelerates protons. The acceleration rate is much {{slower than the}} usual first-order shock acceleration rate, {{but in this case}} it can be energy-independent. The resultant UHECR spectrum is so hard that the bulk energy is concentrated in the highest energy range, resulting in a moderate requirement for the typical cosmic ray luminosity of ∼ 10 ^ 53. 5 erg s^- 1. In this model, the secondary gamma-ray and neutrino emissions initiated by photopion production are significantly suppressed. Although the UHECR spectrum at <b>injection</b> shows a <b>curved</b> feature, this does not conflict with the observed UHECR spectral shape. The cosmogenic neutrino spectrum in the 10 ^ 17 [...] 10 ^ 18 eV range becomes distinctively hard in this model, which may be verified by future observations.
