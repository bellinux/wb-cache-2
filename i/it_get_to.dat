2500|$|MacCorkindale's film debut came in 1974 with Juggernaut. He {{was cast}} as Simon Doyle in the 1978 film {{adaptation}} of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile {{at the age}} of 25. He became a friend of co-star Bette Davis, reflecting, [...] "There was a feeling of being in awe of these people but I had a certain amount of pioneer courage, so I didn't let <b>it</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> me. But there were days when I thought, 'I'm about to do a scene with this cinema legend, am I up to it?' But people were very gracious. I was never the whipping boy because I was less experienced." [...] The role boosted MacCorkindale public profile and he considered it to be his career break. He won the London Evening Standard Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer for this part. MacCorkindale went on to star as sailor and spy Arthur Davies in The Riddle of the Sands (1979), the film adaptation of the celebrated Erskine Childers' novel.|$|E

6000|$|Or {{turning now to}} the Government of men. Witenagemote, old Parliament, was a great thing. The {{affairs of}} the nation were there deliberated and decided; what we were {{to do as a}} nation. But does not, though the name Parliament subsists, the {{parliamentary}} debate go on now, everywhere and at all times, in a far more comprehensive way, out of Parliament altogether? Burke said there were Three Estates in Parliament; but, in the Reporters' Gallery yonder, there sat a Fourth Estate more important far than they all. It is not a figure of speech, or a witty saying; it is a literal fact,--very momentous to us in these times. Literature is our Parliament too. Printing, which comes necessarily out of Writing, I say often, is equivalent to Democracy: invent Writing, Democracy is inevitable. Writing brings Printing; brings universal everyday extempore Printing, as we see at present. Whoever can speak, speaking now to the whole nation, becomes a power, a branch of government, with inalienable weight in law-making, in all acts of authority. It matters not what rank he has, what revenues or garnitures. the requisite thing is, that he have a tongue which others will listen to; this and nothing more is requisite. The nation is governed by all that has tongue in the nation: Democracy is virtually there. Add only, that whatsoever power exists will have itself, by and by, organized; working secretly under bandages, obscurations, obstructions, it will never rest till <b>it</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> work free, unencumbered, visible to all. Democracy virtually extant will insist on becoming palpably extant.-- ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{thing is}} undeniable, {{and must be}} {{continually}} repeated till <b>it</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> be understood again: Of all constitutions, forms of government, and political methods among men, the question to be asked is even this, What kind of man do you set over us? All questions are answered in the answer to this. Another thing is worth attending to: No people or populace, with never such ballot-boxes, can select such man for you; only the man of worth can recognize worth in men;--to the commonplace man of no or of little worth, you, unless you wish to be misled, need not apply on such an occasion. Those poor Tenpound Franchisers of yours, they are not even in earnest; the poor sniffing sniggering Honorable Gentlemen they send to Parliament are as little so. Tenpound Franchisers full of mere beer and balderdash; Honorable Gentlemen come to Parliament as to an Almack's series of evening parties, or big cockmain (battle of all the cocks) very amusing to witness and bet upon: what can or could men in that predicament ever do for you? Nay, {{if they were in}} life-and-death earnest, what could it avail you in such a case? I tell you, a million blockheads looking authoritatively into one man of what you call genius, or noble sense, will make nothing but nonsense out of him and his qualities, and his virtues and defects, if they look till the end of time. He understands them, sees what they are; but that they should understand him, and see with rounded outline what his limits are,--this, which would mean that they are bigger than he, is forever denied them. Their one good understanding of him is that they at last should loyally say, [...] "We do not quite understand thee; we perceive thee to be nobler and wiser and bigger than we, and will loyally follow thee." ...|$|E
