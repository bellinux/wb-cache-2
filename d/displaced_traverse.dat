50|$|Usually, the {{horizontal}} slits were level, which created a cross shape, but less common {{was to have}} the slits off-set (called <b>displaced</b> <b>traverse</b> slots) as demonstrated in the remains of White Castle in Wales. This has been characterised as an advance in design as it provided attackers with a smaller target; however, it has also been suggested that it was to allow the defenders of White Castle to keep attackers in their sights for longer because of the steep moat surrounding the castle.|$|E
40|$|The {{wave-particle duality}} of light plays a {{fundamental}} role in introductory courses on quantum mechanics. Traditionally the wave and particle aspects of light are demonstrated in separate experiments {{which makes it}} difficult for students to understand their complementary nature. We present an experiment using a single apparatus that demonstrates the wave aspect, the particle aspect, and most importantly, their coexistence. The apparatus is based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in which a light beam is attenuated so that at each instant there is only a single photon in the interferometer. In this way the observation of single photon interference becomes possible. By integrating the single photon events in a storage oscilloscope the evolution toward classical interference fringes can be shown in real time. A second strong laser beam, derived from the same pointer, but slightly <b>displaced,</b> <b>traverses</b> the interferometer at the same time, allowing the simultaneous demonstration of wave aspects. Special features of the setup are low cost, simplicity, didactical power and suitability for presentations in large lecture halls using both multimedia projections and audible signals...|$|R
50|$|Protons, {{which are}} {{approximately}} 1800 times more massive than electrons, have deeper penetration in materials and travel {{in an almost}} straight path. This feature allows the fabrication of three-dimensional, high aspect ratio structures with vertical, smooth sidewalls and low line-edge roughness. Calculations have also indicated that p-beam writing exhibits minimal proximity effects (unwanted exposure due to secondary electrons), since the secondary electrons induced in proton/electron collisions have low energy. A further advantage stems from the ability of protons to <b>displace</b> atoms while <b>traversing</b> material, thereby increasing localized damage especially {{at the end of}} range. P-beam writing produces resistive patterns at depth in silicon, allowing patterning of selective regions with different optical properties as well as the removal of undamaged regions via electrochemical etching.|$|R
