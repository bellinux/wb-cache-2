This paper studies the complicated effects of environment and sliding on the dynamic resistance of the contacts materials of Pd-Ni plated.

The surface morphology of specimens after <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>test</b> is observed by stereoscopic microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM).

The module types [a-Si, tandem a-Si/a-Si micro-morph a-Si/µ-Si, triple junction a-Si, CIS (x 2) and CdTe] were selected to cover a range of thin-film devices, materials and construction types. Sequential <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> tests for cumulative exposure times of 250, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 h have been achieved to date, with the modules subjected to visual inspection, electrical insulation measurements and electrical performance measurements (IV curves). A wide range of performance losses (Pmax), from practically zero to - 88 %, were evident for the different technologies. The <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> tests with applied voltage provoked very fast (< 500 h) degradation of some modules, with the critical factor being the use of glass in the module construction rather than the semi-conductor type of thin-film technology.

40|$|Aluminum {{doped zinc}} oxide (ZnO:Al) {{is widely used}} as {{transparent}} conductor for opto-electronic devices such as photovoltaic (PV) modules. It is used as front contact {{or as part of}} the back contact in thin-film PV technology [1]. Solar modules and in particular the contact material must withstand long-term out-door operation. The estimation of out-door stability comprises the exposure of solar modules to a humid environment at elevated temperature (<b>damp</b> <b>heat).</b> During normal operation, the devices are encapsulated to minimize detrimental effects of the environment. Nevertheless, the stability of the non-encapsulated device is considered an important life-time limiting parameter. ZnO:Al conductivity usually degrades under <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> exposure. However, the degradation mechanism is still not understood in detail and the actual effect was suggested {{to be related to the}} combination of humidity and other atmospheric species such as CO 2 [2, 3]. This contribution reports on the electrical properties of ZnO:Al thin films on glass after <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> treatments under various atmospheric conditions. The ZnO:Al films were prepared by in-line magnetron sputtering. One set of ZnO:Al films was annealed under a protective silicon layer, because those ZnO:Al films have been reported to be stable in <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> treatments after the cap had been removed [4]. The <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> treatments took place in humid air, or mixtures of hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide (CO 2). 500 ml glass vessels were filled with a few milliliters of water and flushed with the respective gas mixture. The amount of water in the glass vessels was chosen to exceed the requirements for water vapor pressure at the given temperature or to represent about 300 mbar of water vapor pressure. The glass vessels were placed in an oven at about 90 °C. Electrical properties of ZnO:Al films before and after the treatments were investigated by Hall effect measurements. Figure 1 shows the electron mobility of ZnO:Al films after <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> treatment in various atmospheres. Dry heat did not deteriorate the electronic properties irrespective of whether CO 2, air, nitrogen, or fully inert argon were present during the treatment. Humidity, however, led to a significant degradation of resistivity by a factor of 1. 5 to 10 depending on ZnO:Al preparation conditions and the atmospheric composition. Higher levels of humidity induced stronger degradation, while the type of gas in the humid atmosphere did not play a major role. In particular, air, forming gas (5 % H 2 in N 2), 20 % CO 2 in Argon, and pure Argon led to the same charge carrier mobility of 26 cm²/Vs after 1000 h <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> treatment. Contrary, in humid CO 2 (no Argon dilution) severe corrosion of ZnO:Al films caused a milky appearance and a resistance increase by orders of magnitude after 1000 hours. The only exception from degradation exhibited the <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> stable ZnO:Al that was annealed under the protective layer. The protective layer and the top 30 nm of the ZnO:Al had been removed by plasma etching and/or wet-chemical etching, respectively, before <b>damp</b> <b>heat.</b> The electrical properties did not degrade at all and an electron mobility of 70 cm²/Vs even after 1000 h of <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> treatment in various conditions was prevailed (see Fig. 2). In conclusion, <b>damp</b> <b>heat</b> degradation of ZnO:Al is related to incorporation of water vapor and formation of zinc hydroxide only and commonly without major impact of other environmental species like CO 2. If a certain amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere is exceeded, the low pH value of the water caused corrosion of the ZnO:Al via chemical etching. Finally, the ZnO:Al stability of annealed films was excluded to be caused by a surface modification during the annealing but it represents a real bulk effect. [1]	K. L. Chopra, P. D. Paulson, V.

40|$|The fatigue {{experimental}} investigation, {{detailed in}} this paper, involved: - tensile-tensile <b>cyclic</b> <b>tests</b> for different stress {{levels in the}} longitudinal direction, {{in order to obtain}} a fatigue life curve of the material; - tensile-tensile <b>cyclic</b> <b>tests</b> of 3 D braided carbon composites with different Vf to evaluate the effect of the fiber volume fraction (Vf) on the fatigue life; - micro-CT observations of the material after different number of cycles to capture the evolution of the damage imparted during the cyclic lading...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen C- 130 {{airplane}} center wings {{which had}} experienced from approximately 4, 000 to 13, 000 {{hours of flight}} service and its associated fatigue damage were tested to destruction, seven in upbending and seven in downbending. Six wings were tested directly for static residual strength in the fatigue-damaged condition as received from field service. The other eight wings were tested in crack propagation <b>cyclic</b> <b>testing</b> at a prescribed stress level for a maximum of 10, 000 cycles. Then the stress level was reduced and testing was continued up {{to a maximum of}} 20, 000 total cycles. <b>Cyclic</b> <b>testing</b> was performed with constant-amplitude stresses at a stress ratio of + 0. 1. Maximum cyclic skin stresses were approximately 18, 000 psi. At the conclusion of <b>cyclic</b> <b>testing,</b> a static test to destruction was conducted to determine the residual strength of each fatigue-damaged specimen...|$|R
50|$|Limewash was {{normally}} {{applied to}} magazines' exterior walls. Care {{was taken to}} minimise and isolate the explosives from <b>damp,</b> <b>heat</b> and grit. The magazine structures incorporated insulated walls and were designed to create a naturally and reasonably cooled and ventilated environment. Their ventilation shafts were covered by metal ventilation louvers, coupled with spark arrestors and dust deflectors.|$|R
