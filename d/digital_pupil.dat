40|$|This paper {{builds on}} the {{outcomes}} of the Cornerstone Maths pilot study, a USA/UK collaboration, which {{is now in a}} phase of scaling to over 100 schools. We describe the vision for the project and its iterative design, both informed by a twenty-year history of research on dynamic digital technologies. The resulting intervention builds on our understanding of some of the constraints to the widespread use of dynamic <b>digital</b> technologies by <b>pupils</b> in mathematics, which relate to accessibility, teacher development, curriculum alignment and the need to support the instrumentation process for teachers. The accompanying research agenda is concerned with evaluating models for scaling that are mindful of the ‘grain size’ of analysis and the necessary re-alignment of the design principles of the innovation to take account of implementation imperatives...|$|R
40|$|In the diploma we use {{a modern}} method of digital {{storytelling}} in the classroom. Through our research we try {{to determine whether a}} digital storytelling could be an appropriate tool for achieving learning goals for a compulsory elective course Computer Science, whether it encourages active learning and whether it makes computer topics more attractive to pupils. We are aiming to determine whether this method helps to develop and to deepen transversal key competences like creative thinking, cooperative learning and digital competence. The method was empirically examined on pupils of the last three year cycle of the chosen primary school. The <b>pupils</b> created <b>digital</b> stories on a subject “pioneers in computer science” alone or in pairs. For editing their multimedia materials and creating digital stories they used the program Movie Maker. The teacher together with pupils has set criteria for assessment of the digital stories. It was important to incorporate elements of <b>digital</b> storytelling. <b>Pupils</b> created their own stories by using story-boards taking into account the characteristics of text stories. With the aim to create a rhythm and increase the efficiency of storytelling the students include carefully selected music into their stories. The pupils’ digital stories were evaluated at the end. Pupils’ attitudes towards the use of digital storytelling in the classroom were assessed by analyzing the result of observations during the study and the questionnaire fulfilled by pupils at the end of research...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a number}} of years we have been {{investigating}} ways in which e-communication can contribute to children's writing development and how new technology re-frames our understandings of writing in the classroom (Merchant, 2003; Burnett et al, 2004; Burnett et al, 2005; Merchant, 2005). Here we analyse the <b>digital</b> writing of <b>pupils</b> from two linked primary school classes (Year 3 – 5) in the North of England. Part of the project involved the pupils in communicating about themselves and their interests to email partners of the same age. In this article, we track children's identity performance in informal message exchange and show how this contributed to a final knowledge product. We explore how work that had its origins in representing children's lives and identities reflected their position in wider cultural worlds. This perspective causes us to question whether there are there sufficient opportunities for pupils to explore and express ‘who they are’ in the current content-driven curriculum where public genres are central and personal voice is peripheral...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this study, {{the main}} purpose is to review the teachers' {{statements}} regarding {{the link between the}} method WTR (Writing to Read) and inclusion of pupils with special needs. The research questions regarding this review are: - What factors in the WTR method do the teachers experience can affect the inclusion of children with special needs in a positive way? And - What factors in WTR method work do the teachers experience can affect the inclusion of children with special needs in a negative way? Five teachers from three different schools were interviewed. The following eight factors appeared positive for the inclusion of pupils with special needs: teachers’ expectations, social interaction, context close to the <b>pupils,</b> <b>digital</b> literacy, inclusion in the long term, working without the pen, to have success, and the teacher's time. The study also shows four factors that negatively affect the inclusion of pupils with special needs: to be slowed down by classmates, unstructured lessons, writing without a pencil, and technology malfunctions. In conclusion, all the teachers in the study felt that the method works for pupils with special needs, and can be called an inclusive method...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{literacy}} (in {{the form}} of capabilities associated with using social networking sites, creating videos, writing reviews accessible to others, or the making of online news, for example) is reported often as being undertaken by pupils outside, rather than inside, schools. It is often access to specific projects within schools that offer opportunities to develop and use digital literacy capabilities that are focused on school-based subject matter, selected for specific educational endeavours and purposes. Empirical studies show that these opportunities can lead to outcomes not just at a subject level (which might be assessed through more traditional tests or examinations), but across a realm of areas including communication and operational skills, group work and teamwork approaches, ownership and independent learning, technical skills, confidence, interest, and the meeting of deadlines (where forms of assessment other than subject tests are clearly needed). Fundamentally, empirical studies report that projects employing <b>digital</b> literacy afford <b>pupils</b> realpurpose, audience and value. Researching this realm of outcomes provides real challenges, {{both in terms of}} identification of affordances, and identification of levels of affordances arising. This presentation and chapter will consider research approaches adopted, and an evidence base emerging, for wide benefits beyond subject gains alone...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{literacy}} {{is one of}} key competencies for lifelong learning. Although implementing multimedia (i. e. ICT) into the educational process has a global perspective, the curricular documents for compulsory school attendance in the Czech Republic (Rámcový vzdělávací program), Slovak Republic (Štátny vzdelávací program) and Germany (Bildungsstandards) do not emphasize this need. A review of the above mentioned documents indicated, that the general need to develop <b>digital</b> literacy of <b>pupils</b> across all school subjects is not formulated by these documents. Therefore, the personal opinions and beliefs of the teachers, their enthusiasm to use ICT, their level of computer literacy, school facilities and the approach of pupils to ICT, play the most important role {{with regard to the}} implementation of multimedia in the educational process. Accordingly, the combined research conducted by questionnaires and structured interviews, is aimed towards beliefs, opinions and experiences of pre-service and in-service teachers of biology and primary school pupils from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Germany. The research has involved 422 Czech, 205 Slovak and 136 German in-service biology teachers and 222 Czech, 100 Slovak and 84 German pre-service teachers.

40|$|New Purposes – New Practices – New Pedagogy (NP 3) is a {{collaboration}} between The Open University, Lancaster University and Manchester Metropolitan University, led by Professor Peter Twining. NP 3 is finding out about how children's digital practices influence teaching and learning. NP 3 aims {{to find out about}} how children use digital devices outside school and what influence (if any) these practices have on what pupils and teachers do inside primary schools. The focus is on pedagogy across the curriculum (rather than the teaching of computing). Our Research Questions (RQs) for these exploratory studies are: RQ 1 What are the <b>digital</b> practices that <b>pupils</b> bring to their learning in school? RQ 2 Across subject domains what do teachers’ intended and enacted pedagogic practices indicate about their awareness of and the value accorded to pupils’ digital competencies, and how do pupils’ experience these pedagogic practices? RQ 3 What institutional circumstances and practices enable or undermine how pupils’ digital competencies and practices are recognised (RQ 1) and integrated into teachers’ practice (RQ 2) ?

40|$|Few {{quantitative}} data exist on pupil diameter, particularly in children. {{in this article}} we describe an analysis of pupil diameter and pupil area in normal preschool children during attentive gaze (AG) and spontaneous gaze (SG) using <b>digital</b> imaging. the <b>pupil</b> diameter and pupil area of 200 preschool children aged 4 to 6 years were evaluated. the images were recorded with a digital camera, transferred to a computer, processed by movie software and submitted to the Invert filter of Adobe Photoshop (R) software. Three consecutive measures of pupil diameter and pupil area were taken for both eyes during AG and SG. Arithmetic means of each parameter were calculated and data were expressed in millimeters. Mean pupil diameter was similar for both eyes, presenting values of 4. 9 mm during AG and 4. 1 mm during SG. Mean pupil area was also similar for both eyes, presenting values of 15. 6 mm(2) and 9. 1 mm(2) during AG and SG, respectively. There were no differences between boys and girls. However, 6 -year-old children showed lower pupil diameter and area under both evaluation conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the writing process {{in the teaching of}} the subject of Swedish at upper secondary school. This study analyses the relations between the pupils’ writing and the school environment in which the writing takes place and how the pupils position themselves and others in relation to their use of digital artefacts and norms in the classroom. The empirical material has been created in three classes at two different schools. The data consists of participant observations of 42 lessons, all of which were video recorded using two cameras, and audio recorded semi-structured interviews with 24 pupils and 3 teachers. Theoretically, the study is based on sociocultural perspectives on literacy and learning and a multimodal social semiotic understanding of meaning-making based on an interest in the use of resources that constitute meaning in the social environment. From an ecological perspective, writing is examined as discourses in which the participants and the environment interact. Analytic concepts are used by inspiration from Kress et al (2005) and Smidt (2002). The figure “Writing roles in fields of tension” has been constructed to illustrate the students’ writing roles and positioning's in the empirical material. The results show that the shift from paper and pen to computer and screen means more than a shift change in the use of artefacts. The teaching of digital writing has a point of departure as a project in communication. In multimodal environments, pupils are often left without access to a teacher due to the layout of the room. This leads to positioning in roles, such as help seeker and helper. The classrooms are characterised by the constant presence of social media and its demands on students’ attention. Earlier generations of writing processes emphasised the importance of prewriting, drafting and revision in stages. In the digital writing process these stages are lacking. In this context, the digital writing process can be understood as a “fourth generation process” consisting of writing, saving and sending. The fourth generation of writing process stresses on the writing at a micro- rather than macro level. The word processing functions of spelling and grammar offer clickable solutions to problems, but cannot be considered as tools for learning. In the <b>digital</b> classroom <b>pupils</b> are vulnerable, left to their own resources and have difficulties in handling complex assignments...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{designs for}} {{learning}} in the extended digital interface in the Social Science classroom. The aim is to describe and analyse how pupils interact, make meaning and learn while deploying digital learning resources. Together with the thesis a multimodal design theoretical perspective on learning has developed: Designs for Learning. Here learning is understood as multimodal transformative processes of sign-making activities where teachers and pupils are viewed as didactic designers. A model called Learning Design Sequence has been developed {{and serves as a}} tool for data collection and analysis. Video observation material from five ICT-advanced schools with pupils aged 6 - 17 was multimodally transcribed and analysed. In conclusion the thesis, among other things, indicates that: - Social Science acquires informal features and pupils are independently designing their own digital Social Science material. - Pupils’ interactions are significantly multimodal and the digital learning resource becomes a third element in interaction. Pupils are constantly active and very responsive to each others’ representations. They cooperate as if {{learning in the}} extended interface is a collective responsibility. - Pupils’ learning is also significantly multimodal. Being digital natives, they engage in colours, sounds and images to represent some of their learning. - Learning represented in modes other than text and speech becomes invisible and disappears in the <b>digital</b> divide. - <b>Pupils</b> are simultaneously designing parallel paths of learning. One path represents the formalised education which is the path initiated, promoted and assessed by the teacher. The other path is guided by pupils’ interests and by affordances in the digital interface. This represents the extended learning that goes on below the surface.           The thesis ends with a discussion about didactic complexities in The Online Learning Paradigm. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 1 : Accepted. Paper 5 : Submitted...|$|R
40|$|Project Outcomes Poster. CPAL Project's Website : www. cpal. qub. ac. uk. Official URL at TLRP : [URL] poster {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} the TLRP project Consulting Pupils on the Assessment of their Learning. This project examined pupils??? participation in their own assessment from a children???s rights perspective. It demonstrated that when genuine opportunities for participating in and understanding assessment are presented, pupils engage in their learning and focus on their own progress. When policy makers use child-centred methods to consult children directly, children show the motivation and capacity {{to be involved in}} decision-making. CPAL enshrined these principles within its own design and processes. KS 2 and KS 3 pupils advised on ethical informed consent and some of the research methods. They co-researched and co-interpreted aspects of the data. In addition to traditional survey methods, the project developed creative methods for use with pupils and teachers which incorporated E-consultation, focus groups, drawings, and <b>pupils???</b> <b>digital</b> recordings. The project was designed to take account of the policy context in Northern Ireland, with its focus on pupil profiles and assessment for learning. Findings: (1) Children can be consulted directly by policy-makers on educational issues such as assessment policy and practice.; (2) When teachers??? beliefs and their assessment for learning (AfL) practices come together, pupils benefit; (3) Teachers and parents are generally supportive of children???s rights; and (4) Children can be involved as co-researchers in mainstream research projects in ways that enhance the inquiry and enshrine children???s right. Implications: (1) Methods should be inclusive and adults should listen and respond to children???s views; (2) Teachers need support to create participative classroom cultures based on genuine AfL; (3) There are opportunities for increased awareness of how to apply and evaluate children???s rights in practice; and (4). This takes time and careful negotiation. We need {{a better understanding of the}} implications of engaging children more democratically in research...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{how much}} oral English pupils are exposed to, {{and how much}} oral English they produce, in two ESL {{classrooms}} in the eighth and tenth grades in western Norway. The study also focuses on extra-curricular sources of incidental language learning where these pupils are exposed to and can produce oral English. Research from neighbouring Sweden (Sundqvist, 2009; Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012; Olsson, 2012; Henry, 2013) {{has focused on the}} effect incidental language learning, in particular online digital gaming, has on pupils’ acquisition of English. There is however little Norwegian research in this particular field (Sletten, Strandbo & Gilje, 2015; Theodorsen, 2015). Inspired by these studies, this thesis hypothesized that pupils produce little oral English in ESL language classes in Norway. Furthermore, that pupils are exposed to greater amounts of oral English from extra-curricular sources. These sources, particularly online <b>digital</b> gaming, provide <b>pupils</b> greater opportunity for exposure to and to produce oral English, in arenas the pupils perceive as authentic and relevant. To investigate these hypotheses, data was collected through 15 hours of classroom observation, using the Classroom Oral Participation Scheme (COPS). This scheme described events in the classroom on multiple levels: activities at whole class level (writing, reading, episodes of L 1 and L 2 speech production, listening, silence) : and who engaged in these activities (teacher, individual pupils, groups, whole class). Three pupils in each class were selected for closer observation, to provide greater nuance in the same areas as described at whole class level. In addition to classroom observation, pupils in the sample population (N= 45) answered questionnaires designed to explore active and passive extra-curricular sources of oral English these pupils were exposed to. Research findings indicate that while instances of individual pupils producing oral English in the ESL classroom were infrequent, pupils were exposed to and produced significant amounts of oral English through discussions, conversations and reading. Activities requiring use of oral communicative abilities (listening and speech production) accounted for nearly 90 % of the observed activities in both classes. The passive incidental language learning sources music, television and YouTube were the greatest sources of exposure to oral English, followed by the ESL-classroom and the cinema. Online digital gaming was found to be the smallest source of exposure for the sample population in this study...|$|R
