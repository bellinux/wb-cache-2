5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers {{that the best}} way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers finally {{carried out}} their {{original}} plan for Demeter {{for the most}} part, set {{all the way back}} in September 1956. He became the new starter in center field, while Duke Snider was moved over to right field. Don had a very successful spring training and was expected to be the opening day starting centerfielder against the Chicago Cubs, but instead he rode the bench {{for the duration of the}} game. The next day, Duke Snider's lingering knee problems came back, and Demeter was given his first start of the season with the temperature around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The new and improved Don Demeter made the best first impression he could, hitting a home run and a single while driving in two runs en route to a 5-3 win. Snider started the next game, the series opener against the St. Louis Cardinals. In his second start the next day, Don hit another homer. The next day, another home run. In just three starts, Don already had three home runs and six runs batted in. Demeter was only <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> with his April tear.|$|E

Gaining {{the trust of the}} inmates by participating in fighting matches, Riddick eventually kills the champion of the fighting matches, a guard named Bam. This leads him to be taken to a room where no surveillance is seen and several guards await to kill Riddick. Abbott walks into the room, fully healed, holding a baseball bat. Shirah returns to him and tells him that the fury of all of his kind is within him, and he can release it if he chooses. A blast of energy called the 'Rage of Furya' kills all the guards around him except Abbott, who hides and then panics and attacks Riddick. Riddick kills Abbott and proceeds to find another way to escape. Using a secret entrance to an elevator, he infiltrates a mining facility. He meets an inmate of great influence in the area named Jagger Valance (Ron Perlman), who wishes to escape with him. He makes a bomb and plants it in a mining site with a massive gas leak. However, Riddick is discovered and caught by the guards. During his transfer to another section, the prison is disrupted by an outbreak of creatures called [...] "Xeno", due to the bomb Riddick planted, in order to create the confusion necessary for his escape, and Riddick attempts to escape with Valance. His plans are foiled again by Johns. After a fist fight, Riddick and Johns are both shot by Valance (who only meant to hit Johns) and Valance is killed by the guards. After meeting again with the warden, and telling him that he is <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>started,</b> Riddick is placed in the [...] "triple-max" [...] area, where inmates are kept in cryonic sleep.
