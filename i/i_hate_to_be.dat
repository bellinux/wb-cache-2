2500|$|The Wrath of Khan had {{its first}} public {{screening}} at a science-fiction convention in Overland Park, Kansas on May 8, 1982, {{almost a month}} before general release. Although Paramount executives were concerned that Spock's death would set fans against the movie, the audience actually applauded after Spock's death scene. [...] "It was sensational. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given to superlatives but it absolutely reached everything we wanted it to. I couldn't ask for anything better," [...] said co-producer Robert Sallin of the advance audience's reaction.|$|E

6000|$|... "There's {{some comfort}} in that anyhow," [...] {{returned}} Sam, with a pleasant smile, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>hates</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pecooliar. By the way, Fred, p'r'aps they may <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> {{give you some}} noos here, if you ax 'em, about your friend Jack Molloy. He was a Blue Light, wasn't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. I wouldn't {{think of}} {{teaching}} you, my boy. You know I'm not a schoolmaster. I'm not clever enough for that, and when I <b>was</b> your age, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taught. But <b>I</b> could {{show you some}} things about flowers and plants that would astonish you. Only it would not <b>be</b> safe <b>to</b> do it just now, for the deer might come up and--" ...|$|R
5000|$|The same profile quoted Morells catholic {{approach}} to stage assignments: [...] "If a part {{is a good}} part and I feel I can enjoy playing it, it doesnt matter whether its Shakespeare or modern farce â€¦ <b>Id</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bogged down in Shakespeare or classic theatre all my life. Its {{a good thing for}} an actor to do many different kinds of theatre, because it keeps his imagination stimulated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit. Maybe I'm soft on {{the little}} cousin. But I just like Miss Sampson--think she's fine--could look up to her. And <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{different}} from what she thinks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Gus. Of course, I'll let {{him know}} what I think of him for spoiling my plans for a spread. But <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hard on him, because of this disgrace about his uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{can you be}} so unkind as to ask me such a question?" [...] he replied. [...] "You {{know how}} <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bothered. I tell you what I hear, and then you can decide for yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|Melissa {{had turned}} her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees, looking gloomily out <b>to</b> sea. I <b>was</b> afraid I couldn't coax her into marrying Isaac. As for me, I hadn't any real {{objection}} to marrying him, after all, for if he was short of romance he was good-natured and has a fat bank account; but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> driven into it that way.|$|R
6000|$|... "And this is {{only the}} beginning. I intend to play all your plays in a repertoire, and you're to write me others as I need them. And finally--and this <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge--you <b>are</b> no longer in my debt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must go, {{because it}} is made for me, but I can come away early and make up lost sleep. <b>I</b> do <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so fractious," [...] and Rose rubbed the {{forehead}} that ached with too much racketing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{had such}} a jolly good time, that <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shut up all day worse than ever. Don't you, Frank?" [...] asked Jack, with a vengeful slap at the {{arithmetic}} which was the torment of his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; three weeks. If {{you could}} have made it the month {{it would have been}} convenient; but <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disagreeable." [...] Thus the matter was settled, and Mr. Traffick was {{altogether}} well pleased with the arrangement.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Phillotson, I am not--altogether! <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what {{is called}} a clever girl--there are too many of that sort now!" [...] {{answered}} Sue sensitively. [...] "I only meant--I don't know what I meant--except that it was what you don't understand!" ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{had eaten}} I went out alone into the garden, for on this plain {{the air was}} very warm and pleasant. It was a {{beautiful}} garden, and I wandered about among its avenues and flowering bushes, glad <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solitary and <b>to</b> have time to think. Amongst other things I wondered where Quilla might be, for of her I had seen nothing {{from the time that}} we entered the town. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> parted from her, because in this vast strange land into which I had wandered {{she was the only one}} for whom I had come to care and without whom I felt I should die of loneliness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} he'd be glad {{he was doing}} {{something}} at once. If I were a--" [...] She stopped, and they laughed together. [...] "I mean that <b>I</b> should <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so long getting ready to do something as men are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Diff'rent? He {{was another}} man. He didn't even look the same. Sich eyes! Al'ays looking past ye at {{something}} behind ye. They'd give anyone creeps. He {{never had any}} notion of flesh-and-blood women after that--said a man wouldn't, after seeing Isabel. His life was plumb ruined. Lucky he died young. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in the same room}} with him--he wa'n't canny, that was all there <b>was</b> <b>to</b> it. You keep away from that grave--you don't want to look odder than ye are by nature. And when ye git married, ye'll have to give up roamin' about half the night in graveyards. A wife wouldn't put up with it, as I've done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do mind, and <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{interrupted}} in my arguments. Yes, just that. If {{he saw his}} cow sick, he'd try {{to doctor}} the cow in her sickness. He sees that you are sick, {{and of course he}} comes to your relief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the {{locomotive}} that did it," [...] she explained. [...] "They were most too scared for anything, but <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beaten by a team. Ours {{know too much}} to try, but I got Haslem to drive me in. I dropped him at Norton's, who'll bring him on." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} made me say it. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of those people}} who throw cold water on other peoples' hopes. But it slipped out before I thought. I suppose the doubt had been vaguely troubling me always, under all my faith in Marcella, and now made itself felt in spite of me.|$|E
5000|$|On September 18, 1985, Mahler pitched 7-2/3 {{innings of}} one-hit relief {{to lead the}} Detroit Tigers to a 5-2 victory over the New York Yankees, thus denying a bid by Phil Niekro to win his 300th game. Mahler, who {{relieved}} Juan Berenguer after he got into trouble in the first inning, retired 23 of the 25 hitters he faced, including the first 15 hitters who came up against him. A former teammate of Niekro's, Mahler told reporters after the game that [...] "The thing I remember most about (Niekro) is what a great guy he was. I didn't think about the Niekro thing at all. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the one <b>to</b> beat him but that's the game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{have been}} pinched if I hadn't. That's why. Ain't that reason enough?" [...] Then {{she began to}} cry. [...] "Honest, Eddie, I <b>was</b> goin' <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the best girl in the world. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what <b>I</b> am; <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> men; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ready almost <b>to</b> die when I saw you. And you seemed {{different}} from everybody else. And when I found you liked me, too, why, I thought I'd make you believe I was good, and I <b>was</b> goin' <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good. When you asked {{to come to my}} house and see me, why, I'd have died rather than do anything wrong after that. But what's the use of talking about it? I'll say good-by, if you will, Mr. McManus." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> Sing <b>is</b> a live album by American composer, bandleader and keyboardist Carla Bley {{recorded}} at the Great American Music Hall in 1981 (at the same concerts that produced Live!) combined with three tracks {{recorded at}} Grog Kill Studios in 1983 and released on the Watt/ECM label in 1984.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{reminded}} of Pollok's [...] "Course of Time," [...] {{and so do}} you; but every time I saw Jacks I would think of the poet's description of another poet {{by the name of}} G. G. Byron who [...] "Drank early; deeply drank--drank draughts that common millions might have quenched; then died of thirst because there was no more to drink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Head will be {{all right}} in a day or two, but I stove in my helmet, and ground a hole in both knees of my new shorts. Had to borrow a fit-out of Bemis, and leave my rags behind. We needn't mention any more than is {{necessary}} to the girls; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fussed over," [...] answered Sid, trying to speak carelessly.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a fool, Bob; {{you never}} learn," [...] she said wearily. [...] "Anyhow, {{you have got}} to cut out this kind of thing; the {{business}} won't stand for it long. Well, as you can't be trusted with dollars, I'll have to put you on an allowance. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mean, but if you waste what I give you, you'll get no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that night}} I wasn't very sleepy, and the porter had got the place so piping hot {{with the big}} stoves, one {{at each end of}} the car, to keep the good, old-fashioned Christmas cold out, that I thought I should be more {{comfortable}} with a smoke before I went to bed; and, anyhow, I could get away from the heat better in the smoking-room. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leaving home on Christmas Eve, for I never had done that before, and <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leaving my wife alone with the children and the two girls in our little house in Cambridge. Before I started in on the old horse-car for Boston, I had helped her to tuck the young ones in and to fill the stockings hung along the wall over the register--the nearest we could come to a fireplace--and I thought those stockings looked very weird, five of them, dangling lumpily down, and I kept seeing them, and her sitting up sewing in front of them, and afraid to go to bed on account of burglars. I suppose she was shyer of burglars than any woman ever was that had never seen a sign of them. She was always calling me up, to go down-stairs and put them out, and I used to wander all over the house, from attic to cellar, in my nighty, with a lamp in one hand and a poker in the other, so that no burglar could have missed me if he had wanted an easy mark. I always kept a lamp and a poker handy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{should not}} have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master Linton. 'He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll <b>be</b> flogged: <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flogged! <b>I</b> can't eat my dinner. Why did you speak to him, Edgar?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll remember, mother. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obliging, but I {{guess it}} would have saved us lots of trouble if I'd said No in the beginning. I tried to, but she would go. Poor Jill! I'll {{take better care of}} her next time. Is she very ill, Mamma?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Thanks, many, many thanks! But I wish I {{could do}} {{something}} to earn my board. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> idle, though rest is delicious. Is there nothing I can do to repay you, Miss Belinda? Please answer quickly, for I know the hour is almost over,' cried Rosa, stamping with anxiety; for, like all her sex, she wanted the last word.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I do. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fenced up, and in, every way. I {{should like}} to break out in some fresh place, and feel I had all the world before me! Then I'll tell you what, Marian," [...] and he spoke with {{infinite}} relish, [...] "suppose matters got a little worse here, {{and they were all}} of them really in distress!" ...|$|E
60|$|He was right, and as {{he spoke}} neither his look, tone, nor manner displeased me; my AMOUR-PROPRE was propitiated; he had not {{addressed}} me out of condescension, but because, having repaired to the cool dining-room for refreshment, he now wanted some one to talk to, by way of temporary amusement. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> condescended to, but I like well enough to oblige; I stayed.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, {{they barely}} {{completed}} {{a tour of}} the United States and missed their dates in Canada after being banned from that country for one year. Highlights included playing with Capitol Punishment in Fresno and Scratch Acid in Dallas. A second album, Things <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>To</b> Admit, <b>was</b> recorded in 1988 at Prairie Sun Studio in Cotati, California.|$|R
2500|$|... 'It does arise {{directly}} from the consideration of the struggle {{to get away from}} speaking Cornish dialect and to speak correct English, a struggle which I began thus early and pursued constantly with no regret, for was it not the key which unlocked the door to all that lay beyondâ€”Oxford, the world of letters, the community of all who speak the Kingâ€™s English, from which I should otherwise have been infallibly barred? But the struggle made me very sensitive about language; <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> corrected; nothing is more humiliating: and it left me with a complex about Cornish dialect. The inhibition which I had imposed on myself left me, by the time I got to Oxford, incapable of speaking it; and for years, with the censor operating subconsciously...' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However, I didn't mean to {{talk about}} the house, but rather about my life when I was a {{shipping}} clerk. I had ambition and thought I had talent; <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left behind by my friends. It cost much planning to share their amusements, join a good yacht club, and race my boat. Sportsmen like you don't know the small tricks and shabbiness we others <b>are</b> forced <b>to</b> use. Well, at length my uncle died and I got control of the falling house, with its load of debt. I'd long been rash, but the rashest thing I did was when I fell in love with Flora. Yet she loved me, and Chisholm, with some reserves, has given his consent. I have got to satisfy him and with this in view, we're bound for the Caribbean on board a thirty-year-old yacht." ...|$|R
