25|$|While {{the search}} was underway, vocal duties were handled {{by a number of}} the band's friends, {{including}} Sean Ingram of Coalesce and Mike Patton, who agreed to help the band produce an EP. The plan to record with Patton was in place before a replacement vocalist had been found however by the time Patton had recorded vocals and the EP was released, the band had been touring with Minakakis's replacement, Greg Puciato, for nearly a year.

25|$|The {{scene is}} within a room where, at an open end on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms. The center is {{occupied}} by a horse falling in agony {{as if it had}} just been run through by a spear or javelin. The large gaping wound in the horse's side is a major focus of the painting. Under the horse <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead,</b> apparently dismembered soldier; his hand on a severed arm still grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. On the open palm of the dead soldier is a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head (the bare bulb of the torturer's cell).|$|E

500|$|A wax {{sculpture}} of Winehouse went {{on display at}} the London Madame Tussauds on 23 July 2008. The singer did not attend the unveiling, although her parents did.

Burroughs (in a recreation of the accidental killing of his wife Joan Vollmer), was scheduled to go on display in New York's Half Gallery on 14 November 2008 with a sale price of US$100,000. Perego said of the sculpture: [...] "Rock stars are the sacrificial animals of society." [...] Winehouse's spokesperson stated: [...] "It's a funny kind of tribute. The artist seems in thrall to a tabloid persona that is not the real Amy. People often use her image to sell their work." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2011, it was {{discovered}} that rare locomotive parts that were [...] "as good as irreplaceable" [...] had been stolen, and the locomotive was moved to Perambur Locomotive Workshops at Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, for repair. [...] On arrival, it was found that an estimated 50 to 60 parts had been looted, including [...] "the boiler, condensor, lubricator and flow tubes". [...] The Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer at the workshops stated [...] "What we received <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> body, a piece of metal whose every removable part has been removed, leaving only the metal shell. The list of parts to be procured is huge." [...] Officials estimated that it could take at least a year to restore the engine, even if suppliers of replacement parts could be found. [...] Following a substantial rebuild, in which the workshops had to construct the missing parts themselves, the locomotive returned to service on 22 December 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{debut album}} from the unknown Blunt {{initially}} attracted little critical attention, {{and there were}} no published reviews from major UK music journals. His live performances, mainly in support of better known musicians, received somewhat mixed but generally favourable reviews. His lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of Damien Rice and David Gray. In March 2004, with Blunt performing in the support role for Katie Melua in Manchester, Alex McCann of Designer Magazine wrote, [...] "Blunt's ascendance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> cert and this time next year it isn't that far removed from reality to suggest that a number one album, Brit Award and countless accolade's [...] will be his for the taking." [...] After release of the album, concert support slots for Elton John and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions in late 2004 and early 2005 followed, as did a band residency at London club 93 Feet East. In March 2005, his second single, [...] "Wisemen," [...] was released.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fianc√©e Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there {{was no one else}} for me... second best is no good for me... I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 he said to the Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{and audiences}} have cited {{similarities}} with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple [...] "borrowing" [...] to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of the Boston Globe called it [...] "the same movie" [...] as Dances with Wolves. Like Dances with Wolves, Avatar {{has been characterized}} as being a [...] "white savior" [...] movie, in which a [...] "backwards" [...] native people is impotent without the leadership {{of a member of}} the invading white culture. Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette [...] "Call Me Joe", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter. Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that Avatar has elements in common with the 1960s Noon Universe novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave. Various reviews have compared Avatar to the films , Pocahontas and The Last Samurai. NPR's Morning Edition has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that Avatar was made by [...] "mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender". Gary Westfahl wrote that [...] "the science fiction story that most closely resembles Avatar has to be Ursula K. Le Guin's novella [...] "The Word for World Is Forest" [...] (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> gook." [...] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the [...] "mash-up" [...] included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, Midworld. Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which featured fantastic images of floating rock formations and dragons. In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m. Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and The Hollywood Reporter noted that Cameron has won multiple Avatar idea theft cases.|$|E
