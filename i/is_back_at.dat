The album was released on November 4, 2008, and contained covers of songs by Public Enemy, House of Pain, Bob Marley, and Cypress Hill. IGN reviewer Spence D. called the album [...] "an embarrassing endeavor that sounds like it should have stayed locked inside Ice's studio (or at the very least leaked on YouTube and passed off as a piss take)."

500|$|It is an Eurodance song, which {{incorporates}} heavy synth-pop {{elements in}} its instrumentation and {{is similar to}} previous works by producer David Guetta. Contemporary critics compared the track to Britney Spears' [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] (2011) and Chris Brown's [...] "Beautiful People" [...] (2011).

The track opens with he singing, [...] "You're beautiful, beautiful/You should know it/I think it's time, think it's time/That you show it", lines that were compared to One Direction's [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] (2011). As the track follows, Bieber encourages girls to release their inner beauty: [...] "Light it up, so explosive/Why you acting so shy, holding back/DJ bring that back." [...] During the rap section, Ludacris references their previous collaboration on [...] "Baby" [...] (2010), saying, [...] "Once again, the dynamic duo <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it!/ JB, Ludacris!/ I love everything about you/ You're imperfectly perfect/ Everyone's itching for beauty/But they're just scratching the surface." ...|$|E

2500|$|No one can {{complain}} of Clarence's lack of variety or versatility. When he really gets going he's a three-ring circus. During one number, he plays, sings, whistles a chorus, and snaps his fingers with {{the technique of}} a Spanish dancer to give further percussive accompaniment to his blues. At times he turns sideways, almost {{with his back to}} the piano as he keeps pounding away at the keyboard and stomping his feet, meanwhile continuing to sing and shout at his audience or his drummer. Suddenly in the middle of a number he jumps up, his hands clasped in front of him, and walks around the piano stool, and then, unexpectedly, out booms a vocal break in a bass voice from somewhere. One second later, he has turned and <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the keyboard, both hands flying at lightning-like pace. His actions and facial expressions are as intensely dramatic and exciting as his music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fin Fang Foom {{appears in}} the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode [...] "Mission: Impossible Man". This version is {{incapable}} of speech. Impossible Man appears {{at the base of}} the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. in the form of Fin Fang Foom where he attacks them until Hulk sees through his ruse. After absorbing Impossible Man's powers, Sauron later uses them to summon Fin Fang Foom (who was the only reptile that Sauron couldn't control). Due to the absorption of Impossible Man's powers wearing off, Sauron tried to absorb Fin Fang Foom's powers only to be knocked out far into the ocean. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. fought hard to defeat Fin Fang Foom. When Impossible Man <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> full strength, he borrows a weapon from Henry Pym's laboratory to enlarge the Two-Headed Compound Hulk (Impossible Man's merging of Hulk and Red Hulk from earlier in the episode) to large size so that he can defeat Fin Fang Foom. The Two-Headed Compound Hulk then throws Fin Fang Foom far into the ocean where he landed on Sauron (who was in the water at the time).|$|E
2500|$|Bertram [...] "Bert" [...] Cooper (Robert Morse); {{recurring}} Seasons 1–2, regular Seasons 3–7: The somewhat eccentric {{senior partner}} at Sterling Cooper. He leaves the day-to-day {{running of the}} firm to Sterling and Draper, but is {{keenly aware of the}} firm's operations. Bertram is a Republican. He is fascinated by Japanese culture, requiring everybody, including clients, to remove their shoes before walking into his office, which is decorated with Japanese art. He is also a fan of the writings of Ayn Rand. Among his eccentricities, Bert frequently walks through the offices in his socks and intensely dislikes gum-chewing and smoking, an oddity for the time, and especially considering Lucky Strike cigarettes is a major client through Season 4. He owns a ranch in Montana and is a widower with no children. Don approaches him about buying back the agency {{at the end of the}} third season, which evolves into their forming the new Sterling Cooper firm. In Season 4, [...] Roger Sterling, being a WWII veteran of the Pacific theater, is outraged at the possibility of taking on a Japanese client, Honda. [...] In a heated office meeting with some of the other executives including Peter Campbell, who had the lead, Roger says to Burt, [...] "Why don't we just get Dr. Lyle Levins in here?" [...] and storms out of the room, leaving Peter Campbell dumbfounded, asking, [...] "Who the hell is Dr. Lyle Levins?" [...] Interesting enough a few episodes later a drunk and lonely Don who is pulling an all-nighter at the office with Peggy stumbles upon an audio tape recording of Roger Sterling's memoirs that reveals that Bert received a war injury to his groin, and that ultimately he was castrated by an incompetent doctor, named Lyle Levins. Later in Season 4, in the episode [...] "Blowing Smoke," [...] when the agency is forced to radically downsize its staff following the loss of the Lucky Strike account, Bert tells the others that he is quitting the business. He is not seen for the rest of the season, but <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> work at the beginning of Season 5. Bert's sister Alice is a silent partner in Sterling Cooper. By the sixth season, Bert is increasingly frustrated with Don's erratic behavior and joins the other partners in placing him on a leave of absence. During the seventh season, he agrees to let Don return under an agreed set of stipulations. He dies while watching the Apollo 11 moon landing on television. He appears to Don in two dream sequences following his death.|$|E

6000|$|To {{the other}} sister, Sarah, Coleridge rather precipitately engaged himself. His love for Mary Evans was not dead, {{but he seems}} to have despaired of winning her and to have determined, by uniting himself {{domestically}} with Southey and his friends, to make retreat from their communistic scheme impossible. A few weeks later he <b>is</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge, tortured apparently between his old love and his new engagement. Mary Evans has written to him deploring his wild notions and the mad plan of Pantisocracy, yet confident that he has [...] "too much sensibility to be an infidel." [...] Southey has reproved him rather sharply for failing to write to his betrothed at Bath. Our next glimpse of him is at London, discussing poetry and philosophy with Lamb at the [...] "Salutation and Cat" [...] tavern and perhaps trying to get a sight of Mary Evans. In December he is again at Bristol, in lively correspondence with Southey about democracy, Pantisocracy, and poetry, {{but at the same time}} he addresses a last appeal to Miss Evans. Her answer is kind, but final; that chapter is closed, and Coleridge writes to Southey that he will [...] "do his duty," [...] by which he means apparently that he will be faithful to Pantisocracy and marry Sarah Fricker.|$|E
