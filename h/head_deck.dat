50|$|Unlike {{many of its}} contemporaries, the {{combustion}} chamber of the W-series engine was in {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, not the head, the head having only tiny recesses for the valves. This arrangement was achieved by combining a cylinder <b>head</b> <b>deck</b> that was not perpendicular to the bore with a crowned piston, which was a novel concept in American production engines of the day. As the piston approached top dead center, the angle of the crown combined with that of the <b>head</b> <b>deck</b> to form a wedge-shaped combustion chamber with a pronounced quench area. The spark plugs were inserted vertically into the quench area, which helped to produce a rapidly moving flame front for more complete combustion.|$|E
50|$|The {{easiest way}} to {{differentiate}} a bare Magnum block from a LA is by checking {{for the presence of}} the two crankshaft position sensor mounting bosses on the right rear top of the block, just {{to the rear of the}} cylinder <b>head</b> <b>deck</b> surface. Bosses = Magnum.|$|E
5000|$|In {{all forms}} (except the ZL-1 Can-Am model), the [...] "rat motor", {{as it was}} later nicknamed (small-block engine being a [...] "mouse motor"), was {{slightly}} heavier than the W-series model, with a dry weight of about 685 lb. Aside from the new cylinder head design and the reversion to a conventional 90 degree cylinder <b>head</b> <b>deck</b> angle, the Mark IV shared many dimensional and mechanical design features with the W-series engine. The cylinder block, although more substantial in all respects, used the same cylinder bore pitch of 4.84" [...] with a larger 2.75" [...] main bearing dimension, increased from the 2.50" [...] of the older engine (in fact, the shorter-stroke 348 and 409 crankshafts could be installed {{with the use of}} [...] "spacer bearings" [...] without modifying the crankshaft). Like its predecessor, the Mark IV used crowned pistons, which were castings for conventional models and impact extruded (forged), solid skirt types in high performance applications.|$|E

In a 1997 interview with The Wire, Homler explained, [...] "I think of English as lettuce and my own language as bread.

50|$|The {{design of}} this card is fairly {{constant}} across tarot decks. The key characters are {{that of a}} woman and a lion, with the woman looking calm and gentle, yet dominant over the lion. Many cards, including that of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, have the woman clasping the lion's jaws. Another feature of the RWS deck is a lemniscate (a kind of geometric form) hovering over the woman's <b>head.</b> Other <b>decks</b> have the woman sitting upon the lion, or merely with one hand upon it. Some decks feature just one of the characters; flowers are often presented on this card.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this work is focused on making a link between casting microstructural, mechanical and machining properties for 319 Al-Si sand cast components. In order to achieve this, a unique Machinability Test Block (MTB) {{is designed to simulate}} the Nemak V 6 Al-Si engine block solidification behavior. This MTB is then utilized to cast structures with in-situ nano-alumina particle master alloy additions that are Mg based, as well as independent in-situ Mg additions, and Sr additions to the MTB. The Universal Metallurgical Simulator and Analyzer (UMSA) Technology Platform is utilized for characterization of each cast structure at different Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing (SDAS) levels. The rapid quench method and Jominy testing is used to assess the capability of the nano-alumina master alloy to modify the microstructure at different SDAS levels. Mechanical property assessment of the MTB is done at different SDAS levels on cast structures with master alloy additions described above. Weibull and Quality Index statistical analysis tools are then utilized to assess the mechanical properties. The MTB is also used to study single pass high speed face milling and bi-metallic cutting operations where the Al-Si hypoeutectic structure is combined with hypereutectoid Al-Si liners and cast iron cylinder liners. These studies are utilized to aid the implementation of Al-Si liners into the Nemak V 6 engine block and bi-metallic cutting of the <b>head</b> <b>decks.</b> Machining behavior is also quantified for the investigated microstructures, and the Silicon Modification Level (SiML) is utilized for microstructural analysis {{as it relates to the}} machining behavior...|$|R

5000|$|In later years, an [...] "auto reverse" [...] feature {{appeared}} {{that allowed the}} deck to play (and, in some decks, record) {{on both sides of}} the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. Most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. Auto-reverse decks employ a capstan and pinch roller for each side. Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the erase <b>head,</b> such <b>decks</b> must fit the erase head (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.|$|R

50|$|Several key {{components}} {{make up the}} main structure of most boats. The hull is the main structural component {{of the boat and}} provides buoyancy. The gunnel, which make up the sides of the boat, offers protection from water and makes the boat harder to sink. The roughly horizontal, chambered structures spanning the hull of the boat are referred to as the deck. A ship often has several decks, but a boat is unlikely to have more than one, if any. Above the deck are the superstructures. The underside of a deck is the <b>deck</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
