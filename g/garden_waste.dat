However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and <b>garden</b> <b>waste,</b> have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

50|$|The {{three major}} causes of animal habitat {{degradation}} are; the disruption {{or loss of}} ecosystem functions, the loss of food resources and loss of resident species. Non-native invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through competition, pest and disease transportation and habitat and ecosystem alteration. The dumping of <b>garden</b> <b>waste</b> in nature reserves surrounding and near urban areas {{increases the risk of}} fires. The dumped <b>garden</b> <b>waste</b> will eventually dry out creating fuel adding to already fallen debris fuel load on which a fire can thrive and spread on. <b>Garden</b> <b>waste</b> can spread weeds and these weeds build fuel for fires.Dumped <b>garden</b> <b>waste</b> can facilitate higher rates of erosion by smothering natural vegetation cover.With no root systems for stabilisation the top soil is vulnerable to erosion (Ritter, J. 2015), This can add higher levels of sediments, contributing to the siltation of creeks and waterways.|$|E
