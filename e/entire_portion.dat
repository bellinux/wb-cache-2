5|$|The {{earliest}} {{road with}} a similar routing to SR54 was mentioned in newspapers in 1908, and was paved by 1935. The South Bay Freeway was constructed next as an expressway from National City to Spring Valley. The freeway west to I-5 and the Sweetwater River flood channel were built at the same time, although both were delayed due to environmental concerns and litigation. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, {{the entirety of the}} western portion of SR54 was converted to a freeway, while the <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> inside the El Cajon city limits was returned to that city.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Route 3 was legislated {{along the}} Paterson Plank Road portion of present-day Route 120. It was {{eventually}} designated along the <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> of current Route 120. In 1953, Route 3 {{was moved to}} its current freeway alignment, replacing Route S3, and a portion of Route 20 was designated to run from current Route 3 north to Paterson Plank Road while Paterson Plank Road {{was removed from the}} state highway system. The portion of Paterson Plank Road that lost its state highway status in 1953 gained it back in 1972, when it became an extension of Route 20 {{as a result of the}} construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. As this route was not connected to the mainline of Route 20, it was designated Route 120 by the 1990s. As a result of the construction of American Dream Meadowlands, the interchange between Route 3 and Route 120 was improved. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in 2009 and a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Magnus {{was opposed}} by his cousin Haakon Magnusson, son of King Olaf's brother and {{short-lived}} co-ruler King Magnus Haraldsson, who claimed half the kingdom. Haakon was proclaimed king in the Uplands {{and at the}} Øyrating, the thing of Trøndelag (in central Norway). According to Førsund, Haakon {{took control of the}} <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> of the kingdom once held by his father (also including the Frostating—the thing of Hålogaland in northern Norway—and the Gulating—the thing of western Norway). Haakon secured support by relieving farmers of taxes and duties (including taxes dating back to the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson during the early 1030s), while Magnus pursued costly policies and demanded lengthy military service. After Magnus settled at the new royal estate in Nidaros for the winter of 1094–95, Haakon also travelled to the city and took up residence at the old royal estate. Their relationship became increasingly tense, culminating when Haakon saw Magnus' longships fully rigged at sea. Haakon summoned the Øyrating in response, leading Magnus to sail southwards. Haakon attempted to intercept Magnus by travelling south to Viken by land (over the mountains of Dovrefjell), but he died unexpectedly while hunting in February 1095.|$|E

25|$|The first {{portions}} of the roadway that is signed as SR53 today makes its appearance on Georgia state road maps in 1921, which show {{the portion of the}} route from south of Calhoun, through Fairmount, and on to Jasper. That <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> was already signed as SR53 at the time; however, this designation was also used in 1921 for the road connecting Calhoun with LaFayette and Chattanooga in Tennessee, which is signed as SR136 today. By 1926, the Calhoun-to-Fairmount portion was shown as having a sand, clay, or topsoil surface, while the Fairmount-to-Jasper portion appeared as being graded but unimproved.|$|E

25|$|The Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway was a {{major part}} of the Pennsylvania Railroad system, {{extending}} the PRR west from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, via Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Chicago, Illinois.

CSX leased its <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> in 2004 to the Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad (CFE). The remaining portion of the line from Tolleston into Chicago is now part of the Norfolk Southern's Chicago District, with a small portion of the original PFW trackage abandoned in favor of the parallel lines of former competitors which are now part of the modern NS system.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the U.S. Highway system was {{finalized}} in late 1926, one relatively minor change {{had been made to}} US2; it was swapped with US1 between Bangor and Houlton, Maine, placing US2 along the <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> of Route 15 east of St. Johnsbury. Several other major parts of the auto trail received numbers, most notably US30 from Portland, Oregon east to Pendleton, US195 in eastern Washington, and US23 in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. In the mid-1930s, much of New York's portion of the road became US104, and the part southeast of Littleton, New Hampshire to Portland, Maine became US302, but by far the longest piece was that followed by US2 between St. Ignace and Bonners Ferry. In 1946, US2 was extended west of its original western terminus in Bonners Ferry in Idaho to Everett in Washington via Spokane along what was then Alternate US10.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the I-10 bypass around Balmorhea and Toyahvale had been completed. With the {{completion}} of the Interstate, US 290 through much of West Texas became largely concurrent with the Interstate separating only to serve as a sort of business route into towns bypassed by the Interstate. With the creation of Interstate business routes, US 290 became obsolete on the portion running along I-10 and its route designation over that portion was canceled in 1992. The <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> of US 290 through Toyahvale and Balmorhea, part of which was concurrent with SH 17, did not become a new Interstate business route. Instead, Business Route 10-F separated from I-10 at FM 2903 to enter Balmorhea and rejoin the Interstate along SH 17. FM 3078 was designated in 1992 along the portion of US 290 between I-10 and SH 17 to allow that stretch of highway not concurrent with SH 17 to have a highway designation when the US 290 designation was canceled.|$|E

25|$|Today, D.C. {{is marked}} by contrasts. Neighborhoods on the eastern {{periphery}} of the central city, and east of the Anacostia River tend to be disproportionately lower-income. Following World War II, many middle-income whites {{moved out of the}} city's central and eastern sections to newer, affordable suburban housing, with commuting eased by highway construction. The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 sparked major riots in chiefly African American neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park. Large sections of the central city remained blighted for decades. By contrast, areas west of the Park, including virtually the <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> of the District between the Georgetown and Chevy Chase neighborhoods (the latter of which spills into neighboring Chevy Chase, Maryland), contain some of the nation's most affluent and notable neighborhoods. During the early 20th century, the U Street Corridor served as an important center for African American culture in DC. The Washington Metro opened in 1976. A rising economy and gentrification in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to revitalization of many downtown neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|By 1929, {{the stretch}} from Rome to Calhoun {{had been added}} and signed as SR53, with the {{southern}} half having been finished in a semi-hard surface, and the northern portion being surfaced {{with one of the}} soft surface materials. Another large portion of the route, running from Jasper to Dawsonville, on to Gainesville, and continuing to Winder, had also been graded by 1929, but {{did not appear to be}} signed yet. By early in 1932, the route had been extended to start at the Alabama state line, with some of the portion from the state line to Cave Spring, and a portion into Rome, appearing to be surfaced with hard cover, and the remainder of the route between the state line and Rome being covered in soft material. About half of the route out of Rome had also been improved to hard surface, and the same was the case for the <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> between Fairmount and Jasper, as well as more than half of the portion between Jasper and Dawsonville, and part of the stretch between Gainesville and Winder. In addition, the entire existing route, from Rome to Winder, was signed as SR53 by 1932.|$|E

In late January, I-805 between SR15 and SR94 was opened to traffic, though not all of the ramps at the SR94 interchange were operational. The connectors to SR94 east were completed in March. The <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> between SR94 and Home Avenue cost $10.5million (equivalent to $ in [...] ).

Wendover Boulevard was originally part of U.S. Route 40 (US40), which connected California to New Jersey via Nevada and Utah. A portion of the Nevada segment is concurrent with U.S. Route 93 Alternate (US93Alt.), and the <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> in Utah is [...] with Utah State Route 58 (SR-58). The Nevada Department of Transportation (Nevada DOT) applied for the business loop designation in the early 1980s but the designation has never been approved; nevertheless, signs are posted in both states.

Construction was underway on the stretch from Seeley to SR111 by June1966, and the <b>entire</b> <b>portion</b> through the county was planned for completion by 1968. This [...] portion, extending west to Drew Road, was planned for completion by early 1967, at a cost of $200million (about $ in [...] dollars); however, by then the date for completion of the freeway had slipped to 1972. The state ordered the building of the portion from west of Coyote Wells to just east of Drew Road in September 1967. The next year, Dekema indicated that the goal was to have I-8 completed by 1973, citing a deadline in order to have the federal government pay for up to ninety percent of the costs; the other freeways in the region were to be delayed because of this.|$|E
