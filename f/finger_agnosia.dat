50|$|Although it is a {{necessary}} component of Gerstmann's syndrome, cases of <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> alone have been reported.

5000|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> first {{defined in}} 1924 by Josef Gerstmann, {{is the loss}} in the ability [...] "to distinguish, name, or {{recognize}} the fingers", {{not only with the}} patient's own fingers, but also the fingers of others, and drawing and other representations of fingers. It is one of a tetrad of symptoms in Gerstmann syndrome, although it is also possible for <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> to exist on its own without any other disorders. [...] Usually, lesions to the left angular gyrus and posterior parietal areas can lead to <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|As in {{many other}} agnosias, those with the {{disorder}} have difficulty recognizing their errors and often do not correct themselves.There is no known treatment for <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Typically, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> does not present difficulties in daily life. In most cases, visual guidance can help with any difficulty in distinguishing or moving the appropriate finger.|$|E
50|$|The angular gyrus is {{the part}} of the brain {{associated}} with complex language functions (i.e. reading, writing and interpretation of what is written). Lesion to this part of the brain shows symptoms of the Gerstmann syndrome: effects include <b>finger</b> tap <b>agnosia,</b> alexia (inability to read), acalculia (inability to use arithmetic operations), agraphia (inability to copy), and left-right confusion.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a strong}} link between {{acalculia}} and <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Early in development, calculation begins with our fingers. The order that we use when we count with our finger is very specific and it is found {{in a variety of}} different cultures. The use of a base ten number system is also found in many cultures. Gerstmann believed that it was no coincidence the word digit means both a finger and any numeral.Rusconi et al. suggested that these two conditions co-occur because they are close in cortical territory. In their 2005 study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), they noted both <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> and acalculia in the test subjects when areas of the intraparietal sulcus were stimulated. They concluded that the areas underlying <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> and acalculia are extremely close to one another, but distinct. These areas receive blood from the same branch of the middle cerebral artery. Any damage to that blood supply would cause symptoms of both acalculia and <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lesions to {{the left}} angular gyrus are {{associated}} with <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> {{as well as the}} other symptoms of Gerstmann Syndrome, also known as Angular Gyrus Syndrome. In a study by Rusconi et al., repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was used in healthy individuals to simulate <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Stimulation to the intraparietal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus, as well as the left and right angular gyrus and posterior parietal areas caused difficulties in naming, recognizing, and distinguishing fingers.|$|E
50|$|Patients with <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{may have}} {{difficulty}} selectively moving fingers, regardless if it is by command or imitation. Others show an inability to name or point to others' fingers, or to show the same finger on the opposite hand. Persons with <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> are able to name and point to a finger when able to use visual guidance, but will have more errors than a person without the disorder. When their own hand is {{out of sight and}} they are asked to name a finger that was touched, they are unable to do so and perform at chance.|$|E
50|$|Destruction to the {{inferior}} parietal lobule {{of the dominant}} hemisphere results in Gerstmann's syndrome: right-to-left confusion, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> dysgraphia and dyslexia, dyscalculia, contralateral hemianopia, or lower quadrantanopia. Destruction to {{the inferior}} parietal lobule of the non-dominant hemisphere results in topographic memory loss, anosognosia, construction apraxia, dressing apraxia, contralateral sensory neglect, contralateral hemianopia, or lower quadrantanopia.|$|E
5000|$|Acalculia is {{associated}} with lesions of the parietal lobe (especially the angular gyrus) and the frontal lobe and can be an early sign of dementia. Acalculia is sometimes observed as a [...] "pure" [...] deficit, but is commonly observed {{as one of a}} constellation of symptoms, including agraphia, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> and right-left confusion, after damage to the left angular gyrus, known as Gerstmann's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Individuals with {{acalculia}} generally live normal lives, {{unless there}} are other disabilities or traumatic injuries present that prevent normal living. Details from a case study published in 2003 described the condition of a 55-year-old woman living with acalculia. [...] "In addition to writing and calculation deficits, both spelling and reading had declined. Lapses of memory occurred occasionally. Despite these deficits, daily living activities remained intact". Another case study published in 1990 described the condition and management of a former female accountant who had [...] "suffered a small circumscribed left parietal subdural hematoma in an auto accident." [...] She was able to speak, read, and write normally, but {{she was unable to}} perform simple addition past the number ten. The case study reports that the patient also demonstrated [...] "severe <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> and in fact the <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> appeared to be directly related to her inability to perform calculations." [...] The patient was somewhat able to manage her acalculia by visiting a therapist who worked with her specifically on finger recognition tasks, especially on finger calculations. This therapy raised her mathematical ability to a high school level after she received treatment for a number of months.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{screening}} procedures for acalculia include asking {{the patient to}} answer questions about order, conducting memory tests to rule out the possibility of a mental disorder, confrontation naming (naming parts of objects), reading tests, writing tests, calculation tests, finger naming, clock drawing, and left/right orientation testing. The writing tests, spelling tests, finger naming, and left/right orientation are all tests to confirm the presence of Gerstmann's syndrome. Acalculia is one out of four defining components of Gerstmann's syndrome; the other three components are agraphia, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> and right/left confusion. Typically, acalculia is present because of Gerstmann's syndrome or it is linked with other disorders. It is imperative to note that there is [...] "difficulty separating calculation disorders from disruptions in other domains". This is why testing functions besides calculation abilities is crucial for the screening of acalculia- so that other disorders can be ruled out. More extensive testing includes [...] "brain mapping techniques such as position emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and event related potentials (ERP), which have helped to illuminate some of the functional anatomical relationships for number processing".|$|E
50|$|Head and Holme's studies (1911) were {{developed}} alongside those of Arnold Pick (1851-1924), {{who was the}} first to describe autotopagnosia (1908) as the inability to locate body parts on command on a whole body structure.Pick noted those afflicted with autotopagnosia as having a dissociation between the capacity to recognize and name their own body part (as commanded by an examiner) and the inability to find the same body part on command. In a series of studies, Pick focused on patients who were unable to point to their own body parts and those of the examiner. His patients could however comprehend the body part terminology as well as locate them on a painted visual; however none had a clear demonstration of body specificity. Pick concluded a disturbance of “visual” body image and body awareness. Pick’s studies introduced autotopagnosia and other category specific agnosias, such as visual and tactile agnosia. Josef Gerstmann (1887-1969) first developed the term somatotopagnosia, meaning the lack of knowledge about the body space. Gerstmann studied patients whose deficits were in the body schema and thus lacked the ability to recognize, identify or name the fingers on either hand, a phenomenon known as <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> This particular ailment, known as Gerstmann syndrome, is often seen in patients with a lesion on their left angular gyrus, which is known to be frequently anatomically correlated with autotopagnosia.|$|E
40|$|Gerstmann’s {{syndrome}} {{includes the}} clinical tetrad of <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> agraphia, acalculia, and right–left confusion. Some disagreement remains {{with regard to}} the exact localization of the syndrome, but most probable it involves the left angular gyrus with a subcortical extension. Several authors have suggested that a defect in mental spatial rotations could simultaneously account for acalculia, right–left disorientation, and <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> It has been also suggested that semantic aphasia is always associated with acalculia; as a matter of fact, left angular gyrus has a significant involvement in semantic processing. In this paper, it is proposed that Gerstmann’s syndrome should include: acalculia, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> right–left disorientation, and semantic aphasia, but not agraphia. When the pathology extends toward the superior parietal gyrus, agra-phia can be found. A fundamental defect (i. e., an impairment in verbally mediated spatial operations) could explain these apparently unrelated clinical signs...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. <b>Finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> is a {{well-known}} consequence of particularly left inferior parietal lesions. Studies of <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> have shown that patients are impaired {{on a range of}} tasks, assessing explicit identification of individual fingers, but also implicit knowledge concerning finger differentiation (Ettlinger, 1963; Kinsbourne & Warrington, 1962). It is established that several perceptual deficits can also be observed as a developmental disorder. This is also the case for developmental Gerstmann syndrome, of which <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> is a constituent part (Kinsbourne & Warrington, 1963). However, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> as separate entity has received little attention in a healthy adult population. The current study aimed to assess possible deficits in finger recognition in healthy individuals. Methodology. Various finger gnosis tasks that have previously been used to identify <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> in neurological patients were applied (Kinsbourne & Warrington, 1962; Anema, et al., 2008). Moreover, performance on the finger identification tasks was related to body part identification and to left-right orientation, the latter being another component of Gerstmann syndrome. Sixty healthy adult participants were assessed. Results. Cronbach‟s alpha showed sufficient internal consistency between various subtests of finger gnosis, allowing construction of an overall measure of finger gnosis. 5 individuals (8, 3 %) performed outside the normal range (≤ 2 SD) on this measure. Moreover, finger gnosis correlated significantly with left-right orientation and body part identification. Conclusions. Finger gnosis problems in healthy adults may be more common than originally considered. It seems that these problems may be associated with reduced performance on left-right discrimination tasks...|$|E
40|$|A {{historical}} {{review of}} calculation abilities is presented. Counting, starting with finger sequencing, {{has been observed}} in different ancient and contemporary cultures, whereas number representation and arithmetic abilities are found only during the last 5000 – 6000 years. The rationale for selecting a base of ten in most numerical systems and the clinical association between acalculia and <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> are analyzed. <b>Finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> (as a restricted form of autotopagnosia), right–left discrimination disturbances, semantic aphasia, and acalculia are proposed to comprise a single neuropsychological syndrome associated with left angular gyrus damage. A classification of calculation disturbances resulting from brain damage is presented. It is emphasized that using historical/anthropological analysis, it becomes evident that acalculia, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> and disorders in right–left discrimination (as in general, {{in the use of}} spatial concepts) must constitute a single clinical syndrome, resulting from the disruption of some common brain activity and the impairment of common cognitive mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{case report}} presents a patient exhibiting Gerstmann syndrome accompanied by toe agnosia. A 72 year old right handed {{woman had a}} focal lesion in the angular gyrus of the left hemisphere which {{was caused by a}} glioblastoma multiforme. The first symptom she had complained of was severe headache. Standardised neuropsychological tests of intelligence, memory, attention, fluency, apraxia, and language functions as well as tests for the assessment of agraphia, acalculia, right-left disorientation, and digit agnosia were performed. The patient displayed all four symptoms of the Gerstmann syndrome—namely, agraphia, acalculia, right-left disorientation, and <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> The patient did not display aphasia, constructional apraxia, or any other neuropsychological impairment. In addition to the four symptoms of the Gerstmann syndrome an agnosia of the toes was found. Further studies should determine whether <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> in Gerstmann syndrome is usually accompanied by toe agnosia. <b>Finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{in the context of this}} syndrome may be better named digit agnosia. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken following {{a suggestion that}} <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> occurred after pre-frontal leucotomy. A preliminary investigation did not reveal the presence of <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> as des-cribed by Gerstmann (1924) but confirmed {{the existence of a}} post-operative difficulty in localizing tactile stimuli on the fingers. Accordingly, the present {{investigation was}} designed with the object of examining the extent and nature of this defect and {{in the hope that the}} nature of the errors would reveal something of the mechanism by which normal localization of tactile stimuli occurs.

40|$|Objective: <b>Finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{refers to}} the {{inability}} to discriminate one's fingers and is frequently associated with acalculia in the Gerstmann syndrome. This co-occurence of symptoms has been related to the helping role of fingers for counting but the cognitive components involved in <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> remain poorly documented. This study investigates the effect of attention allocation on <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Method: PM, a 54 -year-old patient with a right parietal lesion, showed signs of neglect and difficulties for calculating and recognizing his fingers. In addition to the neuropsychological examination, we measured speed and accuracy in tasks that required PM to move a finger in response to its name or to mentally solve addition and subtraction problems. His performance was compared {{to the performance of}} healthy participants matched for age and education. Results: The neuropsychological examination evidenced left neglect and difficulties to discriminate fingers of the left hand in tasks that put high demands on attention allocation. Finger recognition was slower for the left than for the right hand when the two hands were tested in the same block of trials, whereas no difference was observed when they were tested in separate blocks. In arithmetic tasks, PM took more time to solve subtraction than addition problems. Conclusions: We conclude that, in the present case, <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> is contingent on a spatial attention deficit. To account for the specific deficit of the patient in subtraction, we propose that subtracting a number involves shifting attention leftward on a visuospatial medium where numbers are represented from left to right...|$|E

40|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as an inability to explicitly individuate between the fingers, which is possibly due to fused neural representations of these fingers. Hence, are patients with <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> unable to keep tactile information perceived over several fingers separate? Here, we tested a finger agnosic patient (GO) on two tasks that measured the ability to keep tactile information simultaneously perceived by individual fingers separate. In experiment 1 GO performed a haptic search task, in which a target (the absence of a protruded line) needed to be identified among distracters (protruded lines). The lines were presented simultaneously to the fingertips of both hands. Similarly to the controls, her reaction time decreased when her fingers were aligned as compared to when her fingers were stretched and in an unaligned position. This suggests that she can keep tactile input from different fingers separate. In experiment two, GO was required to judge the position of a target tactile stimulus to the index finger, relatively to a reference tactile stimulus to the middle finger, both in fingers uncrossed and crossed position. GO was able to indicate the relative position of the target stimulus as well as healthy controls, which indicates {{that she was able to}} keep tactile information perceived by two neighbouring fingers separate. Interestingly, GO performed better as compared to the healthy controls in the finger crossed condition. Together, these results suggest the GO is able to implicitly distinguish between tactile information perceived by multiple fingers. We therefore conclude that <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> is not caused by minor disruptions of low-level somatosensory processing. These findings further underpin the idea of a selective impaired higher order body representation restricted to the fingers as underlying cause of <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia.</b> © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Patients with lesions of {{the left}} {{posterior}} parietal cortex commonly fail in identifying their fingers, a condition known as <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> yet are relatively unimpaired in sensation and skilled action. Such dissociations have traditionally been interpreted as evidence that structural body representations (BSR), such as the body structural description, are distinct from sensorimotor representations, such as the body schema. We investigated whether performance on tasks commonly used to assess <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> is modulated by changes in hand posture. We used the ‘in between’ test in which participants estimate the number of unstimulated fingers between two touched fingers or a localization task in which participants judge which two fingers were stimulated. Across blocks, the fingers were placed in three levels of splay. Judged finger numerosity was analysed, in Exp. 1 by direct report and in Exp. 2 as {{the actual number of}} fingers between the fingers named. In both experiments, judgments were greater when non-adjacent stimulated fingers were positioned far apart compared to when they were close together or touching, whereas judgements were unaltered when adjacent fingers were stimulated. This demonstrates that BSRs are not fixed, but are modulated by the real-time physical distances between body parts...|$|E

Clinical evidence was found for parietal lobe dysfunction in CRPS.

40|$|Introduction				 						 Body {{representation}} {{is a form}} of higher order somatosensory functioning containing multiple integrative processes in which information from different primary sensory modalities is integrated in a representation of the body. It is crucial for the conscious experience of the position and structure of our body parts and directing bodily movements. Disorders of body representation can affect the entire body or only specific body parts. The exact neurological substrate underlying body representation disorders remains unclear. The aim of the current study is to determine the neural substrate of body representation. Methodology											 In the present study we investigate in the neurological mechanisms underlying body representation-disorders in a sample of 17 first episode-stroke patients by linking neurological lesions with body representation disorders, i. e. <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia,</b> tactile localization impairments or left-right disorientation. Furthermore, the overlap and interplay between these impairments are mapped by using an advanced voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach. Results											 The voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis of the anatomical correlate related to left right disorientation showed that lesions significantly related to left right disorientation are mainly located in the right hemisphere, more specifically the nucleus caudatus, capsula externa and putamen. Analyses on <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> and tactile localization impairments gained no significant results, but a qualitative lesion subtraction analysis shows a trend that lesions related to these disorders are also mainly situated in the right hemisphere, more specifically the caudate nucleus, external capsule, putamen and frontal cortex.

40|$|THE {{concept of}} the body image as a {{tridimensional}} inner diagram each person has of his own body has proved of great value for the understand-ing {{of a variety of}} neurological and psychiatric disorders. The concept originated from the work of Pick (1908) and Head and Holmes (1911). Since Pick described the first case of anosognosia for hemiplegia in 1898, evidence has accumulated to indicate that the parietal lobes are the crucial links in the functional physiological chain concerned with the elaboration of the body image. Lesions of the right parietal lobe produce disordered awareness of the left half of the body, sometimes with delusional con-fabulations. Lesions of the left parietal lobe produce disorders which are bilateral in distribution. The commonest condition resulting from disease of the major parietal lobe is that described by Gerstmann, in which <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> is usually associated with acalculia, agraphia, loss of right-left discrimination, and constructional apraxia. Gerstmann (1942) believes that <b>finger</b> <b>agnosia</b> is a forme fruste of total autotopagnosia, or inability to identify or indicate any part of the body, and this, in his view, is produced by a lesion involving the "chief representation of the body schema " in the major parietal lobe. This condition is always manifested in a setting of severe intellectual defects, sometimes with clouded consciousness, which obscure the body image disorder and, according to Gerstmann, explain why it is so rarely encountered. Brain (1941) has suggested that the disorder which is obscured in this way by the associated aphasic, apractic and other agnostic symptoms, is a disordered awareness of the right body half, identical with that produced by right hemisphere lesions for the contralateral side. However, very few convincing cases of anosognosia for right hemiplegia, or other delusional beliefs concerning the right half of the body and produced by a lesion in a dominant left hemisphere, have so far been recorded (although the condition may, to a large extent, be diagnosed from the patient's behaviour). We are mainly concerned here with disorders of the body image pro...|$|E

This study examined three patients with a lesion of the angular gyrus with intact somatosensory processing, but with selectively disturbed finger identification (<b>finger</b> <b>agnosia).</b> These patients performed normally when pointing towards the touched finger on their own hand but failed to indicate this finger on a drawing of a hand or to name it.
