It is found that self-similar solutions appear as fixed {{points in the}} renormalization group transformation.

Based on the linear perturbation analysis of the self-similar solutions, we conclude that the self-similar evolution is stable as <b>explosive</b> gravitational <b>waves</b> under the condition of no incoming waves, while it is weakly unstable as collapsing gravitational waves. The result implies that self-similar solutions can describe the asymptotic behavior of more general solutions for exploding gravitational waves and thus extends the similarity hypothesis in general relativity from spherical symmetry to cylindrical symmetry.

Initially, the 40 cm long cylinder was filled with 4 % propane-air mixtures and ignited with a 1 kJ sparking energy until the maximum temperature near the ignition source reached 2400 / 3000 K. In the study, a 3 D numerical model was established by combining compressible four-step reduced propane oxidation reaction kinetics with the k-ω shear-stress transport (SST) turbulent model. In order to resolve the thin detonation wave front, a dynamically refined mesh near the high pressure gradient was adopted.

In this paper, in order to study the propagation law of an underground methane/air mixture <b>explosive</b> <b>wave,</b> and check the failure mode of a coal mine mobile refuge chamber, a full-sized underground tunnel model and a refuge chamber model have been established in ANSYS/LS-DYNA (LSTC, R 7. 0. 0, Livermore, CA, USA, 2014).

40|$|In the article, {{within the}} {{framework}} of the dynamic theory of elasticity, a mathematical model of the impact of seismic blast waves on rock mass is presented, including a working. The increase in the volume of mining operations in complex mining and geological conditions, taking into account the influence of the explosion energy, is closely connected with the analysis of the main parameters of the stress-strain state of the rock massif including a working. The latter leads to the need to determine the safe parameters of drilling and blasting operations that ensure the operational state of mining. The main danger in detonation of an explosive charge near an active working is a seismic <b>explosive</b> <b>wave</b> which characteristics are determined by the properties of soil and parameters of drilling and blasting operations. The determination of stress fields and displacement velocities in rock mass requires the use of a modern mathematical apparatus for its solution. For numerical solution of the given boundary value problem by the method of finite differences, an original calculation-difference scheme is constructed. The application of the splitting method for solving a two-dimensional boundary value problem is reduced to the solution of spatially one-dimensional differential equations. For the obtained numerical algorithm, an effective computational software has been developed. Numerical solutions of the model problem are given for the case when the shape of the working has a form of an ellipse...|$|E

Chorus emissions with rising tones are generated in all simulation runs {{except for the}} simulation assuming the lowest number density.

The spatial scale of the region where the observed <b>explosive</b> <b>wave</b> growth varies in each simulation run, corresponding to the difference of the wave amplitudes of reproduced chorus elements. We estimate the spatial scale hc, a measure of the spatial extent of the generation region derived from the nonlinear wave growth theory, using parameters of the simulation runs and find its consistency with the simulation results. We also analyze the energy spectra of reproduced chorus elements in the simulation results and find that the spectra of chorus are essentially different from those predicted by the linear growth rates in the frequency domain.
