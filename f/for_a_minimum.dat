5|$|Standard USB has {{a minimum}} rated {{lifetime}} of 1,500 cycles of insertion and removal, the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 cycles, and the newer Micro-USB and USB-C receptacles are both designed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal. To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was {{moved from the}} jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear.|$|E

5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E

5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He {{struck up a conversation}} with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{earned a}} spot in the 2007 Money in the Bank ladder match by {{defeating}} Sabu in an Extreme Rules match in a February episode of ECW on Sci Fi. At WrestleMania 23, Kennedy won the Money in the Bank ladder match, giving him the right to challenge any World Champion in WWE at any date up until WrestleMania XXIV. Kennedy announced on the April 30 episode of Raw that he would be cashing in his Money in the Bank championship opportunity at WrestleMania 24. On the May 7 episode of Raw, Kennedy, however, lost his Money in the Bank opportunity to Edge, losing mere moments after being struck with a monitor before the match began. Because of the injury Kennedy sustained during his match with Edge, it was revealed that his right triceps muscle tore off the bone and he would be out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of five to seven months. The injury, however, was not as serious, as the triceps tendon did not tear off the bone but was, in fact, a massive hematoma.|$|E
5|$|Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr.) are {{the current}} champions, having {{defeated}} Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia, Niebla Roja and Último Guerrero) {{to win the}} title on February 13, 2015. They are the 27th overall championship team and this is their first reign as a team. Místico and Valiente have previously held the championship with Máscara Dorada. 25 different teams have held the title, combining for 27 individual title reigns. Only two teams have held the title more than once, the first champions Los Infernales and the team of Héctor Garza, Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara. Black Warrior, Blue Panther and Dr. Wagner Jr. hold {{the record for the}} longest single reign of any team, but due to the uncertainty of when the championship was vacated it can only be verified that they held them <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of 1,141 days. Dr. Wagner Jr.'s four reigns combine to 2,051 days, the highest of any wrestler. Héctor Garza's five individual reigns is the record for the most reigns of any individual wrestler.

5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly.

Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E
