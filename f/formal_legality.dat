To modify either of these two is forbidden by article 9 of the Constitution. The term 'rechtsstaat' should not be understood merely formally, but substantively. The Constitutional Court confirmed this in its adjudications. As early as December 1993, it ruled: [...] "The Constitution accepts and respects the principle of legality {{as a part of the}} overall concept of 'rechtsstaat'; it does not merely link positive law to <b>formal</b> <b>legality,</b> it also subordinates the construction and application of legal norms to the substantive meaning of their content; it makes it a premise of law that it respects basic constitutive values of democratic society, and measures the application of legal norms by these values." ...|$|E

50|$|In Britain, the “Combination Act” of 1799 made labour unions “{{criminal}} conspiracies,” illegal until 1825, {{when the}} Act was finally repealed.

As the matter was never settled in the higher courts in this period we can only point to the general “indefinite area of toleration” for such combinations evidenced in the magistrates’ manuals for Upper Canada. W.C.

5000|$|As a Finnish peculiarity, the law may in {{some cases}} provide that a special, {{out-of-court}} appeal measure known as [...] "rectification request" [...] (oikaisuvaatimus) be taken before an administrative court may actually hear the case. The rectification request is lodged with the public authority (or private actor using public power) that made the original decision. By means of the request, the authority may double-check its decision (to rule out potential unintentionally incorrect application of law, spelling errors etc.) and possibly modify it, in order that an undisputedly unlawfully made decision need not be settled at court. The rectification process is regulated by the Administrative Procedure Act (434/2003). If the decision is not modified through rectification, an actual appeal may (in most cases) be lodged with the administrative court. That appeals process is regulated by the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (586/1996). On appeal, the administrative court reviews {{the legality of the}} decision of the authority. The appeal may usually be made by an involved person, or by another authority charged with the supervision of public interest in the matters of its jurisdiction. Depending on the type of the case and the laws involved, the review by the administrative court may cover only the <b>formal</b> <b>legality</b> of the authority's procedure, but it may extend to the actual appropriateness of the decision. If the authority in question is overturned, the administrative court issues a decision in the case or submits it back to the authority for further consideration of facts. If the appellant or the authority is discontent with the decision of the administrative court, it is possible to appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. The proceedings are chiefly written, but if the case requires, the administrative courts may conduct surveys, hold oral proceedings, hear witnesses, experts or involved parties, or receive opinions from other authorities.|$|E

40|$|What impact {{does the}} European Union (EU) {{have on the}} {{development}} of good governance in Romania? Does EU conditionality facilitate or hinder the transition towards good governance? This brief policy-oriented chapter argues that the EU’s promotion of good governance in Romania leads to some selective progress but, overall, to the persistence of bad governance. In particular, the paper shows that Romania’s process of Europeanisation has resulted in 1. some progress across three dimensions of governance (substantive legality, capacity and efficiency/effectiveness) but 2. regress in three others (<b>formal</b> <b>legality,</b> impartiality and coherence). In other words, reforms generate more substantive laws that are adapted to international/European standards (best practices), {{but at the same time}} the new laws become instable, incoherent (contradictory), hardly enforced and less general. In addition, reforms improve capacity (inputs) and partly efficiency (outputs) or effectiveness (outcomes) but undermine the procedural and structural aspects of government quality (impartiality, coherence), for instance through increased politicisation and fragmentation of the state structures. Overall, the analysis suggests that there is no transition towards good governance in Romania, despite selective progress...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In his seminal {{of war and}} law, David Kennedy {{demonstrates}} how the shift from formalism to realism {{can be observed in}} the evolution of the law of war. This shift, which can be characterized as a ‘‘deformalization’’ narrative of the law of war, is the main object of this chapter. More precisely, I argue that, especially in regard to the codification of relevant rules in jus contra bellum and in jus in bello, formalism must not be underestimated. On the one hand, the formalization narrative appears far more convincing than the deformalization one to understand the evolution of the law of war from the nineteenth century. Every time a war is waged, it leaves no doubt that a large range of actors will debate about its <b>formal</b> <b>legality.</b> On the other hand, formalism must not be overestimated. It provides only a strategy which can—or not, depending on the circumstances of the case at hand—be used to support or combat a war.

40|$|Presumption of {{a direct}} causal link between {{formalisation}} of property rights and economic productivity {{is back on the}} international development agenda. Belief in such a direct causal relationship had been abandoned in the early 1990 s, following four decades of land tenure reform experiments that failed to produce the anticipated efficiency results. The work of Hernando de Soto has provided the springboard for this revival. De Soto argues that formal property rights hold the key to poverty reduction by unlocking the capital potential of assets held informally by poor people. De Soto’s justifications of formal title do not differ much from justifications that were advanced for ambitious land tenure reforms in various sub-Saharan African countries, starting with Kenya in the 1950 s. Introduction of formal title in the African areas was seen as the key to solving problems of land degradation and improving agriculture by providing farmers with security of tenure that would create incentives for further investment in the land. This paper argues that there are five shortcomings in both the old and contemporary arguments for formalisation of land title. First, legality is constructed narrowly to mean only <b>formal</b> <b>legality.</b> Therefore legal pluralism is equated with extra-legality. Second, there is an underlying social evolutionist bias that presumes inevitability of the transition to private (conflated with individual) ownership as the destiny of all societies. Third, the presumed link between formal title and access to credit facilities has not been borne out by empirical evidence. Fourth, markets in land are understood narrowly to refer only to ’formal markets’. Fifth, the arguments in favour of formulisation of title as the means to secure tenure ignore the fact that formal title could also generate insecurity.

40|$|Sustained {{since the}} early history of Brazil, the {{mutually}} beneficial relationship between the state and elites has been perpetuated throughout the centuries {{to the detriment of the}} rights, freedoms and interests of the rest of the population. By analysing primary and secondary sources on Brazil's history, legal system, current affairs and general legal and political theory, as well as current and past domestic and international legal frameworks, this thesis highlights, in the case of Brazil, law's role in cementing social and economic inequality, mirroring society's class relations and providing the ruling classes with a tool for their continued socio-political-economic dominance, pinpointing the consolidation of their power on the development of a Coimbra-graduated consensually unified political elite during Brazil's formation as a nation-state. Political and social sciences' publications have concentrated on exploring Brazil's legal system's ingrained injustices, whilst Brazilian law research has been historically isolated from other sciences and unduly affected by the prejudices of the legal profession. This research links law with other disciplines by analysing the historical foundations of the inequities promoted by Brazil's legal system as well as presenting both a theoretical and a practical framework for change. Theoretically, a conception of the rule of law, suitable to explaining why the observance of <b>formal</b> <b>legality</b> has not promoted the convergence between the country's legal framework and its socio- political reality, is advanced. Importantly, such formulation offers an ideal that both matches Brazil's aspirations and is compatible with the Western liberal democratic ideals defining the international world order into which the country is increasingly willing to participate. Practically, the often neglected conditions for the implementation of the rule of law are established, providing Brazil with the conditions for a rupture with its elitist past and the imposition of limits on the government's exercise of power.

40|$|Extract] Fear by the propertied of the {{possibility}} of organised rebellion by the working classes inspired by the revolutionary spirit of France was the principle reason for the passing of the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 in Britain. There had been statutory regulation of employment relations in Britain before 1799, including combination acts for single trades, but the Combination Acts were the first statutory provisions to deal directly with the institution of trade unionism, albeit to suppress it. Although the Combination Acts were repealed in 1824 - 1825, trade unions did not gain a <b>formal</b> <b>legality</b> until the passing of the Trade Union Act 1871. Bills enacted in 1906, 1913 and 1927 completed the legislation - both protective and restrictive - that was in place when the British Colonial Office stepped up its encouragement of trade union ordinances in the territories for which it was responsible. Kerr et al. (1960) hypothesised from their 1950 s worldwide studies that industrialising countries would become more like each other. An inherent logic of industrialism would lead them to converge on a future of pluralistic industrialism. In the meantime, diversity could be explained, as well as by culture and the stage reached in the industrialization process, by the different ideologies of the industrializing elites. One class of industrialising elites was that of 'colonial administrators', another was 'revolutionary intellectuals', and another 'nationalist leaders'. Dore (1973), following his study of technologically similar manufacturing companies in Britain and Japan, modified the convergence thesis by suggesting that Japan had leapfrogged pluralistic industrialism and was itself the model for others' industrial futures. By being a 'late' developer Japan had more effectively than elsewhere adapted through 'welfare corporatism' the modern bureaucratic equivalent of paternalism. Regular Japanese employees enjoyed lifetime employment, age-based promotion and seniority wages. While these practices can be a source of rigidity (Dore, 1986) they encourage the incorporation of employees into the enterprise culture and result in strong employee commitment. It has been contended that these practices are a 'highly rational and effective means for inducing worker identification with the enterprise and for creating a highly skilled and pliable core of employees adaptable to rapid technological and organisational change' (Moore, 1987, page 143) ...|$|E
40|$|Students of {{the history}} of {{administrative}} law in the United States regard the antebellum era as one in which strict common law rules of official liability prevailed. Yet conventional accounts of the antebellum period often omit a key institutional feature. Under the system of private legislation in place at the time, federal government officers were free to petition Congress for the passage of a private bill appropriating money to reimburse the officer for personal liability imposed on the basis of actions taken in the line of duty. Captain Little, the officer involved in one oft-cited case, Little v. Barreme, pursued this avenue of indemnification successfully. As a result, the ultimate loss associated with that officer 2 ̆ 7 s good faith effort to enforce federal law fell on the government rather than on the officer himself. This paper fills out the picture of government accountability {{in the early nineteenth century}} by clarifying the practice of congressional indemnification. After identifying cases in which officers sought indemnity from Congress through a petition for private relief, we examine the way official liability, as administered by the courts, interacted with private legislation, as administered by Congress, to shape the incentives of government officers to comply with the law. We find that a practice of relatively routine indemnification took the sting out of sovereign immunity, a doctrine that key players— including James Madison and John Marshall—treated as thinly formalistic. We also find that Congress assumed responsibility for deciding when federal officers were entitled to indemnity for acts taken in the scope of employment. The antebellum system thus contrasts sharply with modern government accountability law. Jurists today tend to regard sovereign immunity as a barrier to relief, rather than a principle of forum allocation that preserves legislative primacy in the adoption of money bills. Moreover, courts today often refrain from deciding the question of <b>formal</b> <b>legality</b> in an effort to strike a proper balance between the victim 2 ̆ 7 s interest in accountability and the official 2 ̆ 7 s interest in immunity. Whatever the wisdom of the resulting body of qualified immunity law, the doctrine reflects judicial control of matters that the early republic had assigned to the legislative branch...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the European Union (EU) {{on the development of the}} rule of law in Central and Eastern Europe. The topic is addressed through a mixed methods study which consists of a quantitative comparative analysis of three country groups from Central and Eastern Europe (1. Central Europe and the Baltics, CEB; 2. South Eastern Europe, SEE; 3. Commonwealth of Independent States, CIS) and three qualitative case studies on Poland, Romania and Moldova. The empirical analysis is based on an innovative set of indicators and revealing insights from numerous qualitative interviews. The findings of the study suggest that {{the impact of the}} EU is differential, both healthy and pathological. While EU-driven judicial reforms increase judicial capacity and align domestic legislation with European and international standards (substantive legality), they do not improve and even lead to a deterioration of judicial impartiality and <b>formal</b> <b>legality,</b> resulting in several reform pathologies, such as instable, incoherent and non-enforced laws and in more politicized and incoherent judicial systems, which undermine the development of the rule of law. These pathological effects occur mostly in weak rule of law countries from SEE (Romania) and CIS (Moldova), in contrast to more healthy effects in advanced, strong rule of law countries from CEB (Poland). The dissimilar development in the rule of law across countries is explained in relation to the conduct of reforms. Successful reformers like Poland, which consolidate the rule of law, have strong and independent horizontal accountability institutions (e. g. Constitutional Court, Ombudsman, judiciary), which mitigate or alleviate reform pathologies and ensure that reforms are conducted in an accountable, gradual and non-politicized way. Unsuccessful reformers, like Romania and Moldova, lack these independent checks on reformers and thus fail to establish the rule of law. Based on the findings from the case studies an original typology of healthy and pathological reform paths is proposed, which draws on the logic of circular and cumulative causation and emphasizes the mutual reinforcement between domestic conditions and the reform approach of transnational coalitions. The proposed typology implies that EU conditionality is not transformative, but rather reinforces existing healthy and pathological reform paths, thus cementing the existing divergence in the rule of law across post-communist countries. This thesis further makes several policy recommendations to remedy the pathological impact of donor-driven reforms...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} discomfort with magistrates {{and the general public}} about alleged abuse by the defence of its procedural rights. This discomfort has led on the one hand to an appeal for sanctions in order to counter the perceived problem of ‘abuse of process’ {{and on the other hand}} to a diminishment or even abolishment of some procedural rights of the defence. It remains remarkably unclear however, which procedural behaviour of the defence effectively can be qualified as ‘abuse of procedural rights’ by the defence and moreover whether or to what extend the fundamental rights of the defence allow for a qualification of (some instances of) procedural behaviour of the defence as ‘abuse’. This doctoral thesis addresses this fundamental question in de context of Belgian criminal law. It reaches the conclusion that the qualification of procedural behaviour of the defence as a real form of ‘abuse of process’ only is possible to a very limited extend. Indeed, the analysis of Belgian criminal procedure suggests that within the plenitude of procedural hindrance by the defence, three types can nevertheless be identified. The first one is the ‘erroneous’ use of a procedural right, i. e. the use of a procedural right in circumstances where the defence clearly does not possess that right. The second one is the ‘illegitimate’ use of a procedural right, i. e. the use of a procedural right contrary to its ratio legis. The third one is the mere ‘harmful’ use of a procedural right, i. e. the use of a procedural right in a way which – given the specific circumstances of the case – disproportionally hinders the smooth course of justice compared to the benefits for the defence. Only the first type of hindrance can be qualified as real ‘abuse’ by the defence of its procedural rights. The qualification of the second one as abuse would run counter to the fundamental principle of the freedom of defence as it exists in inquisitorially oriented criminal procedures. The qualification of the third one as abuse would generally be contrary to the principle of legality in criminal matters. Furthermore, it addresses the issue of how to deal with procedural behaviour of the defence which can hinder the smooth course of justice. It reaches the conclusion that three reactions are possible. The first one is the restrictive interpretation of the existing procedural rights of the defence. This option however is limited by formal principles such as the principle of the separation of powers and the principle of <b>formal</b> <b>legality.</b> The second one is the neutralisation of the impact of disturbing defence behaviour on the smooth course of justice. The third one is the sanctioning of ‘abuse’ by the defence of its procedural rights with a procedural fine or even as a specific crime. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|According to Weber, the {{religious}} mind of Calvinists, {{influenced by the}} pastoral reformed idea of calling, became profit-intended and then brought directly the capitalistic life style as follows: (1) simplicity and uniformity; (2) profit-seeking by incessant labour at one's calling; (3) practical consumption corresponding the 'comforts' of citizen's home; (4) capital accumulation {{as a result of}} liberation of profit-seeking and of restraining consumption; (5) citizen's economic rationality. With these items, considered by Weber to compose the (modern) capitalistic spirit as an ideal-type, 'ideal' of course in the meaning of the logical completeness, we are not contented regarding the very point of their logical structure, especially the placement of item (1) and the relation of this to the others. The capitalistic spirit as a historical individuality was constructed at first as Puritan and then as changing historically itself to that seen in B. Franklin. The process proceeded towards gradual dismissal of {{the religious}} feature beginning with the moment of the strong lure of property, which was the outcome of the industriousness at calling labour with similar eminence also in the Medieval Catholic monkery. It was accelerated by the additional moment of the very labour at calling, which the modern capitalism, once established as a mechanical-machinery cosmos, enforced its habitants as necessity so long as they wanted to survive there. Thus the foundation of the spirit of capitalism was altered from Puritanism to Utilitarianism with the corresponding change in its ethic from Puritan asceticism to <b>formal</b> <b>legality</b> and after that even to sports with mere competitive passion as observed in America. We must note here that Weber, explaining the historical emergence of the spirit of (modern) capitalism, distinguishes the citizens with Puritan ethic and capitalistic spirit from the monopoly capitalists with Catholic ethic and adventurous, conscienceless spirit and/or possibly traditional spirit (both the enemies of modern capitalistic spirit) -this in contradiction to his earlier observation concerning the causal relation between modern capitalism and its spirits. In the course of transformation of the spirit of modern capitalism, we could find Fordism in U. S. A. as the one with slightly religious aspect still and several economic theories of business enterprise (Betriebswirt-schaftslehre) in Germany {{in the early years of}} the 20 th century as the ones with less or no religious feature and, even in Japan, alien country from the viewpoint of Christianity, that general theory of the ethos of modern capitalistic enterprise by S. Mohri as the one without any relation to Puritanism. Despite all the deviations in degrees and sorts from Puritan ethic, the spirits observed above have a specific core in common: profit-seeking through production of values-this we may call 'productive profit-seeking principle'; and we could call also its counterpart 'plunderous profit-seeking principle', which means profit-making through taking values away from value-producers and even from other value-plun-derers. The economic conditions nowadays are to be explained partly but decisively as the further change of the capitalistic spirit and the recovery of the precapitalistic spirit as plunderous profit-seeking principle...|$|E
40|$|The sects {{developed}} from the Baptistic movement, or briefly Baptistic Sects, are regarded by Weber as primary and positive in the doctrine as compared to Calvinism, while Pietism and Methodism are thought secondary and passive to Calvinism both in the doctrines and the ascetic ethics. One of the decisive characteristics of Baptistic Sects was just their 'sects' which mean the church originally invisible in heven concreted visible on earth by the genuine Christians with their voluntary will. And the doctrine of these sects was {{different from that of}} old Protestantism and also from that of Cathoricism. It was that the bless could be given only by the manifestation i. e. the work of God's spirit within one's soul; - the Renaissence of the pneumatic theory of early Christianism. There were two moments distinct in the religious mind of Baptistic Sects : (1) Bibliocracy and (2) waiting for the manifestation. The first generation of Baptistic Sects thought that only 'the awakened' were the 'brothers of Christ', because they were made of the spirit of God, and held the Bibliocracy in the meaning of esteem and acquirement {{of the way of the}} Apostl's life. This was accompanied with aversion to uninevitable intercourse with worldly life - difference from Calvinism - and with repugnance to any appreciation and worship of creature and so of worldly pleasure - alikeness to Calvinism. However, Baptistic Sects had another moment of religious mind strong enough to restrict its Bibliocracy. What had been revealed and described in the Bible was not all but a part of God's words and the words were to be manifested continuously from the past to the present, so that not only the Bible but also the revelation to each conscience of the believers was to be adored. This idea, which prized the 'subjective' conscience, led to complete the liberation from all the magics and so from the salvation by the church - to the same effect of Calvinism. Alikeness with Calvinism is also seen in the doctrine that the bless by God, once given, was never lost because this was the work of God and made the men free from all the sins, and, with some slight difference in this turn, that the bless was to be endowed not to all but to some i. e. to the limited number of 'the grown-up'. As well as in Calvinism, 'good deed' in Baptistic Sects was the inevit- able sign of one's blessed state; but the deed in the early Baptistic Sects was thought to be far from the worldly life and worked passively to the economic occupation. The ethical life in this sense was supposed to be needed in waiting for the manifestation; it meant the preparation for the revelation because the spirit of God spoke only to the soul soothed and cooled by the ethical deed. The idea of coolness was accepted in the minds of broad circle when Baptistic movement spreaded into the regular lives of the worldly occupations, and then the people with these occupations began to controll their very wordly lives by their conscience; - a notable change in the religious mind of Baptistic Sects, I think. The membership of the citizens pressed Baptistic Sects to proceed now on the soil of worldly asceticism prepared by Calvinism. This was forced also by the Protestant notion that asceticism in monkery was adoration of creature and anti-Bible, and stimulated by the rejection of politics and by the hostility to the aristcratic life style. Worldly asceticism in Baptistic Sects was activated more by the spontaneousness in Baptistic Sects which valued the free will of its members instead of the regulation by the church-police which persecuted people with close examination and oppressed their autonomy in asceticism. From all the observations above, Weber concludes that Baptistic Sects did not give any remarkably new contribution to the development of the idea of calling, and so are to be ignored at large in the following stages of his study. But we can not forget the moment of conscience which Baptistic Sects added to Calvinism and brought into the cool and <b>formal</b> <b>legality</b> of the Calvinistic mind some virtues of warmness as seen in B. Franklin...|$|E
