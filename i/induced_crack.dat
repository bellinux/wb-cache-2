50|$|This occurs where rapid {{corrosion}} {{occurs during}} crack propagation. Here {{the effect is}} to wedge a crack open during fatigue loading, due {{to the presence of}} corroded particles in the crack. And hence the effective stress required is lowered {{as in the case of}} fluid <b>induced</b> <b>crack</b> closure.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} found that crack closure due to surface {{roughness}} was influenced by grain size to a greater extend. The extent of crack closure was found to increase with increase in grain size, especially at low load ratios. Specimen type is also a factor influencing crack closure. Roughness <b>induced</b> <b>crack</b> closure is generally used to describe contact of faceted fracture features which are dimensionally small (of the order of grain size). However there are situations where crack closure can occur due to crack branching or deflection.|$|E

Ratios of hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> are presented, determined {{on the basis of}} metallographic examination, as well as the new hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> ratio determined {{on the basis of a}} static tensile test. A model allowing for an assessment of specimens behaviour with hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracks</b> has been proposed. This model allows to determine the relations between the HIC ratios proposed by NACE TMO 284 - 96 Standard (metallographic examinations) and the new HIC ratio proposed by authors which expresses the decrease of the plastic properties (contraction) of hydrogenated specimens in relation to non-hydrogenated specimens (strength tests). The presented model has been verified basing on the results of HIC tests of X 52, X 60, X 65, X 70 steels...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn ultra {{low carbon}} (ULC) steel was {{subjected}} to electrochemical hydrogen charging to provoke hydrogen induced damage in the material. The damage characteristics were analyzed for recrystallized, partially recrystallized, and cold deformed material. The goal {{of the study is}} to understand the effect of cold deformation on the hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> behavior of a material which is subjected to cathodic hydrogen charging. Additionally, charging conditions, i. e. charging time and current density, were varied in order to identify correlations between, on the one hand, crack initiation and propagation, and, on the other hand, the charging conditions. The obtained hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracks</b> were studied by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracks</b> were observed to propagate transgranularly, independently {{of the state of the}} material. Deformed samples were considerably more sensitive to hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracking,</b> which implies the important role of dislocations in hydrogen induced damage mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|Roughness <b>induced</b> <b>crack</b> closure is hence {{a result}} of {{slipping}} of crack faces leading to faceted crack morphology and is justifiable or valid when the roughness of the surface is of same order as the crack opening displacement. It is influenced by grain size, loading history,material mechanical properties and load ratio. Also, the slip of crack faces occur at low ΔK and R ratios. Ageing of the specimen also influences the crack closure. Comparing under aged and hyper overaged conditions crack closure due to roughness was greater in under aged specimens in which planar slip dominated.|$|E

Plasticity <b>Induced</b> <b>Crack</b> Closure (PICC) is an {{important}} fatigue phenomenon affecting crack growth under cyclic loading, which makes important to consider it {{in the design of}} components. In this paper a parametric study that correlates elastic-plastic material parameters with plasticity <b>induced</b> <b>crack</b> closure (PICC) is presented.

40|$|Present study {{focuses on}} the {{terminal}} penetration of tungsten heavy alloy (WHA) long rod penetrator impacted against armour steel at an impact velocity of 1600  m/s. The residual penetrator and armour steel target recovered after the ballistic test have been characterized using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). Metallurgical changes in target steel and WHA remnant have been analysed. Large shear stresses and shear localization have resulted in local failure and formation of erosion products. Severe plastic deformation acts as precursor for formation of adiabatic shear band (ASB) <b>induced</b> <b>cracks</b> in target steel.

40|$|The {{detection}} {{and location of}} hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracks</b> In steel pipes is unreliable and time consuming because of the unpredictable nature of the defect {{and the lack of}} sensitivity of conventional non destructive testing techniques. Determination of the susceptibility of steels to the formation of hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> by attack from a sour gas environment has always been based on laboratory testing of small samples where the samples are subjected to attack from all sides. This is unrealistic compared to the in-service situation and a single sided exposure test is more realistic. In this thesis the subject literature is reviewed. Experiments on small samples show that seamless steel is the least susceptible to hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracking,</b> whereas electric welded un directionally formed pipe is the most susceptible. The susceptibility of submerged arc welded pipe depends on the metallurgical form of the pipe but is always less susceptible than the electric welded pipe. Ultrasonic techniques have been used to detect the location of hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracks</b> but manual techniques are labour intensive and unreliable. Four complete pipes were subjected to a sour gas environment from one side, one of which was seamless and one electric welded. These pipes were monitored using a passive non destructive testing technique, acoustic emission. A mechanised ultrasonic scanner was used to examine the last two pipes found to be susceptible to cracking using a specially selected ultrasonic transducer. The acoustic emission data collected was used to detect and locate areas of high acoustic activity produced by the formation of hydrogen <b>Induced</b> <b>cracking.</b> These areas were examined metallographically and shown to include several forms of hydrogen <b>induced</b> <b>cracking.</b> The mechanised ultrasonic technique failed to detect near surface (< 1 mm) cracks, but was able to resolve mid wall affected areas. The seamless steel pipe was unaffected, whereas the electric welded pipe was severely affected by the sour gas environment. The automatic welded pipes suffered varying degrees of attack. This supports laboratory based experiments on small samples reported previously by other workers...|$|R

Baseline HIC and SOHIC {{tests were conducted}} in NACE TM 0284 - 96 solution A. For the SOHIC tests, four-point double beam specimens were stressed to 60 %, 80 % or 100 % of the yield strength of the steel in order to study the effect of applied stress. Test conditions included solutions containing 70 wt. % DGA and 500 ppm H 2 S to 0. 45 or higher mole-H 2 S/mole-DGA and temperatures of 25, 45 and 80 C. Corrosion rates of the steel were calculated from weight loss of the HIC specimens in order to compare {{the severity of the}} test environment with the actual service environment. Cracks were characterized in terms of crack length ratio (CLR), crack thickness ratio (CTR) and crack sensitivity ratio (CSR).

Keeping in view the importance of the local environment, two environment conditions were used; Lab Environment (Temperature 23 ± 2 o C) and the open environment of Riyadh. These environmental conditions were used taking into account the local environmental conditions. The samples were outside for almost one year and encountered all weather conditions of Riyadh.

40|$|In {{connection}} with the German continental deep drilling program KTB the state of earth crustal stress has been studied by analyzing induced core instabilities and borehole instabilities. Information are derived from bore-technically <b>induced</b> <b>cracks,</b> core disking structures and centerline fractures. Fracture structures in the drill core contain important information on the in situ state of stress, while the anisotropy of the horizontal stress is reflected by the morphology of the fracture structure. Core disking and wellbore breakouts point to high values of horizontal stress, which centerline fractures and bore-technically <b>induced</b> <b>cracks</b> are indicators for large differences in the horizontal stress. At a coincident appearance of core disking structures and <b>induced</b> <b>cracks,</b> {{the magnitude of the}} horizontal stress can be estimated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{case history}} {{describes}} the instrumentation {{of a house}} near an aggregate quarry to assess the effect of changes in blast design on the house response. Velocity response was measured for the superstructure as well as walls and ceilings. Micrometer response of three cracks was measured as well. In all some 11 velocity transducers and 3 crack sensors measured excitation and response for each blast. Dynamic response of these cracks was compared to various measures of ground and/or structure motion to determine those with the best correlation. Variations in the ground motion and air pressure wave (air blast) reflected changes in the blast design. In addition dynamic crack response was compared to the long-term, weather <b>induced</b> <b>crack</b> response {{as well as the}} changes in temperature and humidity that produced the response.

40|$|Conventional {{theories}} {{to describe and}} predict FCG {{are based on a}} SIF parameter, ΔK. If ΔK is used as similitude parameter to predict FCG, an R-effect arises. This R-effect can be accounted for by means of plasticity <b>induced</b> <b>crack</b> closure: A plastic wake behind the crack tip causes the crack to close before a zero tensile load is applied. As such ΔK is adapted to an effective ΔK, ΔKeff. If ΔKeff is used for similitude the R-effect disappears. These theories have recently been disputed and an alternative, SER dominated FCG description model has been proposed. This research discusses the confusion about using ΔK for similitude and approaches FCG also from a SER perspective. Experiments are designed and executed in air and vacuum environment to obtain a better understanding of fatigue, the R-effect and crack closure. The experimental results show that ΔK is an improper similitude parameter and that the R-effect is an artefact of choosing ΔK for similitude. Instead of that, fatigue should be approached from a SER perspective. Furthermore the research shows that the R-effect is not caused by (plasticity <b>induced)</b> <b>crack</b> closure.
