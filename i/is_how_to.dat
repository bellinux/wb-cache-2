5|$|A {{critical}} issue <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use}} of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} question which attracts {{the attention of}} engineers and mathematicians <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use the multi-output signals at the receiver to recover the multi-input signals at the transmitter. In Shang, Sun and Zhou (2007), sufficient and necessary conditions are established to guarantee the complete recovery of the multi-input signals.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{is always}} {{synthesized}} in the 5' to 3' direction.

50|$|For eight years, Alan Kay, Allen Cypher, and Smith {{worked closely}} {{together}} in the Advanced Technology Group {{to find a way}} <b>to</b> teach children <b>how</b> <b>to</b> program. During this project, they faced two main issues. The first issue <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> input programs without boring or overwhelming students and the second <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> understand <b>how</b> a program works once it is written. Their efforts were ultimately successful and they developed a system called KidSim (for Kids' Simulations). The system enabled children as young as preschoolers to program video games that other children could play.|$|R

25|$|All {{of these}} ideas speak to the crux of Plato's Problem, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> account for the gap between {{knowledge}} and limited experience. For some scientific and philosophical disciplines, {{the answer to this}} conundrum is innateness, or biological pre-wiring. Innate knowledge is what bridges the gap between the limited information one gleans from the environment (poverty of the stimulus) and one's actual knowledge.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the basic}} {{problems}} {{in the study of}} speech <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with the noise in the speech signal. This is shown by the difficulty that computer speech recognition systems have with recognizing human speech. These programs can do well at recognizing speech when they have been trained on a specific speaker's voice, and under quiet conditions. However, these systems often do poorly in more realistic listening situations where humans can understand speech without difficulty.|$|E
25|$|A {{special issue}} in {{representing}} Renaissance music <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with its characteristic free-flowing rhythms, which very often include syncopated notes crossing the modern bar boundaries. To avoid the {{excessive use of}} ties and {{to allow for a}} notation more closely reflecting the original, some editions will print bar lines not across the staves, but only in the intermediate spaces between them (a convention sometimes referred to by the German term Mensurstrich), allowing notes to be read as lasting across a bar line.|$|E
50|$|Several design {{problems}} presented themselves. The first <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> turn B Street NW into {{a ceremonial}} gateway. The second <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> link B Street NW with the bridge. This second problem was particularly important, because the Lincoln Memorial {{stood at the}} northeastern terminus of the proposed bridge. Third, the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway was being designed to terminate at the Lincoln Memorial as well. The parkway would also interact with the B Street approaches to the bridge.|$|R

25|$|The {{wearing of}} hijab in France {{has been a}} very {{controversial}} issue since 1989. The debate essentially concerns whether Muslim girls who choose to wear hijab may do so in state schools. A secondary issue <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> protect the free choice and other rights of young Muslim women who do not want the veil, but who may face strong pressure from families or traditionalists. Similar issues exist for civil servants and for acceptance of male Muslim medics in medical services.|$|E
25|$|One problem <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} {{the doctrine of}} anatta {{with the idea of}} karma and rebirth. The anatta-doctrine stipulates that there is no underlying self, while the idea of karma and rebirth seems to implicate an underlying essence that's being reborn. A solution to this problem was the proposition of the existence of karmic seeds. The karmic effects of the human deeds lie dormant, as seeds, until they germinate in this or a next life. Not an individual self, but these karmic seeds are the base for the generation of a following life.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Three â€“ The Caucus Race and a Long Tale: The sea {{of tears}} becomes crowded with other animals and birds {{that have been}} swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the {{question}} among them <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get dry again. The Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on William the Conqueror. A Dodo decides {{that the best thing}} to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem for}} the {{principal}} <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the agent is doing what the principal wants done. Agency theory predicts that if the costs of monitoring the agent are low, the principal will use intrusive methods of control. Intrusive methods include, for the executive branch, such things as inspections, reports, reviews of military plans, and detailed control of the budget, and for Congress, committee oversight hearings and requiring routine reports. For the military agent, if the likelihood that shirking will be detected by the civilian principal is high or if the perceived costs of being punished are too high, the likelihood of shirking is low.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} problem therefore <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{ensure that}} the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But {{it would seem that}} this must be achieved without organizing such response â€“ for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived {{in various parts of the}} social system.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E
