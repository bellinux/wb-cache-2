5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ <b>exonuclease</b> activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a genetic}} {{mutation}} {{at the level}} of nucleotide bases. Why and how frameshift mutations occur are continually being sought after. An environmental study, specifically the production of UV-induced frameshift mutations by DNA polymerases deficient in 3′ → 5′ <b>exonuclease</b> activity was done. The normal sequence 5′ GTC GTT TTA CAA 3′ was changed to GTC GTT T TTA CAA (MIDT) of GTC GTT C TTA CAA (MIDC) to study frameshifts. E. coli pol I Kf and T7 DNA polymerase mutant enzymes devoid of 3′ → 5′ <b>exonuclease</b> activity produce UV-induced revertants at higher frequency than did their <b>exonuclease</b> proficient counterparts. The data indicates that loss of proofreading activity increases the frequency of UV-induced frameshifts.|$|E
25|$|Werner {{syndrome}} {{is due to}} an inherited defect in an enzyme (a helicase and <b>exonuclease)</b> that acts in base excision repair of DNA (e.g. see Harrigan et al.).|$|E
50|$|DNA <b>exonucleases</b> have {{roles to}} play in DNA metabolism, such as: replication, repair, and recombination.|$|R
50|$|Exodeoxyribonucleases {{are both}} <b>exonucleases</b> and deoxyribonucleases. They {{catalyze}} digestion of {{the ends of}} linear DNA. They are a type of esterase. They are classified EC 3.1.11.|$|R
25|$|Polyadenylation tail: Creates a {{polyadenylation}} tail {{at the end}} of the transcribed pre-mRNA {{that protects}} the mRNA from <b>exonucleases</b> and ensures transcriptional and translational termination: stabilizes mRNA production.|$|R
25|$|Polymerase δ (Pol δ): Highly processive and has proofreading, 3'->5' <b>exonuclease</b> activity. In vivo, it is {{the main}} {{polymerase}} involved in both lagging strand and leading strand synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Polymerase ε (Pol ε): Highly processive and has proofreading, 3'->5' <b>exonuclease</b> activity. Highly {{related to}} pol δ, in vivo it {{functions}} mainly in error checking of pol δ.|$|E
25|$|Yellow fever {{is caused}} by the yellow fever virus, a 40– to 50-nm-wide enveloped RNA virus, the type species and namesake of the family Flaviviridae. It was the first illness shown to be {{transmissible}} by filtered human serum and transmitted by mosquitoes, by Walter Reed around 1900. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA is around 11,000 nucleotides long and has a single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein. Host proteases cut this polyprotein into three structural (C, prM, E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5); the enumeration corresponds to the arrangement of the protein coding genes in the genome. Minimal yellow fever virus (YFV) 3’UTR region is required for stalling of the host 5'-3' <b>exonuclease</b> XRN1. The UTR contains PKS3 pseudoknot structure which serves as a molecular signal to stall the <b>exonuclease</b> and is the only viral requirement for subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) production. The sfRNAs are a result of incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the <b>exonuclease</b> and are important for viral pathogenicity. Yellow fever belongs to the group of hemorrhagic fevers.|$|E
50|$|Generation of {{junctional}} diversity {{starts as}} the proteins, recombination activating gene-1 and -2 (RAG1 and RAG2), along with DNA repair proteins, such as Artemis, {{are responsible for}} single-stranded cleavage of the hairpin loops and addition {{of a series of}} palindromic, 'P' nucleotides. Subsequent to this, the enzyme, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), adds further random ‘N’ nucleotides. The newly synthesised strands anneal to one another, but mismatches are common. <b>Exonucleases</b> remove these unpaired nucleotides and the gaps are filled by DNA synthesis and repair machinery. <b>Exonucleases</b> may also cause shortening of this junction, however this process is still poorly understood.|$|R
50|$|One {{challenge}} {{associated with}} CFPS is {{the degradation of}} the DNA by endogenous nucleases in the cell extract. This is particularly problematic with LETs. Cells have endonucleases that attack random sites of a DNA strands, however much more common are the <b>exonucleases</b> which attack DNA from the ends. Since plasmids are circular and have no end for the <b>exonucleases</b> to attach to, they are not affected by the latter. LETs however are susceptible to both. Because of this, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS using plasmids.|$|R
50|$|Once HO {{cuts the}} DNA at MAT, <b>exonucleases</b> are {{attracted}} to the cut DNA ends and begin to degrade the DNA {{on both sides of}} the cut site. This DNA degradation by <b>exonucleases</b> eliminates the DNA which encoded the MAT allele; however, the resulting gap in the DNA is repaired by copying in the genetic information present at either HML or HMR, filling in a new allele of either the MATa or MATα gene. Thus, the silenced alleles of MATa and MATα present at HML and HMR serve as a source of genetic information to repair the HO-induced DNA damage at the active MAT locus.|$|R
25|$|Pre-mRNA {{sequence}} of miR-712 is {{generated from the}} murine ribosomal RN45s gene at the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2). XRN1 is an <b>exonuclease</b> that degrades the ITS2 region during processing of RN45s. Reduction of XRN1 under d-flow conditions therefore leads to the accumulation of miR-712.|$|E
25|$|Multiple DNA polymerases take on {{different}} {{roles in the}} DNA replication process. In E. coli, DNA Pol III is the polymerase enzyme primarily responsible for DNA replication. It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire replication cycle. In contrast, DNA Pol I is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol I has a 5' to 3' <b>exonuclease</b> activity {{in addition to its}} polymerase activity, and uses its <b>exonuclease</b> activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called nick translation. Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} is {{the inclusion of}} phosphorothioate bonds. In a phosphorothioate bond, one of the non-bridging oxygens between nucleotide bases is replaced with a sulfur atom, changing the chemical properties. This modification is necessary in oligo design because it results in decreased susceptibility to <b>exonuclease</b> degradation. At maximum, four of these bonds should be situated near the 5’ end of the oligo. Too many phosphorothioate bonds can be problematic; each modified site creates a chiral center, {{which can lead to}} a racemic mixture of isomers with varying characteristics and properties.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{in living}} cells, the storage {{can be turned}} active by enzymes. Light-gated protein domains fused to DNA {{processing}} enzymes are suitable for that task in vitro. Fluorescent <b>exonucleases</b> can transmit the output according to the nucleotide they have read.|$|R
5000|$|Enzymes used in decellularization {{treatments}} {{are used to}} break the bonds and interactions between nucleic acids, interacting cells through neighboring proteins, and other cellular components. Lipases, thermolysin, galactosidase, nucleases, and trypsin have all {{been used in the}} removal of cells. After a cell is lysed with a detergent, acid, physical pressure, etc., endonucleases and <b>exonucleases</b> can begin the degradation of the genetic material. Endonucleases cleave DNA and RNA in the middle of sequences. Benzoase, an endonuclease, produces multiple small nuclear fragments that can be further degraded and removed from the ECM scaffold. [...] <b>Exonucleases</b> act at the end of DNA sequences to cleave the phosphodiester bonds and further degrade the nucleic acid sequences.|$|R
50|$|Contamination of non-protein-bound DNA {{fragments}} {{can result}} in a high rate of false positives and negatives in ChIP experiments. The addition of <b>exonucleases</b> to the process not only improves resolution of binding-site calling, but removes contaminating DNA from the solution before sequencing.|$|R
25|$|Following {{creation}} of RNA primers by primase on the lagging strand, DNA polymerase δ synthesizes Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase δ also carries out a 3' to 5' <b>exonuclease</b> role, proofreading newly synthesized DNA strands during DNA replication. When the polymerase encounters an erroneous base pair, it removes {{one of the}} nucleotides and replaces it with a correct one. A third function of DNA polymerase δ is to supplement FEN1/RAD27 5' Flap Endonuclease activity. This includes preventing and removing the strand displacement of 5' flaps, and creating ligatable nicks at the border of Okazaki fragments.|$|E
25|$|Taq {{polymerase}} lacks a 3' to 5' <b>exonuclease</b> activity. Thus, Taq has no error-proof-reading activity, {{which consists}} of excision of any newly misincorporated nucleotide base from the nascent (i.e., extending) DNA strand that does not match with its opposite base in the complementary DNA strand. The lack in 3' to 5' proofreading of the Taq enzyme results in a high error rate (mutations per nucleotide per cycle) of approximately 1 in 10,000 bases, which affects the fidelity of the PCR, especially if errors occur early in the PCR with low amounts of starting material, causing accumulation of {{a large proportion of}} amplified DNA with incorrect sequence in the final product.|$|E
25|$|The λ-red recombineering {{system was}} {{published}} in 2000 and allows for insertion, deletion, or mutations to E. coli genes. In this system, the red operon from bacteriophage λ is transfected into E. coli cells to facilitate incorporation of linear target DNA into the E. coli genome. The bacteriophage λ-red operon consists of the exo, bet, and gam genes which, together, are responsible for recombineering. Phage λ <b>exonuclease</b> (exo) degrades transfected linear target DNA from the 5’ end. Beta binds to the resulting single stranded 3’ end and incorporates it into the target DNA to form the recombinant DNA. Phage λ gamma is necessary to inhibit E. coli nuclease activity and protect the transformed linear DNA in vivo.|$|E
50|$|E. coli {{does not}} have a 5'→3' {{degradation}} pathway. Its mRNA {{does not have}} 5' capped ends and there are not any 5'→3' <b>exonucleases</b> known. The same thing happens to other eubacteria, hence the 5'→3' degradation pathway could be an exclusive treat of eukaryotic cells.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two primary}} classifications {{based on the}} locus of activity. <b>Exonucleases</b> digest nucleic acids from the ends. Endonucleases act on regions {{in the middle of}} target molecules. They are further subcategorized as deoxyribonucleases and ribonucleases. The former acts on DNA, the latter on RNA.|$|R
40|$|Minimally {{modified}} oligonucleotides {{belong to}} the second-generation antisense class. They are phosphodiester oligonucleotides {{with a minimum of}} phosphorothioate linkages in order to be protected against serum and cel-lular <b>exonucleases</b> and endonucleases. They activate RNase H, have weak interactions with proteins, and have thus a better antisense efficiency. Two of them have been designed from an all-phosphorothioate antisense oli-gonucleotide directed against mdr 1 -expressing cells. They are protected against serum and cellular enzymatic degradation by the self-forming hairpin d(GCGAAGC) at their 39 -end and by judiciously located phosphoro-thioate residues, depending on the cellular composition in <b>exonucleases</b> or endonucleases. Besides their already demonstrated ability to cleave pyrimidine sites, endonucleases show some specificity for CpG sites. Their ac-tivity is hindered if specific sites are involved in secondary structure as hairpin...|$|R
500|$|Base {{excision}} repair (BER) repairs {{damage to a}} single nitrogenous base by deploying enzymes called glycosylases. These enzymes remove a single nitrogenous base to create an apurinic or apyrimidinic site (AP site). Enzymes called AP endonucleases nick the damaged DNA backbone at the AP site. DNA polymerase then removes the damaged region using its 5’ to 3’ [...] <b>exonuclease</b> activity and correctly synthesizes the new strand using the complementary strand as a template.|$|E
500|$|Mismatch repair {{systems are}} present in {{essentially}} all cells to correct errors that are not corrected by proofreading. These systems consist {{of at least two}} proteins. One detects the mismatch, and the other recruits an endonuclease that cleaves the newly synthesized DNA strand close to the region of damage. In E. coli , the proteins involved are the Mut class proteins. This is followed by removal of damaged region by an <b>exonuclease,</b> resynthesis by DNA polymerase, and nick sealing by DNA ligase.|$|E
2500|$|Apurinic/Apirimidinic (AP)-{{endonuclease}}s: [...] endonuclease IV (encoded by nfo gene) and <b>exonuclease</b> III (encoded by xth gene).|$|E
40|$|Using our {{new method}} for {{assaying}} DNases with radioactively labeled DNA bound to wells of plastic depression plates as substrate, we could distinguish between endonucleases and <b>exonucleases</b> and between haplotomic and diplotomic endonucleases. Oligonucleotides smaller than 30 detach from the DNA binding {{sites of the}} well into the reaction mixture. Thus, a lag period was evident before endonucleases produced small soluble oligonucleotides, while <b>exonucleases</b> released mononucleotides or short oligonucleotides without any lag period. Haplotomic and diplotomic endonucleases were detected because of the different rates in which they produce small soluble oligonucleotides which were expressed in different lag periods. Under conditions in which the haplotomic DNase 1 changes {{its mode of action}} to become a diplotomic enzyme, the shift was clearly detected by a change in the lag period in the well assay...|$|R
40|$|When a {{preparation}} containing the DNA of the bacteriophage φX 174 in its replicative form together with DNA from Escherichia coli is treated with <b>exonucleases,</b> the replicative form retains its characteristic physical properties, while the bacterial DNA is degraded. The {{evidence suggests that}} the mature replicative form exists as a closed ring...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli strains {{carrying}} null alleles {{of genes}} encoding single-strand-specific <b>exonucleases</b> ExoI and ExoVII display elevated frameshift mutation rates but not base substitution mutation rates. We characterized increased spontaneous frameshift mutation in ExoI− ExoVII− cells and report {{that some of}} this effect requires RecA, an inducible SOS DNA damage response, and the low-fidelity, SOS-induced DNA polymerase DinB/PolIV, which makes frameshift mutations preferentially. We also find that SOS is induced in ExoI− ExoVII− cells. The data imply a role for the single-stranded <b>exonucleases</b> in guarding the genome against mutagenesis by removing excess single-stranded DNA that, if left, leads to SOS induction and PolIV-dependent mutagenesis. Previous results implicated PolIV in E. coli mutagenesis specifically during starvation or antibiotic stresses. Our data imply that PolIV can also promote mutation in growing cells under genome stress due to excess single-stranded DNA...|$|R
2500|$|Several [...] "high-fidelity" [...] DNA polymerases, having {{engineered}} 3' to 5' <b>exonuclease</b> activity, {{have become}} available that permit more accurate amplification {{for use in}} PCRs for sequencing or cloning of products. [...] Examples of polymerases with 3' to 5' <b>exonuclease</b> activity include: KOD DNA polymerase, a recombinant form of Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1; Vent, which is extracted from Thermococcus litoralis; [...] Pfu DNA polymerase, which is extracted from Pyrococcus furiosus; and Pwo, which is extracted from Pyrococcus woesii.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the process}} of {{terminating}} transcription by Pol I and Pol II, the elongation complex does not dissolve immediately after the RNA is cleaved. The polymerase continues to move along the template, generating a second RNA molecule associated with the elongation complex. Two models have been proposed to explain how termination is achieved at last. [...] The allosteric model states that when transcription proceeds through the termination sequence, it causes disassembly of elongation factors and/or an assembly of termination factors that cause conformational changes of the elongation complex. [...] The torpedo model suggests that a 5' to 3' <b>exonuclease</b> degrades the second RNA as it emerges from the elongation complex. Polymerase is released as the highly processive <b>exonuclease</b> overtakes it. It is proposed that an emerging view will express a merge of these two models.|$|E
2500|$|The AP endonucleases cleave an AP site {{to yield}} a 3' {{hydroxyl}} adjacent to a 5' deoxyribosephosphate (dRP). [...] AP endonucleases are divided into two families based on their homology to the ancestral bacterial AP endonucleaes endonuclease IV and <b>exonuclease</b> III. [...] Many eukaryotes have members of both families, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which Apn1 is the EndoIV homolog and Apn2 is related to ExoIII. [...] In humans, two AP endonucleases, APEX1 and APEX2, have been identified. [...] It {{is a member of}} the ExoIII family.|$|E
25|$|These include 5' capping, {{which is}} set of enzymatic {{reactions}} that add 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end of pre-mRNA and thus protect the RNA from degradation by <b>exonucleases.</b> The m7G cap is then bound by cap binding complex heterodimer (CBC20/CBC80), which aids in mRNA export to cytoplasm and also protect the RNA from decapping.|$|R
25|$|Most tmRNAs are {{transcribed}} as larger precursors {{which are}} processed much like tRNA. Cleavage at the 5´ end is by ribonuclease P. Multiple <b>exonucleases</b> {{can participate in}} the processing of the 3´ end of tmRNA, although RNase T and RNase PH are most effective. Depending on the bacterial species, the 3'-CCA is either encoded or added by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase.|$|R
50|$|NdeI is a {{specific}} Type II restriction enzyme that cuts open specific target sequences, unlike <b>exonucleases.</b> This enzyme is used in gene cloning to cut open reading frames in the plasmid of certain bacteria such as E. coli and insert a foreign gene, such as the gfpuv gene that codes for bio fluorescence of the jelly fish Aequorea victoria.|$|R
