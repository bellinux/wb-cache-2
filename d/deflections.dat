40|$|<b>Deflection</b> routing {{has been}} well studied for optical {{networks}} with regular topologies. In this paper, we propose using <b>deflection</b> routing in the Internet and study its TCP performance. In particular, we show that when {{the difference between the}} delay of the <b>deflection</b> path and the shortest path (i. e., the <b>deflection</b> cost) is in a certain range, <b>deflection</b> routing can make almost full use of the free bandwidth in the <b>deflection</b> path and hence achieve substantial throughput improvement. In the worst case when the <b>deflection</b> cost is large, <b>deflection</b> routing can achieve an aggregate throughput no less than that without <b>deflection</b> routing. We analyze the underlying mechanisms of these characteristics. In order to extend the usefulness of <b>deflection</b> routing, we also propose a <b>deflection</b> routing scheme with adaptive <b>deflection</b> point and show via simulation that this scheme can achieve very high throughput as long as the <b>deflection</b> cost is no larger than a certain value. We show that <b>deflection</b> routing is friendly to the existing traffic in the <b>deflection</b> path. One possibly unfavorable requirement of <b>deflection</b> routing is that it should be enabled for either all or none of the flows contending for the same outgoing (congested) link...|$|R

50|$|Electrostatic <b>deflection</b> is {{very useful}} for small <b>deflection</b> angles but {{is well known}} to be {{inferior}} to magnetic <b>deflection</b> for deflecting a charged particle beam into large angles - say over 10 degrees. The reason is that <b>deflection</b> aberrations become large as the <b>deflection</b> angle increases. This reduces the ability to finely focus the beam. Also in electrostatic <b>deflection</b> {{it has long been}} the practice to inject the beam midway between the charged <b>deflection</b> plates so as to avoid the fringe fields as much as possible. However it was found by computation methods that <b>deflection</b> aberrations would be significantly reduced if the beam were injected offset toward the attracting plate. That way the beam tends to follow equipotentials and the <b>deflection</b> force is normal to the beam direction. Thus offset, all the electrons in the beam are deflected into the same angle. There is an induced astigmatism that is correctable. This <b>deflection</b> idea has been tested and verified. <b>Deflection</b> angles of 50 degrees are reportedly possible without measurable <b>deflection</b> aberration. Optimal injection offset is approximately 1/3 of the plate gap toward the deflecting plate. The useful beam diameter is also approximately 1/3 of the gap. See M. Retsky and R. Stein.

5|$|Hammond was {{selected}} for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman's body to create <b>deflections</b> that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, {{one of the first}} players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics with him on the outward journey. Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although he understood some of the reasons for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain {{and the rest of the}} team. It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.|$|E

Bismarck and Tirpitz were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder <b>deflections</b> as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E

5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive <b>deflections</b> from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
5|$|Collins was a keen gambler, a pastime {{that became}} {{habitual}} {{during his time}} as {{a soldier in the}} Great War. After the war, he played with the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team (AIF XI) that toured England, South Africa and Australia and was later appointed captain of the team. He was not a stylish or forceful batsman, preferring to rely on nudges and <b>deflections</b> to score runs. His slow left arm off-spin, bowled from a two step run up, was seldom seen after the AIF XI tour. On return to Australia, he made his Test début against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) scoring 104 in the second innings; the fifth Australian to score a century on Test début. He was appointed captain of the Australian team in 1921 in South Africa, when the previous captain, Warwick Armstrong, fell ill.|$|E
5|$|During the {{previous}} winter, England had played Australia in the controversial Bodyline series {{in which the}} English bowlers were accused of bowling {{the ball on the}} line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch <b>deflections</b> off the bat. The tactics were difficult for batsmen to counter and were designed to be intimidatory. In the 1933 English season, Bodyline was a sensitive subject. There had already been controversy in the tourists' match against the MCC, during which Constantine and Manny Martindale, another West Indian fast bowler, were criticised in the press for bowling short. Frustrated by a slow pitch which he believed was intended to neutralise his fast bowlers, Grant had ordered Constantine to bowl Bodyline against Yorkshire, and decided to repeat the tactics in the second Test. The West Indies scored 375, of which Constantine made 31. When England replied, several batsmen were discomfited by the Bodyline bowling; Wally Hammond was struck on the chin and retired hurt. Constantine and Martindale bowled up to four short deliveries each over so that the ball rose to head height; occasionally they bowled around the wicket.|$|E
40|$|<b>Deflection</b> {{angles of}} massive test {{particles}} moving along an unbound trajectory in the Schwarzschild metric are {{considered for the}} case of large <b>deflection.</b> We analytically consider the strong <b>deflection</b> limit, which is opposite to the commonly applied small <b>deflection</b> approximation and corresponds to the situation when a massive particle moves from infinity, makes several revolutions around a central object and goes to infinity.

5|$|In 1932–33 the English team, led by Douglas Jardine and jointly {{managed by}} Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet, toured Australia {{and won the}} Ashes in an acrimonious contest that {{became known as the}} Bodyline series. The English team used {{contentious}} bowling tactics where the English pace bowlers Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the ball roughly on the line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched, designed to rise at the batsman's body, with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch <b>deflections</b> off the bat. Intended to be intimidating, the tactics proved difficult for batsmen to counter and were physically threatening. The primary target of Bodyline was Donald Bradman, who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Leading English cricketers and administrators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932–33, and looked for possible weaknesses in his batting technique.|$|E

5|$|After {{starting}} all 16 {{games at}} outside cornerback in 2014, Munnerlyn settled into nickel back role, playing in all 16 regular season games with five starts {{as well as}} the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. He helped the Vikings defensive unit rank fifth in the NFL in defensive points allowed at 18.9 points per game, playing {{a key role in the}} Vikings winning the NFC North title over long-time reigning champs Green Bay Packers for the first time since 2009. In Week 10, he started the game at Oakland and posted a season-best 7 tackles against the Raiders. Four weeks later, he recorded seven solo tackles again in the loss at Arizona Cardinals on December 20. He posted his first sack as a Viking when he corralled Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers in Week 11. The following week, he got his first pick of the season when he intercepted Falcons' quarterback Matt Ryan. In the final game of the regular season against the Green Bay Packers for the NFC North title, the Vikings had a 13-3 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter. On a 3rd-and-12 play, Aaron Rodgers dropped back to his own 45-yard line to make a pass, but Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen got a hand on Rodgers' arm, causing him to fumble; Munnerlyn scooped up the ball at the 55-yard line and with blocking support from safety Andrew Sendejo and linebacker Anthony Barr, ran it all the way back for a touchdown (his first on a fumble recovery). Munnerlyn recorded 55 tackles, a sack, one fumble recovery for a touchdown, 2 interceptions, and 4 pass <b>deflections</b> in his second season in Minnesota.|$|E

New equipment was developed world-wide and analysis techniques moved towards utilising the full <b>deflection</b> basin in fundamental analysis procedures. This author addressed the problem of a proper description of the full <b>deflection</b> basin by doing a detailed literature survey on this subject. Various <b>deflection</b> basin parameters that describe the <b>deflection</b> basin are listed, as well as the various measuring apparatus related to them. The apparatus are all discussed in detail and related to the equipment available in South Africa. The measurement of <b>deflection</b> basins with the road surface deflectometer (RSD) under accelerated testing with the fleet of heavy vehicle simulators (HVSs) are described in detail. An improved data manipulation procedure is proposed which simplifies the calculation of all the <b>deflection</b> basin parameters found in literature. Various models to fit the measured <b>deflection</b> basins are also investigated in an effort to describe the <b>deflection</b> basin in full too. The measured <b>deflection</b> basin parameters of a bitumen, granular, cemented and light structured granular base pavement are discussed in detail as being tested with the fleet of HVS's. It is shown how the <b>deflection</b> basin parameters reflect the structural capacity of the various layers and behaviour states. A more accurate description of the behaviour states is made possible with the proposal of ranges for the various behaviour states for these <b>deflection</b> basins selected. A literature study was carried out to investigate the various analysis procedures that use measured <b>deflection</b> basins as basic input in the characterization of materials. On the basis of this study, linear elastic programmes were used to calculate effective elastic moduli for each pavement layer, using measured <b>deflection</b> basins as input. The possibility to relate typical distress determinants to measured <b>deflection</b> basins were investigated in the literature. Based on this, typical South African flexible pavement structures were analysed mechanistically and typical design curves were established for typical bitumen and. granular base pavements. The effect of overlays were investigated too, resulting in typical overlay design curves. In the final chapter the author endeavours to summarise the research by indicating how <b>deflection</b> basins can be measured and enhance the South African mechanistic rehabilitation design process.

The simulation {{results show that the}} free-end <b>deflection</b> is strongly dependent on the kinetic energy of the incident ions. At low incident energies (≪ 10 eV), the graphene film bends towards the irradiated side (upward <b>deflection</b> in our simulations); a transition from bending towards the irradiated side (upward <b>deflection)</b> to bending away from the irradiated side (downward <b>deflection)</b> occurs when the incident energy is ∼ 10 eV; the downward <b>deflection</b> peaks at ∼ 50 eV. Further increases of the incident energy cause the magnitude of downward <b>deflection</b> to decrease. The evolution of free-end <b>deflection</b> with respect to the number of incidences is also dependent on the incident energy. The dependence of the <b>deflection</b> behavior of the graphene films on the incident energy revealed by our atomistic simulations suggests the generation of intrinsic stress of different levels in the growing films.
