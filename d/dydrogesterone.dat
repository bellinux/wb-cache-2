25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> {{has been}} {{prescribed}} {{and used in}} over 10million pregnancies worldwide. There have been no harmful effects exhibited due {{to the use of}} <b>dydrogesterone</b> while pregnant. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> is safe to use during pregnancy only when prescribed and indicated by a medical practitioner. Studies have not shown any incidence of decreased fertility due to <b>dydrogesterone</b> at therapeutic dose. The Ames test found no evidence of any potential mutagenic or toxicity properties.|$|E
25|$|All the {{metabolites}} of <b>dydrogesterone</b> {{retain the}} 4,6-diene-3-one structure, and are metabolically stable. As such, <b>dydrogesterone</b> does not undergo aromatisation, {{which is consistent}} with its absence of estrogenic effects. Furthermore, <b>dydrogesterone</b> does not undergo 17α-hydroxylation, which may contribute to its lack of androgenic effects.|$|E
25|$|Oral <b>dydrogesterone</b> is {{effective}} drug, well tolerated and accepted among patients {{and can be}} considered for routine luteal support. Advantage of <b>dydrogesterone</b> is oral administration, easy to use and better patient compliance which results in high satisfaction score of oral <b>dydrogesterone</b> in luteal support of IVF/ICSI cycles.|$|E
25|$|In HRT, <b>dydrogesterone</b> is {{administered}} {{together with an}} estrogen. Therefore, the interaction between <b>dydrogesterone</b> and estrogens has been assessed, and no clinically significant interaction has been observed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> {{does not}} bind to the androgen, estrogen, and {{glucocorticoid}} receptors. As such, it is devoid of androgenic or antiandrogenic, estrogenic or antiestrogenic, and glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. Similarly to progesterone however, <b>dydrogesterone</b> binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and possesses antimineralocorticoid activity, but only weakly so. Due to its activity as a progestogen, <b>dydrogesterone</b> can produce antigonadotropic effects in animals. However, {{it does not}} suppress gonadotropin secretion or inhibit ovulation at typical clinical dosages in humans; dosages of <b>dydrogesterone</b> of 5 to 40mg/day fail to suppress ovulation (as assessed by urinary pregnanediol and laparotomy), and {{one study found that}} ovulation persisted even in women treated with a dosage as high as 400mg/day (assessed by visual inspection of the ovaries). The inability of <b>dydrogesterone</b> to prevent ovulation in humans is in contrast to all other marketed progestogens, including progesterone. Unlike progesterone, which forms sedative neurosteroid metabolites, <b>dydrogesterone</b> is not able to be metabolized in a similar way due to structural differences, and for this reason, is non-sedative.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is {{a highly}} {{selective}} progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of <b>dydrogesterone</b> for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, <b>dydrogesterone</b> is much more potent in comparison, with an equivalent dose, in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times {{lower than that of}} progesterone. This is due to pharmacokinetic differences between the two drugs, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with <b>dydrogesterone</b> as well as additional progestogenic activity of its metabolites. Although <b>dydrogesterone</b> binds to both isoforms of the PR and has similar activity as an agonist of the PRB as progesterone, its agonistic activity is weak {{in the case of the}} PRA. Hence, <b>dydrogesterone</b> shows selectivity for activation of the PRB. This could potentially confer a therapeutic advantage, as the two receptor isoforms induce different physiological responses in target tissues.|$|E
25|$|The progestational {{efficacy}} and potency of <b>dydrogesterone</b> {{was confirmed by}} standard test (i.e. delay of menses and induction of withdrawal bleeding). The benefits of estrogen or other target organs are not compromised by <b>dydrogesterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> has {{selective}} progestational {{activity and}} does not inhibit ovulation. The greater rigidity of <b>dydrogesterone</b> also positively affects its selectivity, while natural progesterone is less selective, existing in different conformations that more easily bind to different receptors. As a consequence of its better bioavailability and the progestational activity of its main metabolites (20-, 21- and 16-hydroxy derivatives), the equivalent dose of <b>dydrogesterone</b> is 10–20 times {{lower than that of}} oral micronized progesterone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> has {{predictable}} pharmacokinetics. The single-dose kinetics are linear in {{the oral}} dose range of 2.5–10mg. The pharmacokinetics do not change during repeated administration of up to 20mg <b>dydrogesterone</b> once daily. Steady state is attained after 3days of treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> {{is readily}} absorbed after oral administration. Tmax values vary between 0.5 and 2.5 hours. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> is {{virtually}} completely metabolized, which {{occurs in the}} liver. The primary reaction (metabolic) is the hydrogenation of the 20-keto group mainly by AKR1C1 {{and to a lesser}} extent AKR1C3, resulting in 20α-dihydrodydrogesterone (20α-DHD), which is a potent progestogen similarly to <b>dydrogesterone.</b> The levels of 20α-DHD, which is the main active metabolite, are also found to peak about 1.5 hours post-dose.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{amenorrhea}} is not {{a specific}} disease, but is instead a symptom. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> {{has been found to}} adequately induce bleeding within a sufficiently estrogen-primed endometrium. When estradiol levels are found to be low, <b>dydrogesterone</b> treatment is more effective when supplemented with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is characterised by progestational and PR-mediated antiestrogenic activity. This is {{demonstrated}} by its ability to induce a secretory transformation in the endometrium of immature or ovariectomised animals {{after they have been}} primed with estrogens (cf. the Clauberg test). The oral progestogenic potency of <b>dydrogesterone</b> is 20 times higher than that of progesterone.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{promotes}} endometrial cell {{growth and}} in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, estrogen monotherapy results in continued endometrial development without the physiological secretory changes normally {{brought on by}} progesterone. This action is {{associated with an increased}} incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Additional protection with progestogens is therefore important in patients with an intact uterus who receive estrogen replacement therapy. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> counters the proliferative effect of estrogens on the endometrium and ensures the transition to a secretory pattern and cyclical shedding of the endometrium in serial HRT regimes. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> effectively protects against the ontogenesis of endometrial hyperplasia. Unlike androgenic progestogens, <b>dydrogesterone</b> does not reverse the benefits brought on by 17β-oestradiol on lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. In a continuous, combined HRT regimen, <b>dydrogesterone</b> retards the proliferation of the endometrium so that it remains atrophic or inactive.|$|E
25|$|The mean {{terminal}} half-lives of DHD and <b>dydrogesterone</b> vary between 14–17 and 5–7hours, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{molecular}} structure is {{almost identical to}} that of natural progesterone, the unique design of <b>dydrogesterone</b> makes it a potent, orally active progestogen. In the <b>dydrogesterone</b> molecule, the hydrogen atom at carbon 9 is in the beta position and the methyl group at carbon 10 is in the alpha position – a reverse of the progesterone structure, hence the term 'retro' progesterone. Furthermore, it has a second double bond between carbon 6 and carbon 7 (the 4,6-dien-3-one configuration). These small differences in chemical structure account for the improved oral activity, metabolic stability, {{and the lack of}} estrogenic, androgenic, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid properties of <b>dydrogesterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{during the period from}} 1977 to 2005 around 38 million women were treated with <b>dydrogesterone</b> and that fetuses were exposed to <b>dydrogesterone</b> in utero in more than 10 million pregnancies. It has been approved in more than 100 countries worldwide. It is commercially marketed under the brand name Duphaston and manufactured by Abbott after it took over Solvay Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is {{used for}} luteal support in IVF protocols, for {{treatment}} of recurrent pregnancy loss.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is {{available}} widely throughout the world. It is marketed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, and Australia, {{but not in}} the United States, Canada, or New Zealand. The drug was previously available in the United States, but has since been discontinued in this country. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> is also available in elsewhere in Europe, as well as in Central and South America, Asia, and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is not {{converted}} into estrogen, {{and has no}} adverse estrogenic effects on fertility or sexual development.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> {{is used as}} an effective, orally active {{progestogen}} for gynecological conditions {{related to}} a wide variety of progesterone deficiencies in pregnant women. The molecular structure and pharmacological effects are somewhat similar to endogenous progesterone, although in smaller amounts it is found to be orally active. Its freedom from hormonal effects like those related to corticoid, androgenic, estrogenic, anabolic, and other effects gives <b>dydrogesterone</b> an advantage over other synthesized progestogens.|$|E
25|$|Endometriosis is {{a chronic}} disease {{which can cause}} severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, {{dyspareunia}} and infertility. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> relieves pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> is particularly suitable {{in cases where the}} woman desires to become pregnant and to prevent bleeding problems. <b>Dydrogesterone</b> results in statistically significant reductions in the symptoms pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia after the first treatment cycle for the treatment of post-laparoscopic endometriosis. The amount and duration of menstrual bleeding is also significantly reduced, and {{from the end of the}} third month onwards, bleeding was considered normal in the majority of patients. Improvement of endometriosis was observed in 71% of patients and cure in 21%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> {{has shown}} {{reasonable}} efficacy in relieving {{a number of}} premenstrual syndrome symptoms like mood swings & physical symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of retroprogesterone. It {{is also known}} as 6-dehydroretroprogesterone or as 9β,10α-pregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione.|$|E
25|$|These {{beneficial}} {{results are}} of particular relevance {{to the use of}} <b>dydrogesterone</b> in women who wish to become pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic {{treatment}} with low-dose (10mg/day) <b>dydrogesterone</b> {{has been found}} to be effective in the treatment of fibrocystic breast changes and associated mastodynia (breast pain).|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> {{has also}} been {{registered}} as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to counter-check {{the negative effects of}} unopposed estrogen on the endometrium in women with an intact uterus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is {{relatively}} safe and well tolerated, {{and does not}} exhibit the androgenic side effects that are common with some other progestins, like medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone.|$|E
25|$|Primary or {{essential}} dysmenorrhea is a {{very common}} gynecological phenomenon experienced by women during their reproductive years. Clinical studies have shown symptom relief {{and a reduction in}} pain with <b>dydrogesterone</b> treatment for dysmenorrhea.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} reported drug related adverse reactions of patients treated with <b>dydrogesterone</b> without estrogen treatment {{in clinical trials}} of indications are migraines, headaches, nausea, menstrual disorders and breast pain/tenderness, bloating or weight gain.|$|E
25|$|The {{plasma protein}} binding of <b>dydrogesterone</b> and 20α-DHD are unknown, {{but based on}} the plasma protein binding of other progestins, they are {{probably}} bound to albumin and not to sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, the FDA {{determined}} {{that there was}} no adequate evidence that progestogens (including progesterone, <b>dydrogesterone,</b> and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate) were effective in treating threatened abortion or preventing habitual abortion and withdrew approval for those indications.|$|E
25|$|In general, pregnane {{derivatives}} (progesterone, <b>dydrogesterone,</b> 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, etc.) do not virilize even in high dose; testosterone derivatives (ethisterone) and 19-nortestosterone (norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, etc.) generally virilize, {{but there}} are exceptions (e.g. noretynodrel) that do not.|$|E
25|$|Apart from a {{wide variety}} of {{medications}} in use to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding in patients with ovulatory cycles, oral progestogens like <b>dydrogesterone</b> have been found to be the most commonly prescribed as it has been found to prevent heavy bleeding.|$|E
25|$|After oral administration, it {{was found}} that plasma {{concentrations}} of 20α-DHD were substantially heightened than those of the primary drug. The ratios of 20α-DHD and <b>dydrogesterone</b> for AUC and Cmax are in the order of 40 and 25, respectively. Absolute bioavailability is on average 28%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is {{manufactured}} by treating progesterone with ultraviolet light, {{leading to a}} change in the spatial structure. It is produced from the plant steroids, Dioscorea mexicana, a plant of the yam family native to Mexico. Dioscorea contains a sterol called diosgenin. Diosgenin is converted to progesterone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dydrogesterone</b> is marketed mainly {{under the}} brand names Duphaston (alone) and Femoston (in {{combination}} with estradiol). It also is or has been marketed alone under the brand names Dabroston, Dufaston, Duvaron, Gestatron, Gynorest, Prodel, Retrone, and Terolut and {{in combination with}} estradiol under the brand names Climaston, Femaston, and Femphascyl.|$|E
