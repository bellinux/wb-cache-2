5|$|With a {{characteristic}} flair for creating publicity, the Air Corps' General Headquarters Air Force (its combat organization) not only successfully made the interception at sea, but exploited both live radio news coverage and dramatic photographs.

Roosevelt and future Army Chief of Staff <b>George</b> <b>C.</b> Marshall became new proponents of long-range air power.|$|E

5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when <b>George</b> <b>C.</b> Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan {{played a central role}} in the drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Walker was {{promoted}} to brigadier general and transferred to the Southwest Pacific, where he became Commanding General, V Bomber Command, Fifth Air Force. The Southwest Pacific contained few strategic targets, relegating the bombers {{to the role of}} interdicting supply lines and supporting the ground forces. This resulted in a doctrinal clash between Walker and Lieutenant General <b>George</b> <b>C.</b> Kenney, an attack aviator, over the proper method of employing bombers. Walker frequently flew combat missions over New Guinea, for which he received the Silver Star. On 5 January 1943, he was shot down and killed leading a daylight bombing raid over Rabaul, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, Groves sent Furman to Britain {{to discuss}} the {{establishment}} of a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project with the British government, and to confer over coordinating the intelligence effort. Lieutenant Commander Eric Welsh, the head of the Norwegian Section of MI6, was unimpressed with Furman's grasp of the subject matter. Groves selected the head of the Manhattan District's security activities, Captain Horace K. Calvert, as head of the London Liaison Office, with the title of Assistant Military Attaché. Working in cooperation with Welsh and Michael Perrin from Tube Alloys, the London Liaison Office consisted of Calvert, Captain <b>George</b> <b>C.</b> Davis, two Women's Army Corps clerks and three CIC agents.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} the president's wishes, matters of policy were {{restricted}} to the president, Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General <b>George</b> <b>C.</b> Marshall. To implement this, the S-1 Section was placed outside NDRC, directly under Bush, who could authorize purchases. Harold D. Smith, {{the director of the}} Bureau of the Budget, gave Bush assurances that should OSRD resources prove insufficient, additional funding would be made available from monies controlled by the president.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} January 1939, when U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a public {{statement}} calling for {{an expansion of the}} Air Corps in anticipation of the coming of World War II and the needs of the United States in defending the Western Hemisphere, that Army policy was reversed. Gen. <b>George</b> <b>C.</b> Marshall, who was soon to move up from head of the War Plans Division to be the Army's chief of staff, received personal instruction on the capabilities and strengths of long-range bombers from new Air Corps chief Gen. Henry H. Arnold.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{established}} {{a close relationship}} with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, and was probably the second most-powerful person in the country after the prime minister, although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had been imposed upon them. MacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces, and in August 1942 selected Major General <b>George</b> <b>C.</b> Kenney to replace him. Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's troops would prove crucial.|$|E
