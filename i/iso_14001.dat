In contrast, weak regulatory institutions make export-oriented and foreign-owned firms more likely to seek ISO certification, but render firms facing high levels of regulatory pressure less likely to do so.

In January 2013 Econovate became fully funded to set up its first demonstration plant capable of producing up to 1.5m blocks a year which expected to achieve certification by October 2015. The company has tested the product at UKAS register testing houses for 18 rigours test such as fire, strength, moisture movement, acoustics, thermal, durability and others toward the product certification. This certification by LABC was achieved in dec 2015. The company was also in the process of achieving <b>ISO</b> 9001, <b>14001,</b> 18001 and BS eN 6001 (responsible sourcing).

The difference between the two will be the amount of fibre within the mixture and this can range between 55% to 79%. The more strength the less fibre thus less thermal.

The petroleum industry in Zamrud fields has received <b>14001</b> <b>ISO</b> Certificate on Environmental Management System. The production sharing contract between CPI and the Government of Indonesia expired in August 2002 Methods:. This case study describes how CPI managed the development  of oil and gas production and compared to  the environmental management system for  petroleum industries  that should be taken  in the Zamrud conservation areas. Results: A number of specific measures were employed by CPI  to protect this sensitive area including a green seismic project, zero-discharge drilling, water management, preservation of nature and regular monitoring and impact assessment. There are two  important points that should be in consideration  for the environmental management system by CPI in the Zamrud areas, including top soil utilization to maintain biological and nutrients quality and re-vegetation in all areas of significant disturbances. Conclusion: oil and gas  exploration and production in conservation areas has to be managed through high commitment to good environmental  and social practices.
