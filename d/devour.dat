5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her hand, with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and <b>devour</b> them in her dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. Less often, they attacked and ate adults; {{they were able to}} find a hidden human by smell.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators {{of black}} bean aphids include both adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and the larvae of hoverflies. Certain species of tiny {{parasitic}} wasps {{lay their eggs}} inside aphids and the developing wasp larvae <b>devour</b> their hosts from inside. Members of the wasp genera Diaeretiella and Lysiphlebus behave in this way and may provide a measure of control of the aphids.|$|E

5|$|Reptile's Fatalities in Mortal Kombat II {{consist of}} {{revealing}} his reptilian face {{in order to}} <b>devour</b> the opponent's head, or turning invisible and severing the opponent's torso. Later finishing moves expand upon the concept, ranging from regurgitating acid upon the opponent to leaping upon their body and gnawing the flesh from their skulls. In a series retrospective, the Mortal Kombat development team named Reptile's finishers as some of their favorites from the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{voracious}} {{adults have}} very broad diets, including insects such as crickets, larvae, mosquito wrigglers, dragonflies, earthworms, cockroaches, flies, and grasshoppers. They are also known to eat freshwater crayfish and slugs, and other frogs, {{even of the}} same species. They have a strong tendency for cannibalism, and frequently these in the same enclosure <b>devour</b> each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown cannibalism also occurs in the wild.|$|E
5|$|In the two Grand Punk Railroad novels, set during late 1931, {{the pair}} receive {{a letter from}} Ennis and decide to visit her in Manhattan. To buy her a gift, they create a plan to rob a train, but instead steal money from the Russo family and make their escape aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express train. There, they befriend gangsters Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone and the immortal boy Czeslaw Meyer. They tell {{the legend of the}} Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, causing Jacuzzi to leave in a panic. Shortly after, the train is hijacked and they escape in the confusion. Later, the duo {{discover}} the conductors' mutilated bodies. Believing that the story of the Rail Tracer has come true, they assume Jacuzzi has also been eaten, only to discover otherwise. Isaac and Miria make up their minds to ask the Rail Tracer to leave, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation and how dangerous the Rail Tracer is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to <b>devour</b> him, the boy decides to <b>devour</b> them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they never bought Ennis a present and tell her their gift is Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E

5|$|Krimibhojana/Krimibhaksha (worm-food): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it {{is where}} a person who does not share his food with guests, elders, {{children}} or the gods, and selfishly eats it alone, and he who eats without performing the five yajnas (panchayajna) is chastised. The Vishnu Purana states that one who loathes his father, Brahmins or the gods and who destroys jewels is punished here. This hell is a 100,000 yojana lake filled with worms. The sinful person is reduced to a worm, who feeds on other worms, who in turn <b>devour</b> his body for 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Lately, Cookie {{has also}} taught {{children}} {{the importance of}} eating a balanced diet. This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} <b>devour.</b> This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually <b>devour</b> their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata, {{the great}} Hindu epic, narrates: a dog, {{with the help}} of a Rishi (sage) assumes various animal forms - {{starting}} from a dog to a tiger then to an elephant followed by a lion and a sharabha - terrorized every one in the hermitage of the Rishi. Eventually, Sharabha assumed a further fiercer form. In this fierce form he wanted to <b>devour</b> the Rishi. The Rishi then narrating the process of change in Sharabha’s development, as a result of his benevolence, cursed Sharabha to go back to his original form of a dog. The epic does not relate Shiva to Sharabha.|$|E
5|$|The Survey Corps, {{losing all}} will {{to follow the}} current government, stage a {{successful}} rebellion to overthrow the monarchy, culminating {{with the death of}} Rod by the hands of his own daughter, who becomes the new queen. It is then revealed that the Reiss Family was responsible for the creation of the walls 100 years ago using the Coordinate, which was stolen by Eren's father Grisha, who then transferred it to Eren's body by turning him into a Titan before allowing his son to <b>devour</b> him.|$|E
5|$|The fly Ormia ochracea {{has very}} acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The {{developing}} larvae burrow inside any crickets {{with which they}} come in contact {{and in the course}} of a week or so, <b>devour</b> what remains of the host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at that time of year, the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for <b>Devoured</b> has been predominantly positive, {{and the film}} has received praise from multiple horror review websites. Opinions were polarized on the film's pacing, which some reviewers felt could deter some viewers while others saw it as adding to the movie's overall feel. We Got This Covered gave <b>Devoured</b> {{four out of five}} stars and wrote [...] "From magnificent production to all around tantalizing psychological horror, <b>Devoured</b> will surely give you a good haunting, as well as present enough substance to take a hearty bite out of along the way." ...|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely <b>devour</b> their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae <b>devour</b> their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|In Matsya Purana, Shiva {{had created}} seven Matrikas {{to combat the}} demon Andhaka, who {{had the ability to}} {{duplicate}} from each drop of his blood that falls from him when he is wounded. The Matrikas drink up his blood and help Shiva defeat the demon. After the battle, the Matrikas begin a rampage of destruction by starting to <b>devour</b> other gods, demons and peoples of the world. Narasimha, Vishnu's man-lion incarnation, creates a host of thirty-two benign goddesses who calm down the terrible, fire-breathing Matrikas. Narasimha commanded the Matrikas to protect the world, instead of destroying it and thus be worshipped by mankind. At the end of the episode, Shiva's terrible form Bhairava is enshrined with the images of the Matrikas at the place where the battle took place. This story is retold in Vishnudharmottara Purana. Vishnudharmottara Purana further relates them with vices or inauspicious emotions like envy, pride, anger etc.|$|E
