25|$|In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, a {{handshake}} took place to prevent both switches from colliding by dialing {{calls on the}} same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches stepped through {{a handshake}} protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would send a signal to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> call and the remote switch would reply with an acknowledgment {{to go ahead with}} dial pulsing. This was done with relay logic and discrete electronics.|$|E

25|$|Summerall {{told the}} rest of CBS crew to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{roll-out}} pass, because without any timeouts remaining a failed run play would end the game. Landry would say he expected a rollout pass attempt because an incompletion would stop the clock and allow the Packers one more play on fourth down, either for a touchdown (to win) or a field goal attempt (to tie and send the game into overtime). But Green Bay's pass protection on the slick field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.|$|E
500|$|Around 8:30 on {{the morning}} of 11 September 2001, the Otis Air Base Operations Center {{received}} a call from the Federal Aviation Administration's Cape Cod Facility Calls Operations Center that it might be receiving a call from the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Northeast Air Defense Sector. The manager of the Cape Cod facility then called the 102d at Otis Air National Guard Base as they figured [...] "...a call [...] will be coming from NEADS soon and a scramble order is likely." [...] He called the base because he figured that the pilots would appreciate the heads up. When he called the Otis operations center, the superintendent of aviation management, Mark Rose, answered. He was initially confused by the call as no identification was given. Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy was then handed the phone and alerted of the situation. On his radio, he called pilot Major Daniel Nash, the pilot who was sharing alert duty, and told him to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> coming alert call. He also told him to suit up and <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> scramble call.|$|E
500|$|The game's difficulty, {{especially}} {{the complexity of}} the VS System ruleset, was described as a potential barrier for gamers. [...] PALGN said [...] "Even though there are a handful of in-game tutorials, they aren’t entirely utilised efficiently as they’re basically just a big slab of text making the game less friendly towards a wider audience." [...] GamesRadar's Eric Bratcher said [...] "If you aren't familiar with the source, <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very steep learning curve." [...] One X-Play reviewer commented that the game's tutorial [...] "might {{go down in history as}} the worst in-game tutorial ever created," [...] and another said that gamers who would be most interested in the video game would already be avid players of the physical version.|$|E

Everybody else, <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bizarre soap opera/pageant, {{consisting}} of a succession of static scenes with characters loping into the frame to announce exactly what they're thinking." [...] Digital Spy gave the film 2 stars out of 5, praising Kristen Stewart for [...] "carrying the film on her shoulders and, once again, bringing plenty of soul to a character who might otherwise come across as self-indulgent", but was critical of its lack of action, ultimately calling it [...] "a draining experience". Roger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of 4 and said that it [...] "takes the tepid achievement of Twilight, guts it, and leaves it for undead." [...] Richard Roeper graded New Moon with a C− and called it a [...] "plodding, achingly slow, 130-minute chapter in the saga".|$|E
500|$|Robert Ignizio of the Cleveland Scene {{described}} The Twilight Saga: New Moon as an [...] "entertaining fantasy", {{and noted}} that it [...] "has a stronger visual look [...] and does a better job with its action scenes while still keeping {{the focus on the}} central love triangle." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film two and half stars out of four, praised Kristen Stewart's performance in the film and wrote: [...] "Despite melodrama that, at times, is enough to induce diabetes, there's enough wolf whistle in this sexy, scary romp to please anyone." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grading and said, [...] "the movie looks tremendous, the dialogue works, there are numerous well placed jokes, the acting is on point." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle responded with a more mixed review, stating, [...] "xpect this film to satisfy its fans.

[...] The release of the movie has also inspired feminist criticism, with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly making light of the claim that Edward Cullen is little better than a stalker. In any case, the influx of female viewers into the theaters indicates the increasing importance of the female demographic in dictating Hollywood's tastes.|$|E
