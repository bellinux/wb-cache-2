5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him {{tips on how to}} give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E
25|$|Swimming {{butterfly}} {{is difficult}} if the core is not utilized, and correct timing and body movement makes swimming butterfly much easier. The body moves in a wave-like fashion, {{controlled by the}} core, and as the chest is pressed down, the hips go up, and the posterior breaks the water surface and transfers into a fluid kick. During the push phase, the chest <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the hips are at their lowest position. In this style, the second pulse in the cycle is stronger than the first pulse, as the second pulse is more in flow with the body movement.|$|E

Ekins, who doubled for McQueen in The Great Escape sequence where McQueen's character jumps over a barbed wire fence on a motorcycle, lays one {{down in front of}} a skidding truck during the Bullitt chase. The Mustang’s interior rear view mirror <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down depending on who is driving: when the mirror is up, McQueen is visible behind the wheel, when it is down, a stunt man is driving.|$|E
500|$|St Paul's {{became the}} place to go to hear the latest news of current affairs, war, religion, {{parliament}} and the court. In his play Englishmen for my Money, William Haughton (d. 1605) described Paul's walk as a kind of [...] "open house" [...] filled with a [...] "great store of company that do nothing but <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, and make a grumbling together".|$|R

25|$|The {{rebalancing}} and re-indexing of leveraged ETFs {{may have}} considerable costs when markets are volatile. The rebalancing {{problem is that}} the fund manager incurs trading losses because he needs to buy when the index <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sell when the index goes down in order to maintain a fixed leverage ratio. A 2.5% daily change in the index will for example reduce value of a -2x bear fund by about 0.18% per day, which means that {{about a third of the}} fund may be wasted in trading losses within a year (1-(1-0.18%)252=36.5%). Investors may however circumvent this problem by buying or writing futures directly, accepting a varying leverage ratio. A more reasonable estimate of daily market changes is 0.5%, which leads to a 2.6% yearly loss of principal in a 3x leveraged fund.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> over the westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings {{were used in the}} outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
500|$|Yolanda is {{the third}} oldest and most imaginative of the four girls. She plays the most {{important}} role in the novel as Alvarez's alter ego. She is a schoolteacher, a poet and a writer. Her nicknames, which reflect and represent the different aspects of her personality, consist of [...] "Joe", [...] "Yosita", [...] "Yoyo" [...] and simply [...] "Yo", which is also the title of the sequel to How the García Girls Lost Their Accents. Each of these nicknames are the product of one of Yolanda's multiple personalities. There is important significance in her character as [...] "Yo", Spanish first person pronoun, the [...] "I" [...] of the narrator. The nickname [...] "Yoyo" [...] is reminiscent of the toy that <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, back and forth, similar to Yolanda’s bouncing from culture to culture, from one extreme to the other. The last, [...] "Joe" [...] represents the American version of Yolanda. Her ultimate return to the Island [...] "represents her desire to displace herself from the North American Joe to the Yolanda of her family and youth." [...] These nicknames [...] "act to properly define and name the many diverse facets of her complex personality". [...] Her character is that whose voice and words are most frequently heard throughout the novel; she is the most developed character and her identity is the most explored of the four girls.|$|E

500|$|Like other fantasy novels, the Septimus Heap {{series is}} set in an {{imaginary}} world. Maps are provided {{in all of the}} books. Magyk contains a map of the Castle and its surroundings to the Port in the south. An enlarged map of the Castle is also included. Flyte has a map showing the Badlands and the Borderlands in the north. Physik has an enlarged map of the Castle with more details showing the Alchemie chambers. Queste has a map for the House of Foryx, drawn by Snorri for Marcellus. Syren keeps the past maps but adds the isles of Syren. The map in Syren also mentions that the country that Septimus lives in is called [...] "The Small Wet Country Across the Sea". Darke has a map similar to that in Magyk, however, instead of including Marram Marshes which are south of the castle, it includes a map of the Darke Halls, bleak creek and the bottomless whirlpool. It also includes an enlarged map of the castle. At the end of Fyre, Septimus writes in the snow that the date is [...] 4 July 12,004. The book ends with a quote from Arthur C Clarke: [...] "Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology is Indistinguishable from Magyk"., hinting that the series {{is set in}} the far future. This also hinted at by a dialogue between Lucy Gringe and Wolf Boy in Syren about the Red Tube. Wolf Boy says he has heard stories that people used to travel to the moon in things like that. Lucy dismisses this, however, it's apparent they are talking about Apollo moon missions. [...] Hints that the story is set in the future also reveal themselves when Septimus and the possessed Syrah enter a chamber that <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down with the press of a button, indicating that they used an elevator.|$|E

I don't want to live thinking about how I'll be remembered" [...] by Mexican people claiming indifference about his position on Forbes list of the world's richest people. He has {{said he has no}} interest in becoming the world's richest person. When asked to explain his sudden increase in wealth at a press conference soon after Forbes annual rankings were published, he said, [...] "The stock market <b>goes</b> <b>up...</b> <b>and</b> down", and noted that his fortune could quickly drop.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, petrol {{sniffing}} now occurs widely throughout remote Aboriginal {{communities in}} the Northern Territory, Western Australia, northern parts of South Australia and Queensland. The number of people sniffing petrol <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down over time as young people experiment or sniff occasionally. [...] "Boss", or chronic, sniffers may {{move in and out}} of communities; they are often responsible for encouraging young people to take it up. In 2005, the Government of Australia and BP Australia began the usage of opal fuel in remote areas prone to petrol sniffing. Opal is a non-sniffable fuel (which is much less likely to cause a high) and has made a difference in some indigenous communities.|$|E
2500|$|Some ballast {{resistors}} {{have the}} property of increasing in resistance as current through them increases, and decreasing in resistance as current decreases. Physically, some such devices are often built quite like incandescent lamps. Like the tungsten filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp, if current increases, the ballast resistor gets hotter, its resistance <b>goes</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> its voltage drop increases. If current decreases, the ballast resistor gets colder, its resistance drops, and the voltage drop decreases. Therefore, the ballast resistor reduces variations in current, despite variations in applied voltage or changes {{in the rest of}} an electric circuit. These devices are sometimes called [...] "barretters" [...] and were used in the series heating circuits of 1930s to 1960s AC/DC radio and TV home receivers.|$|E

[...] Trump clarified, [...] "Yes, even my own feelings {{as to where}} the world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day. Then you have a September 11th, and you don't feel so good about yourself and you don't feel so good about the world and you don't feel so good about New York City. Then you have a year later, and the city is as hot as a pistol. Even months after {{that it was a}} different feeling. So yeah, even my own feelings affect my value to myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, {{estimates}} of the GCV's weight, depending on armor packages, put the General Dynamics entry vehicle at 64–70 tons, and the BAE Systems entry vehicle at 70–84 tons. This made the planned infantry fighting vehicle designs heavier than the M1 Abrams tank. The reason was the vehicle had to have enough armor to protect a squad of nine troops from all battlefield threats (from rocket-propelled grenades to [...] IEDs) as good as or better than other vehicles can protect against specific threats individually. [...] This worked against the vehicle; as weight increases, cost <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> maneuverability goes down. The contractors worked to bring the weight down. The Army maintained that heavy armor was needed to protect the squad from acceleration forces that come with an underside blast, and that thicker underbelly plates and [...] V-shaped hulls do not give enough protection. [...] More armor would come from the vehicle being larger for more internal space for the soldiers, and to allow for features such as floating floors for blast deflection and extra headroom. [...] The Army also said heavy weight would not affect deployability because the Bradley it was planned replace already requires [...] strategic airlift transport aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Needing a band, {{he called}} {{childhood}} friend and songwriter/guitarist Ron Elliott, who recruited drummer John Petersen, rhythm guitarist/singer Declan Mulligan, and bassist Ron Meagher. Victor Savant, later to achieve fame in Europe as musical director for schlager singer Roberto Blanco, {{was in the}} band {{for a brief period}} as a pianist, but never recorded with the band. The gig led to a more lucrative deal at the Morocco Room, a club in nearby San Mateo, California. Meanwhile, San Francisco disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell were looking for new acts to bring to their fledgling Autumn Records label. Donahue and Mitchell wanted to capitalize on the Beatlemania craze that originated the previous year in the UK and was spreading across the U.S. by this time. Rich Romanello, owner of the Morocco Room and the Brummels' first manager, asked Donahue and Mitchell to see the band perform at the club. Romanello recalled, [...] "There were maybe four people in the place, and they set up and started playing, and that old hair on my arm <b>goes</b> <b>up.</b> <b>And</b> when the hair on your arm goes up, you got something. It was a big change, to go from saxophones and black singers to a white guitar sound, but I hired 'em." ...|$|E

2500|$|A July 2015 {{campaign}} press release, issued {{one month}} after Trump announced his presidential run, said that the FEC filing [...] "was not designed {{for a man of}} Mr. Trump's massive wealth" [...] and that his [...] "net worth is in excess of [...] ". However, Trump has testified that [...] "my net worth fluctuates, and it <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings—even my own feelings." [...] On the same day, Trump's own stated estimates of his net worth have varied by as much as $3.3 billion. Trump has also acknowledged that past exaggerated estimates of his wealth have been [...] "good for financing". Forbes has said that although Trump [...] "shares a lot of information with us that helps us get to the figures we publish," [...] he [...] "consistently pushes for a higher net worth—especially {{when it comes to the}} value of his personal brand." [...] Forbes reduced its estimate of Trump's net worth by $125million following Trump's controversial 2015 remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants, which ended Trump's business contracts with NBCUniversal, Univision, Macy's, Serta, PVH Corporation, and Perfumania. An internal Young & Rubicam study of Trump's brand among high-income consumers showed [...] "plummeting" [...] ratings for traits such as [...] "prestigious", [...] "upper class", and [...] "glamorous" [...] at the end of 2015, suggesting that Trump's various businesses could face market difficulties and financing challenges in the future.|$|E
