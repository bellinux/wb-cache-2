40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the physical, chemical, {{physiological}} and microbiological changes during the flow chart of fresh-cut strawberry. Strawberry cvs. Camarosa, Dover and Tudla, derived from experimental area of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, were selected by color (red ¾) and absence of wound. Afterwards, the minimal processing was evaluated, as follows: fast cooling, water and ice, removal of the calyx followed by conservation at 5 ± 0. 5 °C and 90 - 95 % RH for 13 days, sanitation, <b>drainage,</b> <b>cut</b> in halves. Removal of the calyx did not result significant difference for fresh weight, total soluble solids, total titratable acidity, pH and ratio TSS/TTA. The rapid cooling resulted in lower electrolyte leakage and respiratory rate, especially sanitized fruits. Sanitization by immersion in chlorine solution slowed the growth of fungi and yeast. Drainage for 20 minutes eliminated practically all water {{on the surface of}} the fruits. The fresh-cutting did not affect the visual and nutritional quality of strawberries like appearance, microbiot, vitamin C, anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, consisting of alternative market potential economically viable...|$|E

50|$|Simi Valley borders the Santa Susana Mountains to {{the north}} and Simi Hills to the east and south. The valley covers an area of about 62 square miles in {{southern}} Ventura County, bordering the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County. The Santa Clara River Valley occupies the northwestern corner of the valley. Mountainous terrain of South Mountain and Oak Ridge characterizes the northern and central area. Elevation within the quadrangle ranges from about 250 feet along the arroyo bottoms to over 2200 feet. Steep, highly dissected slopes form much of the boundary of the area. In the southeast, Little Simi Valley, drained by Arroyo Simi/Arroyo Las Posas, separates the southern flank of Oak Ridge from the Las Posas Hills. The Las Posas upland area, a broad elevated region that slopes gently to the south, separates the South Mountain-Oak Ridge highlands from the Las Posas-Camarillo Hills between Little Simi Valley on the east and the Oxnard Plain on the west. This relatively low-lying area is also referred to as the Las Posas Valley. Numerous north-south-trending <b>drainages</b> <b>cut</b> South Mountain and Oak Ridge creating steep narrow canyons on north-facing slopes and wide flat-bottomed canyons with incised streams on south-facing slopes. A network of residential streets and ranch and oilfield roads that traverse the area from U.S. Highway 101 and State Highways 118, 23, and 126 provides access to the area. Current land use includes citrus and avocado orchards, oil well drilling and production, sand and gravel quarries, decorative-rock quarries, cattle grazing, suburban residential development, and golf courses. The oldest geologic unit mapped in the Simi Valley quadrangle is the upper Eocene to lower Miocene Sespe Formation. The Sespe Formation consists of alluvial fan and floodplain deposits of interbedded pebble-cobble conglomerate, massive to thick-bedded sandstone, and thin-bedded siltstone and clay-stone. In {{the northern part of the}} map area, Sespe Formation is overlain by and inter-fingers with the upper Oligocene to lower Miocene Vaqueros Formation that is composed of transitional and marine sandstone, siltstone, and claystone with local sandy coquina beds. In the Las Posas Hills, Sespe Formation is unconformably overlain by marine sandstones of the middle Miocene Topanga Group that are interlayered with and intruded by basalt flows, breccia, and diabase dikes of the Conejo Volcanics.|$|R

6000|$|Telford was now growing an old man.

His later days were passed in deserved honour and comparative opulence; for though never an avaricious man, and always anxious to rate his services at their lowest worth, he had gathered together a considerable fortune by the way, almost without seeking it. To the last, his happy cheerful disposition enabled him to go on labouring at the numerous schemes by which he hoped to benefit the world of workers; and so much cheerfulness was surely well earned {{by a man who}} could himself look back upon so good a record of work done for the welfare of humanity. At last, on the 2nd of September, 1834, his quiet and valuable life came gently to a close, in the seventy-eighth year of his age. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, and few of the men who sleep within that great national temple more richly deserve the honour than the Westerkirk shepherd-boy. For Thomas Telford's life was not merely one of worldly success; it was still more pre-eminently one of noble ends and public usefulness. Many working men have raised themselves by their own exertions to a position of wealth and dignity far surpassing his; few indeed have conferred so many benefits upon untold thousands of their fellow-men. It is impossible, even now, to travel in any part of England, Wales, or Scotland, without coming across innumerable memorials of Telford's great and useful life; impossible to read the full record of his labours without finding that numberless structures we have long admired for their beauty or utility, owe their origin to the honourable, upright, hardworking, thorough-going, journeyman mason of the quiet little Eskdale village. Whether we go into the drained fens of Lincolnshire, or traverse the broad roads of the rugged Snowdon region; whether we turn to St. Katharine's Docks in London, or to the wide quays of Dundee and those of Aberdeen; whether we sail beneath the Menai suspension bridge at Bangor, or drive over the lofty arches that rise sheer from the precipitous river gorge at Cartland, we meet everywhere the lasting traces of that inventive and ingenious brain. And yet, what lad could ever have started in the world under apparently more hopeless circumstances than widow Janet Telford's penniless orphan shepherd-boy Tam, in the bleakest and most remote of all the lonely border valleys of southern Scotland? ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{variation}} of the geochemistry of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the tropical estuarine system composed of the adjacent Piraquê-Açu and Piraquê-Mirim (ES) rivers using SPM sampled with sediment traps (45 µm mesh) installed in the drainage channels. We collected SPM during different tidal stages and seasonal periods and analysed the metals using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry according to EPA 3051 A, the mineralogy using X-ray diffraction, the particle size using laser ray diffraction, and organic matter (OM) using calcination. The traps collected enough SPM to perform analyses for each sampling period. The SPM consists of silt size particles, and the percentage of OM is between 20 and 40 %. The particles are dominated by kaolinite and quartz, and gibbsite, haematite, goethite, and pyrite are also present. These materials are found in the Barreiras Formation, through which the <b>drainage</b> system <b>cuts.</b> The metal concentrations were higher in the summer: Al (3208. 32 g kg- 1), Pb (28. 05 mg kg- 1), Mn (676. 35 mg kg- 1), Cr (136. 12 mg kg- 1), and Cu (13. 76 mg kg- 1). The Piraquê-Açu River had higher metal concentrations than the Piraquê-Mirim River, and the geochemical indices of both rivers indicate that they naturally contribute to the estuarine system of the Piraquê-Açu and Piraquê-Mirim rivers (SEPAPM).

40|$|Permeable {{interlocking}} {{concrete pavements}} (PICP) {{are specifically designed}} to remove sediment and other pollutants from stormwater runoff. Over time, {{this can lead to}} clogging of the PICP system. Previous research has shown that much of the clogging occurs on the bedding aggregate directly below the paving joints, while the remainder of the aggregate is unaffected. This paper describes a proof of concept study to delay the effects of clogging by making more efficient use of the bedding aggregate used in PICP systems. Lateral <b>drainage</b> slots were <b>cut</b> into the underside of PICP blocks to allow sediment-laden stormwater to access, and be filtered by, a greater surface area of bedding aggregate. Eight different slot designs were trialed in the study to determine which of the slot designs made the most efficient use of the bedding aggregate to filter the sediment from the stormwater. The study results demonstrated that the eight drainage slot designs deposited between 25 % and 366 % more sediment (by weight) beneath the pavers than the control pavement. The results of the study suggest that PICP systems with drainage slots cast into their bases would take much longer to clog than unmodified pavers, thereby proving the concept of this study...|$|R
