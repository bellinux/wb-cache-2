25|$|By June 8, 1951, a {{total of}} 74 human runs had been made on the <b>decelerator,</b> 19 with the {{subjects}} in the backward position, and 55 in the forward position.

25|$|By {{riding the}} <b>decelerator</b> sled himself, in his 29th and last ride at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Stapp {{demonstrated}} {{that a human}} can withstand at least 46.2 g (in the forward position, with adequate harnessing). This is the highest known acceleration voluntarily encountered by a human, set on December 10, 1954. Stapp reached a speed of , which broke the land speed record and made him the fastest man on earth. Stapp believed that the tolerance of humans to acceleration {{had not yet been}} reached in tests.

25|$|Stapp's {{research}} on the <b>decelerator</b> had profound implications for both civilian and military aviation. For instance, the backward-facing seat concept, which was known before, was given great impetus by the officer's crash research program. It proved beyond a doubt that this position was the safest for aircraft passengers and required little harness support. Also, that a human can withstand much greater deceleration than in the forward position. As a result, many Military Air Transport Service (MATS) aircraft in USAF and carrier on-board delivery aircraft in USN were equipped or retrofitted {{with this type of}} seat. Commercial airlines were made aware of these findings, but still use forward-facing seats. The British Royal Air Force also installed it on many of their military transport aircraft.|$|E

40|$|On 14 January 2004, NASA {{received}} {{a mandate to}} return astronauts to the Moon, evolve a sustained presence there, then head out into the solar system to Mars and perhaps beyond. This new space exploration initiative directs NASA to develop human and robotic technologies that can deliver payloads larger than Apollo to the Moon, to Mars, and bring astronauts and samples safely back to Earth at costs much lower than Apollo. These challenges require creative aerospace systems. On proposed technology for safely delivering payloads {{to the surface of}} Mars and returning samples to Earth involves deployed flexible and inflatable <b>decelerators</b> for atmospheric entry. Because inflatable <b>decelerators</b> provide the entry vehicle more drag surface area at smaller mass than traditional ablative devices, this class of <b>decelerators</b> can potentially accomodate larger mass payloads. The flexibility of these lightweight aeroshells can pose both vehicle and aeroelastic stability problems if not properly designed for the expected flight regimes. Computational tools need to be developed for modelling the large and nonlinear deformations of these highly flexible structures. Unlike wind tunnel testing, an integrated and efficient aeroelastic analysis tool can explore the entire flight environment. This paper will provide some background on flexible deployable <b>decelerators,</b> survey the current state of technology and outline the proposed development of an aeroelastic analysis and capability...|$|R

40|$|Characteristics of {{the impacts}} su!ered by the fruit on a {{transfer}} point of an experimental fruit packing line were analysed. The transfer {{is made up}} by two transporting belts at di!erent heights forming an angle of 903. These transfer points are very common in fruit packing lines, in which fruits receive two impacts: the "rst onto the belt base and the second into the lateral plate. Diferent tests were carried out to study the e!ect of transfer height, velocity, belt structure and padding on the acceleration values recorded by an instrumental sphere (IS 100). Results showed that transfer height and belt structure a!ect mainly impact values on the belt base, and padding a!ects mainly impact values registered for lateral contact. The elect of belt velocity in both impacts is less important {{when compared to the}} rest of the variables. Additionally, two powered transfer <b>decelerators</b> were tested at the same point with the aim of decreasing impacts su!ered by the fruit. Comparing impacts registered using these <b>decelerators</b> to those analysed in the first part of the study without <b>decelerators,</b> a high reduction of the impact values was observed...|$|R

30|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} {{tremendous}} progress {{in the ability to}} manipulate molecular beams. Nowadays, full control over both the internal and external degrees of freedom of molecules in a beam is possible. Efficient molecular beam sources are available to cool the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom in a supersonic expansion, yielding beams with a high state purity and velocity distributions corresponding to temperatures of 1 K or less. Further manipulation of the beam has become possible since the advent of molecular beam <b>decelerators</b> [1 – 3]. Molecules can be decelerated or accelerated to any desired velocity exploiting the interaction of molecules with electric or magnetic fields, using techniques akin to the manipulation of charged particles in LINACs.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for estimating mass for inflatable aerodynamic <b>decelerators.</b> The technique uses dimensional analysis {{to identify a}} set of dimensionless parameters for inflation pressure, mass of inflation gas, and mass of flexible material.

This technique is applicable for attached (e. g., tension cone, hypercone, and stacked toroid) and trailing inflatable aerodynamic <b>decelerators.</b> The technique uses simple engineering approximations that were developed by NASA in the 1960 s and 1970 s, {{as well as some}} recent important developments.
