5|$|In 2010, Bonds's son Nikolai, {{who served}} as a Giants batboy during his father's years playing in San Francisco and always sat next to his dad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> during games, was charged with five misdemeanors {{resulting}} from a confrontation with his mother, Sun. Barry accompanied him to San Mateo County Superior Court.|$|E
5|$|Shearer took a brief role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> for {{his final}} three games under Glenn Roeder. Shearer had {{rejected}} offers of coaching or assistant roles at Newcastle under both the returning Kevin Keegan in February 2008 and Joe Kinnear in November 2008. Shearer had previously had talks about, but never been offered, a full-time manager's role at Newcastle until his appointment on 1 April 2009.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E
50|$|Home {{games are}} {{streamed}} {{live on the}} website, whilst there is radio commentary for away matches, allowing fans to vote on whether to make a substitution, and, if the vote is to do so, who to take off and bring on.

50|$|<b>In</b> 2007, <b>the</b> first on-field {{advertising}} appeared {{since the}} park's early days. Sporting goods firm Under Armour placed its logo on the double-doors between the ivy on <b>the</b> outfield wall, <b>in</b> left-center and right-center fields. Advertisements were also placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugouts,</b> originally for Sears department stores, then Walter E. Smithe furniture and now State Farm insurance.|$|R

5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E
5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote his}} remix album, My Worlds Acoustic {{as well as}} draw {{interest}} for the upcoming film, Bieber shot a music video for the song. The video premiered during Game 3 of the 2010 World Series. In the video, Bieber stands on a baseball diamond and dons apparel from both teams in the Series, wearing a San Francisco Giants hat and Texas Rangers jacket Scenes in which Bieber sings on the diamond is intercut with players hitting the ball and hanging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> as well as Bieber playing a guitar. In an interview, Bieber said that the video was inspired by his love for sports.|$|E
50|$|Candlestick was {{an object}} of scorn from {{baseball}} purists {{for reasons other than}} weather. Although originally built for baseball, foul territory was quite roomy. According to Simmons, nearly every seat was too far from the field even before the 1971 expansion. As with the radiant heating system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grandstands, <b>the</b> heating systems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugouts</b> were wholly inadequate. Players on other National League teams - especially if they'd played for the Giants beforehand - complained that <b>the</b> visitors <b>dugout</b> was colder than <b>the</b> Giants' <b>dugout.</b> This was due to two reasons: First, because <b>the</b> Giants' <b>dugout</b> included a tunnel to the clubhouse, heat from the clubhouse flowed into <b>the</b> <b>dugout.</b> <b>The</b> second reason was due to the placement of <b>the</b> <b>dugouts.</b> <b>The</b> Giants' <b>dugout</b> was located on the first base side, which was {{on the south side of}} the stadium. <b>The</b> visitors' <b>dugout</b> was located on the third base (west) side of the field.|$|R
50|$|Home to {{the varsity}} {{baseball}} team, Varsity Field features a diamond with dugouts and bleachers. It was {{recently announced that}} Varsity field will undergo major renovations set for completion by the 2012 season. The project {{was supposed to be}} for an artificial turf field along with light and many other updates including bathrooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugouts.</b> However, <b>the</b> state would not allow them to get turf so the team did receive a new field but did not receive all of the promises they were originally told.|$|R

5|$|What {{was seen}} as a failure to keep {{discipline}} on the team hurt Stengel's standing with the Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67, had several times fallen asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> and players complained that he was growing more irritable with the years. Former Yankee catcher Ralph Houk, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel's first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel's contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the 1958 World Series. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of Bob Turley (who got two wins and a save in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.|$|E

25|$|In addition, as Mack {{entered his}} 80s, his once-keen mind began fading rapidly. Mack would make strange {{decisions}} (which his {{coaches and players}} usually overruled), make inexplicable outbursts, and call for players from decades earlier to pinch-hit. He spent most games asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> leaving his coaches to run the team most of the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{supporting}} tanks—except the {{two that}} had been damaged—were ordered to return to an assembly position in reserve. At this time, {{it was discovered that}} the Marines had overrun the Japanese positions, although there were still some defenders alive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugouts.</b> Riflemen with grenades quickly dealt with these and by 14:00, all Japanese resistance had been overcome, and patrols returned reporting no further contact. At 14:15, the advance was resumed, with mopping up operations commencing. However, the Japanese troops managed to successfully break contact and began withdrawing to the east. By 15:30 to 15:45 the Marines had occupied their objective, with a perimeter defense organized for the night.|$|R
25|$|While {{prior to}} his major league career Winters was being {{compared}} to Christy Mathewson, by April 12, 1920, the Milwaukee Sentinel was comparing him to Ferdie Schupp. The newspaper noted Winters' lack of control on the mound and related him to Schupp, who, like Winters, was a very highly touted prospect that initially showed poor control. As Winters did not appear in many games in his rookie season, Schupp too spent {{the early part of}} his career primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout.</b> However, by 1917, he blossomed by winning 21 games for the Giants. The newspaper predicted a similar output by Winters.|$|E
25|$|McCarthy was the Athletics {{opening day}} starter for the 2012 season. On September 5, {{he took a}} line drive to the head off the bat of Erick Aybar of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. McCarthy {{subsequently}} underwent surgery for 2 hours to relieve cranial pressure after CT scans revealed he had suffered an epidural hemorrhage, a brain contusion, and a skull fracture. While he did not pitch again that season, he recovered well enough to join his teammates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> as a spectator during their postseason run. He was 8–6 in 18 starts for the Athletics in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In April 1977, the Comets and the Redmanizers were {{involved}} in a tumultuous post-game rumble at the Big Dome that saw both protagonists being sent and jailed at the Fort Bonifacio. At a time when the players' notion of winning a game was “at all costs”, especially in a Crispa-Toyota game, it was not uncommon to find these two teams involved in several rumbles. The very first fight actually happened back in 1975 between the two teams and led by Toyota's notorious bad boy Oscar Rocha. The apex came in 1977 when players like Fernandez and Co were mixing up at each other despite the presence of cops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout.</b>|$|E
50|$|Individual leagues {{at levels}} below MLB {{are free to}} set their own rules {{governing}} <b>the</b> <b>dugouts</b> as is appropriate for their league's ballparks and playing level.

25|$|Jealousy {{and hatred}} between Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney, the other ace pitcher on the team, broke out into {{violence}} in the clubhouse. Radbourn was faulted as the initiator of the fight, and was suspended without pay after a poor outing on July 16, having been accused of deliberately losing the game by lobbing soft pitches over the plate. But on July 22, Sweeney had been drinking {{before the start of}} the game and continued drinking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> between innings. Despite being obviously intoxicated, Sweeney managed to make it to the seventh inning with a 6–2 lead: when Bancroft attempted to relieve him with the change pitcher, Sweeney verbally abused him before being ejected and storming out of the park, leaving Providence with only eight players. With only two men to cover the outfield, they lost the game.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, in a 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but notoriously slow runner, hit a ball into shallow right field that Jackson appeared to weakly attempt to field.

50|$|Increasing {{popularity}} of the team and rising attendances lead to continued construction on Pittodrie, {{and a number of}} football firsts throughout the years. Aberdeen F.C. purchased the ground they had been leasing, with the final payment made on 1 December 1920. <b>In</b> 1925 <b>the</b> Main Stand, where the club offices, dressing rooms and trophy room are located, was constructed.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, when {{baseball}} was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. [...] "They never...had {{the need to}} sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout</b> and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, [...] "because {{he was trying to}} change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people." ...|$|E

500|$|With the Blue Jays {{finishing}} the season 93–69, the team clinched the AL-East pennant {{for their first}} postseason berth in 22 years. During Game 6 of the 2015 ALCS against the Kansas City Royals, Revere was involved in controversy where Jeff Nelson called a strike on a pitch that was up and outside on a 2-1 count. The very next pitch, Revere struck out swinging. He attacked a garbage can with his bat in frustration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dugout,</b> and the Blue Jays would end up losing the game 3-4, eliminating them from further postseason contention. In 11 postseason games, Revere batted [...]256 with 2 stolen bases.|$|E
50|$|As most of {{the stadium}} was {{demolished}} and little of the proposed redevelopment work has as yet been carried out at Hartsdown Park, the stadium's current facilities are limited.

25|$|Dugouts or benches are {{generally}} {{used instead of}} pavilions <b>in</b> Twenty20 cricket. <b>The</b> <b>dugout</b> or bench is located just off the field of play, allowing players to enter and exit the field of play more quickly in comparison to a pavilion, therefore maintaining the faster pace of that form of the game.|$|R
50|$|Farther {{from the}} infield {{on either side}} are <b>the</b> <b>dugouts,</b> where <b>the</b> teams and coaches sit when they're not on the field. They are named such because, at the {{professional}} levels, this seating is {{below the level of}} the playing field so as to not block the view from prime spectator seating locations. <b>In</b> amateur parks, <b>the</b> <b>dugouts</b> may be above-ground wooden or CMU structures with seating inside, or simply benches behind a chain link fence.|$|R
