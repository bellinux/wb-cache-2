It is my concern to ensure that this government {{is in a position to}} exercise its responsibilities if trouble comes".|$|E
500|$|Once {{the game}} went into downtime, {{developer}} CCP Games {{announced that it}} would create an in-game monument in the B-R5RB star system to commemorate the battle. [...] "Titanomachy" [...] was created using brand new Titan wreck models introduced with Eve Online: Rubicon's 1.1 release which came out immediately following the battle. CCP Games posted on the Eve Online website that they planned to install [...] "Titanomachy" [...] during downtime of January 31, and were [...] "hard at work placing the wrecks in a hauntingly beautiful arrangement." [...] Placed around the seventh planet in the B-R5RB system, the installation is [...] "off grid" [...] from the space-station. CCP Games stated that [...] "Thereafter, any player who plays [...] can make the dangerous pilgrimage there and marvel at the scope of destruction. We <b>expect</b> <b>some</b> of the 'travel' bloggers to do full write-ups on it almost immediately and [...] videographers to make some moving tributes as well." ...|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] finished 22nd {{in the ratings}} for the week of March 23–29, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.8, equivalent to approximately 16.63 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and called it [...] "another great" [...] episode that chronicles the love between Homer and Marge, showing the [...] "ups and downs" [...] of their marriage. He said Lurleen's songs are [...] "filled with clever observations", but it is Homer's befuddlement {{that makes it a}} [...] "classic" [...] episode. Meyers added, however, that country music fans might [...] "take offense at Matt Groening's script, which hams up every stereotype imaginable". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that after the [...] "great" [...] previous episode [...] "Dog of Death", [...] "one might <b>expect</b> <b>some</b> drop-off with 'Colonel Homer', but virtually none occurs. It offers another classic episode that benefits from a memorable guest voice performance from D’Angelo. Homer’s moment in the sun creates a fun plot and the program nicely lampoons the country music business." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the episode is a [...] "good example of The Simpsons fixing itself on a target (in this case, country and western music) and extracting every possible gag. Lurleen's songs are all marvelous." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, he is not an entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's {{a lot of fun to}} play. There are a lot of different dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, but he has a sensitive side as well, which is coming out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So <b>expect</b> <b>some</b> fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "If {{he finds}} the crowd harsh here then he must {{remember}} he asked for it." [...] said Jeremy Coney. [...] "But crowds just can't be neutral about him", he said.

I just feel neutral about him – when he is batting I {{want to get rid}} of him, when he is bowling I want to hit him around the park." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} and ideological background of the Internet censorship {{is considered to be}} one of Deng Xiaoping's favorite sayings in the early 1980s: [...] "If you open a window for fresh air for longer than 10 hours, you have to <b>expect</b> <b>some</b> flies to blow in." [...] The saying is related to a period of the economic reform of China that became known as the [...] "socialist market economy". Superseding the political ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, the reform led China towards a market economy and opened up the market for foreign investors. Nonetheless the Communist Party of China has wished to protect its values and political ideas from [...] "swatting flies" [...] of other ideologies, with a particular emphasis on suppressing movements that could potentially threaten the power of the CPC and the stability of the Chinese state.|$|E

2500|$|Ordinary atomic {{matter as}} we know it is really a mixed phase, {{droplets}} of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature phase boundary between vacuum and nuclear matter, at μ=310MeV and T close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase μ) keeping the temperature low, we move into a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a neutron star. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of μ, there is a transition to quark matter. At ultra-high densities we expect to find the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color-superconducting quark matter. At intermediate densities we <b>expect</b> <b>some</b> other phases (labelled [...] "non-CFL quark liquid" [...] in the figure) whose nature is presently unknown,. They might be other forms of color-superconducting quark matter, or something different.|$|E
2500|$|The Canon begins [...] "Te igitur". To {{what does}} that [...] "igitur" [...] refer? From {{the sense of the}} whole passage it should follow some {{reference}} to the sacrifice. One would <b>expect</b> <b>some</b> prayer that God may accept our offering, perhaps some reference such as is found in the Eastern liturgies to the sacrifices of Abraham, Melchizedek, etc. It should then be natural to continue: [...] "And therefore we humbly pray thee, most merciful Father", etc. But there is no hint of such an allusion in what goes before. No preface has any word to which the [...] "igitur" [...] could naturally refer. At any rate there is no trace of it, either in our preface or in any of the other rites. Other difficulties are the reduplications between the ideas of the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] and the [...] "Nobis quoque peccatoribus". Various allusions to older forms of the Canon increase the number of these difficulties.|$|E
