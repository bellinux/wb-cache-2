25|$|In August 1977, a clue {{emerged to}} the {{disappearance}} of John Szyc: Michael Rossi, who had bought Szyc's car from Gacy, was arrested for stealing gasoline from a service station while driving the car. The attendant noted the license plate number and police traced the car to Gacy's house. (Rossi had lived with Gacy until April 1977 and had worked for PDM Contractors since May 1976.) When questioned, Gacy told officers that Szyc had sold the car to him in February with the explanation that he needed money to leave town. The police did not pursue the matter further, although they did inform Szyc's mother that <b>her</b> <b>son</b> <b>had</b> sold his car to Gacy.|$|E
25|$|He was {{fortunate}} {{in having a}} station commander in Group Captain Jim Warfield who was a cricket enthusiast and was willing to grant him leave for Test and occasional county matches. In addition, Warfield decided to employ Trueman in the sports section, looking after the equipment and playing fields. However, this relaxation of the usual rules caused questions to be raised in the House of Commons after the mother of another conscript complained to her local MP that <b>her</b> <b>son</b> <b>had</b> been refused leave {{to take part in}} a national banjo playing championship. Trueman claimed that he was the first person to be mentioned in Hansard in a cricketing connection. His identity in the RAF was AC2 F. S. Trueman 2549485. He was later promoted to AC1.|$|E

Both {{she and her father}} have the gene - he's noticed the father is {{slightly}} deaf, a symptom that characterizes the condition. It's likely <b>her</b> <b>son</b> <b>has</b> it too. She accuses him of lying. He points out that both of <b>her</b> <b>sons</b> <b>have</b> trouble hearing high pitched sounds, which is why it seemed that <b>her</b> dead <b>son</b> was <b>having</b> trouble pronouncing words. <b>Her</b> current <b>son</b> <b>has</b> the same problem, but the disease is treatable.

25|$|Dziekański's {{flight was}} two hours late, {{and arrived at}} about 3:15 pm on October 13, 2007. According to {{official}} sources, Dziekański required language support to complete initial customs formalities. After he completed initial immigration processing, his whereabouts between 4:00 p.m. and about 10:45 p.m. remain unclear, though at various points he was seen around the baggage carousels. Dziekański's mother, Zofia Cisowski, {{had told him to}} wait for her at the baggage claim area but it was a secured area where she was not allowed to enter. At 10:45 p.m., when he attempted to leave the Customs hall, he was directed again to secondary immigration as his visa had not yet been processed. Dziekański's immigration procedures were completed at about 12:15 a.m. on October 14. After 30 minutes in an immigration waiting area, he was taken to the international arrivals reception area. Cisowski had been making enquiries of airport staff since the early afternoon.

25|$|As {{early as}} 1918 Ellen was {{thinking}} of selling Preston Manor to Brighton Corporation; years of feuding with <b>her</b> <b>son</b> <b>had</b> left a legacy of bitterness. Charles and Ellen were probably influenced by their friend Henry Roberts, Director of the Royal Pavilion, but they also feared that if John did inherit he would demolish the house or {{turn it into a}} girls' school. In 1925 Charles bought Preston Manor from his wife's trustees and made provision in his will that, subject to the respective life interests of himself and Ellen, Preston Manor and four acres of adjoining land should pass to Brighton Corporation by deed of gift on the condition that it be preserved in its historic condition and be used as a museum with exhibits relevant to Brighton and Sussex. The frontage to Preston Road and Preston Drove was purchased by the Corporation for the sum of £5,000 (although the sale was not completed until after Charles and Ellen died). Also in 1925 Charles and Ellen were given the honorary freedom of Brighton and in 1929 Charles was made a baronet in recognition of his years of public service. Sir Charles and Lady Ellen Thomas-Stanford continued to live at Preston Manor until their deaths in 1932. Charles died in March having willed to the Corporation 'all my books, documents, ancient deeds and papers relating exclusively or primarily to the County of Sussex'. (The rest of his library went to the National Library of Wales). Ellen died in November, bequeathing to the corporation the furniture and contents of the house.|$|E
