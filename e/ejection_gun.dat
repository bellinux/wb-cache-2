25|$|A {{version of}} the seat with a longer-stroke <b>ejection</b> <b>gun</b> for the V bombers was the Martin-Baker Mk.3.|$|E
30|$|A second {{important}} factor determining the patients outcome is {{the pressure of}} the <b>gun</b> <b>ejection.</b> An injection under low pressure causes less damage than an injection under high pressure. That is why injections with veterinary vaccines in general give less damage than other injections.|$|R
5000|$|Spy car {{equipped}} with machine <b>guns,</b> <b>ejection</b> seat and cannon: The bullets {{from the machine}} guns ricochet off a bolder and blow away the car top, the Coyote ejects himself from the car while suspended upside down, and the force from the cannon sends the car backwards, running over the Coyote who then fails to dodge the cannonball.|$|R
40|$|A {{pneumatic}} gun for ballistic {{delivery of}} microparticles to soft targets is proposed and demonstrated. The particles are accelerated {{by a high}} speed flow of Helium in a capillary tube. Vacuum suction applied to a concentric, larger diameter tube is used to completely divert the flow of Helium from the gun nozzle and prevent it from hitting the target. Depths of penetration of micron-sized gold particles into agarose gels and their speeds of <b>ejection</b> from the <b>gun</b> nozzle are measured...|$|R
50|$|Rounds {{are loaded}} into the {{magazines}} through a large loading/ejection port, located at the bottom rear of the gun in the stock, behind the pistol grip. Empty shells are ejected down through the same port. The safety is a cross-bolt manual safety button located above the grip. When coupled with the center loading and <b>ejection</b> makes the <b>gun</b> fully ambidextrous. Sighting equipment is not included, but iron sights and/or red dot sights can be installed using the standard Picatinny rail located above the barrels. A second Picatinny rail {{at the bottom of}} the slide is installed for the forward grip and, for installation of other accessories.|$|R
