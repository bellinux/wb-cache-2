40|$|Vulture {{populations have}} been declining {{globally}} and regionally within Africa. Rüppell’s Vulture <b>Gyps</b> <b>rueppellii</b> is currently listed as ‘Near Threatened ’ {{and numbers of}} the species, along with African White-backed Vultures G. africanus, have declined by 52 % {{in and around the}} Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. A large breeding colony of Rüppell’s Vulture at Kwenia, southern Kenya, was monitored between 2002 and 2009. Around 150 – 200 adults were present on each visit, with up to 64 simultaneously active nests. The date of egg-laying differed considerably between years, with two discrete breeding attempts in some years. Nests were not positioned randomly across the cliff face and the number of active nests was related to rainfall in the previous year. The large ungulate migration of the Mara-Serengeti provides a vital foraging ground for the species. Conservation implications of the loss of vultures are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In East Africa live {{two species}} of Griffon Vultures; Rüppel’s Griffon Vulture (<b>Gyps</b> <b>rueppellii)</b> and African White-backed Griffon Vulture (G. africanus). One of the {{apparently}} most important factors limiting the population of these birds is food supply. Griffon vultures nest for eight months of the year, and are during this period geographically tied down to the nesting place. The living biomass in the East-African protected areas Masai Mara and Serengeti consists mainly of migrating ungulate populations of Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurins), Common Zebra (Equus burchelli), and Thomson’s Gazelle (Gazella thomsoni). The migration of these ungulates causes an irregular and unsure food supply for the Griffon vultures. In order to cope with this, Griffon vultures have developed anatomic, physiologic and ethologic characteristics. Griffon vultures have the advantages of being large and diurnal as well as good sight. Long necks and flat feet are adaptations for an easier opening of carcasses and spending {{long periods of time}} on the ground. Griffon vultures also elicit social traits such as local enhancement that benefit the whole population, nest in colonies that give protection, and are in principle monogamous which saves energy. A lot of energy is consumed by raising offspring, but this is well-invested time as the number of successful reproductions and nestlings that reach adulthood is high. Scientists agree that Griffon vultures are very well-adapted in their way of living...|$|E
40|$|Diurnal raptors have {{declined}} significantly in western Africa since the 1960 s. To evaluate {{the impact of}} traditional medicine and bushmeat trade on raptors, we examined carcasses offered at markets at 67 sites (1 – 80 stands per site) in 12 countries in western Africa during 1990 – 2013. Black kiteMilvus migransand hooded vulture Necrosyrtes monachus together accounted for 41 % of 2, 646 carcasses comprising 52 species. Twenty-seven percent of carcasses were of species categorized as Near Threatened, Vulnerable or Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Common species were traded more frequently than rarer species, as were species with frequent scavenging behaviour (vs non-scavenging), generalist or savannah habitat use (vs forest), and an Afrotropical (vs Palearctic) breeding range. Large Afrotropical vultures were recorded in the highest absolute and relative numbers in Nigeria, whereas in Central Africa, palm-nut vultures Gypohierax angolensis were the most abundant vulture species. Estimates based on data extrapolation indicated that within West Africa 73 % of carcasses were traded in Nigeria, 21 % in Benin and 5 % elsewhere. Offtake per annum in West Africa {{was estimated to be}} 975 – 1, 462 hooded vultures, 356 – 534 palm-nut vultures, 188 – 282 Rüppell's griffons <b>Gyps</b> <b>rueppellii,</b> 154 – 231 African white-backed vultures Gyps africanus, 143 – 214 lappet-faced vultures Torgos tracheliotos, and 40 – 60 crowned eagles Stephanoaetus coronatus. This represents a sizeable proportion of regional populations, suggesting that trade is likely to be contributing significantly to declines. Stronger commitment is needed, especially by governments in Nigeria and Benin, to halt the trade in threatened raptors and prevent their extirpation...|$|E
40|$|Dry-season {{counts of}} diurnal raptors were {{performed}} in the wet season in the agricultural region in northern Cameroon along several road transects (total = 900 km), while assessing general land cover characteristics and land cover characteristics of the raptor habitats. 9 common diurnal residential raptor species (Milvus migrans, Elanus caeruleus, Melierax metabates, Falco alopex, Butastur rufipennis, Necrosyrtes monachus, Buteo auguralis, <b>Gyps</b> <b>rueppellii,</b> Aquila wahlbergi) have been analyzed for their land cover preference at microhabitat scale regarding several land cover characteristics: agriculture, woodland, village, herbaceous layer, trees and shrubs/bushes. Overall all raptors, except Necrosyrtes monachus and Milvus migrans, showed, on a microhabitat scale level, a significant preference for {{a high percentage of}} natural woodland. Conservation of the woodland areas within the agricultural region is thus important for preservation of many raptors: only the scavenging raptors living of dead animals and refuse dumps significantly prefer villages above woodland and agricultural fields. Human presence may not be a problem for several raptors, but their activities might. For cover with agriculture and trees, there is a wide variety in preference, varying from a low level (resp. 0 - 20 % and 0 - 30 trees/hectare) to a high level (80 - 100 % and > 120 trees/hectare). On a microhabitat level, many of the investigated raptors seem to prefer a small cover of herbaceous layer above a larger cover, indicating that on a small scale, grazing can be possibly be positive for raptors, when bare soil is surrounded by areas with more grass. Regarding bush/shrub density, there was little variation in the area (88 % having a cover of 0 - 20 %), where only Necrosyrtes monachus and Buteo auguralis showed a significant preference for respectively a low to high cover. Maintaining a diverse landscape with a wide diversity in land cover characteristics is thus expected to be crucial for conservation of raptors. Through field experiments, I investigated the effect of very local land cover characteristics on the presence of prey animals for raptors, during the dry season. Literature shows that a wide variety of food types are eaten by different raptors. Analysis in 4 different land use types revealed that in each land use type, grasshoppers had a statistically significant positive correlation with the grass cover. In natural woodland, average grasshopper numbers found were significantly higher than in villages and cotton plantations. Differences are expected to be larger in the growth season (wet season) : in the dry season {{no significant differences were found}} between the intensive (cotton) plantations and the extensive (sorghum plantations), regarding grasshopper densities. For other types of prey animals, no significant relations have been found regarding land cover characteristics. Only in general, significantly more lizards were present in villages compared to the other three land use types...|$|E
