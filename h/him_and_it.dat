5|$|As {{it turned}} out, maybe Hadl {{had led him}} {{to believe that we}} had come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with <b>him.</b> <b>And</b> <b>it</b> was really funny because it was not what he was expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E
5|$|However, Sigurd's line barely survived <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was Torf-Einarr, Rognvald's son by a slave, {{who founded}} a dynasty that {{controlled}} the islands for centuries after his death. He was succeeded {{by his son}} Thorfinn Skull-splitter and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954. Thorfinn's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa, on South Ronaldsay, led to {{a long period of}} dynastic strife.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Polish {{fantasy and}} science fiction fandom (associated with the Polish SF {{convention}} Polcon) decided {{to establish an}} annual award, initially named Sfinks ("Sphynx"). Janusz A. Zajdel became the first winner of this award, for his 1984 novel Paradyzja. He won the award posthumously in 1985, shortly after his death, at which time {{it was decided to}} rename the award after <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> became known as the Janusz A.

5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E
5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, the Norse {{tradition}} {{states that}} Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation {{for the death}} of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty. Sigurd's line barely survived <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was Torf-Einarr, Rognvald's son by a slave, who founded a dynasty that controlled the Northern Isles for centuries after his death. He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954. Thorfinn's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa, on South Ronaldsay, then led to a long period of dynastic strife. Whatever the historical details, it seems likely that Orkney and Shetland were being rapidly absorbed into Norse culture by this time.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E

25|$|Maxwell's House, {{designed}} by George Drumgoole Coleman, was a two-storey house built for a merchant, John Argyle Maxwell, in 1827. However, {{it was never}} occupied by <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> became a courthouse and lands office. Subsequently, it was converted to Government Offices and additions were made in 1839 and 1847.|$|E

Divorced and estranged from his family, Johnny was entombed in the {{mausoleum}} Mathieu in Avignon. Upon Stark's death, everyone said {{that no one could}} replace <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> proved true, but by then the entertainment press had also matured.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between the Second Doctor and his predecessor was unclear. In his first story, the Second Doctor referred to his predecessor in the third person {{as if he were a}} completely different person.

25|$|In 1893 Charles Street of Le Carbone {{discovered}} {{a process for}} making artificial graphite. Another process to make synthetic graphite was invented accidentally by Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856–1931). In the mid-1890s, Acheson discovered that overheating carborundum produced almost pure graphite. While studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum, he had found that silicon vaporizes at about 4,150°C (7,500°F), leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon. This graphite was another major discovery for <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant.|$|E
25|$|The Syrah grape was {{introduced}} into Australia in 1832 by James Busby, an immigrant who brought vine clippings from Europe with <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> is almost invariably called Shiraz. Today it is Australia's most popular red grape, {{but has not}} always been in such favour; in the 1970s, white wine was so popular that growers were ripping out unprofitable Shiraz and Grenache vineyards, even those with very old vines. In the Barossa Valley, the world's oldest continually producing commercial vineyard {{is believed to be the}} Shiraz vines at Turkey Flat in Tanunda that were originally planted in 1847.|$|E
25|$|Knox {{attended}} Dulwich College. He {{played two}} matches for Surrey in 1904 without achieving a great deal, but the following year, aided by some fiery pitches at The Oval, advanced {{so much that}} he was an excellent backup to Walter Lees in a major Surrey revival. Although he was expensive on true pitches Knox took 129 wickets for less than 22 runs each, and his promise was clearly noted, though even then the length (over 20 metres – very long for the time) of his run-up was seen as taking a great deal of energy out of <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was thought Knox would have trouble coping with arduous seasons.|$|E
