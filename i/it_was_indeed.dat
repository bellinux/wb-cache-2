Renan Ramirez of the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute stated that the medical conditions could have been caused by sulfur, arsenic or other toxins that may have melted in the extreme heat produced by the meteorite strike. Some unnamed Peruvian sources stated soon after the event occurred that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> a meteorite. Later on 18 September, a Peruvian vulcanologist stated that the impact was caused by a chondrite meteorite arrival.|$|E
5|$|The demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) {{boasted that}} even dead French monarchs could heal; <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>indeed,</b> still {{believed}} in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order to be touched by the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.|$|E
5|$|Flagged {{initially}} as {{a transit}} event by the satellite, Kepler-9d {{was given the}} designation KOI 377.03. It was recognized as a potential planet after a study into the system confirmed Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, but follow-up studies had to be completed to verify that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> a planet, and that the apparent transit event was not due to a background eclipsing binary star in the aperture of Kepler's photometer. Kepler's team exhaustively disproved that the small transit event could have been anything but a planet, and their results {{were published in the}} Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. Follow-up observations were conducted by the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, as well as the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with two courses of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically dimming it) and a radial velocity effect detected in Kepler-10's spectrum provided the information needed to prove that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> a planet. An additional, longer-period dimming was detected in Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal could have some other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called Blender.|$|E

5|$|The {{intensification}} trend {{picked up}} {{again the next}} day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea, a region typically unfavorable for intensification. Hurricane Emily's winds increased in reaction, briefly bringing the storm to Category 4 strength early on July15. During the day, the storm's strength fluctuated greatly, dropping to a Category2 storm and then rebuilding to Category4. On July16, Emily strengthened considerably, making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of July with peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), the earliest known Category 5 in the Atlantic basin. Initially at this point Emily was thought to have peaked as a Category4 storm, but the post-storm analysis showed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> a Category5 hurricane. The storm weakened slightly as it continued westward, and remained a Category4 while passing south of Jamaica and, on July17, the Cayman Islands. Hurricane Emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest, weakening somewhat but remaining at Category4 until striking Cozumel just before mainland landfall at Playa del Carmen at 06:30UTC on July18. Sustained winds were 135mph (215km/h), and the eyewall passed directly over Cozumel.|$|E
5|$|With Bosnia-Herzegovina {{firmly in}} Austro-Hungarian hands, Serbia {{and several other}} Balkan states turned to forcing the Ottoman Empire from southeastern Europe. The ensuing Balkan Wars, which lasted from 1912 until 1913, saw Serbia take {{possession}} of Kosovo and Macedonia. On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The assassination precipitated the July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary to issue an ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on suspicion that the assassination had been planned in Belgrade.

25|$|Following more {{experimentation}} in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide ("New {{experiments with}} the vacuum"), which detailed basic rules describing {{to what degree}} various liquids could be supported by air pressure.

In 1018, the emperor Basil II {{went on a}} pilgrimage to Athens directly after his final victory over the Bulgarians {{for the sole purpose of}} worshipping at the Parthenon.

Schaper {{was sentenced to}} six years' imprisonment, but was soon released for medical reasons. He died of old age in his nineties. According to statement received by the Polish IPN from German prosecution, the documentation of his trial is no longer available and was most likely destroyed after the case was terminated.|$|E

In June 1710, most probably via a ship from Pernau, the plague arrived in Stockholm, where the health commission (Collegium Medicum) until 29 August denied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> the plague, despite buboes being visible on the bodies of victims from the ship and in the town. The plague raged in Stockholm until 1711, affecting primarily women (45.3% of the dead) and children (38.7% of the dead) in the poorer quarters outside the Old Town. Of Stockholm's approximately 55,000, inhabitants, about 22,000 did not survive the plague.|$|E
25|$|According to Maxine Sanders, Sanders never courted publicity, but {{was simply}} unable to avoid it.

The couple running a coven that Sanders belonged to were practising Christians, and the local press had become curious about their activities. Had they been exposed {{it would have been}} disastrous for them. Sanders offered the Press an alternative story, proposing to hold a ritual at a magical site at Alderley Edge, where he would raise a man from the dead. A bandaged up figure lying on a stone altar was examined by one of Sanders' colleagues posing as a G.P., who certified <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> a corpse.|$|E
