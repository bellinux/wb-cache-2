500|$|With {{over twenty}} years of {{parliamentary}} majorities, Liberal ministers did as they wished {{with little regard for}} the opposition parties. The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state, a development initially opposed by many Tories. C.D. Howe, considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government, told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them, [...] "Who would stop us?...

500|$|Like his {{predecessor}} Helen Clark, Key views a New Zealand republic as [...] "inevitable", although probably not for another decade. [...] "If Australia becomes a republic {{there is no}} question it will set off quite an intense debate {{on this side of the}} Tasman", he said. [...] "We would have to have a referendum <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to move towards it." [...] Key later stated that he is a monarchist, and that a New Zealand republic would [...] "Not [...] under my watch". In 2009 Key announced the restoration of titular honours, including knighthoods and damehoods—the abolishment of these titles in 2000 had been seen as an advancement towards republicanism.|$|E
500|$|Sales of the Anarky limited series {{were high}} enough to green light an ongoing series, with Breyfogle commenting, [...] " [...] did well enough so that DC is {{willing to listen to}} Alan’s idea for a sequel <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to pitch them." [...] However, despite the sales, Grant was still {{concerned}} the character lacked enough support among fans to sustain an ongoing series. While the ongoing series did find an audience amongst Latin American nations—Mexico and Argentina in particular—it failed in the United States, where Alan Grant has lamented that the comic was doomed to eventual cancellation, as DC Comics [...] " [...] take foreign sales into consideration when counting their cash".|$|E

The more I {{was listening to the}} thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a government surplus. In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us? [...] Don't take yourself too seriously. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to get away with it, who would stop us?" ...|$|E
500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It {{was the first time}} we ever heard of that, but they said because we were a band going to be touring around the world in 1992 they wondered <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to be spokesband for the ISY.

2500|$|The {{combination}} {{of sexuality and}} spirituality shown at Herrnhaag was not unknown in Christian history, but it caused increasing scandal both within and without the church, particularly embarrassing for Nicholas, [...] "who {{was trying to be}} recognized as a rightful theologian after joining the confession of Augsburg" [...] in 1748. Even Christel’s mother was concerned, realizing the events taking place at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn were at the edge where metaphor and reality meet. Referring to a plowshare that can be raised and lowered, she later wrote to her son that [...] "I sometimes said we have already put the peg in the last hole. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to remain in the world, the Savior would have to make three or four holes further back and lower down." ...|$|E

He used the word Daesh, an Arab acronym considered derogatory by ISIS, and claimed that the group was detaining a third of the Ba'ath's command. Al-Douri then went on to claim the number of ISIS victims in Iraq [...] "does not equal 1% of those killed by the militias". On Iran, al-Douri called for the [...] "Iraqis in Al-Anbar and Karbala to strongly fight the Persian criminal plan, which aims at swallowing Iraq." [...] He stressed that Iran is the main player in Iraq and it is working through the Quds Force.|$|E
2500|$|The band toured Australian {{to promote}} the album, then {{returned}} to Europe, frustrated with low album sales and their inability to gain traction on Australian radio.

[...] "Chin Chin didn't go {{as well as we}} hoped it would and we felt the band's future had been discounted.
