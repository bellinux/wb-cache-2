5000|$|Smelting and {{producing}} pig iron and other iron products {{was known to}} the Ancient Egyptians and gradually spread around the Eastern Mediterranean as far as Ancient Greece.

5000|$|The open hearth {{process is}} a batch process and a batch is called a [...] "heat". The furnace is first {{inspected}} for possible damage. Once it is ready or repaired, it is charged with light scrap, such as sheet metal, shredded vehicles or waste metal. The furnace is heated using burning gas. Once it has melted, heavy scrap, such as building, construction or steel milling scrap is added, together with pig iron from blast furnaces. Once all the steel has melted, slag forming agents, such as limestone, are added.

50|$|Incidental {{decarburization}} can {{be detrimental}} to surface properties in products (where carbon content is desirable) when done during heat treatment or after rolling or forging, because the material is only affected to a certain depth according to the temperature and duration of heating. This can be prevented by using an inert or reduced-pressure atmosphere, applying resistive heating for a short duration, by limiting the time that material is under high heat, as is done in a walking-beam furnace, or through restorative carburization, which uses a hydrocarbon atmosphere to transfer carbon into {{the surface of the}} material during annealing.

Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be <b>decarburized</b> to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E

Where iron ore was unavailable, they melted any steel objects they could get their hands on, including pots and pans, and even bicycles, to make steel girders, but these girders were useless, as the steel was impure and of poor quality and thus cracked easily. Unbeknownst to the Communist Party officials, the result was not steel, but high carbon pig iron, which needs to be <b>decarburized</b> to make steel.|$|E

5000|$|Puddled iron—the {{puddling}} process {{was the first}} large-scale process to produce wrought iron. In the {{puddling process}}, pig iron is refined in a reverberatory furnace to prevent harmful sulphur from the coal or coke from contaminating the iron. The molten pig iron is manually stirred and iron ore, an oxygen source, is added, which <b>decarburizes</b> the iron. As the iron is stirred, globs of wrought iron are collected into balls by the stirring rod (rabble arm or rod) and those are periodically removed by the puddler. Puddling was patented in 1784 and became widely used after 1800. By 1876, annual production of puddled iron in the UK alone was over 4 million tons. Around that time, the open hearth furnace was able to produce steel of suitable quality for structural purposes, and wrought iron production went into decline.|$|R
50|$|China {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{the exception to the}} general use of bloomeries. It was thought that the Chinese skipped the bloomery process completely, starting with the blast furnace and the finery forge to produce wrought iron: by the 5th century BC, metalworkers in the southern state of Wu had invented the blast furnace and the means to both cast iron and to <b>decarburize</b> the carbon-rich pig iron produced in a blast furnace to a low-carbon, wrought iron-like material. Recent evidence, however, shows that bloomeries were used earlier in China, migrating in from the west as early as 800 BC, before being supplanted by the locally developed blast furnace. Supporting this theory was the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BCE), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the site today).|$|R

5000|$|More fuel is {{then added}} and the {{temperature}} raised. The iron completely melts and the carbon starts to burn off as well. When wet puddling, the formation of carbon dioxide due to reactions with the added iron oxide will cause bubbles to form that cause the mass to appear to boil. This process causes the slag to puff up on top, giving the rabbler a visual indication of {{the progress of the}} combustion. As the carbon burns off, the melting temperature of the mixture rises from 1150 to 1540 C, so the furnace has to be continually fed during this process. The melting point increases since the carbon atoms within the mixture act as a solute in solution which lowers the melting point of the iron mixture (like road salt on ice). Burning them off causes the melting point to increase towards that of pure iron, and since the temperature of the puddling furnace is less than that which wrought iron melts, <b>decarburized</b> iron in the mixture start to solidify around the puddling bars. Eventually the carbon is mostly burned off and the iron [...] "comes to nature", forming into a spherical spongy mass, indicating that the process is complete and the material can be removed.

50|$|Silicon {{significantly}} {{increases the}} electrical resistivity of the steel, which decreases the induced eddy currents and narrows the hysteresis loop of the material, thus lowering the core loss. However, the grain structure hardens and embrittles the metal, which adversely affects the workability of the material, especially when rolling it. When alloying, the concentration levels of carbon, sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen {{must be kept}} low, as these elements indicate the presence of carbides, sulfides, oxides and nitrides. These compounds, even in particles as small as one micrometer in diameter, increase hysteresis losses while also decreasing magnetic permeability. The presence of carbon has a more detrimental effect than sulfur or oxygen. Carbon also causes magnetic aging when it slowly leaves the solid solution and precipitates as carbides, thus resulting {{in an increase in}} power loss over time. For these reasons, the carbon level is kept to 0.005% or lower. The carbon level can be reduced by annealing the steel in a <b>decarburizing</b> atmosphere, such as hydrogen.|$|R

Considering the oxidation loss depth, the “true ferrite <b>decarburized</b> depth” at 850 °C (AC 3 -G) is still smaller than that at 760 °C (AC 1 -AC 3).

By the end of forging, the steel produced was among the purest steel-alloys of the ancient world. Due to the continuous heating the steel tends to <b>decarburize,</b> so a good quantity of carbon is either extracted from the steel as carbon dioxide or redistributed more evenly through diffusion, leaving a nearly eutectoid composition (containing 0.77 to 0.8% carbon).

5000|$|Steel {{contains}} {{a relatively small}} percentage of carbon, which can migrate freely within the gamma iron. When austenized steel is exposed to air {{for long periods of}} time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing environment, in which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenized steel is very susceptible to decarburization. This is often used for cast steel, where a high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce malleable cast iron, in a process called [...] "white tempering." [...] This tendency to <b>decarburize</b> is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing, where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount of time possible to prevent too much decarburization.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the crucial}} stages in {{fabrication}} of WC-Co composite is sintering process. Inappropriate sintering state, especially sintering temperature will lead to an abnormal grain growth and thus reduce the mechanical properties of the sintered parts. Sintering atmosphere also plays {{a big role in}} oxidation, carburizing, <b>decarburizing</b> and nitriding on the surface of sintered parts. Prevention of any unwanted process during sintering is demanded to maintain the performance of WC-CO composites without any by-products. In this work, the effect of different sintering atmosphere and sintering temperatures was studied on the mechanical properties of WC-Co composites. 95 % nitrogen (N 2) mixed with 5 % hydrogen (H 2) gases was used as sintering atmosphere in a tube furnace whereas vacuum atmosphere was carried out in vacuum furnace. The sintering process was conducted at 1300 °C and 1400 °C, respectively. Higher relative density, hardness and transverse rupture strength (TRS) were observed on the sintered parts. Sintering under N 2 -H 2 atmosphere exhibited better mechanical properties.
