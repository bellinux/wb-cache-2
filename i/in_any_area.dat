5|$|Honorees are {{inducted}} {{for work}} <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area</b> of wrestling, including {{competing in the}} ring, managing, refereeing, promoting, and announcing. During the ceremony, personalities from the NWA deliver speeches and present the inductees with plaques. These plaques have the logo of the NWA Legends Fanfest and are identical aside from the year of induction and the inductee's name. Many presenters {{have been involved in}} the inductee's career; for example, Gary Hart, who managed Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson, inducted both men, and Buddy Roberts was inducted by Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin, both of whom were fellow members of The Fabulous Freebirds. Inductees and other former NWA wrestlers are seated at tables with fans to provide an intimate atmosphere. Although most people honored by the hall attend the dinner and induction ceremony, some are inducted posthumously and others are unable to attend for medical reasons.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area,</b> such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E

25|$|An additional, rabbinic prohibition, which Jewish {{religious}} tradition ascribes {{to the court}} of King Solomon, forbids carrying <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area</b> that was shared by the occupants of more than one dwelling, even if it is surrounded by fences or walls. But, in this case of areas surrounded by walls, carrying was allowed through the use of an eruv. The eruv consists of a food item – in general bread – that is shared by all dwellers. By means of this shared meal, all the dwellers are considered as if they were living in a common dwelling, thus exempting them from the added prohibition.|$|E

25|$|Water purification: All {{water used}} for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, ozone water treatment, {{ultraviolet}} light sterilization (e.g., by solar water disinfection), or antimicrobial filtration <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area</b> where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling {{are often the}} least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters or sari filtration, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.|$|E
25|$|A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area,</b> the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call. The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, {{a version}} of Donkey Kong Country was {{released}} for the Game Boy Color. [...] The GBC version has a new stage in Chimp Caverns called [...] "Necky Nutmare", {{as well as a}} revamped and longer Winky's Walkway. The GBC version had some of the music scrapped and replaced, often with music that had originated in Donkey Kong Land. In 2003, another version of the game was released for the Game Boy Advance. This version has increased brightness, at the cost of contrast and colour saturation, to make the game easier to see on an unlit LCD screen. Both games have some new features, including new minigames, hidden pictures, and a Time Trial mode; additionally, the GBA version had multiplayer games. Both versions also have lower sound fidelity and a number of minor changes. Candy Kong no longer runs a save point, so players can save the game <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

500|$|The gray-tailed vole (Microtus canicaudus) {{also known}} as the gray-tailed meadow vole or gray-tailed meadow mouse, is a rodent in the genus Microtus (small-eared [...] "meadow voles") of the family Cricetidae. Voles are small mammals, and this species lies roughly {{in the middle of their}} size range. First {{collected}} in 1895, it is endemic to the Willamette Valley, Oregon, and Clark County, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Historically, they were found in the prairie areas of the Valley and, though many of these areas have been converted for agricultural purposes, these animals remain common. For reasons that remain unclear, vole population densities <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area</b> may fluctuate widely from season to season and year to year. They are preyed upon by owls, hawks, and carnivorous mammals, and their parasites include fleas and ticks. These voles build underground burrows and complex tunnel networks, which they sometimes share with other burrowing animals. Relatively little is known about their behavior in the wild, because they are elusive and unlikely to enter traps.|$|E
500|$|Hordern was 14 {{when he left}} Windlesham House to {{continue}} his schooling {{as a member of}} Chichester House at Brighton College. By the time he joined the college, his interest in acting had matured. In his 1993 autobiography, A World Elsewhere, he admitted: [...] "I didn't excel <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area</b> apart from singing; I couldn't read music but I sang quite well." [...] There he helped organise amateur performances of various Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The first of these was The Gondoliers, in which he played the role of the Duchess. The tutors called his performance a great success, and he was given a position within the men's chorus in the next piece, Iolanthe. Over the next few years, he took part in The Mikado {{as a member of the}} chorus, and then appeared as the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance. It was a period which he later acknowledged as being the start of his career. [...] When the war ended in 1918, Edward, who was by now a port officer in Calcutta, arranged for Margaret to return to England. [...] With her, she brought home an orphaned baby girl named Jocelyn, whom she adopted. The following year, Edward retired from active service and returned to England where he relocated his family to Haywards Heath in Sussex. There, Michael developed a love for fishing, a hobby about which he remained passionate for the rest of his life.|$|E
500|$|During the Hundred Years War of the 14th–15th centuries, the English {{government}} {{banned the}} export of horses in times of crisis; in the 16th century, Henry VII passed a number of laws relating to the breeding and export of horses {{in an attempt to}} improve the British stock, under which it was forbidden to allow uncastrated male horses to be turned out in fields or on common land; they had to be [...] "kept within bounds and tied in stalls." [...] This ruling caused inconvenience, and the practice of gelding horses became widespread. In 1535, Henry VIII passed the Breed of Horses Act aimed at improving the height and strength of horses; no stallion under [...] and no mare under 13hands (52inches, 132cm) was permitted to run out on common land, or to run wild, and no two-year-old colt under 11.2hands (46inches, 117cm) was allowed to run out <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>area</b> with mares. Annual round-ups on common land were enforced, and any stallion under the height limit was ordered to be destroyed, along with [...] "all unlikely [...] whether mares or foals." [...] Henry VIII also established a stud for breeding imported horses such as the Spanish Jennet, Neapolitan coursers, Irish Hobbies, Flemish [...] "roiles", or draught horses, and Scottish [...] "nags", or riding horses. However, it was reported in 1577 that this had [...] "little effect"; soon after, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Nicholas Arnold was said to have bred [...] "the best horses in England".|$|E
