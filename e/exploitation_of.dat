40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present a rights-based theory <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> I argue that {{successful}} conceptions <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> should {{begin with the}} ordinary language claim that exploitation involves `taking unfair advantage'.

Existing conceptions <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> fail to provide adequate accounts of both aspects <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Hillel Steiner and John Roemer provide convincing accounts of the unfairness involved in exploitation, but because they fail to provide restrictive `advantage taking' conditions, their theories <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> include cases that we would not ordinarily describe as exploitations. Ruth Sample and Robert Goodin provide accounts that place a stronger emphasis on the attitudes involved in exploitation and the processes that bring it about. Unfortunately, these theories do not properly incorporate the unfairness aspect <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Consequently, they are either self-frustrating or incomplete.

5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> Aboriginal people.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom resource.|$|E
