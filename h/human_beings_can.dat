5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> be explained through the cell cycle. Cells {{are most vulnerable}} {{to the effects of}} radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.|$|E

25|$|For deists, <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> know God only via {{reason and}} the {{observation}} of nature, but not by revelation or supernatural manifestations (such as miracles) – phenomena Deists regard with caution if not skepticism. Deism is related to naturalism because it credits the formation {{of life and the}} universe to a higher power, using only natural processes. Deism may also include a spiritual element, involving experiences of God and nature.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{continued}} to seek {{support from a}} wary Republican electorate; {{at this point in}} the race, his poll numbers were relatively flat and at a historically low level for a Republican frontrunner. After the charges of flip-flopping that marked his 2008 campaign began to accumulate again, Romney declared in November 2011: [...] "I've been as consistent as <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> be." [...] In the final month before voting began, Newt Gingrich experienced a significant surge– taking a solid lead in national polls and most of the early caucus and primary states– before settling back into parity or worse with Romney following a barrage of negative ads from Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney Super PAC.|$|E

Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E
500|$|In 1819, when Peel {{introduced}} a Bill to introduce an eleven-hour day {{for all children}} under 16 working in cotton mills, a Lords Committee heard evidence from a Bolton magistrate who had investigated 29 local cotton mills; 20 had no apprentices but employed a total of 550 children under 14; the other nine mills employed a total of 98 apprentices, {{and a total of}} 350 children under 14. [...] Apprentices were mostly found in the larger mills, which had somewhat better conditions; some even worked a 12-hour day or less (the Grant brothers' mill at Tottington worked an 11.5 hour day: [...] "This establishment has perfect ventilation; all the apprentices, and in fact all the children, are healthy, happy, clean, and well clothed proper and daily attention is paid to their instruction and they regularly attend divine worship on Sundays."): in other mills children worked up to 15 hours a day in bad conditions (e.g. Gortons and Roberts' Elton mill: [...] "Most filthy; no ventilation; the apprentices and other children ragged, puny, not half clothed, and seemingly not half fed; no instruction of any sort; no <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> be more wretched").|$|E

[...] Marshall Fine, of The Huffington Post, praised the film as being [...] "a film that doesn't shy away from the depths to which <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> sink, but it also shows the strength and resilience of which we are capable, even at our lowest moments." [...] Scott Mendelson, also of The Huffington Post, felt that when you put the [...] "glaring issues aside," [...] the film [...] "still works as a potent character study and a glimpse inside a world we'd rather pretend does not exist in America." [...] But while the film [...] "succeeds as a powerful acting treat and a potent character study, there are some major narrative issues that prevent the film from being an accidental masterpiece." [...] Mendelson described the film as being [...] "an acting powerhouse" [...] based on its many emotional themes.|$|E

2500|$|Atonement is a {{doctrine}} that describes how <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> be reconciled to God.
