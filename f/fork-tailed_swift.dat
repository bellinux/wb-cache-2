50|$|The Karajarri {{were divided}} into two {{distinct}} groups, those who inhabited the coastal areas, called Naja (Nadja), and the inlanders dwelling on the eastern plains and bushlands, the Nawutu (Naudu). The social hierarchy was headed by ritual leaders (pirrka, literally roots of a tree),male elders who organized ceremonial life, and who are also responsible for management of the country and the general affairs of tribal members. Members of a Karajarri group were classified in four ways, panaka, purrungu, parrjari and karimpa, a tribal taxonomy that is determined by alternate generation levels distinguished along moiety lines called inara. Thus one inara, represented by the barn swallow (wiyurr), is panaka-purrungu, being constituted by self, grandparents, sisters, brothers, cousins and grandchildren, together with marriageable partners and their siblings, the other, karimpa-parrjarri, is inclusive of ones mother, father, aunts, uncles, great grandparents and grandchildren, and is emblemized in terms of the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>swift</b> (kitirr). Both the kitirr and wiyurr are viewed as heralds of rain.|$|E
