50|$|Environmental {{protection}} in Tanzania began during the German occupation of East Africa (1884-1919) — colonial conservation laws {{for the protection}} of game and forests were enacted, whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities such as hunting, firewood collecting and cattle grazing. In year 1948, Serengeti was officially established as the first national park for wild cats in East Africa. Since 1983, there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level, through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the development of an <b>environmental</b> <b>act.</b> In 1998 Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) start working for environment & forest {{protection in}} India from a small city Sojat.

50|$|Legal {{framework}} also {{exists to}} pressure companies to {{assume responsibility for}} {{the environmental impacts of}} coal industry activities. The National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Act</b> of 1981 allowed for the creation of several government organizations in charge of evaluating the impact of practices potentially harmful to the environment and local communities. It allowed each state and municipality to establish its own environmental regulation system. It also introduced the idea of environmental impact assessment into Brazilian environmental legislation. The Brazilian Constitution (as of 1988) upheld this by obliging mining companies “to reclaim the degraded environment, in accordance with the technical solution demanded by the competent public organization” by repairing environmental damages caused by their activity. They are required to maintain water quality within legal limits and are bound by these requirements even after the closure of the mine.The federal court has taken action to uphold this provision. In 2000, a federal judge in Criciúma, Santa Catarina, ordered the establishment of a three-year recovery project by government-run companies that encompasses damages caused by coal mining activities in the state’s entire coal region. The Supreme Federal Court condemned mining companies and the federal government for not abiding by these obligations and demanded that they take action. The remediation costs can total $20,000 to $40,000 per hectare according to the levels of degradation and intentions for future use. A technical advisory board was created in 2006 to assist the federal court in addressing reclamation actions based on environmental indicators.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{starts with}} the {{practice}} of spatial development, and with legal practice, {{to come up with}} three reasons why a new <b>environmental</b> <b>act</b> is necessary. The Dutch legislature is working on that these years and in its commission we’ve been looking for change within environmental law. Our first step is to use the principles of law {{to move away from the}} current dominance of written law. Second step is to introduce the possibility to trump written law with the principles of the law, because that’s not permitted within Dutch law at this moment. We bring this as a positive bonus: only the initiator of a project that enhances the quality of the environment, may ask to put aside a written rule. The principles of law are here to help justify the decision to put aside a written rule. To enhance this we take our third step: we introduce the principle of positive proportionality. With that we put emphasis on the interests that will benefit from a project. We think that both the positive bonus and benefits should be part of legal reasoning since they can balance the right decision. This brings us to the thesis of positive positive law that gives benefits a place in legal argumentation. To argue for this we will make use of the work of Ronald Dworkin. We end with our suggestion for a set of rules for the New <b>Environmental</b> <b>Act...</b>|$|E

In this paper, the potential for usage of coarse recycled aggregate obtained from crushed concrete for making self-compacting concrete was discussed, emphasizing its ecological value.

In support of this and when competence within the employer’s own organization is insufficient, regulations state that the employer are required to employ external resources such as an Occupational Health Service (OHS) provider. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore how public sector organizations utilised services and support from their OHS provider in preventive OHSM. Eleven public sector organizations were studied, one hundred of respondents (politicians, managers, HR, safety representatives and OHS professionals) interviewed and the data collected qualitatively and thematically analysed. The results showed that the OHS providers do not support the public-sector organisations with preventive OHSM according to the intentions of the legislation. A significant conclusion is that the HR department has an important role in the collaboration and for the utilization of preventive services in OHSM. QC 20171019 </p...|$|E
