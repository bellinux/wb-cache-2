5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed {{next to the}} bridge at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire wrapped around the landing skids of the gliders succeeding <b>in</b> <b>rapidly</b> bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox, which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded.|$|E

This became especially significant as the British restricted export of British coal to the United States after the War of 1812, creating a fuel shortage <b>in</b> <b>rapidly</b> expanding New York City.

25|$|James {{first became}} {{interested}} in the potential for railways and planning possible routes in 1799. As early as 1806 he had realised that the horse-drawn railways that had been a common means of transporting goods in and around collieries for almost two centuries could form the basis of a national system of public transportation. Uniquely among early railway pioneers, he saw the value of railways <b>in</b> <b>rapidly</b> transporting passengers as well as freight and minerals.|$|E

25|$|The {{logistics}} {{in which}} the delivery of humanitarian occurs can be problematic.

Although aid was flown <b>in</b> <b>rapidly,</b> regional belief systems, cultural backgrounds and even language seemed to have been omitted as a source of concern. Items such as religiously prohibited pork, and non-generic forms of medicine that lacked multilingual instructions came flooding in as relief. An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves.|$|E

25|$|LA drugs act {{mainly by}} {{inhibiting}} sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, {{in particular the}} so-called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site {{is thought to be}} located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster <b>in</b> <b>rapidly</b> firing neurons. This is referred to as state-dependent blockade.|$|E
25|$|The board {{determined}} the following Probable Cause for the accident:...the {{failure of the}} flightcrew to monitor altitude and to recognize passage of the aircraft through the approach decision height during an unstabilized precision approach conducted <b>in</b> <b>rapidly</b> changing meteorological conditions. The unstabilized nature of the approach was due initially to the aircraft's passing the outer marker above the glide slope at an excessive airspeed and thereafter compounded by the flightcrew's preoccupation with the questionable information presented by the flight director system. The poor positioning of the flight for the approach was in part the result of nonstandard air traffic control services.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{expanding}} western states, the Federalists had few supporters. Every {{state had}} a distinct political geography that shaped party membership. In Pennsylvania, the Republicans were weakest around Philadelphia and strongest in Scots-Irish {{settlements in the}} west. Members came from all social classes, but came predominantly from the poor, subsistence farmers, mechanics and tradesmen. After the War of 1812, partisanship subsided across the young republic—people called it the Era of Good Feelings. James Monroe narrowly won the party's nomination for President in Congress over William Crawford in 1816 and defeated Federalist Rufus King in the general election.|$|E
