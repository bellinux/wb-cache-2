It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E

This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E

500|$|Musical {{performances}} in the episode attracted mixed reviews. USA Today Robert Bianco deemed the highlight [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>Did</b> <b>for</b> Love", and wrote that Michele's performance [...] "puts every amateur musical performance on every TV talent show this year to shame." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal {{agreed that it was}} the best song of the episode, [...] "done with smart aplomb [...] heart". In contrast, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "non-sequitur song" [...] which [...] "seemed shoehorned in by Michele's agent", Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone deemed it touching but unmemorable, and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

Agnew {{describes how}} Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some {{advice on how to}} dismiss Viv Richards, Botham's great friend: [...] "Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15." [...] Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew's [...] "first illustrious victims in Test cricket".|$|E
500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think {{it is important that the}} artist is enabled to perform with integrity.

500|$|You {{know how}} many verses <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist.

I will be working with some of the same people <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the first album, {{you know what they say}} ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy.

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the Crystal Palace, Grove devoted much of his leisure time to Biblical scholarship. Discovering that there was no full {{concordance}} of the proper names in the Bible, Grove, helped by his wife, began work in 1853 making a complete index of each occurrence of every proper name in the Bible, including the Apocrypha. Between 1860 and 1863, Grove was assistant editor to Sir William Smith in a comprehensive Bible dictionary, contributing more than a thousand pages. Some entries written by Grove, such as that on the prophet Elijah, were equivalent almost to book-length. He visited the Holy Land in 1859 and 1861, and helped to found the Palestine Exploration Fund, of which he became honorary secretary, labouring incessantly on its behalf. The Archbishop of York said that Grove was [...] "virtually the founder and institutor of the Society, and has done wonders for it throughout." [...] Grove later observed, [...] "People will insist on thinking of me as a musician, which I really am not in the very least degree. I took quite as much interest in my investigations into the natural features and the little towns of Palestine which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Smith's Dictionary of the Bible or for Arthur Stanley's Sinai and Palestine, as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Beethoven and Mendelssohn, indeed perhaps more so." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, {{the dance}} musical A Chorus Line emerged from {{recorded}} group therapy-style sessions Michael Bennett conducted with [...] "gypsies"– those who {{sing and dance}} {{in support of the}} leading players– from the Broadway community. From hundreds of hours of tapes, James Kirkwood, Jr. and Nick Dante fashioned a book about an audition for a musical, incorporating many real-life stories from the sessions; some who attended the sessions eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show. With music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Edward Kleban, A Chorus Line first opened at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in lower Manhattan. What initially had been planned as a limited engagement eventually moved to the Shubert Theatre on Broadway for a run of 6,137 performances, becoming the longest-running production in Broadway history up to that time. The show swept the Tony Awards and won the Pulitzer Prize, and its hit song, What <b>I</b> <b>Did</b> <b>for</b> Love, became a standard.|$|E
