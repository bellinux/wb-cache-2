5|$|His father William H. McCudden took a {{post at the}} Air Ministry at {{the rank}} of warrant officer after the Great War, but would die tragically at Clapham Junction railway station on 7 July 1920. When <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to offer a woman his seat the {{compartment}} door flew open, knocking him {{into the path of}} an oncoming train. Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he retired through illness in 1933. He died of colitis the following year, leaving a widow and small daughter.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E

500|$|Nolan is {{also known}} for casting stars from the 1980s in his films, i.e. Rutger Hauer (Batman Begins), Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight), Tom Berenger (Inception), and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). Modine said of working with Nolan: [...] "There are no chairs on a Nolan set, {{he gets out of}} his car and goes to the set. And <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> until lunchtime. And then <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> until they say 'Wrap'. He's fully engaged – in every aspect of the film." ...|$|R

5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made a run for it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up.</b> The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

25|$|While {{serving in}} the DCNO/DNI roles, he also took on the {{position}} of Directory of Navy Cybersecurity, becoming the Navy's leading proponent for cybersecurity. In this role, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> a year-long matrixed organization called Task Force Cyber Awakening {{to develop and implement}} Navy’s cybersecurity strategy. That group developed the CYBERSAFE program to design and build in cyber resiliency, and inculcate an enhanced culture of cybersecurity throughout the U.S. Navy. When the Task Force completed their efforts, <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> the Navy Cybersecurity Division within N2N6 so the process of instituting CYBERSAFE and a culture of cybersecurity could continue.|$|E

25|$|He {{was engaged}} by the Oxford Players, {{where he worked}} {{with the likes of}} John Gielgud and Robert Morley.

Fagan realized that Napier was even taller than Guthrie when <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> but honoured his commitment. Napier performed for ten years (1929–1939) on the West End stage.|$|E
