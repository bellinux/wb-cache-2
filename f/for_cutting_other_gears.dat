50|$|He {{returned}} to Florence in March 1894 {{to work at}} the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova, and continued as a proponent of the lateral pubiotomy using the wire saw despite lack of support from colleagues in Italy. He also described the use of his saw <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>other</b> bones, excepting the skull, in 1897; Professor Alfred Obalinski of Kraków then described its use for craniotomy in the same year.|$|R
50|$|In {{woodworking}} {{the term}} circular saw is {{most commonly used}} to refer to a hand-held, electric circular saw designed <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> wood, but may be used <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>other</b> materials with different blades. Circular saws can be either left or right-handed, depending {{on the side of the}} blade where the motor sits. A left-handed saw is typically easier to use if held in the right hand, and contrariwise for the right-handed saw, because the user does not need to lean across the saw to see the cutting line.|$|R

40|$|When {{stainless}} steel, {{a difficult}} work material, is cut, cutting forces increase and cutting temperature rises significantly. Consequently, the tool life of high-speed steel becomes markedly short. To reduce the cutting temperature, the tool is cooled internally with water, {{and to reduce}} cutting forces, high-velocity cutting oil is applied. With the method of cooling and lublication technique tool life becomes far longer, compared with that in ordinary cutting. Accordingly, this procedure would be very effective <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>other</b> difficult work materials...|$|R

50|$|A head spade is an {{instrument}} used in whaling.

5000|$|The haircut {{is usually}} done with {{electric}} clippers utilizing the clipper over comb technique, {{though it can}} also be cut shears over comb or freehand with a clipper.

50|$|A marking gauge, {{also known}} as a scratch gauge, is used in {{woodworking}} and metalworking to mark out lines <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> or <b>other</b> operations. The purpose of the gauge is to scribe a line parallel to a reference edge or surface. It is used in joinery and sheetmetal operations.|$|R

50|$|Japanese knives feature subtle {{variations}} on the chisel grind: {{the back side of}} the blade is often concave, to reduce drag and adhesion so the food separates more cleanly; this feature is known as urasuki. The kanisaki deba, used <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> crab and <b>other</b> shellfish, has the grind on the opposite side (left side angled for right-handed use), so that the meat is not cut when chopping the shell.|$|R
5000|$|A string trimmer, {{also called}} a [...] "weed-whip", [...] "whipper-snipper", [...] "weed-whacker", a [...] "weed eater", a [...] "line trimmer" [...] (in Australia) or a [...] "strimmer" [...] (in the UK and Ireland), {{is a tool}} which uses a {{flexible}} monofilament line instead of a blade <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> grass and <b>other</b> plants near objects, or on steep or irregular terrain. It consists of a cutting tip {{at the end of}} a long shaft with a handle.|$|R

"We will do that," [...] Aska said, [...] "we {{have more}} than we require;" [...] for indeed after the battle with Cerealis and the sack of the towns all the men had taken Roman swords and carried them in {{addition}} to their own weapons, regarding them not only as trophies but as infinitely superior to their own more clumsy implements <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> wood and <b>other</b> purposes. At a word from Beric four of these were brought and handed to the men, who took them with lively satisfaction.|$|R
40|$|The degree {{project at}} hand investigates how {{large areas of}} older forest (80 plus years) {{suitable}} <b>for</b> clear <b>cutting</b> there is on the Swedish island of Gotland. Large areas of older forest on Gotland are situated on land with shallow soil depths which are economically uninteresting and often unsuitable <b>for</b> clear <b>cutting</b> forestry. <b>Other</b> forests hold big nature conservation values and should not, or cannot, be used for forestry purposes. The survey is made as a GIS analysis based on the old but carefully made “Brief forest inventory” (ÖSI) made in the 1980 s and early 1990 s. A sample from the inventory is combined with studies of orthophotos, satellite photos and other GIS layers that display estimated soil depth and nature conservation values. Partly contrary to common belief, the survey shows {{that there are still}} large areas of older forest suitable <b>for</b> clear <b>cutting</b> forestry on the island. However, the numbers presented are significantly lower than those presented by the Swedish National Forest Inventory...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} plan of operations to support the scientific observation hole (SOH) program in the Kilauea middle east rift zone. The SOH is for scientific observation purposes only. The core hole will not be flowtested or produced. The information {{to be gained from}} the SOH will provide an assessment of subsurface geological conditions, groundwater level and composition, temperature, drilling conditions, an inventory of possible mineral and geothermal resources, and an eruptive history of the island to the depth drilled. The plan addresses the drilling program and schedule, project area and drill site description, well bore description, planned access, source of water, major project facilities and equipment for drilling activities, other areas of potential surface disturbance, disposal procedures <b>for</b> drill <b>cuttings</b> and <b>other</b> waste, and monitoring plans and programs for review and approval...|$|R
25|$|Hobbing is a {{machining}} process <b>for</b> gear <b>cutting,</b> cutting splines, and cutting sprockets on a hobbing machine, {{which is a}} special type of milling machine. The teeth or splines are progressively cut into the workpiece {{by a series of}} cuts made by a cutting tool called a hob. Compared to <b>other</b> <b>gear</b> forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.|$|R
50|$|Alligator shears {{are used}} <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> long metal stock or scrap, {{generally}} where accuracy {{is not an}} important consideration, and the size or shape of the material makes <b>other</b> <b>cutting</b> or shearing options impractical- often the only <b>other</b> <b>cutting</b> option is cutting with a torch. Alligator shears are often {{used in conjunction with}} large metal shredders in the metal recycling industry, to 'clean' or prepare scrap for shredding by removing unwanted fittings or other parts the shredder will not accept.|$|R
5000|$|Chisel grind — As on a chisel, {{only one}} side is ground (often at an edge angle of about 20 - 30°); the other remains flat. As many Japanese culinary knives tend to be chisel ground they are often sharper than a typical double {{bevelled}} Western culinary knife; a chisel grind has only a single edge angle; if a sabre ground blade has the same edge angle as a chisel grind, it still has angles {{on both sides of}} the blade centerline, and so has twice the included angle. Knives that are chisel ground come in left and right-handed varieties, depending upon which side is ground. Japanese knives feature subtle variations on the chisel grind: firstly, the back side of the blade is often concave, to reduce drag and adhesion so the food separates more cleanly; this feature is known as urasuki. Secondly, the kanisaki deba, used <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> crab and <b>other</b> shellfish, has the grind on the opposite side (left side angled for right-handed use), so that the meat is not cut when chopping the shell.|$|R

25|$|By the mid-20th century, the {{knowledge}} of making amate paper was kept alive only in a few small towns in the rugged mountains of Puebla and Veracruz states, such as San Pablito, an Otomi village and Chicontepec, a Nahua village. It was particularly strong in San Pablito in Puebla {{as many of the}} villages around it believed this paper has special power when used in rituals. The making of paper here until the 1960s was strictly the purview of the shamans, who kept the process secret, making paper primarily to be used <b>for</b> <b>cutting</b> gods and <b>other</b> figures for ritual. However, these shamans came into contact with anthropologists, learning of the interest that people on the outside had for their paper and their culture. But although the ritual cutting of paper remained important for the Otomi people of northern Puebla, the use of amate paper was declining, with industrial paper or tissue paper replacing amate paper in rituals. One stimulus for amate's commercialization was the shamans' growing realization of the commercial value of the paper; they began to sell cutouts of bark paper figures on a small scale in Mexico City along with other Otomi handcrafts.|$|R
