40|$|This transdisciplinary {{study has}} a {{three-fold}} systems approach in evaluating a horticultural technology: 1) horticultural evaluations, 2) economic and resource analyses, and 3) systems engineering analyses, using low temperature storage {{as an example}} technology. Vegetable grafting is a technique to produce value-added seedlings but requires labor intensive nursery operations. Low temperature storage of seedlings {{for a short period}} of time can reduce peak production, but has not been evaluated at the extent demonstrated in this paper. Seedlings of 22 genotypes of Cucurbitaceae (cucurbit family) and Solanaceae (nightshade family) were evaluated for storability under selected temperatures and photosynthetic photon flux. Storability of Cucurbitaceous seedlings varied between 2 to 4 weeks at 12 °C and 13 μmol m- 2 s- 1. Solanaceous seedlings were generally storable for 4 weeks at 12 °C and 13 μmol m- 2 s- 1, but tomato seedlings could be stored for 4 weeks at 10 °C and 5 μmol m- 2 s- 1. Capital and weekly operational costs of a low temperature storage system with a design that meets environmental requirements were estimated as $ 671 to $ 708 per m 2 footprint and $ 0. 79 to $ 2. 21 per m 2 footprint per week, respectively. Electricity costs per plant was less than 0. 1 cents for 2 to 4 weeks of storage. Using a schedule-optimization heuristic and a logistics simulator previously developed for <b>grafting</b> <b>nursery</b> operations, six production scenarios consisting of two crops (tomato or watermelon) and three production peak patterns were examined to evaluate the impact of including low temperature storage. While the overall average costs of grafting labor were not significantly different, maximum labor demand and grafting labor cost during the peak production week were reduced by 31 % to 50 % and 14 % to 30 % by using storage, respectively.

40|$|Grapevine nursery production, strictly-regulated by EU norms, {{represents}} the {{important first step}} in the wine production process, because it’s able to strongly influence both the quali-quantitative performance of farm investments and the type and the quality of wines, with consequences on profitability. The latest reform of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for wine took effect on August the 1 st 2008 and introduced, among many initiatives oriented towards enhancing the competitiveness of the wine sector, a new voluntary three-year grubbing-up scheme from the 2008 / 2009 season, achieving a balanced wine market, reducing surplus production and providing an alternative for uncompetitive producers. This new policy is therefore mainly directed to increase product quality, as demanded from both domestic and foreign markets, without neglecting aspects relating to environmental safeguard in wine regions. Even grapevine nursery sector had been involved in guidelines set out in the new CMO for wine. This new regulatory framework, aiming to strengthen the entire chain, requires propagating material both with genetic-sanitary certification and consistent with recent market trends; in this meaning, it’s important to take account of either market signs concerning the varietal choices and the need to renew vineyards which have {{come to the end of}} their natural and economic life. <b>Graft</b> <b>nursery</b> activity, in fact, is closely correlated with wine market trend, both in terms of quantity and mainly quality, in relation to the meaning and the contents that the consumer assigns to the beverage "wine" (commodity, brand or private label, image or terroir, a mix of the three). However, it is common knowledge that market trends are unpredictable, just as consumer tastes can change abruptly; consequently, the market demand for propagating material is characterized by randomness too. Therefore, on planning the grapevine nursery production a key role is played on the one hand by nurserymen -on behalf of their knowledge of market trends, their experience, and their instinct too-, and on the other hand by the very specific combination of variety, clone and rootstock chosen by entrepreneurs depending on what will fit the profile of the their wine and what may fit their business requirement in the best way. The recently increased prestige of Sicilian viticulture and wines, the remarkable technical and managerial skills of entrepreneurs and the favourable climatic and soil environment, exert a positive influence on Sicilian <b>graft</b> <b>nursery</b> activity that takes on the meaning of an important economic activity.

Research was initiated to determine the pathogenic diversity of pepper spot, with emphasis on avocado. Eighty C. gloeosporioides isolates obtained from avocado and mango fruit showing anthracnose and pepper spot symptoms were screened for pathogenicity, comparative aggressiveness and cross-infection potential by inoculating onto detached avocado and mango fruit, avocado leaf petioles and branches of young, <b>grafted</b> <b>nursery</b> trees, as well as avocado fruit and pedicels still attached to the tree. On detached, ripening avocado and mango fruit in the laboratory, {{it was found that}} pepper spot isolates were as capable as anthracnose isolates of causing anthracnose lesions. However, avocado isolates were significantly (P 0. 05) more aggressive than mango isolates on avocado fruit and mango isolates were significantly (P 0. 05) more aggressive than avocado isolates on mango fruit. In field inoculations, pepper spots were formed on developing avocado fruit and pedicels on the tree. Likewise, pepper spots developed on petioles and branches of nursery avocado trees, but not on their leaves. When all isolates were grouped according to symptom or host of origin, significant differences in lesion severity were demonstrated between isolates on avocado petioles in the glasshouse, with avocado pepper spot isolates being the most aggressive, followed by avocado anthracnose isolates then mango isolates from both anthracnose and pepper spot, respectively. On unripe avocado fruit in the field, the pattern was generally similar with the mango isolates being the least aggressive. There were more and less pathogenic strains present in the pathogen populations from both mango fruit and avocado fruit but neither were restricted to anthracnose or pepper spot groupings. Generally, a higher percentage of the most aggressive isolates was from avocado pepper spot.

The first treatment was applied at 70 -cm height of nursery trees and the second 2 weeks later. Comparison was performed in relation to untreated control. An application of BA and BA+GA 4 + 7 did not affect both rootstock and nursery tree diameter at 10 cm above the <b>grafting</b> union. <b>Nursery</b> trees of cultivar Jonagold were not influenced by treatments applied, whereas in cultivar Čadel, the treatment with BA+GA 4 + 7 decreased apical growth of nursery trees.

In November, 1993, an initial hot water dip study involved dipping all life stages of phylloxera and five different rootstocks (not grafted) in 125 °F water for 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 minutes. Three root pieces with established populations of eggs, nymphs, and adults were dipped for each time treatment. After the heat treatment, the root pieces were placed in petri dishes and stored in an incubator. Data on percent survival for each life stage and amount of time to kill all life stages were collected. The results showed that all life stages were killed at the five minute dip in 125 °F water. The five rootstocks studied were Pinot Noir, 5 C, 101 - 14, 3309 C, and Freedom. The dormant plants were removed from their pots, washed free of soil, and pruned to 4 buds and 6 " root length. Control plants were dipped in 70 °F for 10 minutes (5 minutes as a pre-dip and 5 minutes for the time needed to eradicate the insect).

Black foot pathogens were not isolated from grafted cuttings prior to planting. Additional treatments involved soil amendments with Tricboderma formulations and hot water treatment of dormant nursery grapevines. Field trials were evaluated after eight months.

Therefore, it has suitable tract of land to grow temperate, subtropical and tropical fruit crops. In 2007, fruits were identified as a potential marketable commodity by the stakeholders participating in the IPMS project. They diagnosed that farmers had limited orchard management knowledge and skill and were growing locally available less productive and low quality fruit varieties. In addition, the linkage among fruit production stakeholders was very weak. Moreover, fruit seedlings from local seeds were only multiplied and distributed from the government fruit nursery and the supply was inadequate. Therefore, {{the quantity and quality of}} fruit produced in the district was still very low. The stakeholders also identified possible interventions along the value chain and subsequently intervened in capacity building (orchard management and propagation techniques), improved varieties introduction, input supply (established private <b>nurseries,</b> introduced <b>grafting</b> in government <b>nurseries),</b> stakeholders linkage and marketing of outputs.

Crown gall is commonly found among Oregon vineyards and the causative agent, Agrobacterium vitis, is known to be present in the vascular system of many symptomless plants. Wounds are required for infection to take place. Crown gall usually develops when the plants are wounded by freeze damage. However, the emphasis on planting grafted plants with phylloxera resistant rootstocks has resulted in increased production of <b>grafted</b> plants at <b>nurseries,</b> and this has been accompanied by a high incidence of crown gall appearing at the wound site of the graft union. Heat treatments in Australia have been shown to reduce the incidence of crown gall but need to be tested in Oregon using grape rootstock and scion wood that will be used in Oregon vineyards. The high variability among agrobacteria strains on gapevines also dictates that treatments be conducted using strains commonly found in Oregon vineyards. In 1994 agrobacteria were isolated from eight vineyards and three nurseries from the Dundee, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene and Medford areas of the state. Plant sources included both grafted and nongrafted plants. Pathogenic strains were found among the 2, 286 isolates characterized from vineyards and nurseries. More pathogenic isolates could be detected on plants where tumors had developed within the last year than on those with older tumors.

40|$|Indigenous fruits/nuts of Africa’s {{humid tropics}} are {{increasingly}} being recognized for their contribution to food security, health (nutrition/medicine), income generation, employment and environmental benefits. However, cultivation of the trees yielding these fruits/nuts is constrained by lack of improved planting materials that are true-to-type and have a short enough juvenile phase to fruit production. In addition, information on both above and belowground growth attributes of these species is scarce. This paper presents {{an overview of the}} results of a doctoral research focused on two African indigenous fruit tree species, i. e. Dacryodes edulis (G. Don) H. J. Lam (Burseraceae) and Allanblackia floribunda Oliv. (Clusiaceae), which are currently under domestication. For D. edulis, the objective was to assess and compare the structural and fine rooting systems together with the above ground growth attributes of fruiting trees propagated either sexually or vegetatively. The research aim for A. floribunda was to shorten the long juvenile phase before first fruiting through grafting techniques. In summary, the results from the studies on D. edulis suggest that vegetative propagation of the species, reduces the long juvenile phase to fruiting and maintains trueness in the transfer of desirable traits over generations, it also results in trees that are apparently less competitive for below ground resources, have more stable root system, and are bigger in stature and higher in carbon sinks compared to trees of seed origin. In parallel, A. floribunda was shown to be amenable to <b>grafting</b> both under <b>nursery</b> and field (in situ) conditions. Furthermore, a grafted A. floribunda tree transplanted in the field in 2007, flowered and carried a single fruit to maturity after 4 years, thereby reducing the long juvenile period to first fruit production from about 10 - 12 years reported in literature to less than 5 years. The findings of this doctoral research are therefore pertinent to efforts towards indigenous fruit/nut tree domestication. However, research should be confirmed as it can be considered a pilot study, one that aims to obtain insights into the effect of vegetative propagation methods on above and below ground growth and development of improved planting materials of D. edulis and A. floribunda under domestication...|$|R

There is little information about tolerant, or likewise promising, varieties of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) that could be used in studies related to host resistance. However, previous studies have indicated some tolerance to CVC in the Navelina ISA 315 cultivar. Based on such information, this study has sought to quantify the tolerance level that Navelina ISA 315 has to CVC through visual observation of typical symptoms in the field, in conjunction with the presence and quantification of X. fastidiosa by PCR and quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR). The results confirmed preliminary information that Navelina ISA 315 is tolerant to CVC, based on its near absence of symptoms and the low population of pathogen observed in this cultiva...|$|R

Kao pokazatelj kompatibilnosti poslužio je je prinos visokokvalitetnih loznih kalemova, sadržaj suve materije u zrelim lastarima i razvijenost korenovog sistema. Oba klona sorte Chardonnay su najviši prinos kalemova I klase ostvarili na loznoj podlozi 41 B, gde je razvijena i najveća masa korenovog sistema, zatim na podlozi Kober 5 BB, dok su statistički značajno nizi prinosi ostvareni na loznoj podlozi SO 4. Sadržaj suve materije u zrelim lastarima ukazuje na dobru sazrelost lastara klonova sorte Chardonnay u svim varijantama ogleda. Klonovi sorte Merlot su ispoljili visok stepen kompatibilnosti sa podlogom Kober 5 BB. U istoj varijanti ogleda ostvarena je i najveća masa korenovog sistema. Nezadovoljavajuća kompatibilnost ostvarena je pri kalemljenju klonova sorte Merlot na loznoj podlozi SO 4, na šta ukazuje značajno niži prinos kalemova I klase u poređenju sa vrednostima ostvarenim pri kalemljenju na druge istraživane lozne podloge. Level of affi nity between grapevine {{rootstock}} and Vitis vinifera as scion, {{quality of}} reproductive materials and technological actions in grapevine rootstock production process determine success in grapevine rootstock production in large extent. Practical training showed that difference in level of compatibility between grapevine rootstock and grafted Vitis vinifera cultivars are existing. Direct {{effects of these}} differences are unequal yield of fi rst class grafted grapevine rootlings. In this paper, level of compatibility in nursery between clones of cv. Chardonnay BCL 75, VCR 4 and cv. Merlot R 18, MCL 519 and grapevine rootstocks Kober 5 BB (Vitis berlandieri x V. riparia), SO 4 (V. berlandieri x V. riparia) and 41 B (Chasselas x V. berlandieri) were investigated. The trial was conducted in commercial grapevine nursery located in Velika Drenova, Serbia. As an index of compatibility, grade of high quality grapevine grafted rootlings, dry matter in mature shoots and root system development were used. Grafting was done by `tongue grafting` indoor technique. Stratifi cation was done in sand, on temperature of the stratifi cation material of 26 - 28 oC, and humidity of around 90 %. Grafted cuttings were waxed twice: before stratifi cation, and before planting in the <b>nursery.</b> <b>Grafted</b> rootlings were classed in two classes according to regulations of quality, (Yugoslav Offi cial Register, 26 / 79). Grafted rootlings that did not satisfi ed standard criteria were discarded. Both clones of cv. Chardonnay gave {{the highest percentage of}} I class grafted rootlings on grapevine rootstock 41 B: clone BCL 75 – 60 % and clone VCR 4 – 61 %. In the same combination, those grapevine grafted rootlings had the highest weight of the root system. Lower percentage of obtained I class grafted rootlings was established on rootstock Kober 5 BB, while statistically signifi cantly lower yields were obtained on grapevine rootstock SO 4 : clone BCL 75 – 43 % and clone VCR 4 – 48 %. Dry matter content in mature shoots is showing good maturity of shoots in cv. Chardonnay in all experiment combinations and varies from 53 % up to 54 %. Clones of Merlot, in this investigation, showed the highest level of compatibility with rootstock Kober 5 BB. Percentage of I class grafted rootlings on this rootstock for clone R 18 was 66 %, and for clone MCL 519 was 62 %. In the same experiment combination the highest root weight was established as well. The low degree of grafting compatibility was obtained by grafting Merlot clones on rootstock SO 4, that is shown by signifi cantly lower percentage of produced I class grafted rootlings in relation to obtained values by grafting on other examined grapevine rootstocks (clone R 18 /SO 4 – 51 %; clone MCL 519 /SO 4 – 50 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of domesticating and integrating high value fruit trees in agricultural landscapes by farmers is increasingly being {{recognized in the}} humid tropics. However in an agroforestry context, the growth attributes of intercropped trees above and belowground determine whether the association will be complementary or competitive. The focus of the present research was on two African indigenous fruit tree species (Dacryodes edulis G. Don) H. J. Lam (Burseraceae) and Allanblackia floribunda Oliv. (Clusiaceae), which are currently under domestication, and have high food, income and environmental security values. On D. edulis, the thrust was to assess and compare the structural and fine rooting systems together with the aboveground growth attributes of fruiting trees propagated sexually and vegetatively, while on A. floribunda, {{the focus was on}} how to reduce the long juvenile phase of about 10 - 12 years before first fruiting to less than 5 years through grafting techniques. The results of the investigations on D. edulis indicate that trees of seed origin were characterized by a tap root, reaching depths of about 1. 20 m, whereas, trees of cutting origin showed three strong vertical roots (d > 5 mm) with the longest reaching depths of 1. 31 m. Similarly, trees of marcot origin were observed to have thick, relatively short prominent vertical roots, reaching depths of 1. 15 m. In addition, trees of seed origin had greater fine root density (RD) (P ≤ 0. 001) than trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) in the upper soil stratum (0 - 30 cm). Trees of seed origin were also shown to have an exponential distribution pattern for fine root density and root length within depth to 80 cm. In contrast, the distribution pattern of fine roots of trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) were quadratic for the same variables which increased in the 20 - 30 cm soil depth stratum before declining steadily to a depth of 80 cm. Furthermore, shoot density, defined as, number of shoots per tree, and height differed significantly (p= 0. 004 and p= 0. 005, respectively) amongst tree origins. Trees of seed and cutting origins had single-stem shoots whereas marcots had 6 shoots per tree on average. Trees of cutting origin grew tallest, with mean height of 8. 4 ± 2. 2 m compared to 6. 7 ± 0. 9 m and 7. 6 ± 1. 9 m for trees of marcot or seed origins respectively. Mean carbon (C) sequestration estimated using allometric models differed significantly (p= 0. 014) between trees of vegetative origin and those of seed origin, with 10 years old D. edulis trees of cutting and marcot origins sequestrating averagely 26. 8 ± 19. 1 Mg C ha- 1 and 21. 74 ± 12. 8 Mg C ha- 1 respectively over 10 years, compared to 13. 10 ± 9. 4 Mg C ha- 1 for trees of seed origin. In summary, the results from the studies on D. edulis suggest that vegetative propagation on the species, besides reducing the long juvenile phase to fruiting and maintaining trueness in the transfer of desirable traits over generations, also results in trees that are apparently less competitive for belowground resources. In addition, vegetative propagated trees of D. edulis were shown to have apparently stable root system and the trees bigger in stature and higher in carbon sinks than trees of seed origin. In parallel, A. floribunda scions were taken from female trees, and grafted onto rootstocks using side tongue, top cleft, side veneer, and whip-and-tongue methods under nursery conditions. In a separate experiment, side tongue and inverted ‘T’ budding methods were also tested in situ on young A. floribunda wildings growing under semi-deciduous and evergreen tree covers. In addition, the effects of protecting side tongue grafts with non-perforated, translucent plastic, perforated translucent plastic and aluminium foil were assessed. A. floribunda was shown to be amenable to <b>grafting</b> both under <b>nursery</b> and field (in situ) conditions. Under nursery conditions, side tongue grafts were significantly more successful (80. 0 ± 6. 3 %), than grafts of side veneer (52. 5 ± 7. 9 %), top cleft (55. 0 ± 7. 9 %) and whip–and-tongue (50. 0 ± 7. 9 %). The success of side tongue grafts was further increased (86. 7 ± 6. 2 %) under evergreen shade when grafts were protected by non-perforated translucent plastic. A grafted A. floribunda tree transplanted in the field in 2007 flowered and carried a single fruit to maturity after 4 years, thereby reducing the long juvenile period to first fruit production of about 10 - 12 years reported in literature to less than 5 years. In conclusion, the effect of propagation methods on the belowground and aboveground growth attributes and their C storage potential studied in the present research on D. edulis, have not yet been studied and published anywhere according to the authors knowledge. Similarly, the reduced long juvenile period to first fruit production to less than 5 years in A. floribunda grafts reported in this research is the first published prove of concept on this species according to the author’s knowledge. Therefore, the research results presented in this thesis should be considered as pilot case studies aimed at obtaining insights into the effect of vegetative propagation methods on the above and belowground growth and development of improved planting materials of these two African indigenous fruit trees (Dacryodes edulis and Allanblackia floribunda) under domestication...|$|R
