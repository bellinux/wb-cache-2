It was from a translation of this Indian text on mathematics (c. 770) that Islamic mathematicians were introduced to this numeral system, which they adapted as Arabic numerals. Islamic scholars carried knowledge of this number system to Europe by the 12th century, and it has now displaced all older number systems throughout the world. Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the Brahmi numerals. Each of the roughly dozen major scripts of India has its own numeral glyphs. In the 10th century, Halayudha's commentary on Pingala's work contains a study of the Fibonacci sequence and Pascal's triangle, and describes the formation of a matrix.|$|E
500|$|A [...] (or [...] ) clause is {{a string}} of characters, each of which {{represents}} {{a portion of the}} data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a [...] indicates a <b>decimal</b> <b>digit,</b> and an [...] indicates that the item is signed. Other picture characters (called [...] and [...] characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of [...] characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a [...] to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, [...] is equivalent to [...] Picture specifications containing only digit (...) and sign (...) characters define purely [...] data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic (...) or alphanumeric (...) characters define [...] data items. The presence of other formatting characters define [...] or [...] data items.|$|E

This means that arbitrary numbers of <b>decimal</b> <b>digits</b> (not just multiples of three digits) can be encoded efficiently. For example, 38=12×3+2 <b>decimal</b> <b>digits</b> can be encoded in 12×10+7=127 bits - that is, 12 sets of three <b>decimal</b> <b>digits</b> can be encoded using 12 sets of ten binary bits and the remaining two <b>decimal</b> <b>digits</b> can be encoded using a further seven binary bits.|$|R

In 628 AD, Brahmagupta suggested that gravity was a force of attraction. He also lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and a <b>decimal</b> <b>digit,</b> along with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout the world. Arabic translations of the two astronomers' texts were soon available in the Islamic world, introducing what would become Arabic numerals to the Islamic World by the 9th century.

2500|$|Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas {{had been}} {{developed}} at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability. [...] Harry Nyquist's 1924 paper, Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed, contains a theoretical section quantifying [...] "intelligence" [...] and the [...] "line speed" [...] at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation [...] (recalling Boltzmann's constant), where W is the speed of transmission of intelligence, m {{is the number of}} different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and K is a constant. [...] Ralph Hartley's 1928 paper, Transmission of Information, uses the word information as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other, thus quantifying information as , where S was the number of possible symbols, and n the number of symbols in a transmission. The unit of information was therefore the <b>decimal</b> <b>digit,</b> which has since sometimes been called the hartley in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information. Alan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers.|$|E
