50|$|The {{materials}} used for both clothing and accessories changed during this era. Increasingly used were <b>easy-care</b> synthetic fabrics such as Crimplene, Dacron and Terylene. The benefits of such synthetic fabrics were {{that they were}} crease-resistant, easy to wash, and required little to no ironing. Designers such as Cristóbal Balenciaga embraced these new types of materials, using them in oversized dolman-sleeve jackets. The pattern for this piece was cut in a rectangular shape forming a boxy blousy look.|$|E
50|$|The ewes lamb {{easily and}} very few indeed have to be {{assisted}} as {{there is little or}} no bearing trouble. It is these characteristics that derive from the better shape of the pelvis of the ewe and the narrower head and shoulders of the lamb. While easy lambing is the main feature of <b>easy-care,</b> two other features are significant. Coopworths are open faced and require no eyewigging. At shearing the points are clear but this makes for extra weight of the ewes.|$|E
50|$|The archetypal tote {{is made of}} sturdy cloth, {{perhaps with}} thick leather at its handles or bottom; leather {{versions}} often have a pebbled surface. Common fabrics include heavy canvas, possibly dyed, or treated to resist moisture and mold. Jute is another traditional material, though less popular. In recent decades, heavy nylon and other <b>easy-care</b> synthetics have become common, although these may degrade with prolonged sun-exposure. Many of today's inexpensive or free totes are often made from recycled matter, from minimally-processed natural fibers, or from byproducts of processes that refine organic materials.|$|E
5000|$|One {{result of}} the Post-World War II {{economic}} expansion was a flood of synthetic fabrics and <b>easy-care</b> processes. [...] "Drip-dry" [...] nylon, orlon and dacron, which could retain heat-set pleats after washing, became immensely popular. Acrylic, polyester, triacetate and spandex were all introduced in the 1950s. During the 1940s nylon stockings were an incredibly popular product as they were a lightweight alternative to silk and wool stockings. For the duration of WW2 the Du Pont company produced nylon exclusively for the war effort. At the end of 1945 the demand for nylon stockings {{was so great that}} Nylon riots ensued at stores selling the products.|$|E
50|$|They {{are mainly}} raised for wool and meat {{production}} especially when crossed with the progeny of a Welsh Mountain ewe. For example, a purebred upland ewe {{such as a}} Welsh Mountain ewe, might be bred with a breeding sire Bluefaced Leicester ram. This is a Welsh Mule, one of {{many different types of}} half-bred ewes. The lamb produced when a half-bred ewe is crossed with a Suffolk ram (as well as with other terminal sire breeds such as Texel, Beltex, or Charollais) is considered ideal for meat production, since they have unusually good conformation. The lamb has the <b>easy-care</b> benefits of a mountain ewe, as well as the excellent growth of the Suffolk ram. The Suffolk breed is also more resistant to elf fire, a disease brought on by eating, among others, the bog asphodel. Sunlight worsens the condition, but the black head and ears of the Suffolk limit sunlight down to the otherwise exposed skin.|$|E
5000|$|Easycare is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} in the 1960s in the United Kingdom for meat. [...] It was derived from Nelson Welsh Mountain sheep (a Welsh Mountain and Cheviot cross) which were crossed twice to the Wiltshire Horn, which is a wool-shedding breed. The progeny were selected for: wool shedding, no horns, and <b>easy-care</b> traits. Most animals in the wild thicken up their coats in winter and then moult when spring comes, but many modern sheep breeds were selectively bred for thick coats which are retained for shearing. With {{the decline in the}} worldwide wool markets, a thick coat is now less desirable, especially where the cost of shearing is higher than the value of the wool produced. In this respect, the Easycare breed is an interesting reversal of centuries of practice in sheep breed development as the sheep naturally shed their coats in spring, a process called rooing. Like many other sheep, Easycare sheep cannot live without the necessary grooming that is shearing every now and then.|$|E
50|$|In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company {{correlated}} breast {{size and}} the degree they sag to letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, and D. Camp's advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of Corset and Underwear Review. These procedures were only designed to help women with the then-standard sizes A through D up to a size 38 band size and were {{not intended to be}} used for larger-breasted women. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Other companies like the Model and Fay-Miss (renamed in 1935 as the Bali Brassiere Company) also began to offer A, B, C and D cups in the late 1930s. Catalog companies continued to use the designations Small, Medium and Large through the 1940s. In the 1930s, Dunlop chemists were able to reliably transform rubber latex into elastic thread. Man-made fibres were quickly adopted by the industry because of their <b>easy-care</b> properties. Since a brassiere must be laundered frequently, this was of great importance. In 1937, Warners added cup sizes (A, B, C and D) to their product line, and other manufacturers gradually followed, but Britain did not take up the American standard until the 1950s. Maidenform introduced brassieres with seamless cups in 1933, but resisted using cup sizes for its products until 1949.|$|E
50|$|As more generic, {{versatile}} sportswear {{became more}} {{prominent in the}} Paris collections, the press increasingly promoted the wearing of such garments in an everyday context. By the mid-1920s, American advertisers also began actively pushing the idea that sporty clothing was just as appropriate for regular daywear {{as it was for}} active pursuits, presenting it as the epitome of modernity and the American ideal. One advertisement put out by Abercrombie & Fitch in Vogue in 1929 suggested that while men might admire a girl in an glamorous evening gown, they would be less intimidated by her approachable, friendly appearance in good-quality sportswear. Sportswear was also presented as an accessible version of resort wear, a term for the luxurious travelling clothing and holiday wear worn by those who could afford a leisurely lifestyle with multiple vacations, such as cruises, yachting, and skiing. Affordable, well-designed all-American sportswear was presented as a way of enabling a less wealthy customer to feel part of that same lifestyle. Although the influence of Europe, particularly Parisian high fashion and English tailoring, was always significant, the Great Depression which started in 1929 acted as a trigger to encourage American fashion to focus on homegrown style and design - particularly sportswear. Despite the acceptance of fashionable sportswear as a form of casual dressing in French fashion in the 1920s, the American garment industry {{went on to become the}} most prominent producers of such clothing. The key difference between French and American sportswear was that French sportswear was usually a small part of a high-end designer's output, while the American sportswear designers focused on affordable, versatile, <b>easy-care</b> garments that could be mass-produced and were relevant to the customer's lifestyle, enabling the modern, increasingly emancipated woman to dress herself without a maid's assistance.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{reliability}} and {{construct validity of the}} <b>EASY-Care</b> Two-step Older persons Screening (<b>EASY-Care</b> TOS), a practice-based tool that helps family physicians (FPs) to identify their frail older patients. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This validation study was conducted in six FP practices. We determined the construct validity by comparing the results of the <b>EASY-Care</b> TOS with other commonly used frailty constructs [Fried Frailty Criteria (FFC), Frailty Index (FI) ] and with other related constructs (ie, multimorbidity, disability, cognition, mobility, mental well-being, and social context). To determine interrater reliability, an independent second <b>EASY-Care</b> TOS assessment was made for a subpopulation. RESULTS: We included 587 older patients (mean age 77 +/- 5 years, 56 % women). According to <b>EASY-Care</b> TOS, 39. 4 % of patients were frail. <b>EASY-Care</b> TOS frailty correlated better with FI frailty (0. 63) than with FFC frailty (0. 52).

40|$|Objective: The {{assessment}} of older people’s needs {{is an important}} indicator for planning individual care and services that promote independence, health and well-being. However, {{there is not a}} valid tool to measure physical, mental, and social needs of older people in Turkey. The {{purpose of the study was}} to adapt of <b>EASY-Care</b> Standard, which is a comprehensive and holistic assessment tool, into Turkish and evaluate its psychometric properties. Material and Method: The sample consisted of 400 older people. The <b>EASY-Care</b> Standard covers seeing, hearing and communicating, looking after yourself, getting around, accommodation and finance, safety and relationships, staying healthy, mental health and wellbeing. Scores representing overall level of independence, risk of breakdown in care and risk of falls are calculated from the selected items’ scores. Forward-back translation method was used to adapt <b>EASY-Care</b> into Turkish. Reliability was assessed using internal consistency, item-total correlation and test-retest stability. Construct validity was analyzed by investigating associations between the three sub domains in <b>EASY-Care</b> and testing convergent and divergent validity. Results: We found satisfactory evidence for reliability and construct validity. Kappa statistics were acceptable, Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Cronbach’s alpha values were satisfactory. Convergent validity was supported by moderate to high negative correlations between <b>EASY-Care</b> Standard and the The MOS 36 -item short-form health survey (SF- 36).

40|$|Background: {{undertaking}} comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGAs) {{combined with}} long-term {{health and social}} care man-agement can {{improve the quality of}} life of older people [1]. The <b>EASY-Care</b> tool is a CGA instrument designed for assessing the physical, mental and social functioning and unmet health and social needs of older people in community settings or primary care. It has also been used as a frailty assessment tool and for gathering population-level data. Objective: to review the evidence of reliability, validity and acceptability of <b>EASY-Care</b> and its appropriateness for assessing the needs of community-dwelling older people. Methods: systematic search of literature databases using pre-defined search terms (January 1994 —May 2014) for English lan-guage articles reporting on the reliability, validity, acceptability and implementation of <b>EASY-Care</b> in primary care and commu-nity settings. Eligible articles were critically reviewed. Discussion papers mapping professionals ’ use of the tool were also included as these could be considered an aspect of validity. Results: twenty-nine papers met the inclusion criteria and underwent data extraction. A narrative synthesis was performed, because there was a variety of quantitative and qualitative outcomes and characteristics. Reliability evidence for <b>EASY-Care</b> is minimal. Evidence for validity is good, and it has received numerous positive endorsements of acceptability in international settings from older people and practitioners. Conclusion: evidence supports the use of <b>EASY-Care</b> for individual needs assessment; further research is needed for other uses.

40|$|Introduction / Background: With an ageing global population, {{effective}} {{identification of}} the health careneeds of older people has become an issue of increasing importance. Older people may have a wide rangeof clinical and social care needs, subsequently, clinical assessment requires a ‘holistic approach’ in whichwider health-impacting factors such as finances and social support are considered, as well as specificmedical problems. The <b>EASY-Care</b> system has been developed in the UK for this purpose. It is a set ofclinical assessment instruments, guidance and training materials. It aims to identify care needs, whilstproviding a clear framework through which to address them. The system focuses on early identificationand prevention as well as identification of active issues. By using a structured and thorough approachwith easy coding of patient responses, the tools aim to work as an effective clinical system, whileconcurrently providing population level data to help direct health policy. The system is being developedfor international use, therefore {{must be seen as}} acceptable by healthcare workers and patients in alltargeted contexts. Aims and Objectives: To assess the acceptability of the <b>EASY-Care</b> system from the perspectives ofhealthcare workers and patients in Colombia. Methods/Design: Healthcare workers (n= 10) were trained in using the <b>EASY-Care</b> assessment system. Using the system, these staff then assessed 14, opportunistically selected patients, in 3 primary caresettings. Patient and healthcare workers then completed questionnaires, to assess perceptions regardingthe acceptability of the system, using quantitative and qualitative components. Study limitations: Participants sample all came from the same town, hence, their views may not berepresentative of wider Colombia. Results: In general, the tools were seen as highly useful by both patients and healthcare workers. Freetext answers included ‘very helpful’ and 100 % of participants recommend the systems future use. Certainimprovements were identified relating to contextually pertinent health impacting factors, such as religionand health resource availability. Discussion / Conclusion: The acceptability of the <b>EASY-Care</b> tool could be improved through furtherdevelopment as suggested by study participants. At present the <b>EASY-Care</b> system is seen as an effectiveand culturally acceptable by healthcare workers and patients in Colombia.

40|$|Keywords: silk, <b>easy-care,</b> polycarboxylic acid, zero-formaldehyde, finishing, cross- linking, machine-washable, silicone, softener, {{swelling}} agent. A zero-formaldehyde, <b>easy-care</b> finish for {{silk fabric}} {{has been developed}} using a polycarboxylic acid (PCA) finishing system. This thesis confirms that treatment of silk fabric with selected PCA finishing systems improves the stability of silk fabric. The treated fabric had improved stability to heat, reduced swelling in solvents, and improved elastic recovery in the dry and wet states. A number of interesting mechanistic possibilities are proposed for improving the easy- care performance of silk fabrics with a PCA finishing system. It is postulated that the improvement in elastic and stability properties of the treated silk fabrics could be {{as a consequence of}} new fibre inter-chain cross-links and/or a new intra-fibre PCA polymer network being formed within the silk fibres. Three different types of possible bonds between the PCA and silk fibroin were proposed : • Ester links formed via acid and/or base catalysis with hydroxyl containing amino acids, serine, threonine and tyrosine, in silk fibroin. • Amide links may also be formed between the basic amino acids, arginine, lysine and histidine, in silk fibroin and acid anhydrides formed during curing. • Hydrogen bonds formed with acid, basic and hydroxy side groups and with the silk fibroin backbone. This thesis extends previous research with respect to PCA finishing. It proposes the use of a new analytical method to pre-determine the effectiveness of an acid/catalyst system as an <b>easy-care</b> finish. It recommends the use of combination acids to compete with 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid and proposes the use of monosodium citrate as an alternative catalyst to sodium hypophosphite when cured at 165 °C. Good <b>easy-care</b> performance was achieved with silk fabrics treated with selective PCA/catalyst finish {{in the presence of a}} swelling agent, such as formic acid or acrylic acid, followed by after-treatment with a silicone softener.
