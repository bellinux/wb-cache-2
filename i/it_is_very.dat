5|$|A. n. punicus, {{described}} by Erlanger in 1897, is resident in north-west Africa, {{north of the}} Sahara. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> similar to nisus, being large and pale.|$|E
5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, the {{conditions}} {{have not yet}} been met. When the switchover date is announced at least a further 2 years will pass so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> unlikely to occur before 2020.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} call after him, but my speech {{suddenly}} failed me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> foolish, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unaccountable, {{but there was something}} in the man's last words which had more than half frightened me.|$|R
60|$|The {{landlord}} {{led them}} into the kitchen, and as {{there was a good}} fire he remarked that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> cold. If there had happened to be a bad one he would have observed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> warm.|$|R
60|$|A {{slight smile}} came over Undy's gay unconcerned features; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> slight, but {{nevertheless}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> eloquent and very offensive also. Alaric understood it well; {{it made him}} hate the owner of it, but it made him hate himself still more.|$|R
5|$|By 1999, about 5 to 10 {{percent of}} all jobs in Israel were held by Russian speakers. The Ministry of Transport {{published}} booklets and manuals in Russian. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> likely to find Russian-speaking doctors at hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus furuitii, {{described}} by Momiyama in 1927, is {{found on the}} Izu and Ogasawara Islands south of Honshū, Japan. It is non-migratory. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> rare, and may only remain on a single island. It is a dark form, resembling pealei in colour, but darker, especially on tail.|$|E
5|$|Following an eruption, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{common for}} the public to hold fears about {{chemical}} contamination of water supplies. However, in general, the physical impacts of an ashfall will tend to overwhelm problems caused by the release of chemical contaminants from fresh volcanic ash. Impacts vary according to the type of treatment system.|$|E
60|$|I hazarded a bold flight, {{and said}} (not without stammering) that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> bright to me then, though <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> dark to {{me a minute}} before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Profitable?" [...] said my friend. [...] "I said agreeable. I don't {{know about}} the profit. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good variety, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> cheap. I {{understand}} that {{this is the kind of}} thing you want the two-dollar theatre to come down to, or up to." ...|$|R

5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous. It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E
5|$|Iceberg/Crisphead - {{the most}} popular type in the US, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{heat-sensitive}} and was originally adapted for growth in the northern US. It ships well, but is low in flavor and nutritional content, being composed of even more water than other lettuce types.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E

5|$|Low-speed (LS) rate of 1.5Mbit/s {{is defined}} by USB1.0. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> similar to full-bandwidth {{operation}} except each bit takes 8 times as long to transmit. It is intended primarily to save cost in low-bandwidth human interface devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks.|$|E
5|$|Most of the time, goalkeepers do low-intensity work (treading water {{without too}} much effort) but when they do work (for example, {{when they have a}} man down or are in the ready position) <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> intense.|$|E
5|$|Note: <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{difficult}} to find a complete and exhaustive list {{of the members of the}} scientific expedition. Often, it is necessary to make conjectures based on incomplete information. Names marked are those found in various sources, but still in doubt.|$|E

30|$|Xiao Xiong: Um … <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> important. <b>It</b> {{meant you}} did not feel lonely. When you saw how hard your classmates worked, you were motivated.

The handle is made out of four different metals including gold and silver, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> possible that it belonged to Sviatoslav himself.|$|E
5|$|Pyramid B6 {{enclosed}} {{the southern}} {{portion of the}} west side of the Group B plaza. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> poorly preserved and the top of the pyramid has collapsed, leaving only the lower walls. Archaeological investigation revealed that the final version of the pyramid had been built over a preceding version.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> difficult to get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.|$|E
