5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who built an {{extensive}} <b>double</b> <b>line</b> of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open. Forced to extend the siege into winter, the besieging army suffered horrendous casualties from the cold {{and the lack of}} provisions.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. At {{least some of the}} rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, although much of the route can still be traced by a <b>double</b> <b>line</b> of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E

Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if he knew who she was. Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the effects of two types of drip {{irrigation}} line design on cotton yield, water use, and net returns. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} arid region of Xinjiang, Northwest China, during 2009 - 2010 growing years. The two types of lateral placement are commonly used by the local farmers in the area: <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> (two laterals controlling four rows) and single line designs (one lateral controlling four rows). The results indicated that less irrigation water was applied by single <b>line</b> compared with <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> design. This implies that more irrigation water could be saved using single line, by reducing the water consumption of cotton. The emergence rates for <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> were 2 and 6 % higher than those for single line design in 2009 and 2010. The seed cotton yields for <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> design were 5. 76 and 6. 41 Mg ha(- 1) which were 13 and 9 % higher than for single line design in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Single lines could however lower the investment cost compared to <b>double</b> <b>lines,</b> which produced 10 and 7 % more net income in 2009 and 2010, respectively. By contrast, the <b>double</b> <b>lines</b> was more profitable and suitable for the farmers in Northwest China than single line design...|$|R

5|$|The safeworking of trains between {{stations}} on {{the early}} lines was time interval working, where a train {{would be allowed to}} leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines. Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with Winters Block working between 1883 and 1888, a system that is a predecessor of the <b>Double</b> <b>line</b> Block system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{built by}} Constantine the Great, the walls {{surrounded}} the new city on all sides, protecting it against attack from both sea and land. As the city grew, the famous <b>double</b> <b>line</b> of the Theodosian Walls {{was built in}} the 5th century. Although the other sections of the walls were less elaborate, when well-manned, they were almost impregnable for any medieval besieger, saving the city, and the Byzantine Empire with it, during sieges from the Avar-Sasanian coalition, Arabs, Rus', and Bulgars, among others. The advent of gunpowder siege cannons rendered the fortifications vulnerable, but cannon technology was not sufficiently advanced to capture the city on its own, and the walls could be repaired between reloading. Ultimately the city fell from sheer weight of numbers of the Ottoman forces on 29 May 1453 after a six-week siege.|$|E

To counter the Spartans' superior skill and maneuverability, the Athenian commanders implemented several new and innovative tactics. First, the Athenian fleet was divided into eight autonomous divisions, each commanded by one of the generals; second, they arranged their fleet in a <b>double</b> <b>line</b> instead of the traditional single line in order to prevent the Spartans from using the maneuver known as the diekplous, in which a trireme raced into a gap between two enemy ships and then wheeled to strike one of them in the side; if the Spartans attempted this against a <b>double</b> <b>line,</b> a ship from the second line could move up to attack the Spartan ship.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{existing}} numerical models of shield tunnel with <b>double</b> <b>lining,</b> an improved numerical model is developed and its rationality is verified by a similar model test. In the improved numerical model, lining, joint, and junction surface, respectively, are simulated by beam, spring, and a combination of compression bar and spring. Through the comparison of the numerical analysis results of the improved model and existing models, {{it turns out that}} the defects or problems in {{the existing}} numerical models are resolved; tension appearance on the contact surface and junction surface and the abrupt change of bending moment in linings are solved in the improved model because the compression bar element and the coupling technology of node displacement in the junction surface is applied. Therefore, the improved numerical model could be applied to analyze <b>double</b> <b>lining</b> with waterproof on the junction surface and separation of the junction surface under an unfavorable load. In this paper, the parameter formulas of element stiffness, applicable to the junction surface and contact surface of <b>double</b> <b>lining,</b> are given definitely, and the influence of the element amount of junction surface on the analysis results is discussed. Based on the improved numerical model, the mechanical behavior of the <b>double</b> <b>lining</b> of the Huangpu River Tunnel in China is studied, and some conclusions are obtained as follows. (1) The thickness increase of the <b>double</b> <b>lining</b> will clearly increase its bending moment, but it has little influence on its axial force. (2) The allocation proportion of the bending moment between the segment lining and secondary lining has no linear relationship with the ratio of the lining thickness...|$|R
