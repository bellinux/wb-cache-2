For instance, inserting calmodulin into <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> (GFP) allowed researchers {{to measure the}} activity of calmodulin via the fluorescence of the split-GFP.

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein,</b> originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E
50|$|While {{the main}} focus of his work was on the bioluminescence, Shimomura and two others, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien, were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2008 for their work on <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R

5|$|The French {{pharmacologist}} Raphaël Dubois {{carried out}} work on bioluminescence {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He studied click beetles (Pyrophorus) and the marine bivalve mollusc Pholas dactylus. He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus, and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound, which he named luciferin, by an enzyme. He sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon for many years. His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the enzymes that act on it is to produce light, were interchangeable between species, showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he found this hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major differences in the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the next thirty years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura {{to be the first to}} obtain crystalline luciferin. He used the sea firefly Vargula hilgendorfii, but it was another ten years before he discovered the chemical's structure and was able to publish his 1957 paper Crystalline Cypridina Luciferin. More recently, Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their 1961 discovery and development of <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> as a tool for biological research.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>green</b> <b>protein</b> (GFP) in 1961 many variants of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> (FP) were detected.

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> (GFP) {{are widely}} used in vivo {{molecular}} markers. These proteins are particularly resistant, and maintain function, {{under a variety of}} cellular conditions such as pH extremes and elevated temperatures. <b>Green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> are also abundant in several groups of marine invertebrates including reef-forming corals. While molecular oxygen is required for the post-translational maturation of the protein, mature GFPs are found in corals where hyperoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) occur due to the photosynthetic activity of algal symbionts. In vitro spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance and spectrophotometric assays of superoxide dismutase (SOD) -like enzyme U− activity show that wild type GFP from the hydromedusa, Aequorea victoria, quenches superoxide radicals (O 2) and exhibits SOD-like activity by competing with cytochrome c for reaction with O 2 U −. When exposed to high amounts of O 2 U − the SOD-like activity and protein structure of GFP are altered without significant changes to the fluorescent properties of the protein. Because of the distribution of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> in both the epithelial and gastrodermal cells of reef-forming corals we propose that GFP, and possibly other <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins,</b> can provide supplementary antioxidant protection...|$|R
25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> (GFP) {{is often}} used in {{genetics}} as a marker. Many substances, such as proteins, have significant light absorption bands in the ultraviolet that are of interest in biochemistry and related fields. UV-capable spectrophotometers are common in such laboratories.|$|E
25|$|Another, well-studied {{example of}} biofluorescence {{in the ocean}} is the hydrozoan Aequorea victoria. This {{jellyfish}} lives in the photic zone off {{the west coast of}} North America and was identified as a carrier of <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> (GFP) by Osamu Shimomura. The gene for these green fluorescent proteins has been isolated and is scientifically significant because it is widely used in genetic studies to indicate the expression of other genes.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{efficient}} fluorescent proteins {{such as the}} <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> (GFP) {{have been}} developed using the molecular biology technique of gene fusion, a process that links {{the expression of the}} fluorescent compound to that of the target protein. This combined fluorescent protein is, in general, non-toxic to the organism and rarely interferes with the function of the protein under study. Genetically modified cells or organisms directly express the fluorescently tagged proteins, which enables the study of the function of the original protein in vivo.|$|E
40|$|For {{a variety}} of coral species, we have studied the {{molecular}} origin of their coloration to assess the contributions of host and symbiont pigments. For the corals Catalaphyllia jardinei and an orange-emitting color morph of Lobophyllia hemprichii, the pigments belong to a particular class of <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> protein-like <b>proteins</b> that change their color from green to red upon irradiation with 400 nm light. The optical absorption and emission properties of these proteins were characterized in detail. Their spectra {{were found to be}} similar to those of phycoerythrin from cyanobacterial symbionts. To unambiguously determine the molecular origin of the coloration, we performed immunochemical studies using double diffusion in gel analysis on tissue extracts, including also a third coral species, Montastrea cavernosa, which allowed us to attribute the red fluorescent coloration to green-to-red photoconvertible <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins.</b> The red <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> are localized mainly in the ectodermal tissue and contribute up to 7. 0 % of the total soluble cellular proteins in these species. Distinct spatial distributions of <b>green</b> and cyan <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> were observed for the tissues of M. cavernosa. This observation may suggest that differently colored <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> protein-like <b>proteins</b> have different, specific functions. In addition to <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> protein-like <b>proteins,</b> the pigments of zooxanthellae have a strong effect on the visual appearance of the latter species. <br/...|$|R
30|$|To {{combine the}} {{sensitivity}} of bioluminescent imaging (BLI) with the 3 D and quantitative properties of pinhole single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/micro-computed tomography (CT) (phSPECT/micro-CT), we generated stable cell lines that express a yellow-fluorescent protein (YFP) and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) fusion protein (YFP/GLuc). For in vivo phSPECT detection of this YFP/GLuc protein, a nanobody, targeted against yellow and <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> (anti-YFP-Nb), was site specifically labelled with 99 mTc.|$|R
50|$|FlAsH-EDT2 enables less toxic {{and more}} {{specific}} fluorescent labeling that is membrane permeable. The {{modification of the}} fluorescein moiety also allows multicolor analysis. It has been {{proven to be a}} good alternative to <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> (GFP) with the advantage that FlAsH-EDT2 is much smaller (molar mass < 1 kDa) as compared to GFPs (~30 kDa), therefore minimizing the perturbation of activity of the protein under the study.|$|R
25|$|In 1961, Osamu Shimomura {{extracted}} <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> (GFP) {{and another}} bioluminescent protein, called aequorin, {{from the large}} and abundant hydromedusa Aequorea victoria, while studying photoproteins that cause bioluminescence in this species. Three decades later, Douglas Prasher sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP. Martin Chalfie {{figured out how to}} use GFP as a fluorescent marker of genes inserted into other cells or organisms. Roger Tsien later chemically manipulated GFP to produce other fluorescent colors to use as markers. In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfie and Tsien won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work with GFP.|$|E
25|$|By {{replacing}} the gene {{with a new}} version fused to a <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> (or similar) marker, expression may be directly quantified in live cells. This is done by imaging using a fluorescence microscope. It {{is very difficult to}} clone a GFP-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often cannot be used to measure endogenous gene expression. It is, however, widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell, for example via an expression vector. It {{is important to note that}} by fusing a target protein to a fluorescent reporter the protein's behavior, including its cellular localization and expression level, can be significantly changed.|$|E
25|$|Because {{fluorescent}} markers come in {{a variety}} of colors and can be specifically bound to a particular molecule (e.g. proteins, polymers, metal-complexes, etc.), it is possible to study the behavior of individual molecules (in rapid succession in composite solutions). With the development of sensitive detectors such as avalanche photodiodes the detection of the fluorescence signal coming from individual molecules in highly dilute samples has become practical. With this emerged the possibility to conduct FCS experiments in a wide variety of specimens, ranging from materials science to biology. The advent of engineered cells with genetically tagged proteins (like <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein)</b> has made FCS a common tool for studying molecular dynamics in living cells.|$|E
40|$|The time {{evolution}} of the fluorescence intensity emitted by well-defined ensembles of <b>Green</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Proteins</b> has been studied by using a standard confocal microscope.

Moreover, this simple theoretical model allows us to obtain information about the energy-scales involved in the aging process. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Detecting {{explosive}} materials {{is a major}} concern in matters of national and individual security. It is very important to be able to detect these materials with high sensitivity and selectivity. We are exploring a fluorescently functionalized hydrogel system to address these requirements. Red, yellow, and <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> are expressed by recombinant E. coli and purified using butyl-sepharose chromatography columns. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> are functionalized via MSH, a reagent that oxidatively eliminates cysteine residues into dehydroalanine.

50|$|OPT {{can assume}} two primary forms - {{transmission}} mode and emission mode. In transmission mode, where light is passed through an optically cleared sample, one can obtain structural {{information about the}} sample of interest. In emission mode, where the sample is exposed to excitation light, one can obtain functional information about the sample of interest. In tandem with organs harvested from genetically modified mouse that express <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins</b> such as <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>proteins,</b> the emission mode of OPT can yield 3D genetic expression images of the mouse organ.|$|R
25|$|Nanoparticles {{can also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with DNA to perform genetic alterations. These are frequently monitored through the use of fluorescent materials, allowing scientists to judge if these tagged proteins have successfully been transmitted—for example <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein,</b> or GFP. Nanoparticles are significantly less cytotoxic than currently used organic methods, providing a more efficient method of monitoring genetic alternations. They also do not degrade or bleach with time, as organic dyes do. Suspensions of nanoparticles with the same size and shapes (mono-dispersed) with functional groups attached to their surfaces can also electrostatically bind to DNA, protecting them from several types of degradation. Because the fluorescence of these nanoparticles does not degrade, cellular localization can be tracked without the use of additional tagging, with GFPs or other methods. The 'unpacking' of the DNA can be detected in live cells using luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) technology.|$|E
25|$|Other {{luminescent}} systems: Early in {{his career}} Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans. This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work {{when he was in}} the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed <b>green</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>protein</b> (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns. Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.|$|E
