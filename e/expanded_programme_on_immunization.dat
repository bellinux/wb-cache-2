The World Health Organization's <b>Expanded</b> <b>Programmes</b> <b>on</b> <b>Immunization</b> succeed in providing standardized guidelines for vaccine storage and distribution, but often fail to accommodate the unique infrastructure between and within countries. In order to better regulate the temperature of vaccines as they travel through countries, we have selected and characterized an appropriate phase change material (PCM) that will resist temperature fluctuations outside {{of a range of}} 2 - 8 °C, based on appropriate thermophysical properties. Additionally, we have integrated the selected PCM within a geometrically and thermally optimized cold box, maintaining long-term stabilization of temperatures within a range of 2 - 8 °C.

40|$|The Yaoundé multiple-antigen {{childhood}} immunization programme {{began in}} November 1975, {{making it one}} of the first <b>expanded</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>on</b> <b>immunization</b> operational in Africa. During the first 9 months, more than 22 000 children were immunized against poliomyelitis, measles, tuberculosis, smallpox, whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria. Evaluation of the programme showed the following rates of immunization coverage in the target population; 30 % for DPT (one dose or more), 27 % for poliomyelitis (one dose or more), 27 % for BCG, 33 % for measles, and 20 % for smallpox. Eighty per cent of children received the correct vaccines for their age and vaccination status. Seroconversion to measles vaccine was 89 % in those over 12 months of age but only 50 % in those between 6 and 11 months of age. The major factor in low immunization coverage was felt to be inadequate publicity. The cost of the programme was estimated to be US $ 10 920. The cost of immunizing a child completely was estimated at US $ 1. 90. Some logistic problems encountered during this initial year of operation are discussed...|$|R

A conventional disposable syringe (CS) was used as a comparison. We observed 48 vaccinators giving 2400 injections with the SS and 1440 with the CS; 98. 7 % of SS performed as designed. The average volume required per delivered dose was comparable for the two syringes and was delivered more quickly with SS. Training and experience had a small but statistically significant effect on several aspects of SS use. Vaccinators who indicated a syringe preference preferred SS on 7 out of 9 indicators. SS is safe and effective in preventing reuse and is easier and quicker to use than the CS. Vaccinators require little, if any, special training.

40|$|Introduction: Despite the {{relentless}} {{efforts to reduce}} infant and child mortality {{with the introduction of}} the National <b>Expanded</b> <b>Programmes</b> <b>on</b> <b>Immunization</b> (EPI) in 1974, major disparities still exist in immunizations coverage across different population sub-groups. In Kenya, for instance, while the proportion of fully immunized children increased from 57 % in 2003 to 77 % in 2008 - 9 at national level and 73 % in Nairobi, only 58 % of children living in informal settlement areas are fully immunized. The study aims to determine the degree and determinants of immunization inequality among the urban poor of Nairobi. Method: We used data from the Nairobi Cross-Sectional Slum Survey of 2012 and the health outcome was full immunization status among children aged 12 - 23 months. The wealth index was used as a measure of social economic position for inequality analysis. The potential determinants considered included sex of the child and mother's education, their occupation, age at birth of the child, and marital status. The concentration index (CI) was used to quantify the degree of inequality and decomposition approach to assess determinants of inequality in immunization. Results: The CI for not fully immunized was - 0. 08 indicating that immunization inequality is mainly concentrated among children from poor families. Decomposition of the results suggests that 78 % of this inequality is largely explained by the mother's level of education. Conclusion: There exists immunization inequality among urban poor children in Nairobi and efforts to reduce this inequality should aim at targeting mothers with low level of education during immunization campaigns...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for malaria prevention, through the antenatal care (ANC) and the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Programme</b> <b>on</b> <b>Immunizations</b> (EPI), is {{recommended by the}} WHO to improve and maintain LLIN coverage. Despite these recommendations, {{little is known about}} the relative strengths and weaknesses of the ANC and EPI-based LLIN distribution. This study aimed to explore and compare the roles of the ANC and EPI for LLIN distribution in four African countries.; In a qualitative evaluation of {{continuous distribution}} through the ANC and EPI, semi-structured, individual and group interviews were conducted in Kenya, Malawi, Mali, and Rwanda. Respondents included national, sub-national, and facility-level health staff, and were selected to capture a range of roles related to malaria, ANC and EPI programmes. Policies, guidelines, and data collection tools were reviewed as a means of triangulation to assess the structure of LLIN distribution, and the methods of data collection and reporting for malaria, ANC and EPI programmes.; In the four countries visited, distribution of LLINs was more effectively integrated through ANC than through EPI because of a) stronger linkages and involvement between malaria and reproductive health programmes, as compared to malaria and EPI, and b) more complete programme monitoring for ANC-based distribution, compared to EPI-based distribution.; Opportunities for improving the distribution of LLINs through these channels exist, especially in the case of EPI. For both ANC and EPI, integrated distribution of LLINs has the potential to act as an incentive, improving the already strong coverage of both these essential services. The collection and reporting of data on LLINs distributed through the ANC and EPI can provide insight into the performance of LLIN distribution within these programmes. Greater attention to data collection and use, by both the global malaria community, and the integrated programmes, can improve this distribution channel strength and effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} hepatitis B vaccine when added to the routine <b>expanded</b> <b>programme</b> <b>on</b> immunisation under field conditions in rural Africa. DESIGN [...] Infants were immunised according to two schedules [...] an early schedule at birth, 3 months, and 6 months and a later schedule to correspond with routine vaccination in the <b>expanded</b> <b>programme</b> <b>on</b> immunisation at 3 months, 4 1 / 2 months, and 6 months. SETTING [...] Venda, northern Transvaal, South Africa, a self governing region of 7460 square kilometers varying from rural villages to small towns. SUBJECTS [...] The 1989 birth cohort of Venda. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Coverage for hepatitis B vaccine at first, second, and third doses; serological assessment of vaccine efficacy by prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen in infants who had completed the three dose course of immunisation; antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen to determine if natural infection occurred. RESULTS [...] Vaccine coverage for hepatitis B dropped sharply from 99 % to 53 % to 39 % for the first, second, and third dose respectively. In contrast, vaccine coverage was maintained at 97 - 99 % for the three doses of poliomyelitis vaccine. Serological evaluation of vaccine efficacy showed that only 3. 5 % of recipients of all three doses failed to develop antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. Only 6. 6 % of vaccine recipients were vaccinated according to either the early or later schedules whereas 93. 4 % received their doses of vaccine at intervals {{beyond the limits of}} either of the planned schedules. There was, however, no significant difference in seroconversion to the surface antigen between the "unscheduled" or scheduled groups of those who were vaccinated according to the early or late schedules. The pattern of prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, which showed a sharp fall in children aged over 7 months, suggested that the antibodies were acquired passively rather than by active infection. CONCLUSIONS [...] Supplementation of the present <b>expanded</b> <b>programme</b> <b>on</b> immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine in rural Africa is fraught with difficulties. However, the vaccine was effective within a fairly wide spacing of dosage. Adding hepatitis B vaccine to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis as a tetravalent vaccine is proposed as a means of effectively integrating it into the <b>expanded</b> <b>programme</b> <b>on</b> immunisation in Third World settings...|$|R
