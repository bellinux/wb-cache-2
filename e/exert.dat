5000|$|The word {{piezoelectric}} {{finds its}} roots in the Greek word piezein, which means to squeeze or press. When a physical force is <b>exerted</b> on the accelerometer, the seismic mass loads the piezoelectric element according to Newton's second law of motion (...) [...] The force <b>exerted</b> on the piezoelectric material can be observed in the change in the electrostatic force or voltage generated by the piezoelectric material. This differs from a piezoresistive effect in that piezoresistive materials experience a change in the resistance of the material rather than a change in charge or voltage. Physical force <b>exerted</b> on the piezoelectric can be classified as one of two types; bending or compression. Stress of the compression type can be understood as a force <b>exerted</b> {{to one side of the}} piezoelectric while the opposing side rests against a fixed surface, while bending involves a force being <b>exerted</b> on the piezoelectric from both sides.|$|R

The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration.
