5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The <b>key</b> <b>way</b> characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E

500|$|In 1925, Born, Heisenberg and Jordan reinterpreted Debye's {{concept in}} a <b>key</b> <b>way.</b> As may be shown classically, the Fourier modes of the {{electromagnetic}} field—a complete set of electromagnetic plane waves indexed by their wave vector k and polarization state—are equivalent {{to a set of}} uncoupled simple harmonic oscillators. Treated quantum mechanically, the energy levels of such oscillators are known to be , where [...] is the oscillator frequency.

500|$|Increases in the {{relative}} vorticity, or spin, with the monsoon trough are normally a product of increased wind convergence within the convergence zone of the monsoon trough. [...] Wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence. [...] A strengthening or equatorward movement in the subtropical ridge can cause a strengthening of a monsoon trough as a wind surge moves towards {{the location of the}} monsoon trough. [...] As fronts move through the subtropics and tropics of one hemisphere during their winter, normally as shear lines when their temperature gradient becomes minimal, wind surges can cross the equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon trough in the other hemisphere's summer. [...] A <b>key</b> <b>way</b> of detecting whether a wind surge has reached a monsoon trough is the formation of a burst of thunderstorms within the monsoon trough.|$|E

2500|$|Richards and Rogers' 1982 {{approach}} expanded on Anthony's three-level framework; however, {{instead of}} approach, method and technique, they chose the terms approach, design, and procedure.

Their design referred to all major practical implications in the classroom, such as syllabus design, types of activities {{to be used in}} the classroom, and student and teacher roles; procedure referred to different behaviors, practices and techniques observed in the classroom. These new terms were intended to address limitations in Anthony's framework, and also gave them specific criteria by which they could evaluate different [...] "methods". This evaluation process was a <b>key</b> <b>way</b> that their formulation differed from Anthony's, as Anthony's framework was intended as purely descriptive.|$|E
