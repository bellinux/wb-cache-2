60|$|I cannot say so {{much about}} Professor Blackie, for a good reason. Kelland's class I attended, once even gained there a {{certificate}} of merit, the only distinction of my University career. But although I am the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>certificate</b> of attendance in the professor's own hand, I cannot remember to have been present in the Greek class above a dozen times. Professor Blackie was even kind enough to remark (more than once) while in {{the very act of}} writing the document above referred to, {{that he did not know}} my face. Indeed, I denied myself many opportunities; acting upon an extensive and highly rational system of truantry, which cost me a great deal of trouble to put in exercise--perhaps as much as would have taught me Greek--and sent me forth into the world and the profession of letters with the merest shadow of an education. But they say it is always a good thing to have taken pains, and that success is its own reward, whatever be its nature; so that, perhaps, even upon this I should plume myself, that no one ever played the truant with more deliberate care, and none ever had more certificates for less education. One consequence, however, of my system is that I have much less to say of Professor Blackie than I had of Professor Kelland; and as he is still alive, and will long, I hope, continue to be so, it will not surprise you very much that I have no intention of saying it.|$|E

50|$|Library {{technicians}} {{will often}} {{carry out the}} practical tasks involved in daily library operation, whereas librarians generally perform the managerial, supervisory and administrative functions. For example, a librarian {{may be responsible for}} creating a library's collection development policies, which would include selection criteria for purchasing <b>of</b> items. <b>A</b> library technician would then purchase items based on these criteria. Library technicians may also be graduates <b>of</b> <b>a</b> four-year college, or institute. They could also be <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>certificate,</b> associate degree, or bachelor's degree. Because the education of the library technician is practical, broad, and skills-based, they are job-ready upon graduation; the only training they may require is that which is specific to their particular place of employment. Duties can vary with the type and size of the library but can include: cataloguing and classification of materials, data input to assist in acquiring print and nonprint materials, assisting in the provision of reference services, and circulation procedures. In a larger library in government or academia, senior library technicians with specialized and more extensive training (at the baccalaureate degree level) are often responsible for other technicians, clerical staff, student workers, and volunteers in a certain section or department. In smaller libraries, where the foundations of organization and operation are already established, such paraprofessionals sometimes serve as the manager or even the sole staff member. A library technician who supervises or serves as library manager with the advanced training is more properly known as a library associate. The average salary for an experienced library technician (an associate degree with three to five years of experience) is around $41,000 per year in a good-paying district; those experienced technicians who serve as supervisors or managers and/or have a baccalaureate degree can earn slightly more.|$|R

25|$|The Companies Act, 1913 {{passed in}} pre-independent India {{prescribed}} various books {{which had to}} be maintained by a Company registered under that Act.

In order to act as an auditor a person had to acquire <b>a</b> restricted <b>certificate</b> from the local government upon such conditions as may be prescribed. The <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> restricted <b>certificate</b> was allowed to practice only within the province of issue and in the language specified in the restricted <b>certificate.</b> In 1918 <b>a</b> course called Government Diploma in Accountancy was launched in Bombay (now known as Mumbai). On passing this diploma and completion of three years of articled training under an approved accountant, a person was held eligible for grant <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unrestricted <b>certificate.</b> This certificate entitled the holder to practice as an auditor throughout India.

50|$|Next on {{the stand}} was Charles Samson, <b>a</b> Director <b>of</b> the Green Island Coal Company and Manager of the Abbotsfield Coal Mine. Samson {{considered}} the mine {{should have had a}} second access and that the old workings should have been sealed off, as was the practice in England. He considered that accessing the old workings, given the presence of fire damp in the mine, was reckless. Samson was followed by Samual Herbert Cox, New Zealand Government Inspector <b>of</b> Mines and <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Competency <b>Certificate</b> from the London School of Mines. The Mine Manager, Hodge, had informed him in February that there was no fire damp present in the mine. Binns, the Coal Inspector had been through the old workings about 8 days earlier and had not reported any fire damp present. He did not think Hodge was experienced enough to be a Mine Manager without supervision. Samson also stated that old workings should only be accessed with a safety lamp.|$|R

5000|$|In many countries, {{the term}} “master mariner” is {{reserved}} {{only for those}} who hold <b>an</b> unlimited master's <b>certificate.</b> The term “unlimited” (often referred to as unrestricted) indicates {{that there are no}} limits on size, power or geographic location on the certificate. It is the highest level of professional qualification amongst mariners and deck officers. The Extra Master's qualification (issued only in the United Kingdom), which was discontinued in the 1990s, used to be the highest professional qualification and it was the pinnacle for any mariner to achieve. There are also various other levels of master's certificates, which may be restricted or limited to home trade/near coastal voyages and/or by gross tonnage. The <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> restricted master's <b>certificate</b> is not referred to as a [...] "master mariner".|$|R
5000|$|Alfred Mitchell-Innes, {{writing in}} 1914, argued that money existed not as <b>a</b> medium <b>of</b> {{exchange}} but as <b>a</b> standard <b>of</b> deferred payment, with government money being debt {{the government could}} reclaim by taxation. Innes argued: Whenever a tax is imposed, each taxpayer becomes responsible for the redemption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small part <b>of</b> the debt which the government has contracted by its issues of money, whether coins, certificates, notes, drafts on the treasury, or by whatever name this money is called. He has to acquire his portion of the debt from some <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coin or <b>certificate</b> or other form of government money, and present it to the Treasury in liquidation of his legal debt.

25|$|Leeds {{reputation}} {{was built on}} strong organisation, professionalism, physical robustness (at a time when football was more physical than it is today), as well as free flowing attacking wing play and patient, possession based football. The team was built around <b>a</b> core <b>of</b> technically adept, intelligent and versatile players, {{who were willing to}} play in multiple positions and indeed could interchange positions and roles around the pitch. Most of Revie's team went on to become internationals; in 1970 the squad contained 17 full internationals. This was at a time when squads never had more than 20 players, when players from outside the British Isles were rare in English football, and international players correspondingly more rare. Two of Revie's players would feature in England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, with Jack Charlton playing a pivotal role at the heart <b>of</b> defence, <b>a</b> further four Leeds players would feature in England's 1970 World Cup squad (two more missed out through injury and fatigue), and five Leeds players featured in Scotland's 1974 World Cup squad. In the early 1970s the Leeds team could boast the captain of the Ireland, John Giles, the captain of Scotland, Billy Bremner and the captain of Wales, Terry Yorath. Leeds would also loan their first team coach Les Cocker to the England national team throughout this period; as one <b>of</b> the first <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> FA <b>certificate</b> in coaching, he would combine his responsibilities to Leeds with that of the national team and play a pivotal role to the success of England in the 1966 world cup as team trainer.|$|R
