40|$|<b>Distrusting</b> democrats seek {{accountability}} and advocate reform in established democracies. Do they behave similarly in new democracies? Using AmericasBarometer survey data, cluster analysis identifies five profiles of democratic support in Chile: democrat, delegative, fair-weather, illiberal, and autocrat. Chilean <b>distrusting</b> democrats are {{more active in}} protest politics but less active in electoral politics than other Chileans, especially fair-weather democrats. The support profiles better predict these behaviors than the classic Linzian and Churchillian measures of democratic support. Thus, <b>distrusting</b> democrats in Chile only partially emulate their counterparts in established democracies, suggesting citizen-led democratic reforms in new democracies could be far more challenging.

Most of them fled from Gaza after the 1929 Palestine riots, when they consisted of fifty families. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had {{a population of}} 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual <b>distrust</b> {{between them and the}} Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.|$|E
5|$|He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November {{in hopes}} of obtaining {{financial}} aid and securing trade agreements.

5|$|In 1259, Geoffrey {{participated in}} the princely army that joined the Achaean–Epirote–Sicilian {{alliance}} opposing the Empire of Nicaea.

However, the <b>distrust</b> toward the trial process gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories. Some experts and politicians argue that their assassination was masterminded by Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan.

5|$|The Bedouins, the Ghatafan {{and other}} Confederates from Najd {{had already been}} {{compromised}} by Muhammad's negotiations.

5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders.

The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual <b>distrust.</b>|$|E
