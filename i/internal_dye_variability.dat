40|$|Non-chromotropic {{substances}} such as fibrin and gelatin {{and most}} tissue and cellular structures stain orthochromatically with <b>internal</b> <b>dye</b> concentrations of such metachromatic dyes as methylene blue and toluidine blue which, if in solution, would be metachromatic. Therefore, at ordinary levels of staining these substances depress the natural tendency of these dyes to change color. However, at {{elevated levels of}} dye-binding metachromasy eventually occurs. This phenomenon is explained {{on the basis of}} the distribution of dye-binding sites. In these substrates, by contrast with chromotropic substances, many binding sites are too far removed for dye interaction, consequently the interaction frequency can become high enough to produce a color change only as saturation of the available sites is approached. It is also shown that the destruction of color is a characteristic of metachromasy and that water molecules intercalated between approximated dye ions are responsible for the loss and change of color. A concept of metachromasy is proposed in which the interaction between water molecules and suitably approximated dye ions plays an essential role. The experimental studies are described against a background of the history and evolution of ideas on metachromasy. The literature is reviewed and reassessed particularly from the physicochemical viewpoint...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} fluid flow after restoration using four restorative procedures. Micro-gap, <b>internal</b> <b>dye</b> leakage, and micropermeability of bonded interfaces were also investigated. Each tooth was mounted, connected to a fluid flow-measuring device, and an occlusal cavity was prepared. Fluid flow after cavity preparation was recorded as the baseline measurement, and the cavity was restored using one of four restorative procedures: bonding with total-etch (Single Bond 2) or self-etch (Clearfil SE Bond) adhesives without lining; or lining with resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (GIC) (Fuji Lining LC) or conventional GIC (Fuji IX) and then bonding with the total-etch adhesive. Fluid flow was recorded after restoration and at specific time-points up to 6 months thereafter and recorded as a percentage. Micro-gap formation was analyzed using resin replicas and scanning electron microscopy. Internal leakage of 2 % methylene blue dye was observed under a light microscope. In micro-permeability testing, fluorescent-dye penetration was investigated using confocal laser microscopy. None of the restorative procedures provided a perfectly sealed restoration. Glass-ionomer lining did not reduce fluid flow after restoration, and micro-gaps were frequently detected. The self-etch adhesive failed to provide a better seal than the total-etch adhesive, and even initial gap formation was rarely observed for the former. Penetration of methylene blue and fluorescent dyes was detected in most restorations. © 2008 Eur J Oral Sci. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A general kinase {{reaction}} was developed {{based on the}} differential reactivity of ATPβS and ADPβS torward bis -dithio nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB). ADPβS, an analog of ADP, the common product of all kinase (or ATPase) reactions is detected after undergoing a disulfide exchange reaction with DTNB to yield the intensely yellow-colored thionitrobenzoate (TNB) anion. The fluorescence version of the kinase assay utilizing dithio-bridged homo-dye dimers has also been tested and is adversely affected by high background fluorescence due to insufficient <b>internal</b> <b>dye</b> quenching. A marked reduction in the background fluorescence was achieved {{by the use of}} (FRET-matched) dithio-bridged hetero-dye dimers. A Z 2 ̆ 7 factor of 0. 6 was obtained using a fluorescein and rhodamine dithio-bridged dye. Kinetic data of the kinase reaction using hexokinase and glucose suggest tighter binding of ATPβS compared to ATP. Likewise, glutathione (GSH), the most abundant cellular thiol, can be detected by a disulfide exchange reaction with dithio-bridged hetero-dye dimers leading to a change in the fluorescence properties of the dye core(s). 1 mM to 10 mM changes in GSH, corresponding to the physiologically relevant GSH levels, showed an almost linear response to net change in fluorescence of the dyes. The cellular application of the dyes was demonstrated through the use of wild-type E. Coli cells and protein reductase deficient cells, in which higher thiol levels were observed in the wild-type cell line.

40|$|The two ß-cyclodextrin-calix[4]arene couples 1 and 2 were {{prepared}} as sensing molecules {{for the detection}} of organic analytes in water. Compounds 1 and 2 are amphiphilic in nature and form aggregates in aqueous solution. Compound 1 forms vesicles both in the absence and in the presence of guest species, and its fluorescence intensity does not change. Compound 2 forms fibers, which change into vesicles upon guest addition. This behavior is accompanied by a reduction in fluorescence intensity. The aggregates were visualized by transmission electron microscopy using both the freeze fracture technique and the uranyl staining method. Langmuir monolayer experiments show that intermolecular interactions lead to a preorganization of 2, whereas molecules of 1 behave independently analogous to conventional amphiphiles. Fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements give evidence for rapid <b>internal</b> <b>dye</b> motion in the aggregates of both compounds 1 and 2. In addition, a slower decay process of low amplitude is observed for both compounds, indicating free rotational motion of single molecules of 1 but the absence of rotational motion of individual molecules within the aggregates of 2. This difference indicates the intermolecular complexation of the fluorophores in the aggregates of 2. The fluorescence lifetimes of aqueous solutions of 2 reveal that the reduction in fluorescence intensity is based on static quenching by the amino group present in the spacer of 2. Our results show the presence of vesicular bilayers of independent amphiphiles for 1, and for 2 the formation of assemblies of molecular threads which are composed by interconnective, linear host-guest complexation...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in nanotechnology {{have led to}} the application of nanoparticles {{in a wide variety of}} fields. In the field of nanomedicine, there is great emphasis on combining diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into a single nanoparticle construct (theranostics). In particular, anisotropic nanoparticles have shown great potential for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection due to their unique optical properties. Gold nanostars are a type of anisotropic nanoparticle with one of the highest SERS enhancement factors in a non-aggregated state. By utilizing the distinct characteristics of gold nanostars, new plasmonic materials for diagnostics, therapy, and sensing can be synthesized. The work described herein is divided into two main themes. The first half presents a novel, theranostic nanoplatform that can be used for both SERS detection and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The second half involves the rational design of silver-coated gold nanostars for increasing SERS signal intensity and improving reproducibility and quantification in SERS measurements. The theranostic nanoplatforms consist of Raman-labeled gold nanostars coated with a silica shell. Photosensitizer molecules for PDT can be loaded into the silica matrix, while retaining the SERS signal of the gold nanostar core. SERS detection and PDT are performed at different wavelengths, so there is no interference between the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Singlet oxygen generation (a measure of PDT effectiveness) was demonstrated from the drug-loaded nanocomposites. In vitro testing with breast cancer cells showed that the nanoplatform could be successfully used for PDT. When further conjugating the nanoplatform with a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), efficacy of both SERS detection and PDT is enhanced. The rational design of plasmonic nanoparticles for SERS sensing involved the synthesis of silver-coated gold nanostars. Investigation of the silver coating process revealed that preservation of the gold nanostar tips was necessary to achieve the increased SERS intensity. At the optimal amount of silver coating, the SERS intensity is increased by over an order of magnitude. It was determined that a majority of the increased SERS signal can be attributed to reducing the inner filter effect, as the silver coating process moves the extinction of the particles far away from the laser excitation line. To improve reproducibility and quantitative SERS detection, an internal standard was incorporated into the particles. By embedding a small-molecule dye between the gold and silver surfaces, SERS signal was obtained both from the <b>internal</b> <b>dye</b> and external analyte on the particle surface. By normalizing the external analyte signal to the internal reference signal, reproducibility and quantitative analysis are improved in a variety of experimental conditions. Dissertatio...|$|R

The capacity of NPs loaded with IL- 8 and MIP- 1 α to increase neutrophil recruitment to lymph nodes (LNs) was tested in mice after footpad injection. Fluorescently-labeled NPs used as tracers indicated the delivery into the sub-capsular compartment of draining LNs. The animals administered the CK-loaded NPs demonstrated a widening of the sub-capsular space and a strong LN influx of leukocytes, while mice injected with control NPs without CKs or bolus doses of soluble CKs alone showed only a marginal neutrophil response. This technology provides a new means to therapeutically direct or restore immune cell traffic, and can also be employed for simultaneous therapy delivery...|$|R

To characterize this <b>variability,</b> <b>dye</b> infiltration experiments {{were conducted on}} four plots representing three main soil types in northeastern Egypt. The plots represented both cultivated and uncultivated land use.

The loamy sand and sandy soils displayed a more uniform dye distribution indicating more homogeneous soil properties. The observed dye patterns were modeled using a diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) model. The DLA is a random walk model where model parameters can be optimized using genetic algorithms (GA). The DLA model reproduced the observed dye patterns for all soils in an excellent way. The best fit was obtained with a specific combination of directional random walk probabilities Pu, Pd, Pr, and Pl for each plot (correlation 0. 97 - 0. 99). To account for soil layers with different hydraulic properties a two layer DLA model was developed. For all plots the Pu (upward random walk probability) was higher for the upper more homogeneous soil layer.

40|$|The {{groundwater}} {{in agricultural}} karst areas {{is susceptible to}} contamination from organic soil amendments and pesticides. During major storm events during 2011, dye traces were initiated using sulphorhodamine-B, fluorescein and eosine in a groundwater recharge area where manure {{was applied to the}} ground. Fecal coliform samples were collected from significant storm events from January-September 2011. Water samples and geochemical data were collected every four hours before, during, and between the storm events from a waterfall in Crumps cave flowing from the known recharge area to track the transport and residence time of the epikarst water and organic soil amendments during variable flow conditions. Two dataloggers at the same waterfall were set up to collect 10 -minute data, which included pH, specific conductivity, temperature, and discharge. Total rainfall amount and other surface meteorological data were collected from a rain station located above the cave. Cave water samples were collected for the analysis of anions, cations, bacterial count, and the presence of dye. The <b>dye</b> traces show <b>variability</b> in the characteristics of epikarstic response and flowpaths. The changes in geochemistry indicate simultaneous storage and transport of meteoric water through epikarst pathways into the cave, with rapid transport of bacteria occurring through the conduits that bypass storage. Fecal coliform counts were elevated all through the study period indicating survivability in soils through the seasons. The results indicate that significant precipitation events affect the storage properties and rapidly impact the various pathways and timing of contaminant transport through the epikarst zone, eventually allowing these contaminants to be transported unfiltered in to the groundwater supply.

40|$|Worldwide {{there is}} {{considerable}} concern over the effects of human activities on {{the quantity and quality}} of freshwater. Measurement of infiltration behaviour will be important for improving freshwater management. This study identifies that New Zealand has a sporadic history of measuring soil water movement attributes on a limited number of soil types, although the current practical demand should be large for management of irrigation, dairy farm effluent disposal, as well as municipal / domestic waste- and storm-water disposal. Previous research has demonstrated that infiltration behaviour is governed by the interplay between numerous mechanisms including hydrophobicity and preferential flow, the latter being an important mechanism of contaminant leaching for many NZ soils. Future characterisation will need to recognise the dynamic nature of these interactions, and be able to reliably characterise the key infiltration mechanisms. Since macropores are responsible for preferential flow, it is critical that infiltration studies use a representative sample of the macropore network. The aim of this project was to study the mechanisms governing the infiltration behaviour of a layered soil in large (50 x 70 cm) monolith lysimeters, where the connectivity of the macropore network remains undisturbed. Four lysimeters of the Gorge silt loam were collected, a structured soil with four distinct layers. On each lysimeter there were four separate infiltration experiments, with water applied under suctions of 0, 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 kPa by a custom-built tension infiltrometer. Each lysimeter was instrumented with 30 tensiometers, located in arrays at the layer boundaries. There was also a field experiment using ponded dye infiltration to visually define preferential flowpaths. Analysis of <b>dye</b> patterns, temporal <b>variability</b> in soil matric potential (Ψm), and solute breakthrough curves all show that preferential flow is an important infiltration mechanism. Preferential flowpaths were activated when Ψm was above - 1. 5 kPa. During saturated infiltration, at least 97 % of drainage was through the ‘mobile’ pore volume of the lysimeter (θm), estimated among the lysimeters at 5. 4 – 8. 7 % of the lysimeter volume. Early-time infiltration behaviour did not show the classical square-root of time behaviour, indicating sorptivity was not the governing mechanism. This was consistent across the four lysimeters, and during infiltration under different surface imposed suctions. The most likely mechanism restricting sorptivity is weak hydrophobicity, which appears to restrict infiltration for the first 5 – 10 mm of infiltration. Overall, the Gorge soil’s early-time infiltration behaviour is governed by the dynamic interaction between sorptivity, hydrophobicity, the network of air-filled pores, preferential flow and air encapsulation. Long-time infiltration behaviour was intimately linked to the temporal dynamics of Ψm, which was in turn controlled by preferential flow and soil layer interactions. Preferential flowpaths created strong inter-layer connectivity by allowing an irregular wetting front to reach lower layers within 2 – 15 mm of infiltration. Thereafter, layer interactions dominate infiltration for long-time periods, as Ψm in soil layers with different K(Ψm) relationships self-adjusts to try to maintain a constant Darcy velocity. An important finding was that Ψm rarely attained the value set by the tension infiltrometer during unsaturated infiltration. The results show that ‘true’ steady-state infiltration is unlikely to occur in layered soils. A quasi-steady state was identified once the whole column had fully wet and layer interactions had settled to where Ψm changes occurred in unison through each soil layer. Quasi-steady state was difficult to identify from just the cumulative infiltration curve, but more robustly identified as when infiltration matched drainage, and Ψm measurements showed each layer had a stable hydraulic gradient. I conclude that the in-situ hydraulic conductivity, K(Ψm), of individual soil layers can be accurately and meaningfully determined from lysimeter-scale infiltration experiments. My results show that K(Ψm) is different for each soil layer, and that differences are consistent among the four lysimeters. Under saturated flow the subsoil had the lowest conductivity, and was the restricting layer. Most interestingly this pattern reversed during unsaturated flow. As Ψm decreased below - 0. 5 to - 1 kPa, the subsoil was markedly more conductive, and the topsoil layers became the restricting layers. All four soil layers demonstrate a sharp decline in K(Ψm) as Ψm decreases, with a break in slope at ~ - 1 kPa indicating the dual-permeability nature of all layers...|$|R
