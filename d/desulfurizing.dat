40|$|Abstract. In this paper, <b>desulfurized</b> ash {{was focused}} on modifying the {{properties}} of fluorgypsum and quicklime was as a reference. According {{to the results of}} water-soluble fluoride and pH value of fluorgypsum with modifiers, the optimal fluoride retention and deacidification effect was obtained by adding 1. 5 % of quicklime, 5 % of <b>desulfurized</b> ash from power station (DA-PS) or 2 % of <b>desulfurized</b> ash from sintered flue gas (DA-SFG), respectively. The continuous hydration process of the cementitious pastes of fluorgypsum was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphology of the gypsum crystals was of irregular particle shapes dispersing inside. In the later hydrating age, the distribution of pores became uniform, and the connection between the crystals overlapped more compact. Considered the modification effects on cementitious pastes, DA-PS could take place of quicklime to achieve the fluoride retention and deacidification of fluorgypsum...|$|R

40|$|New <b>desulfurizing</b> {{bacteria}} able {{to convert}} dibenzothiophene into 2 -hydroxybiphenyl and sulfate were isolated from contaminated soils collected in Mexican refineries. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis showed they {{were different from}} previously reported Rhodococcus erythropolis <b>desulfurizing</b> strains.

A deeply hydrodesulfurized diesel oil containing significant amounts of 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiophene was treated with Rhodococcus sp. IMP-S 02 cells. Up to 60 % of the total sulfur was removed and all the 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiophene disappeared as a result of this treatment...|$|E
30|$|The {{desulfurization}} system mainly includes <b>desulfurizing</b> reaction tower (T- 101) {{and washing}} tower (V- 101). After passing the supercharger (C- 101), the gas containing H 2 S and flue gas {{from outside of}} the device enters the tower {{from the bottom of}} the <b>desulfurizing</b> reaction tower. At same time, the mixed liquor containing sulfuric acid catalyst enters the tower from the top of the tower. The gas and the liquid contact adequately, then the H 2 S will be absorbed and then react with SO 2 in the flue gas stream in the acid catalyst system. Elemental sulfur is generated along with the reaction. All the H 2 S gas almost completely converts into elemental sulfur when passing through from the tower bottom to tower top.|$|E
