5|$|UConn {{owns the}} two longest winning streaks, any gender, <b>in</b> <b>college</b> <b>basketball</b> history. The longest streak, 111 {{straight}} wins, {{started with a}} win against Creighton on December 23, 2014, and ended on March 31, 2017 when a buzzer-beater {{at the end of}} the overtime caused a loss in the 2017 NCAA Final Four by Mississippi State. The second streak counts 90 consecutive wins, including two undefeated seasons (2008–09 and 2009–10), and was delimited by two losses against Stanford, the first on April 6, 2008 in the National Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, and the second – three seasons later – on December 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|While other #1 seeds Notre Dame, South Carolina and Baylor {{suffered}} early upsets in the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily {{advanced to}} the Final Four where they defeated Oregon State 80–51 and then old Big East rival Syracuse 82–51 in the Championship Game. UConn completed their sixth undefeated season winning the 11th overall Championship (all-time record for both men's and women's college basketball) and 4th in a row (also a record for women's college basketball). Geno Auriemma is now the only coach <b>in</b> <b>college</b> <b>basketball</b> to have won 11 titles, passing UCLA legend John Wooden (who has 10) and reaching former NBA coach Phil Jackson.|$|E
5|$|With the {{graduation}} of Luis Guzmán, Fernández switched {{back to his}} natural position at point guard in his junior campaign. Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection. He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard <b>in</b> <b>college</b> <b>basketball.</b> A shooting slump that lasted {{the majority of the}} season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5%, his three point percentage drop to 33.3%, and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game. He still led the team in assists, with 3.9 per game. Fernández did miss four games {{in the middle of the}} season due to a bone bruise in his knee, but the shooting slump was more devastating and caused him to consult a sports psychologist. One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond, in which he went 3-for-17 from the field and committed three turnovers. After the game Fran Dunphy convinced Fernández that he had to take less shots and get his teammates involved.|$|E
