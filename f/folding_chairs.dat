NBC {{did not have a}} studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from a borrowed empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. <b>Folding</b> <b>chairs</b> were brought in for the audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared {{out at the end of}} each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{presents}} about the designing and fabrication of a <b>folding</b> <b>chair.</b> Based {{on the title}} that given of this project, the student has {{to create their own}} design of a <b>folding</b> <b>chair</b> and fabricate the product by individual. The main objective of this project is to design and fabricate a light weight <b>folding</b> <b>chair</b> that able to be used in various types of activities in daily life. There are a several scopes of this project those consist of fabricate an ergonomic <b>folding</b> <b>chair,</b> designing a <b>folding</b> <b>chair</b> that able to used for indoor and outdoor activities, make a few analysis on the product material, and carry out a survey after fabrication. The software that used for designing the concept of <b>folding</b> <b>chair</b> is AutoCAD. This software is able to provide the product drawing in two dimensional and three dimensional views. The concept that selected as final design and will develop for fabrication process is arm table <b>folding</b> <b>chair.</b> This concept is suitable to use for various types of activities such as seminar, campaign and relaxing. The materials that use for fabricate the <b>folding</b> <b>chair</b> is structural steel that come from ASTM-A 36 type. This material is selected because it is hard, more strength and durable. The machining processes that used in this project are such as cutting, welding, drilling and grinding. Besides, there are several analyses design that built in this project. Those analyses are bending moment and stress analysis. Both analyses are purposes to determine the value of bending moment and stress towards the material when applied minimum and maximum load on the back rest and seat part of the <b>folding</b> <b>chair.</b> The minimum load that applied for this analysis is 80 kg and maximum load is 200 kg.. Besides, these analyses also used to measure the strength of material whether the material that used can withstand with the loads give. As the result of analyses, the materials that are structural steel ASTM-A 36 can withstand with the loads given and safe to use for fabrication process. In addition, this project had carried out a survey in university area. That survey had carried out through by questionnaire form and its purpose to gathering the data about the folding that was fabricated and also to gathering the suggestions from respondent for improve the design of <b>folding</b> <b>chair</b> for future...|$|R

2500|$|The {{design for}} the first outdoor OSF Elizabethan Theatre was sketched by Angus L.

Ashland, Oregon obtained WPA funds in 1935 to build it in the roofless shell of the abandoned Chautauqua theatre, the [...] circular walls which remained after the dome had been removed. Bowmer extended the walls to reduce the stage width to fifty-five feet, and painted the extensions to resemble half-timbered buildings. He designed a thrust stage—one projecting toward the audience—with a balcony. Two columns helped divide the main stage into forestage, middle stage, and inner stage areas. Illustrating the improvised nature of it all, actors doubled as stage hands, stage lighting was housed in coffee cans, and string beans were planted along the walls to improve sound quality! Fifty cent general admission seating was on benches just behind the one dollar reserved seating on <b>folding</b> <b>chairs.</b> This theatre was torn down during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{shooting}} continued outside, nurses and medics entered the building. [...] An unidentified soldier secured the south double doors with his ACU belt {{and rushed to}} help the wounded. According to the responding nurses, {{there was so much}} blood covering the floor inside the building, that they were unable to maintain balance, and had difficulty reaching the wounded to help them. In the area outside the building, Hasan continued to shoot at fleeing soldiers. [...] Herman Toro, Director of the Soldier Readiness Processing Site, arrived at this time. [...] Hasan had gone around the building and was out of sight, but still shooting. Toro and another site worker rushed to assist Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman who was down on the ground north of the medical building. [...] They both took her by the arms and tried to carry her to safety when Hasan returned and aimed his red laser across Toro's chest, but did not fire. [...] Toro took cover behind an electrical box and saw civilian police Sergeant Mark Todd arrive and shout commands at Hasan to surrender. Todd said: [...] "Then he turned and fired a couple of rounds at me. I didn't hear him say a word, he just turned and fired." [...] The two exchanged shots, and then Hasan's pistol was empty. [...] He stopped, turned and reached into his pocket for a new magazine and was felled by five shots from Todd, who ran over to him, kicked the pistol out of his hand and put handcuffs on him as he fell unconscious. LTC Tom Eberhart, Deputy Director of Human Resources, Fort Hood, arrived and entered the Medical Building to help. [...] He had to step over bodies to enter the building's north entrance. He assisted another soldier in performing CPR on one of the wounded soldiers at the building's waiting area. [...] <b>Folding</b> <b>chairs</b> were scattered all around. [...] He noticed a soldier outside the south doors of the building and went to help. [...] He had to remove the belt from the door and went outside as others were arriving. [...] The downed soldier was Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, a medical assistant from the building. [...] He had two wounds in the abdomen and a wound to the scalp. He was unconscious and LTC Eberhart went back into the building to retrieve a folding table. [...] Other soldiers assisted getting SSG Lunsford onto the table and around the building to the triage area.|$|E
