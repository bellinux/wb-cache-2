25|$|Since 1975, {{emigration}} from Honduras <b>has</b> <b>accelerated</b> {{as economic}} migrants and political refugees sought {{a better life}} elsewhere.

A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population. The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa. In the 2010 census in the United States, 617,392 residents identified as Hondurans, up from 217,569 in 2000.|$|E
