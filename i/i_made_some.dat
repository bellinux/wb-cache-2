5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E

Journalist Larry Kane, who befriended Lennon in 1964, wrote a {{comprehensive}} biography of Lennon which detailed the [...] "Lost Weekend" [...] period. In the interview with Kane, Lennon explained his feelings about his time with Pang: [...] "You know Larry, I {{may have been the}} happiest I've ever been...

2500|$|I'm {{proud of}} it. It was difficult; {{it was hard}} work. I'm proud of the work because I think <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> little {{difference}} in women in science.

2500|$|Shortly before O'Donnell {{left for}} India he discovered, [...] "a lump on my ribs that was sore. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> doctors do some horrible things to ensure I got to India.

But two days into India not only did the big lump come back but he had a couple of {{partners}} and that's when I thought I was in a bit of strife." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 Florida Gators were 6–1 {{and ranked}} No. 10 {{coming into the}} game, and again seeking to secure their first SEC {{football}} championship. [...] The Gators held a 27–13 halftime advantage and {{seemed to have the}} game in hand until the Bulldogs scored early in the third quarter to cut the lead to 27–20. [...] Then, faced with a fourth-and-one situation at the Gators' own 29-yard-line, coach Doug Dickey decided to go for the first down rather than punt. [...] Gators running back Earl Carr was stopped short by Bulldogs safety Johnny Henderson. [...] Led by quarterback Ray Goff's game management and running back Kevin McLee's 198-yard rushing performance, the Bulldogs seized the momentum and scored three touchdowns {{on their way to a}} come-from-behind 41–27 win. [...] After the game, Dickey said: [...] "We were not outplayed. [...] We were outcoached. [...] <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> dumb calls." [...] Sports writers seized on Dickey's mea culpa, and in subsequent months and years popularized the phrase [...] "fourth and dumb" [...] to refer to Dickey's failed fourth down attempt and the game itself.|$|E

2500|$|Huis {{said of his}} victory: [...] "It's very {{exciting}} to be here, racing in conjunction with pro drivers {{during one of the}} most renowned tech forward events. And to be the ultimate grand victor with Faraday Future Dragon Racing is thrilling." [...] Second-place finisher Rosenqvist stated that the simulation racing environment was new to all the professional racing drivers but was delighted with his achievement and expressed his hope of competing in future eRaces: [...] "In the end it worked out very well for me and I was up the at front in every session. Luckily, in the final I started from the front row and had a very clean race with a long first stint, without any traffic, and I was able to cruise to the podium in P2." [...] Despite his twelve-second penalty for the overuse of FanBoost, Pahkala was sanguine, feeling that the worlds of simulation and real life racing belong together and reserved praise for the development of motor racing eSport events: [...] "In the end, P3 was more than welcome for me. It’s been a blast! <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> mistakes in the practice session preparation which cost me pace later on and P3 is more than fair for everyone with what happened." ...|$|E
