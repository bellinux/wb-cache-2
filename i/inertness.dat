5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical <b>inertness,</b> and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.|$|E
5|$|For its <b>inertness</b> {{and high}} thermal conductivity, neutron transparency, {{and because it}} does not form {{radioactive}} isotopes under reactor conditions, helium is used as a heat-transfer medium in some gas-cooled nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Helium, {{mixed with}} a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for thermoacoustic {{refrigeration}} due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number. The <b>inertness</b> of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.|$|E
5|$|Titanium may be {{anodized}} to {{vary the}} thickness of the surface oxide layer, causing optical interference fringes and a variety of bright colors. With this coloration and chemical <b>inertness,</b> titanium is a popular metal for body piercing.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{protective}} gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, because it is inert. Because of its <b>inertness,</b> thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal {{has several}} useful {{mechanical}} properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative <b>inertness.</b> Many metals {{are superior to}} lead {{in some of these}} aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores. Lead's toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses.|$|E
5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its <b>inertness</b> makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The <b>inertness</b> of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{platinum}} wire {{is used for}} electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical <b>inertness</b> upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{elements}} in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme <b>inertness</b> and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the noble gases, {{with the exception of}} xenon in the very unstable XeBr2); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's (oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{elements}} in the periodic table form binary iodides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme <b>inertness</b> and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the noble gases); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth); and having an electronegativity higher than iodine's (oxygen and the first three halogens), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not iodides but rather oxides or halides of iodine.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{abundant}} on a universal scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical <b>inertness,</b> all properties which tend {{to keep it from}} being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its bullion has the ISO currency code of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} <b>inertness.</b> It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative <b>inertness</b> of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the great}} {{reactivity}} of atomic nitrogen, elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical <b>inertness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative <b>inertness</b> to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, its {{name comes from}} Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It {{is part of the}} refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical <b>inertness</b> of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers.|$|E
5|$|Technetium {{is located}} in the seventh group of the {{periodic}} table, between rhenium and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical <b>inertness</b> and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with a net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. Technetium dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.|$|E
5|$|While {{balloons}} {{are perhaps}} the best known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use. Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or <b>inertness.</b> Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers. Other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and leak detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary <b>inertness</b> of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon) is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E
25|$|Bioceramic {{prosthetics}} {{are made}} of aluminium oxide (Al2O3). Aluminium oxide is a ceramic biomaterial {{that has been used}} for more than 35 years in the orthopedic and dental ﬁelds for a variety of prosthetic applications because of its low friction, durability, stability, and <b>inertness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitor {{electrodes}} {{are generally}} thin coatings applied and electrically {{connected to a}} conductive, metallic current collector. Electrodes must have good conductivity, high temperature stability, long-term chemical stability (<b>inertness),</b> high corrosion resistance and high surface areas per unit volume and mass. Other requirements include environmental friendliness and low cost.|$|E
25|$|Over 90% of the {{aluminium}} oxide, normally termed Smelter Grade Alumina (SGA), produced {{is consumed}} {{for the production}} of aluminium, usually by the Hall–Héroult process. The remainder, normally called speciality alumina is used {{in a wide variety of}} applications which reflect its <b>inertness,</b> temperature resistance and electrical resistance.|$|E
25|$|Argon compounds, the {{chemical}} compounds that contain the element argon, are rarely encountered {{due to the}} <b>inertness</b> of the argon atom. However, compounds of argon have been detected in inert gas matrix isolation, cold gases, and plasmas, and molecular ions containing argon have been made and also detected in space. One solid interstitial compound of argon, Ar1C60 is stable at room temperature. Ar1C60 was discovered by CSIRO.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} wet tantalum capacitors {{developed in}} the 1930s were axial capacitors, having a wound cell consisting of a tantalum anode and foil cathode separated by a paper stripe soaked with an electrolyte, mounted in a silver case and non-hermetic elastomer sealed. Because of the <b>inertness</b> and stability of the tantalum dielectric oxide layer against strong acids, the wet tantalum capacitors could use sulfuric acid as an electrolyte, thus providing them with a relatively low ESR.|$|E
25|$|Zircon is {{a common}} {{accessory}} to trace mineral constituent of most granite and felsic igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical <b>inertness,</b> zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and {{is a common}} constituent of most sands. Zircon is rare within mafic rocks and very rare within ultramafic rocks aside {{from a group of}} ultrapotassic intrusive rocks such as kimberlites, carbonatites, and lamprophyre, where zircon can occasionally be found as a trace mineral owing to the unusual magma genesis of these rocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} gas is {{to prevent}} {{evaporation}} of the filament, without introducing significant heat losses. For these properties, chemical <b>inertness</b> and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament, reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces heat losses (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by heat conduction and heat convection.|$|E
25|$|Carboplatin is less potent than cisplatin; {{depending}} on the strain of cancer, carboplatin may only be 1/8 to 1/45 as effective. The clinical standard of dosage of carboplatin is usually a 4:1 ratio compared to cisplatin; that is, for a dose that usually requires a particular dose of cisplatin, {{four times as much}} carboplatin is needed to achieve the same effectiveness. The stable property of carboplatin is a mixed blessing: once uptake of the drug occurs, its retention half-life is considerably longer than cisplatin, but it is also this <b>inertness</b> that causes carboplatin to go right through the human body, and up to 90% of the carboplatin given can be recovered in urine.|$|E
25|$|Packaging is the {{operation}} {{to put the}} wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask and the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement {{to the quality of}} the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the beverage can, and the Bag-In-Box. Their quality is in their chemical <b>inertness</b> in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.|$|E
25|$|As {{the best}} and {{original}} state, {{there was a time}} when the pure elements and the two powers co-existed in a condition of rest and <b>inertness</b> in the form of a sphere. The elements existed together in their purity, without mixture and separation, and the uniting power of Love predominated in the sphere: the separating power of Strife guarded the extreme edges of the sphere. Since that time, strife gained more sway and the bond which kept the pure elementary substances together in the sphere was dissolved. The elements became the world of phenomena we see today, full of contrasts and oppositions, operated on by both Love and Strife. The sphere being the embodiment of pure existence is the embodiment or representative of God. Empedocles assumed a cyclical universe whereby the elements return and prepare the formation of the sphere for the next period of the universe.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr {{model was}} able to explain the {{emission}} and absorption spectra of hydrogen. The energies of electrons in the n = 1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such {{as the fact that}} helium (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical <b>inertness.</b> Modern quantum mechanics explains this in terms of electron shells and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus the n = 1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the n = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all n = 1 states are fully occupied; the same for n = 1 and n = 2 in neon. In argon the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.|$|E
500|$|The {{predominance}} of radiogenic [...] {{is the reason}} the standard atomic weight of terrestrial argon is {{greater than that of}} the next element, potassium, a fact that was puzzling when argon was discovered. Mendeleev positioned the elements on his periodic table in order of atomic weight, but the <b>inertness</b> of argon suggested a placement before the reactive alkali metal. Henry Moseley later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of atomic number (see History of the periodic table).|$|E
500|$|While Fenn {{was working}} with Monsanto, the company's {{research}} {{was focused on the}} production of phosphoric acid and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). [...] Fenn and his colleagues at Monsanto were largely unaware of the health hazards posed by PCBs, indeed because of their <b>inertness,</b> they [...] "practically bathed in the stuff". [...] After spending several more years doing various industrial research, Fenn was looking {{to get back into the}} academic world. [...] He had the opportunity to go to Princeton University, where he became the director of Project SQUID.|$|E
500|$|Simply {{following}} electron configurations, hydrogen (electronic configuration 1s1) and helium (1s2) {{should be}} placed in groups 1 and 2, above lithium (2s1) and beryllium (2s2). However, such placing is rarely used outside of the context of electron configurations: When the noble gases (then called [...] "inert gases") were first discovered around 1900, they were known as [...] "group 0", reflecting no chemical reactivity of these elements known at that point, and helium {{was placed on the}} top that group, as it did share the extreme chemical <b>inertness</b> seen throughout the group. As the group changed its formal number, many authors continued to assign helium directly above neon, in group 18; one of the examples of such placing is the current IUPAC table.|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} {{basis of}} the chemical periodicity governing the periodic table is the electron shell closures at each noble gas (atomic numbers 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 86, and 118): as any further electrons must enter a new shell with higher energy, closed-shell electron configurations are markedly more stable, leading to the relative <b>inertness</b> of the noble gases. Since protons and neutrons are also known to arrange themselves in closed nuclear shells, the same effect happens at nucleon shell closures, which happen at specific nucleon numbers often dubbed [...] "magic numbers". The known magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, and 82 for protons and neutrons, and also 126 for neutrons. Nucleons with magic proton and neutron numbers, such as helium-4, oxygen-16, calcium-48, and lead-208, are termed [...] "doubly magic" [...] and are very stable against decay. This property of increased nuclear stability {{is very important for}} superheavy elements: without any stabilization, their half-lives would be expected by exponential extrapolation to be in the range of nanoseconds (10−9s) when element 110 (darmstadtium) is reached, because of the ever-increasing repulsive electromagnetic forces between the positively charged protons that overcome the limited-range strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together. The next closed nucleon shells and hence magic numbers are thought to be at the centre of the long-sought island of stability, where the half-lives to alpha decay and spontaneous fission lengthen again.|$|E
