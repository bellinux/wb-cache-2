5|$|At first Nansen and Johansen {{made good}} {{progress}} south, but on 13 April suffered a serious setback when {{both of their}} chronometers stopped. Without knowing the correct time, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches {{on the basis of}} Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 {{was further}} pushed back to October 2008 due to {{manufacturing}} delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions. Lockheed Martin experienced delays during the production changes {{to make new}} external tanks with all the enhancements recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to produce two tanks for the STS-125 mission–one for Atlantis, and one for Endeavour for an emergency rescue mission, if necessary–in time for the original August launch date.|$|E

[...] "With all the telegraph and telephone wires down the authorities won't {{be able to}} send out any alarm.

60|$|Over {{and over}} again the clinking noise was repeated. Cautious as the Indians were, it was <b>impossible</b> even <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to get over that strange and {{difficult}} obstacle without touching the wires with their arms. Occasionally Mr. Hardy and the boys fancied that they could see dark objects stealing toward the house through the gloom; otherwise all was still.|$|R
5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to land.|$|E
5|$|The couple then {{journeyed to}} Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the {{presence}} of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
60|$|The {{two boys}} had been hustled on {{board of the}} {{schooner}} with scant ceremony, and now they found themselves bound and handcuffed, {{so that it was}} next to <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> either of <b>them</b> to move. Hour after hour had passed, yet nobody had come near them.|$|R
60|$|What to do {{next the}} Rover boys did not know. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any of <b>them</b> to {{calculate}} how far they were from the spot where they had landed or {{to determine the best}} way of getting back to Foreshow Bay, as they had named the locality.|$|R
60|$|When {{they found}} out {{what they had to}} do, each man went to work to try, if possible, to raise the twelve pounds; but Rogers soon saw that it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> some of <b>them</b> to do this, as specie money was so hard to get, and he reduced the sum, in some cases, to six or four pounds. He was a good {{business}} manager, and would not try {{to get out of a}} man more than that man could pay.|$|R
5|$|Operation Banner {{ended at}} midnight on 31 July 2007 after about 38 years of {{continuous}} deployment, the longest in British Army history. According {{to an internal}} document released in 2007, the British Army had failed to defeat the IRA but made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to win by violence. Operation Helvetic replaced Operation Banner in 2007, maintaining fewer service personnel in a more-benign environment. From 1971 to 1997, a total of 763 British military personnel were killed during the Troubles. About 300 deaths during the conflict were attributed to the British Army, including paramilitary troops and civilians.|$|E
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied {{one end of a}} cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} changed radically {{during the}} early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of NVA armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank tracks in the area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the NVA was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.|$|E
6000|$|... “Davidson’s {{home after}} {{this was like}} a silent, frozen hell for him. A stupid woman {{with a sense of}} {{grievance}} is worse than an unchained devil. He sent the boy to the White Fathers in Malacca. This was not a very expensive sort of education, but she could not forgive him for not casting the offensive child away utterly. She worked up her sense of her wifely wrongs and of her injured purity to such a pitch that one day, when poor Davidson was pleading with her to be reasonable and not to make an <b>impossible</b> existence <b>for</b> <b>them</b> both, she turned on him in a chill passion and told him that his very sight was odious to her.|$|R
50|$|In April 2011, the New York Times ran {{an article}} on law school {{scholarships}} that included interviews with Golden Gate students and alumni who claimed the school had baited them into enrolling by awarding them merit scholarships. Such a scholarship would continue as long as its recipient maintained a GPA of at least 3.0. The article claims that the school did not inform recipients that the school's mandatory first-year curve made it statistically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> all of <b>them</b> to maintain a GPA of at least 3.0.|$|R

5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered {{and it would have been}} <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the garrison surrender, the garrison refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the garrison were able to give up the castle with dignity.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been delayed}} several times by poor weather, Operation Cobra {{commenced}} on 25 July, with a concentrated aerial bombardment {{from thousands of}} Allied aircraft. Supporting offensives had drawn the bulk of German armored reserves toward the British and Canadian sector and coupled with the general lack of men and materiel available to the Germans, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to form successive lines of defense. Units of the U. S. VII Corps led the initial two-division assault, while other First Army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin German units in place. Progress was slow {{on the first day}} but opposition started to crumble once the defensive crust had been broken. By 27 July, most organized resistance had been overcome and the VII and VIII Corps advanced rapidly, isolating the Cotentin peninsula.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He {{believed}} that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
6000|$|The company moved round, in fact, {{until they}} had formed almost a semicircle, then they advanced, closing in as they neared the house. When they reached the spot {{where they could be}} seen by the peasants a trumpet sounded and they ran in. The peasants, bewildered at seeing the line of {{soldiers}} closing in around them, hesitated. Some were already too drunk to rise from the ground on which they had thrown themselves, the others caught up their arms and ran together. Retreat was <b>impossible,</b> <b>for</b> behind <b>them</b> was the burning house. Suddenly a stream of fire burst from the semicircle of troops. Some thirty of the insurgents fell, the others threw down their arms and fell upon their knees crying for mercy. The troops were rushing forward to finish their work, when Hector shouted [...] "Halt!" ...|$|R

500|$|The android {{head nurse}} ANI (Julia Pennington) and the alien surgeon Dr. Batung (Jordan Lund) {{also help to}} combat the {{frequent}} medical emergencies at the hospital. ANI (Android Nursing Interface) is represented as [...] "extremely efficient and attractive", the facility's other nurses disliking her as they feel that she sets an <b>impossible</b> standard <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to match. Throughout the series, ANI develops more emotions, such as crying and laughing, and tries {{to learn more about}} them. Batung, who is part of the slug-like species the Shenn, is portrayed as lacking bedside manners by acting insensitively toward his patients. His negative behavior is attributed to his lack of experience working with human co-workers and patients. The hospital is run by the Chief of Staff Harris DeMilla (Joe Spano), who is often tasked to handle its ethical issues.|$|R

25|$|The Virginia Colony {{continued}} to grow and encroach on Powhatan land, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to sustain traditional practices.

50|$|This process {{started in}} 1834 with the {{appointment}} of Bayraktar Mehmet Pasha, who was to rule Mosul {{for the next four}} years. After the reign of Bayraktar Mehmet Pasha, the Ottoman government (wishing still to restrain the influence of powerful local families) appointed a series of governors in rapid succession, ruling “for only a brief period before being sent somewhere else to govern, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any of <b>them</b> to achieve a substantial local power base.” Mosul's importance as a trading center declined after the opening of the Suez canal, which enabled goods to travel to and from India by sea rather than by land across Iraq and through Mosul.|$|R
50|$|It must be {{said that}} unlike the {{nationalist}} propaganda that exaggerated the communist threat, despite being threatened, Kaifeng remained firmly in the nationalist hands throughout the campaign, and even the Communists themselves had never planned to take the city, fully aware {{that it was an}} <b>impossible</b> task <b>for</b> <b>them</b> at the time. It {{should also be noted that}} another gravely exaggerated communist threat was the nationalist loss once announced by the local nationalist defenders themselves in order to draw more help / reinforcement, the nationalist loss was only sixteen thousands, (which was agreed by the enemy), it was never as high as ninety thousand, a number that was dismissed even by the enemy. Furthermore, the true casualty of sixteen thousand was insignificant, totaling less than 10% of the total nationalist force deployed for this campaign, and though it was too late <b>for</b> most of <b>them</b> to participate in actual fighting, they would have the chance later in the Dingtao Campaign soon to come.|$|R

(In the conditions prevailing at the time of writing - with the right of African-Americans to civil equality still hotly disputed in the South - Wallace assumed that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> one of <b>them</b> to achieve the presidency by direct election, and that the only way it could happen would be by an unlikely accident).|$|R
25|$|Each Jewish etrog {{merchant}} committed {{himself to}} his local rabbi {{that he would not}} buy any etrog from the Greek farmers, since this would result in a record breaking expense for the Jewish community, which was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to pay.

For ordinary persons, married life is undoubtedly advisable unless they have a special aptitude for celibacy". Baba also asserted that [...] "The value of celibacy lies {{in the habit of}} restraint and the sense of detachment and independence which it gives" [...] and that [...] "The aspirant must choose one of the two courses which are open to him. He must take to the life of celibacy or to the married life, and he must avoid at all costs a cheap compromise between the two. Promiscuity in sex gratification is bound to land the aspirant in a most pitiful and dangerous chaos of ungovernable lust." ...|$|R
