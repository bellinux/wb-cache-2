5|$|Pumpkin {{bombs were}} {{a means of}} {{providing}} realistic training with non-nuclear bombs for the 509th Composite Group's Boeing B-29 Superfortress crews assigned to drop the atomic bomb. The pumpkin bomb had the same weight, size, and weight distribution as the Fat Man plutonium bomb, giving it the same ballistic and <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B-29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets.|$|E
5|$|U-23 was {{launched}} on 5 January 1917, but It {{is not known}} with certainty when U-23 was commissioned. Author Paul Halpern reports that U-23 and her three sisters all entered service between August and November 1917. Although there are no specific reports of problems with U-23, the U-20 class as a whole suffered from unreliable engines which compounded the poor <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the boats.|$|E
5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E
25|$|The jet {{failed to}} gain {{sufficient}} altitude upon takeoff, with eyewitnesses suggesting the nose was over-rotated. The F-86 Sabre has a dangerous and often fatal <b>handling</b> <b>characteristic</b> upon takeoff if the nose is raised prematurely from the runway.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{development}} of an instrument to measure fabric <b>handle</b> <b>characteristic</b> objectively. A nozzle extraction method for objective measurement of fabric <b>handle</b> <b>characteristics</b> has been developed. The instrument measures the force exerted by the fabric being drawn out of the nozzle axially {{as well as on}} the periphery of the nozzle i. e. radials. These two forces in perpendicular directions have been used to determine the <b>handle</b> <b>characteristics</b> of fabric. Accuracy and reproducibility of the newly developed testing instrument is verified. It has been observed that the fabric extraction force and load time graph obtained from the instrument gives valuable information to draw some meaningful conclusion regarding the nature of fabric and the <b>handle</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the fabric. The preliminary test results indicate that fabric feel can be comprehensively judged from a single test from the instrument objectively. Cost and time involved in testing is also less compared to other existing instruments...|$|R
5|$|As American fighters {{took over}} the {{long-range}} escorting of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) daylight bombing raids, the Griffon-engined Spitfires progressively took up the tactical air superiority role, and {{played a major role}} in intercepting V-1 flying bombs, while the Merlin-engined variants (mainly the Mk IX and the Packard-engined Mk XVI) were adapted to the fighter-bomber role. Although the later Griffon-engined marks lost some of the favourable <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> of their Merlin-powered predecessors, they could still outmanoeuvre their main German foes and other, later American and British-designed fighters.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|During their active service, {{the boats}} of the U-20 class {{suffered}} from unreliable engines which compounded the already poor <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the boats. None {{of the class}} had any successes and two of their number were sunk during the war. U-23 was the first sunk when she went down on 21 February 1918 from an explosive paravane in the Straits of Otranto. U-20, the lead boat of the class, sank in July 1918 when she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine F-12 in the Tagliamento estuary. The remaining two boats were surrendered at war's end, with U-21 being ceded to Italy in 1920, and U-22 to France; both were broken up.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45â€“60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E

Obtaining a CDL requires extra {{education and training}} dealing with the special knowledge requirements and <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> of such a large vehicle. Drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) must adhere to the hours of service, which are regulations governing the driving hours of commercial drivers. These and all other rules regarding the safety of interstate commercial driving are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The FMCSA is {{a division of the}} United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which governs all transportation-related industries such as trucking, shipping, railroads, and airlines.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} a {{comprehensive}} study of reproducibility of the newly developed instrument to study fabric <b>handle</b> <b>characteristics</b> using extraction principle. As reported earlier that a new nozzle extraction method for objective measurement of fabric <b>handle</b> <b>characteristics</b> has been developed. The force exerted by the fabric being drawn out of the nozzle is known as extraction force and the force exerted by the fabric at the side wall of the nozzle is known as radial force. A few fabric samples have been tested on this newly developed instrument {{and the effect of}} numbers of tests has been studied. It has been observed that minimum five samples of a fabric test in this instrument gives lower standard deviation of the test results. Also the overall deviations of results justified the reproducibility of the instrument and hence the said instrument if validated for its testing parameters...|$|R

50|$|If (lateral) load {{transfer}} reaches the tire loading {{on one end}} of a vehicle, the inside wheel on that end will lift, causing a change in <b>handling</b> <b>characteristic.</b> If it reaches half the weight of the vehicle it will start to roll over. Some large trucks will roll over before skidding, while passenger vehicles and small trucks usually roll over only when they leave the road. Fitting racing tires to a tall or narrow vehicle and then driving it hard may lead to rollover.|$|R
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were responsive to the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7Â°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12Â° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, {{one of the}} 707s transported 300 Australian Army {{personnel}} in two flights to Namibia {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to UNTAG, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group policing the country's transition to independence. Later that year, the squadron helped ferry members of the Australian public when the two domestic airlines were grounded during an industrial dispute; it was similarly employed in 1991 following the demise of Compass Airlines. On 29October 1991, one of the transport-configured 707s crashed into the sea during a training flight out of East Sale, Victoria; all five crew members were killed. The coronial inquest into this accident found that training in the asymmetric handling manoeuvre that caused the crash was deficient, and that the RAAF lacked a proper understanding of the <b>handling</b> <b>characteristics</b> of its 707s. The Coroner's first recommendation related to the need for appropriate simulation for this type of training, an area not properly recognised or addressed by the RAAF at the time. No.33 Squadron transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace in 1993.|$|E
50|$|As well, {{the ongoing}} {{technical}} development and long production {{history of the}} F-86 resulted in some {{significant differences in the}} <b>handling</b> and flying <b>characteristics</b> between the various F-86 models. Some of the important changes to the design included the switch from an elevator/stabilizer to an all-flying tail, the discontinuation of leading edge slats for a solid leading edge with increased internal fuel capacity, increased engine power and internal missile bay (F-86D). Each of these design changes impacted the <b>handling</b> and flying <b>characteristics</b> of the F-86 and not necessarily for the better. In the case of the solid leading edge and increased internal fuel capacity, the design change produced increased combat performance but exacerbated a dangerous and often fatal <b>handling</b> <b>characteristic</b> upon takeoff if the nose was raised prematurely from the runway. This 'over-rotation' danger is now a major area of instruction and concern for current F-86 pilots. The 1972 Sacramento Canadair Sabre accident resulting in 22 fatalities and 28 other casualties was a result of over-rotation on takeoff.|$|R
