50|$|The {{electron}} <b>ionization</b> <b>time</b> {{of flight}} mass spectroscopy (EI-TOF MS) {{is well suited}} for analytical and basic chemical physics studies. EI-TOF MS is used to find ionization potentials of molecules and radicals, as well as bond dissociation energies for ions and neutral molecules. Another use of this method is to study about negative ion chemistry and physics. Autodetachment lifetimes, metastable dissociation, Rydberg electron transfer reactions and field detachment, SF6 Scavenger method for detecting temporary negative ion states, and many others have all been discovered using this technique. In this method the field free ionization region allows for high precision in the electron energy and also high electron energy resolution. Measuring the electric fields down the ion flight tube determines autodetachment and metastable decomposition as well as field detachment of weakly bound negative ions.|$|E

40|$|The nonequilibrium {{ionization}} {{process in}} hydrogen-helium mixture behind a strong shock wave is studied numerically using the detailed ionization rate model developed recently by Park {{which accounts for}} emission and absorption of Lyman lines. The study finds that, once the avalanche ionization is started, the Lyman line is self-absorbed. The intensity variation of the radiation at 5145 Angstroms found by Leibowitz in a shock tube experiment can be numerically reproduced by assuming that ionization behind the shock wave prior to the onset of avalanche ionization is 1. 3 %. Because 1. 3 % initial ionization is highly unlikely, Leibowitz s experimental data is deemed questionable. By varying the initial electron density value in the calculation, the calculated <b>ionization</b> equilibration <b>time</b> is shown to increase approximately as inverse square-root of the initial electron density value.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{experimental}} parameters on kinetic measurements performed with an ion trap mass spectrometer {{have been investigated}} by a chemometric approach using Experimental Design techniques. The selected experiment was {{the determination of the}} rate constant of the reaction CH 3 CO++CH 3 COCH 3 → CH 3 CO(H) CH 3 ++CH 2 CO. In a first step, eight variables were studied: temperature, acetone pressure, buffer gas pressure, method of ion selection, ionization start mass, <b>ionization</b> <b>time,</b> mass range, and reaction time. The results show that isolation method and reaction time were the only parameters affecting rate constants determination, although temperature may be considered a “borderline” factor. The remaining parameters and their interactions do not significantly affect the kinetic measurements.

40|$|The hydromagnetic {{turbulence}} surrounding comet Giacobini-Zinner {{is characterized}} by two dominant components: large amplitude, linearly polarized waves with periods near 100 s and circularly polarized wave packets with periods near 3 s. The latter appear in association with variations in field magnitude produced by the long period waves. A third, commonly observed feature is identified, consisting of a partial rotation of the magnetic field (a hook-like structure) which {{also appears to be}} triggered by the long period waves. The possibility that the long period waves are generated by the pickup of freshly ionized cometary neutrals has been investigated. A resonant instability identified by Wu and Davidson (1972) appears able to account for the long period waves in terms of the pickup of cometary ions of the water group. Application of the theory also indicates that the growth rate of proton cyclotron waves, as a consequence of hydrogen ion pickup, is somewhat lower, due to both higher neutral velocities and longer <b>ionization</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{ion trap}} mass {{spectrometer}} is a tandem-in-time instrument that has promise as an extremely sensitive device for practical tandem mass spectrometry assays. An approach for the quantitative analysis of unknown drug levels in crude extracts, using combined capillary gas chromatography and the ion trap mass spectrometer in the tandem mode, is described. One-gram plasma samples were spiked with an anti-inflammatory drug at levels of 1 – 100 ng, and with 50 ng {{of a chemical}} analog internal standard. Crude extracts of the plasma samples are analyzed by using scan functions that utilize combined radiofrequency (rf) and dc voltages. The need for combined rf- and dc-voltage sequences for analysis of such extracts is demonstrated by comparison to attempted analyses using only rf voltages. Limitations of the method are: (1) the need for accurate calibration of <b>ionization</b> <b>times</b> to obtain linear calibration lines, and (2) the lack of automatic gain control for scans using combined rf and dc voltages to control and optimize parent ion populations and to allow a simpler analysis of “unknowns. ...|$|R

There is strong evidence that these magnetosheath abundances are representative of the solar wind. Other sources of solar wind abundances are Solar Energetic Particle experiments and Apollo lunar foils. When comparing the abundances from all of these sources with photospheric abundances, it is clear that helium is depleted in the solar wind while silicon and iron are enhanced.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of ionization {{of the hydrogen}} atom due to an XUV pulse {{in the presence of}} an IR laser with both fields linearly polarized in the same direction. In particular, we study the energy distribution of photoelectrons emitted perpendicularly to the polarization direction. By means of a very simple semiclassical model which considers electron trajectories born at different <b>ionization</b> <b>times,</b> the electron energy spectrum can be interpreted as the interplay of Intra and Intercycle interferences. The intracycle interference pattern stems from the coherent superposition of four electron trajectories giving rise to (i) interference of electron trajectories born during the same half cycle (Intrahalfcycle interference) and (ii) interference between electron trajectories born during the first half cycle with those born during the second half cycle (Interhalfcycle interference). The intercycle interference is responsible for the formation of the sidebands. We also show that the destructive interhalfcycle interference for the absorption and emission of an even number of IR laser photons is responsible for the characteristic sidebands in the perpendicular direction separated by twice the IR photon energy. We analyze the dependence of the energy spectrum on the laser intensity and the time delay between the XUV pulse and the IR laser. Finally, we show that our semiclassical simulations are in very good agreement with quantum calculations within the strong field approximation and the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
