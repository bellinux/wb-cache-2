The "majority " approach to dialect-caused reading problems is bidialectal, which suggests that SE should be taught as a supplementary or alternative dialect without stigmatizing the child's indigenous speech. Linguists vary in their approaches to this method. Some suggest methods which focus on teaching SE prior to reading or in the lower grades; others opt for methods which permit the child to read the traditional material in his own dialect. Still others recommend that reading materials be altered to match the child's dialect. A more recent suggestion call...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 54). In this paper, we demonstrate an Augmented Reality based Bangla text detection and translation application on Android-platform (2. 2). This application recognizes the text that is captured by a mobile phone camera and translates the text and finally displays back the recognized text along with the translation onto the screen. To develop this application we have used the Optical Character Recognition, OCR engine (Tesseract), Google translate API and an open source Android application called android-ocr. The objective of this project is to assist the tourists navigate while they are roaming around in abroad. To achieve our goal we develop an application based on the mobile camera which can {{be able to detect}} Bangla text at word level and translate it into <b>English.</b> <b>S.</b> Mahbub-Uz-ZamanTanjina IslamB.
