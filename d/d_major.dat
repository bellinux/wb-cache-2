5|$|Novello {{published}} {{both the}} E-flat major and the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> {{version of the}} Magnificat in a single publication in 2000, edited by Neil Jenkins. This edition also offered a transposed version of the Christmas 1723 laudes {{so that they could}} be fitted in performances of the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> version of the Magnificat. The last measures of the Virga Jesse, missing from the autograph score, were in this edition completed on the base of a similar composition by Bach.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recording}} by Rilling, of the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> {{version with}} Christmas interpolations, with a performance time of 40:06, was reissued {{under the title}} Christmas Magnificats, and also issued in comparison to a recording of the Magnificat in D by Kurt Thomas under the title Compare. Gönnenwein's <b>D</b> <b>major</b> recording with Christmas interpolations appeared on a CD titled J.S. Bach: Cantatas 142, 65 & Magnificat.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} the Christmas hymns of the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat were printed {{was in the same}} volume as the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> version of the Magnificat, in the 1862 Bach Gesellschaft XI/1 publication, which {{presented}} the hymns in an annex. In that publication the hymns were however not transposed to fit in the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> setting of the Magnificat. More recently publishers offer such transposed (and completed) versions of the hymns, {{so that they can be}} performed as part of the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> version of the Magnificat, for instance Novello in 2000 (Neil Jenkins) and Bärenreiter in 2014.|$|E
5|$|All {{movements}} {{are written in}} <b>D</b> <b>major,</b> but Reger often modulates. The movements follow each other without a break.

5|$|Bruno Maderna {{recorded}} BWV 243a, {{with the}} choir and orchestra of the Südwestdeutscher Rundfunk, and Hedy Graf, Hildegard Laurich, Adalbert Kraus and Michael Schopper as vocal soloists, in 1971. Its CD-release as volume 8 of the Maderna Edition by Arkadia was in 1991. The first recording on period instruments of Bach's Magnificat, {{with the four}} choral Christmas interpolations (BWV 243a), was released by Simon Preston and the Academy of Ancient Music in 1978 (L'Oiseau Lyre / Decca), coupled with Vivaldi's Gloria. Nicolaus Harnoncourt's first recording of the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> version followed in 1984. Also Helmuth Rilling and John Eliot Gardiner had by then recorded the <b>D</b> <b>major</b> version of the Magnificat.|$|E
5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} <b>D</b> <b>major</b> for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a <b>D</b> <b>major</b> chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} {{the work for}} five soloists: two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass. The soloists {{are listed in the}} table in the order SATB. For some recordings, only one soprano soloist is listed. Recordings with orchestras on period instruments in historically informed performances are highlighted. The first recordings in the 1960s combined the version in <b>D</b> <b>major</b> (BWV 243) with transposed Christmas interpolations. The type of orchestra is shown for an ensemble with period instruments in historically informed performance by green background.|$|E
5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} the version better known today. In that version, transposed to <b>D</b> <b>major,</b> the laudes interpolations were abandoned.

Changes in musical texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony {{near the end of}} the Omnes generationes movement being the most noticeable.|$|E

5|$|For {{the feast}} of Visitation of 1733, Bach {{produced}} {{a new version of}} his Latin Magnificat, without the Christmas hymns: instrumentation of some movements was altered or expanded, and the key changed from E-flat major to <b>D</b> <b>major,</b> for performance reasons of the trumpet parts.

40|$|Abstract A pontoniinid shrimp, Periclimenes rectirostris Bruce, 1981 ，is {{recorded}} {{on the basis}} of seven specimens captured f rom Suruga Bay, Honshu, Japan. The host species of this shr imp has not been exactly determined. This s tudy shows the host to be determined a diadematid echinoid, Chaetodiadema japonicum Mortensen, 1904 ，and the first record of P. rectirostris f rom Japanese waters, represent <b>ing</b> <b>major</b> range extension to north. Key words: Periclimenes rectirostris, sea urchin associate, new host record, range extension, Japan. Shrimps of the pontoniinid genus Pericli-menes Costa, 1844, are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. Most species are associated with several taxa of marine invertebrates (Bruce, 1994). Bruce (1981) described Periclimenes rectirostris based on two males and an ovigerous female dredged from NE of Lubang, the Philippines, at depths of 129 to 134 m. Additionally, Bruce (1991, 1996) recorded this species from the deep seas off the Chesterfield Islands and the Philippines. The type specimens of P. rectirostris were dredged together with a deep sea diadematid sea urchin, Eremopyga denudata (de Meijere, 1904), and thus Bruce (1981 ， 1985, 1991) suggested that the host of P. rectirostris might be E. denudata. One of us (JO) examined a male specimen identifiable with P. rectirostris collected by a skillful diver, Mr. R. Minemizu, from Ose...|$|R
