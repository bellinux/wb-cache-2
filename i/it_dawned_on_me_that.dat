500|$|As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, {{and many}} {{movements}} arose in its wake– {{among them the}} feminist, men's liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements. [...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press. [...] He also took up residence in a free-love commune. [...] "One fierce winter's day", he says,"... <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the ideas and energies from the various 'fringe' movements [...] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. [...] But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". [...] Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. [...] He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself, in 1976. [...] A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the [...] "first", [...] "most ambitious", or [...] "most adequate" [...] attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising {{in the wake of the}} New Left. [...] Some academics say it offers a new ideology.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{professional}} tennis career, however, {{was going}} nowhere. [...] "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, {{some of whom}} I had thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," [...] she wrote. [...] "Suddenly <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my triumphs had not destroyed the racial barriers once and for all, as I had—perhaps naively—hoped. Or if I did destroy them, they had been erected behind me again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E
60|$|But we {{were quite}} a party: the second bus-driver and his mate, a bearded {{traveller}} {{on the second}} bus, with his daughter, ourselves, the bright-faced citizen from Nuoro, and our driver. Our little dark-eyed conductor did not come. <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> later he {{could not afford to}} pay for this meal, which was not included in his wage.|$|R
5000|$|It wasn't until I was settled, {{facing a}} nice little family group--mother, daddy, baby--that <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> how funny that episode had been. My zipless fuck! My {{stranger}} on a train! Here I'd been offered my very own fantasy. The fantasy that had riveted me to the vibrating seat of the train for three years in Heidelberg and instead of turning <b>me</b> <b>on,</b> it had revolted me! Erica Jong ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I once {{followed}} {{a trail of}} sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my cart down the aisle {{on one side of}} a tall counter and back the aisle on the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he was making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail became thicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> I was the shopper I was trying to catch." ...|$|R
6000|$|She paused, before {{following}} him, {{to watch}} {{the progress of the}} other passenger. [...] "Poor old man!" [...] she said. [...] "How weak and ill he looks! It was a shame to let him be turned away like that. I'm very sorry--" [...] At this moment <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> these words were not addressed to me, but that she was unconsciously thinking aloud. I moved away a few steps, and waited to follow her into the carriage, where I resumed the conversation.|$|E
6000|$|With my last {{flickering}} ray {{of consciousness}} I turned mechanically toward the distance meter. It stood at exactly five {{hundred miles from}} the earth's surface--and then {{of a sudden the}} huge thing that bore us came to a stop. The rattle of hurtling rock through the hollow jacket ceased. The wild racing of the giant drill betokened that it was running loose in AIR--and then another truth flashed upon me. The point of the prospector was ABOVE us. Slowly <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> since passing through the ice strata it had been above. We had turned in the ice and sped upward toward the earth's crust. Thank God! We were safe! ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the fire}} was at Gaspard's Trail and I sat still a minute, irresolute. I {{had no doubt that}} the recent {{purchaser}} was merely acting for Lane, and I felt tempted to resume my journey; but curiosity, or the instinct which calls out each prairie settler when his neighbor's possessions are in jeopardy, was too strong for me, and I rode towards the blaze, but much more slowly. It was one thing to risk a broken limb when danger appeared to threaten Bonaventure, but quite another to do so for the sake of an unscrupulous adversary. It would have been well for me had I obeyed the first impulse which prompted me--and turned my back upon the fire.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, {{after hitting}} Cleveland's Brett Butler with a pitch, Mahler told reporters, [...] "The thing is, the signal {{here for the}} fastball is the signal for the curve in Texas and Oklahoma. When I got the sign, my mind said 'curve.' I took my grip, went into the stretch, kicked up the leg and, {{right in the middle}} of my motion, <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> 'fastball.' I wound up trying to change my grip mid-motion." ...|$|R
5000|$|At ignition, Brixner remembers [...] "The whole filter {{seemed to}} light up as bright as the sun. I was {{temporarily}} blinded. I looked to the side. The Oscura mountains were as bright as day. I saw this tremendous ball of fire, and it was rising. I was just spellbound! I followed it as it rose. Then <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> I'm the photographer! I've gotta get that ball of fire." [...] He jogged the camera up. He said: [...] "There was no sound! It all took place in absolute silence." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{topic for}} Bury the Chains stemmed from Adam Hochschild's initial idea {{to write a}} {{biography}} on John Newton, a slave trader turned abolitionist. In an interview with Mother Jones, Hochschild explained that: [...] "Gradually, <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> after {{three or four months}} of going up the wrong path that the story was the movement and not Newton." [...] Hochschild also noted that abolitionist campaigner Thomas Clarkson, the central figure in Bury the Chains, had often been overlooked in favor of William Wilberforce. According to Hochschild, the firebrand Clarkson was [...] "by far the more interesting figure" [...] who [...] "really got shortchanged by history." ...|$|R
60|$|And while I don't {{remember}} anything my uncle said or {{did at the}} wedding, I do remember very distinctly certain little things, scrutiny, solicitude, a curious rare flash of intimacy in my aunt's eyes. <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't hiding anything from her at all. She was dressed very smartly, wearing a big-plumed hat that made her neck seem longer and slenderer than ever, and when she walked up the aisle with that rolling stride of hers and her eye all on Marion, perplexed into self-forgetfulness, it wasn't somehow funny. She was, I do believe, giving my marriage more thought than I had done, she was concerned beyond measure at my black rage and Marion's blindness, she was looking with eyes that knew what loving is--for love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why this tone of suspicion?" [...] remonstrated Heyst. [...] "I {{suppose the}} sight of this {{particular}} distress was disagreeable to me. What you call fun came afterwards, when <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was for him a walking, breathing, incarnate proof of the efficacy of prayer. I was a little fascinated by it--and then, could I have argued with him? You don't argue against such evidence, and besides it would have looked as if I had wanted to claim all the merit. Already his gratitude was simply frightful. Funny position, wasn't it? The boredom came later, when we lived together on board his ship. I had, {{in a moment of}} inadvertence, created for myself a tie. How to define it precisely I don't know. One gets attached in a way to people one has done something for. But is that friendship? I am not sure what it was. I only know that he who forms a tie is lost. The germ of corruption has entered into his soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{is not an}} American at all. He {{was born}} and bred in my own country, and took me by {{surprise}} by calculating that I {{was one of the}} Audleys of Wrightstone Court, and wanting to know whether my father were Sir Robert or Sir Robert's son. Then he guessed that I might have heard of his father, if I was not too young, and by-and-by <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> whenever there is any complication about business matters, or any one is in bad circumstances, my father always vituperates one Travis, who, it seems, was a solicitor greatly trusted by all the country round, till he died, some twenty years ago, and it appeared that he had ruined everybody, himself included. These men are his sons. They went out to America, and got up in the world. They told me the whole story of how they had knocked about everywhere, last evening, but I was too sleepy to enter into it much, though I daresay it was curious enough; successful speculations and hair's-breadth escapes seemed to come very thick one upon another, but all I am clear about is that this poor boy, Fernando's mother was a Mexican heiress, they--one of them, I mean--managed to marry, her father English, but her mother old Spanish blood allied to the old Caciques, he says; whether it is a boast I don't know, but the boy looks like it--such a handsome fellow; delicate straight profile, slender limbs, beautifully made, inky-black hair and brows, pure olive skin--the two doctors were both in raptures. Well, they thought affairs in Mexico insecure, so they sold the poor woman's estate and carried her off to Texas. No; was it? I really can't remember where; but, at any rate, Diego stuck to her wherever she went, and when she died, to her child; nursed him like an old woman, and-- In short, it was that touching negro love that one sometimes hears of. Now they seem to have grown very rich--the American Vice-Consul, who came over this morning from Dearport, knew all about them--and they came home partly on business, and partly to leave Fernando to be made into an English gentleman, who, Mr. Travis says, if he has money to spend, does whip creation. He's English enough for that still. Well, they have got a telegram that makes them both want to sail by the next steamer.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Seeing {{that in all}} {{probability}} you were watching the wives and daughters {{of most of the}} kings of India, the chances are that you won't,' I said, for <b>it</b> was <b>dawning</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that Mulvaney had stumbled upon a big Queens' Praying at Benares.|$|R
5000|$|At times... {{missed my}} normal childhood, but then, <b>it</b> <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> {{that even if}} I lose my childhood, it's okay. Playing with friends is not more {{important}} than saving a life. —Palak Muchhal (in 2007) [...] Muchhal {{became a member of}} Kalyanji-Anandji Little Star, a group of young singers, when she was four years old. During the Kargil War of 1999, when aged seven, she spent a week singing at shops in her home city, Indore, to raise funds for the families of deceased Indian soldiers. Her efforts received substantial coverage in Indian media and she raised 25,000 (US$810). Later that year, she sang to raise funds for victims of the 1999 Odisha cyclone.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea behind}} Dimmi {{was created by}} Stevan Premutico on a coffee shop napkin in 2007. [...] "I {{was sitting in a}} coffee shop in Chelsea, {{thinking}} about how the internet and online was transforming the hotel business, when <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the same impact could change the restaurant business," [...] says Premutico.|$|E
5000|$|Being a first {{generation}} Taiwanese-American, she is fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and used her language skills to host {{an episode of}} the YouTube travel show Resident in Shanghai, although Tina Huang hesitated {{to return to her}} [...] "motherland" [...] after being born and raised in America: <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in Shanghai, I was a foreigner.

5000|$|After his {{military}} service, {{he moved to}} Brooklyn and began working at a small electronics retailer. He became familiar with profit margins for electronics, then worked as a sales representative in web sales. He has stated “I used {{to spend a lot}} of time checking out big shopping sites like Amazon.com. <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> if you featured just one or two items at a time, you could get great volume pricing.” ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> when I {{was being}} fitted for my {{traveling}} uniform that I {{was about to}} represent my country. When that hit home {{it was a very}} proud moment in my life. Even though it was not a real representative tour it felt like it to me ... It wasn't until we all gathered at the airport that I got the real rush of excitement because there I was, this sixteen year-old kid about to take off and play cricket in a strange country, and from what we had been told it would be in conditions like we had never experienced before. We were all excited with the prospect of taking on the South Africans and we had been told about the wickets being bouncy and fast, similar to the WACA strip in Perth.|$|R

5000|$|After the Ministry of the Environment {{rejected}} the plan, {{she found that}} the Tunisian banks would not loan her any startup capital because she was female. She later explained, [...] "Every time I got a no, it was a motivation for me. <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I would fight for women's equal rights in society and that Acacias for All {{should be the first}} step".

I'm going to focus more on {{production}} and DJing and zero per cent of my time will go on singing. I'll do tracks with people who can sing well - proper artists, proper performers. I can focus on what I'm much better at, which is making music. I'm just not cut out for that role. I kind of fell into it a few years ago - the live show had to happen, I had to be the frontman because I was doing the vocals on the songs. It went all right.

5000|$|The B-side, [...] "Hyakunen'ai", {{was written}} by essayist Mayumi Satō and Sasaki.

Part of the lyrics are a dedication to a post-disaster Tōhoku. Misia has taught me through her voice that, whether {{on the brink of}} giving up or in despair over the unchanging reality of these difficult times, believing in our future and in our love for each other as people is one of the answers we need. Let there be nature, song and love a hundred years from now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Killing Moon #3 is Swanson’s self-portrait, {{where he}} depicts {{himself as a}} Yeti in his lair in the boiler room of P.S. 1. “The idea was that I would be the Yeti and {{basically}} collect garbage for four-to-six weeks every night to make the installation. I had to reconcile the fact that I’m an educated artist who knows about formal issues and academia, {{and figure out what}} the Yeti would make instead—these more ritualistic objects. But the Yeti also collects things in the world and then puts them together to sort of make sense of the world around him. <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I pretty much do the same thing: so I’m the yeti and the yeti is me.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Initially, it was {{intended}} that Hayley would only appear for two months, {{it was thought that}} this would help increase ratings as well as show a new side to Roy Cropper (David Neilson).

Hesmondhalgh only knew she was auditioning to play a [...] "fun" [...] character, so arrived [...] "all Bet Lynch, in my leopard skin and red lippy". When she learned Hayley would be transgender, she was nervous, but [...] "then <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this was actually my ’dream job’ and I desperately wanted it."
