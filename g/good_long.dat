In fundoplication, the gastric fundus (upper part) {{of the stomach}} is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of gastric acid. The procedure is now commonly performed laparoscopically.

[...] Joyce Millman of Salon.com stated that she disliked Seinfelds pilot episode, but after seeing a scene from [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was [...] "awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane." ...|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} amongst many reviewers {{was that}} in spite of its title, no connection is made between Fermat's Last Theorem and the alien invasion. Alex Kasman at Mathematical Fiction complained about errors in some of the author's descriptions of the mathematical problems, and in particular their unfair treatment of Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Some reviewers felt that the characters had not been developed sufficiently. Michael Sims of The Washington Post said that [...] "these characters are so thin you can see through them." [...] The aliens are depicted as cartoon-like figures, and Ranjit {{does not appear to be}} affected by his lengthy incarceration, interrogation and torture. Some critics also felt that the book ended [...] "somewhat precipitously", that after the aliens arrived, the crisis was resolved too quickly, giving the impression [...] "that there was at least a <b>good,</b> <b>long</b> chapter missing." ...|$|E

500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier {{here with my}} work than I could be outside. By staying here a <b>good</b> <b>long</b> time, I shall have learned regular habits {{and in the long}} run the result will be more order in my life." [...] While his time at Saint-Rémy forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} to the season. During its 1991 Program awards, Entertainment Weekly, ranked Seinfeld {{second place in}} the [...] "Program of the year" [...] category, behind Roseanne. Joseph P. Kahn, a critic for the Wilmington Morning Star, praised the writing and acting of the season premiere and stated, [...] "One safe prediction, Seinfeld will be here for a <b>good</b> <b>long</b> run this time around." [...] Writing for The Spokesman-Review, critic Jon Burlingame stated that [...] "Seinfeld is an offbeat take on the standard sitcom concept. While rarely hilarious, it's often smart and amusing." [...] Dave Kehr of The New York Times felt that [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was a turning point for the show, noting that after the first few episodes, the show [...] "turn into something sharp and distinctive [...] Here, suddenly, is the tight knot of guilt and denial, of hypersensitivity and sarcastic contempt that Seinfeld would explore for the next eight years." [...] Despite the critical acclaim for the season and several of its episodes, two of the season's episodes, [...] "The Busboy" [...] and [...] "The Baby Shower", were named to a list of Seinfelds [...] "Not-so-top episodes", compiled by the New York Daily News.|$|E
500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a <b>good</b> <b>long</b> time, {{we had no idea}} what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up."

2500|$|These two effects {{tend to be}} at {{odds with}} each other, and {{it is not easy to}} combine both good short range and <b>good</b> <b>long</b> range in a single radar. This is because the short pulses needed for a good minimum range {{broadcast}} have less total energy, making the returns much smaller and the target harder to detect. This could be offset by using more pulses, but this would shorten the maximum range. So each radar uses a particular type of signal. Long-range radars tend to use long pulses with long delays between them, and short range radars use smaller pulses with less time between them. As electronics have improved many radars now can change their pulse repetition frequency, thereby changing their range. The newest radars fire two pulses during one cell, one for short range (about [...] ) and a separate signal for longer ranges (about [...] ).|$|E

He underwent physeptone treatment in a British program, returned to New York and was hospitalized there, and then finally committed himself to the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders. Meanwhile, Apple released his debut album, James Taylor, in December 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the US.

2500|$|The {{skull of}} Postosuchus was {{constructed}} narrow {{in front and}} extended wide and deep behind. It was 55cm in length and 21cm broad and deep. There are many fenestrae (openings) present in the bones that lighten the skull, providing space for the muscles. Like more derived archosaurs, the lower jaw had mandibular fenestrae (openings at the lower jaw), formed by the junction of the dentary with other jaw bones (surangular and angular). Postosuchus had very <b>good</b> <b>long</b> distant sight, due to large orbits, supporting large and sharp eyes, and strong olfaction provided by elongated nostrils. Inside the skull, under the nostrils, there was a hollow that may have contained the Jacobson's organ, an olfactory sensory organ sometimes referred as the [...] "sixth sense". The jaws held large and sharp serrated teeth, of which some were developed even larger to operate as hooked sabers. A complete tooth found among Postosuchus remains in North Carolina measured about 7.2cm in height. Postosuchus possessed heterodonty dentition, which means each tooth was different in size and shape from the others. The upper jaw contained seventeen teeth, with each premaxilla bearing only four teeth and each maxilla thirteen teeth. In the lower jaw were over thirty teeth. Replacement activity in Postosuchus was {{different from that of}} crocodiles, since the replacement tooth didn't fit directly in the pulp cavity of the old tooth, but grew until resorption of the old tooth was complete.|$|E
2500|$|In Soulcalibur II, Taki {{was given}} more distance-closing moves to help {{compensate}} for her limited range. Nevertheless, the Soulcalibur II guide by GamePro verdicted Taki is an [...] "excellent short range fighter {{with plenty of}} height variation in attack," [...] yet still [...] "weak against <b>good</b> <b>long</b> range opponents" [...] and with [...] "poor offensive capabilities outside short range." [...] The game's review by Marlon Ramos of Philippine Daily Inquirer [...] "of course" [...] highly recommended Taki for the players who are [...] "after speed". In GameSpot's guide to Soulcalibur II, Stephen Kleckner wrote that Taki has [...] "a lot of options and variety which allow her to really mix up her attack heights" [...] and very quick moves making her highly capable at close range, but might [...] "essentially become a moving target" [...] if her player [...] "can't rush down someone who is really good at sustaining a range game, such as Kilik." [...] Andrew Alfonso wrote in GameSpy's guide that [...] "what makes Taki so fearsome is her speed. She's still the fastest character in the game, and despite this her damage potential is still very good at times. However, unlike the big power hitters like Cervantes and Astaroth, she needs to work for her wins." [...] Alfonso added that Taki can be [...] "somewhat hard to learn and execute with" [...] and the key strategy [...] "is to maintain her flow of attack." [...] Taki and Talim, who are both the most acrobatic and fastest characters in Soulcalibur II, were noted to be particularly dangerous in the original version of the HD Online edition due to the Internet multiplayer lag problems.|$|E
