500|$|Jim Abott of Orlando Sentinel {{classified}} [...] "the sweetly melodic old-school" [...] song among Jackson's [...] "occasional {{bursts of}} inspiration," [...] declaring it [...] "a beautifully big arrangement that's Motown-esque." [...] Additionally, its [...] "depth and sweetness" [...] was considered unexpected by Dan LeRoy from The Scene, commenting [...] "West's swaying '50s pastiche [...] "I Want You" [...] is delightful". Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times exclaimed the track [...] "has a swooning charm, with a chimes-studded texture that suggests the sweeping light-points of a disco ball." [...] Mikael Wood of Baltimore City Paper gave a similar critique, saying the [...] "luscious slow jam" [...] ultimately [...] "shimmers with the sweet lovesickness Karen Carpenter {{had to fight}} through a scrim of suburban sang-froid to express." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared the song [...] "on the slower side", containing [...] "a verse that's memorable." [...] Plugged In observed subtle sexuality within its lyrics, commenting that Jackson is insatiable. The song's production from West also received acclaim. Music critic Kevin Nottingham ranked it as West's second best production, classifying it as a [...] "gorgeous piece of work." [...] He exclaimed. [...] "The drums hit {{at the beginning and}} the listener should already fall in love. Janet's voice should intrigue you, but frankly, those strings and those drums <b>grab</b> <b>my</b> attention all the time." [...] Nottingham added that West's beat takes the listener on a joyful ride, while the beat evokes happiness.|$|E

6000|$|However often one meets it, as in {{this war}} one meets it at every turn, one never gets used to the Holy Spirit of Man at his job. The [...] "common sweeper," [...] {{growling}} over his mug of tea that there was [...] "nothing in sweepin'," [...] and these idly chaffing men, new shaved and attired, from the gates of Death which had let them through for the fiftieth time, were all of the same fabric--incomprehensible, I should imagine, to the enemy. And the stuff held good throughout all the world--from the Dardanelles to the Baltic, where only {{a little while ago}} another batch of submarines had slipped in and begun to be busy. I had spent some of the afternoon in looking through reports of submarine work in the Sea of Marmora. They read like the diary of energetic weasels in an overcrowded chicken-run, and the results for each boat were tabulated something like a cricket score. There were no maiden overs. One came across jewels of price set in the flat official phraseology. For example, one man who was describing some steps he was taking to remedy certain defects, interjected casually: [...] "At this point I had to go under for a little, as a man in a boat was trying to <b>grab</b> <b>my</b> periscope with his hand." [...] No reference before or after to the said man or his fate. Again: [...] "Came across a dhow with a Turkish skipper. He seemed so miserable that I let him go." [...] And elsewhere in those waters, a submarine overhauled a steamer full of Turkish passengers, some of whom, arguing on their allies' lines, promptly leaped overboard. Our boat fished them out and returned them, for she was not killing civilians. In another affair, which included several ships (now at the bottom) and one submarine, the commander relaxes enough to note that: [...] "The men behaved very well under direct and flanking fire from rifles at about fifteen yards." [...] This was not, I believe, the submarine that fought the Turkish cavalry on the beach. And in addition to matters much more marvellous than any I have hinted at, the reports deal with repairs and shifts and contrivances carried through in the face of dangers that read like the last delirium of romance. One boat went down the Straits and found herself rather canted over to one side. A mine and chain had jammed under her forward diving-plane. So far as I made out, she shook it off by standing on her head and jerking backwards; or it may have been, for the thing has occurred more than once, she merely rose as much as she could, when she could, and then [...] "released it by hand," [...] as the official phrase goes.|$|E
