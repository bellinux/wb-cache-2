5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} <b>full</b> <b>command</b> as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly {{out of sight of the}} land.|$|E

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning <b>full</b> <b>command</b> of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|In early March, Union Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, then {{commander}} of the Department of the Missouri, ordered Grant to remain at Fort Henry, and on March 4 turned field command of the expedition over to a subordinate, Brig. Gen. C. F. Smith, who had recently been nominated as a major general. (Various writers assert that Halleck took this step because of professional and personal animosity toward Grant; however, Halleck shortly restored Grant to <b>full</b> <b>command,</b> perhaps influenced by an inquiry from President Abraham Lincoln.) Smith's orders were to lead raids intended to capture or damage the railroads in southwestern Tennessee. Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's troops arrived from Paducah, Kentucky, to conduct a similar mission to break the railroads near Eastport, Mississippi. Halleck also ordered Grant to advance his Army of West Tennessee (soon to be known by its more famous name, the Army of the Tennessee) on an invasion up the Tennessee River. Grant left Fort Henry and headed upriver (south), arriving at Savannah, Tennessee, on March 14, and established his headquarters on the east bank of the river. Grant's troops set up camp farther upriver: five divisions at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, and a sixth at Crump's Landing, four miles from Grant's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 1944 Specht {{was awarded}} the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his 30 {{victories}} on the Western Front. On 15 April after his commander, Hermann Graf was injured, he gave up his command of II./JG 11, {{and moved to the}} Geschwaderstab (Wing Command flight) as Kommodore-in-training, under Herbert Ihlefeld. Promoted to major on 1 May, he was given <b>full</b> <b>command</b> of JG 11 on 15 May, replacing Ihlefeld who was himself transferred to command JG 1. But little could be done as the Allied bombing offensive stepped up a gear. His units were decimated over the skies of Normandy in June and July. He himself was injured in July, suffering head injuries in yet another crash-landing. Despite severe pain from his injuries, Specht remained on combat duty. His wing was retired to the Rhineland to be rebuilt, but they were crushed again {{in the latter half of}} 1944. The Allies were now sending overwhelming numbers of bombers to destroy the German industrial and military factories and now protected by the advent of the P-51 Mustang, providing fighter cover right into the heart of the Reich and back.|$|E

25|$|A very {{different}} interpretation of events suggests that Stilwell, pressing for his <b>full</b> <b>command</b> of all Chinese forces, had made diplomatic inroads with the Chinese Communist Red Army commanded by Mao Zedong. He bypassed his theater commander Chiang Kai-shek and had gotten Mao {{to agree to}} follow an American commander. His confrontational approach in the power struggle with Chiang ultimately led to Chiang's determination to have Stilwell recalled to the United States.|$|E

25|$|After {{hearing of}} the retreat, Grant, {{who was in charge}} of VIII Corps., put Maj. Gen. E. O. C. Ord in command of Wallace’s troops.

25|$|Hawk is the {{original}} field commander of the G.I. Joe Team. His primary military specialty is strategic command operations and his secondary military specialties are ranger, artillery, intelligence and radar. His original rank was that of colonel. He was later promoted to brigadier general and then major general. As a colonel, Hawk served under General Lawrence Flagg, and was responsible for recruiting most of the team's early members. After General Flagg was killed in action and his successor, General Austin, retired from active duty, Hawk assumed <b>full</b> <b>command</b> of the G.I. Joe team.|$|E
25|$|Those two matches will {{probably}} be remembered as Illingworth's finest moments as captain {{because they were the}} most famous.

Alan Knott pulled off a miraculous stumping off Norman Gifford (Asif the batsman) and again Illingworth's bowling changes just as they had two years earlier resulted in wickets – including the key wicket of Sadiq – c by Basil D'Oliveira.|$|E
25|$|We {{were met}} by Reverend A.E. Sylvestor , an Australian Methodist Missionary. He {{had been on the}} island for some months. He was a well-organized Coastwatcher and with his native crew of Melanesians, he gave reports of Japanese {{movements}} of ships and aircraft in the area. He was familiar with the entire island. His scouts reported all Japanese movements on the island; he was in <b>full</b> <b>command.</b> He reported all his information to the American forces with what means he had. He and the other Coastwatchers throughout these islands were a tremendous asset to the allies in winning the war in the Pacific. They were alone against tremendous odds, they often suffered from lack of food, had little or no means of communication, and always faced capture by the enemy in the Pacific.|$|E

25|$|In 1887, Arimondi was {{assigned}} {{as a staff}} officer to the expeditionary corps of General Alessandro Asinari di San Marzano and left for Eritrea, where he stayed until 1890. In 1892, {{he was promoted to}} colonel and sent again in Eritrea with <b>full</b> <b>command</b> of all native troops in the colony. In this position, he won a series of minor clashes and defeated the Dervishes under Emir Ahmed Alì at the Second Battle of Agordat in December 1893. In this battle, he remarkably decided to deploy his men in an extended battle line, with reserves echeloned at the rear. This caught by surprise the Mahdists, who were expecting close square formations as the ones adopted by British infantry in previous engagements. For this victory he received a promotion to major general.|$|E
25|$|Jatin {{was acquitted}} in February 1911 and released. Immediately, he {{suspended}} armed revolution. This lull proved Jatin's <b>full</b> <b>command</b> of violence as an antidote, {{contrary to the}} Chauri Chaura fiasco after him. During the German Crown Prince's visit to Calcutta, Jatin met him and received a promise about arms supply. Having lost his government job– and home interned -, he managed to leave Calcutta, to start a contract business constructing the Jessore–Jhenaidah railway line. This provided him with a valid pretext and an ample scope to move about on horse-back or on bicycle to consolidate not only the district units in Bengal, but also to revitalise those in other provinces. Jatin with his family {{set out on a}} pilgrimage, and at Haridwar visited his Guru, Bholananda Giri. Jatin went on to Brindavan where he met Swami Niralamba (who had been Jatindra Nath Banerjee, the renowned revolutionary, before leading a sanyasi's life); he had continued preaching in North India Sri Aurobindo's doctrine of a revolution.|$|E
25|$|There he {{was allowed}} to draw and paint imprisoned Russian officers, and his commander, Karl Moser (who assumed that Schiele was a painter and {{decorator}} when he first met him), even gave him a disused store room to use as a studio. Since Schiele {{was in charge of the}} food stores in the camp, he and Edith could enjoy food beyond rations. By 1917, he was back in Vienna, able to focus on his artistic career. His output was prolific, and his work reflected the maturity of an artist in <b>full</b> <b>command</b> of his talents. He was invited to participate in the Secession's 49th exhibition, held in Vienna in 1918. Schiele had fifty works accepted for this exhibition, and they were displayed in the main hall. He also designed a poster for the exhibition, which was reminiscent of the Last Supper, with a portrait of himself in the place of Christ. The show was a triumphant success, and as a result, prices for Schiele's drawings increased and he received many portrait commissions.|$|E
