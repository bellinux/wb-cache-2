5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} {{laying out}} the Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the Convention. As Pinckney did not write it down, the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. The <b>House</b> <b>would</b> have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The <b>House</b> <b>would</b> elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as these keeps were being built by the {{extremely}} wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower <b>house</b> <b>would</b> typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps but rather as a form of fortified house.|$|E
50|$|Prime Minister Richard Seddon {{introduced}} the Workers' Dwellings Act in 1905 to provide well-built suburban houses for workers who earned less than £156 per annum. He argued that these <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> prevent {{the decline of}} living standards in New Zealand and increase the money available to workers without increasing the costs to employers. By breaking private landlords' control over rental housing, housing costs for everyone would decline. The bill passed by 64 votes to 2, despite criticism over {{the cost of the}} scheme, the distance the <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> be from workplaces, particularly ports, and the lack of provision for Māori. Seddon estimated that 5,000 <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> be built under the scheme.|$|R

5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger <b>House,</b> <b>would</b> be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|However, the King did {{not want}} the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared to Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main <b>house</b> <b>would</b> go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} by the family that a new and far grander <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be built, using the money that the Wrights had earned through their inventions and business. Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, {{building}} had begun in the Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon {{the design of the}} house was that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live to see its completion in 1914.|$|E
50|$|It {{was planned}} that {{a total of}} 145 <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> be built on the 3 hectare site. In total there <b>would</b> be 11 <b>house</b> styles, from 2 bedroom maisonettes to five bedroom family <b>houses.</b> It <b>would</b> be a mix of {{affordable}} housing and larger private dwellings.|$|R

5|$|Sam died on 25 February 1998. While gravely {{ill with}} cancer in 1998, Joan {{unveiled}} a memorial plaque in Barony Hall, Glasgow, to commemorate her husband, {{and it was}} announced that the walled garden at Ross Priory, on Loch Lomondside, was to be named in her honour, and the Joan Curran Summer <b>House</b> <b>would</b> be built there. Joan died on 10 February 1999, and was cremated at the Daldowie Crematorium. Her daughter, Sheena, three sons and three grandsons survived her.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} company against a takeover, commissioning a report from McKinsey & Company on the future outlook of the company. This course of action would ultimately prove futile and Trafalgar <b>House</b> <b>would</b> launch a successful bid for the company, beginning on 30 June 1971. Smallpeice accepted an increased bid from Trafalgar House {{at the end of}} July, and would go on to preside over the last board meeting of Cunard as an independent company on 25 August 1971, 93 years after its incorporation.|$|E
5|$|The Goražde {{printing}} house {{was one of}} the earliest among the Serbs and the first in the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was founded by Božidar Ljubavić near the town of Goražde in 1519, in the early period of Ottoman rule over the region. It produced three Orthodox religious books, including the Goražde Psalter, with its last book printed in 1523. The next printing <b>house</b> <b>would</b> not be opened in Bosnia and Herzegovina until {{the second half of the}} 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower <b>house</b> <b>would</b> be apportioned. A {{minority}} {{wanted it to be}} apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously considered. Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} the <b>house</b> <b>would</b> have been far more impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the House of Representatives {{required}} that the final two days of the chamber's session be reserved for overriding any vetoes by the governor. Beshear hoped that the <b>House</b> <b>would</b> suspend the rules, as they had in previous years, in order to consider bills to increase funding to public defenders, create a transportation authority to oversee bridge-building projects in Louisville and Henderson, and provide various economic incentives, including a package intended to lure a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race to Kentucky Speedway. The House refused to suspend the rules, however, citing its desire to receive legislation {{in a timely manner}} in the future. The chamber allowed Beshear's one veto to stand and adjourned a day early.|$|E

5|$|Weisman {{explains}} that a common <b>house</b> <b>would</b> begin {{to fall apart}} as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith <b>House</b> <b>would</b> be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the <b>House</b> <b>would</b> preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March, Prime Minister John Key {{said that}} around 10,000 <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> {{need to be}} demolished, and {{liquefaction}} damage meant that some parts of Christchurch could not be rebuilt on.|$|R

50|$|One goal {{of phase}} {{one of the}} {{programme}} was of course to continue helping first-time buyers onto the property ladder by facilitating the purchase of new-build. By doing so, and by also helping existing home-owners to buy new-build, demand for new-build would increase. George Osborne claimed that, by increasing demand for new-build, the supply side of the <b>housing</b> market <b>would</b> be stimulated, i.e. more <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> be built to meet the increased demand for new-build.|$|R
5|$|Laurie was {{supposed}} to wear a monocle as Lt. George, the character's second incarnation, but eventually decided against it after it kept falling out of his eye. Laurie reprised the role of Prince George in the Christmas special Blackadder's Christmas Carol, and portrayed a new character, Lord Pigmot, set in the distant future. He also appeared in the millennium special , playing the Roman Consul Georgius and the modern day Major George Bufton-Tufton, The Viscount Bufton-Tufton. Although no new series or specials were made, the creators of the series have commented on various proposals over the years; one possibility was a film in which the main characters return as a 1960s' rock band, with George playing the guitar and keyboard. Curtis later said Laurie's international success with <b>House</b> <b>would</b> make a new instalment difficult.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the <b>House</b> <b>would</b> have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the <b>house</b> <b>would</b> elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E
50|$|In the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture burdei {{houses were}} {{characterized}} by elliptical shapes. These <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> typically have a wooden floor that was about 1.5 meters (5 feet) below ground, which would place the roof at just above ground level.|$|R
