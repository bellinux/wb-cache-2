5|$|Aalborg is North Jutland's major {{industrial}} and commercial centre, exporting grain, cement, and spirits. Heavy industry {{was behind the}} city's prosperity until fairly recently. Many of the factories have now closed, {{to be replaced by}} developments in the <b>knowledge-based</b> and green-energy sectors. Mobile and wireless communications industries have grown substantially since the 1990s, as has rotor production for wind turbines.|$|E

5|$|The college {{also offers}} {{numerous}} transfer programs. The Center for Community, Workforce and Economic Development offers partnerships with local businesses and industries for on-demand performance- and quality-based training. The college {{is also home}} to the Ashland Area Innovation Center, a business accelerator that aids in the development of <b>knowledge-based</b> industries in eastern Kentucky, and the Entrepreneur Center, a small business incubator that provides assistance for about two to three years to individuals or groups of individuals who have a desire to start a business. ACTC also offers a Ready to Work, and a similar Work to Learn program that assists low-income students and parents in northeastern Kentucky. The former provides paid work experience on and off campus, counseling and advising, job references and referrals, job readiness and life skills, while the latter provides basic adult education for those attempting to receive a GED.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} settlements date {{to around}} AD700. Aalborg's {{position at the}} narrowest point on the Limfjord made it an important harbour during the Middle Ages, and later a large industrial centre. Architecturally, the city {{is known for its}} half-timbered mansions built by its prosperous merchants. Budolfi Church, now a cathedral, dates {{from the end of the}} 14th century and Aalborghus Castle, a royal residence, was built in 1550. Today, Aalborg is a city in transition from a working-class industrial area to a <b>knowledge-based</b> community. A major exporter of grain, cement, and spirits, its thriving business interests include Siemens Wind Power, Aalborg Industries, and Aalborg Portland. These companies have become global producers of wind turbine rotors, marine boilers and cement.|$|E

25|$|Although the resource-based view of {{the firm}} recognizes the {{important}} role of knowledge in firms that achieve a competitive advantage, proponents of the <b>knowledge-based</b> view argue that the resource-based perspective does not go far enough. Specifically, the RBV treats knowledge as a generic resource, rather than having special characteristics. It therefore does not distinguish between different types of <b>knowledge-based</b> capabilities. Information technologies can {{play an important role in}} the <b>knowledge-based</b> {{view of the}} firm in that information systems can be used to synthesize, enhance, and expedite large-scale intra- and inter-firm knowledge management (Alavi and Leidner 2001).|$|E

25|$|Much of the US$3.7 {{trillion}} earmarked in Vision 2025 {{is to go}} towards supporting {{investment in}} research and development by <b>knowledge-based</b> firms and the commercialization of research results. A law passed in 2010 provides an appropriate mechanism, the Innovation and Prosperity Fund. According to the fund’s president, Behzad Soltani, 4600 billion Iranian rials (circa US$171.4 million) had been allocated to 100 <b>knowledge-based</b> companies by late 2014.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of <b>knowledge-based</b> systems the knowledge-bases were fairly small. The knowledge-bases that were meant to {{actually}} solve real problems rather than do proof of concept demonstrations needed to focus on well defined problems. So for example, not just medical diagnosis as a whole topic but medical diagnosis of certain kinds of diseases.|$|E

25|$|New Orleans became {{increasingly}} dependent on tourism {{as an economic}} mainstay during the administrations of Sidney Barthelemy (1986–1994) and Marc Morial (1994–2002). Relatively low levels of educational attainment, high rates of household poverty, and rising crime threatened the prosperity in the later decades of the century. The negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions contrasted with the changes to {{the economy of the}} United States, which reflected a post-industrial, <b>knowledge-based</b> paradigm in which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills.|$|E
25|$|Latvia and Israel {{established}} {{diplomatic relations}} 6 January 1992.

Rinkevics also met with Israeli President Shimon Peres on behalf of President Berzins to visit Latvia. Rinkevics and Peres agreed on the key significance of education and <b>knowledge-based</b> economies {{for the development of}} small countries further paving opportunities for our future cooperation between the two nations.|$|E
25|$|Even {{prior to}} the {{implementation}} of NAFTA, Tijuana was home to many businesses selling products and services at a lower rate than in the United States. Today businesses such as auto detailing, medical services, dentistry and plastic surgery are heavily marketed and located near Tijuana's border with San Diego. In addition, there are high-tech firms and telemarketing companies, including Medtronic Inc., in the city. This influx of companies is drawing skilled people from the United States with technical trades and college degrees to Tijuana transforming the city economy into a <b>knowledge-based</b> one.|$|E
25|$|The city is the {{economic}} and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, {{one of the major}} industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in <b>knowledge-based</b> service and manufacturing industries.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{industries}} in San Diego–Tijuana are trade, services, electronics, tourism, life sciences, high-tech and defense sectors. In 2002 San Diego and Tijuana had a gross regional product of $136.3 Billion; and in 2007 this figure increased to $176 Billion. The greater San Diego area has a <b>knowledge-based</b> {{economy that is}} only growing; Tijuana's sub-metropolitan region is reliant on a diversified manufacturing sector. Leading private employers to the metropolitan region are Qualcomm, SAIC, Sempra Energy, Sony, Kyocera, Pfizer Global Research & Development, Callaway Golf, Sharp Healthcare, Scripps Health, Sanyo, Hitachi, Panasonic Corporation, Samsung, Hyundai, Mattel, Honeywell, Pioneer Corporation, Maxell, Douglas Furniture, and International Rectifier.|$|E
25|$|Martin Ford, {{author of}} The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future, and {{others argue that}} {{specialized}} artificial intelligence applications, robotics {{and other forms of}} automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many <b>knowledge-based</b> occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work.|$|E
