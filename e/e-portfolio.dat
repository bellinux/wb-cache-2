40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a study of the}} {{experiences}} of teacher educators in the introduction and development of <b>e-portfolios</b> over an eight-year period from 2002 to 2009 at a Swedish university. The study was conducted with 67 teacher educators in order to investigate how <b>e-portfolios</b> have been discussed, designed, used and disseminated during this period. Research methods involved 25 narrative interviews and a questionnaire that was completed by 42 participants. The theoretical framework of Basil Bernstein, particularly his concepts of classification, framing, educational codes and pedagogical devices, was used to analyse the data. The paper presents a discussion of the contextual circumstances in relation to classification, framing and codes that affect the social construction of <b>e-portfolios.</b> The results point to parallel processes resulting in a variety of discourses and designs of <b>e-portfolios</b> and highlighting the importance of the social construction of <b>e-portfolios</b> across the teacher education faculty, rather than merely their implementatio...|$|R

50|$|In education, the {{electronic}} portfolio {{is a collection}} of a students' work that can advance learning by providing a way for them to organize, archive, and display work. The electronic format allows an instructor to evaluate student portfolios via the Internet, CD-ROM, DVD, or zip disk. Electronic portfolios have become a popular alternative to paper-based portfolios because they provide the opportunity to review, communicate and give feedback in an asynchronous manner. In addition, students are able to reflect on their work, which makes the experience of creating the <b>e-portfolio</b> meaningful. A student <b>e-portfolio</b> may be shared with a prospective employer or used to record the achievement of program or course specific learning outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Narrative {{approaches}} to documentation and assessment {{in early childhood}} education (ECE) encourages children to be active contributors in their own learning journey. With the growing emphasis of technology in society it is natural that this shift has transformed assessment practices {{with the introduction of}} <b>e-portfolios.</b> <b>E-portfolios</b> are seen in tertiary, secondary and primary settings nationwide and most recently have been introduced into ECE as a way to extend traditional documentation methods. As a result, documentation and the role children have in their own learning has shifted. Despite their growing popularity in early childhood settings there is very little research into the effect that <b>e-portfolios</b> have on teachers, parents, and most importantly, children and their learning. Given this limited research this study sought to understand the ways in which children are engaging with their learning through <b>e-portfolios.</b> This mixed methodology study used a national online survey as well as case studies to develop an understanding of this topic. Participants included early childhood centre educators, parents and children from settings across New Zealand. Findings revealed a distinct variation in the ways that centres are using <b>e-portfolios</b> to engage children with their learning. A large number of centres are maintaining both hard-copy and online versions of a child's portfolio to ensure that children are not removed from contributing to and revisiting their learning. Whilst results showed examples of children's in-depth engagement with <b>e-portfolios,</b> they also highlighted that many centres are not yet harnessing their full potential. These findings suggest implications for teacher practice, including the need for greater support and training for teachers. As <b>e-portfolios</b> are still a new phenomenon in ECE this study suggests areas of future research to investigate this topic further to improve learning outcomes for children...|$|R
