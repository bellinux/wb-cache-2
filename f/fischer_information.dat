40|$|We {{present a}} closed form {{expression}} for the <b>Fischer’s</b> <b>information</b> matrix {{associated with the}} identification of Wiener models. In the derivation {{we assume that the}} input signal is Gaussian. The analysis allows the linear sub-system in the Wiener model to have a generic rational transfer function of arbitrary order. It also allows the static nonlinearity of the Wiener model to be a polynomial of arbitrary degree. In addition, we show how this analysis can be used to design tractable algorithms for D-optimal input design. The idea is further extended to design optimal inputs consisting of a sequence of Gaussian signals with different mean values and variances. By combining Gaussian inputs with different means we can tune the amplitude distribution of the input to achieve the best identification accuracy in D-optimal sense. The analytical results are also illustrated with some numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|Although {{two-stage}} {{testing is}} not the most efficient form of adaptive testing, it has some advantages. In this paper, linear programming models are given for the construction of two-stage tests. In these models, practical constraints with respect to, among other things, test composition, administration time, and inter-item dependencies play an important role. Research indicates that two-stage tests can be constructed both sequentially and simultaneously. Models based on the maximin model for test construction developed by W. J. van der Linden and E. Boekkooi-Timminga (1989) are formulated for the sequential case, with constraints specified at test and subtest levels. It is assumed that a bank of items calibrated under the item response model is available and that "information" is used in accordance with G. H. <b>Fischer's</b> <b>information</b> model. The maximin design is used in order to select the items that maximize the information in the test, while the resulting test information function still has the desired shape. The paper concludes that simultaneous test construction has the disadvantage of having a large number of variables; hence, constraints must be considered...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for stably {{removing}} noise from measurements of a quantum many-body system. The question is cast to a linear inverse problem by using a quantum <b>Fischer</b> <b>information</b> metric as figure of merit. This requires the ability to compute the adjoint of the noise channel {{with respect to the}} metric, which can be done analytically when the metric is evaluated at a Gaussian (quasi-free) state. This approach can be applied effectively to n-point functions of a quantum field theory. For translation invariant noise, this yields a stable deconvolution method on the first moments of the field which differs from what one would obtain from a purely classical analysis...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} different methods for statistically analyzing {{the variability in}} pressure fluctuations measured at three locations in an 80 -mm-ID, 5 -m-tall CFB model operated with natural rutile particles and air at ambient conditions. The methods evaluated are the Shannon entropy, <b>Fischer</b> <b>information</b> matrix together with kernel density estimation, and an estimation {{of the magnitude of}} the pressure amplitudes. The accuracy of the different methods is estimated by the bootstrap method. We illustrate how informative statistics from these methods can be used to quantify the effect of the process variables on fluidization at different bed locations. Depending on the interest of the experimenter, the method and statistic can be selected which explains fluidization operation most accurately...|$|E

This is related to some recently published experimental work by Eker et al., Science 2010. We show the results of numerical experiments that confirm the propagation to chaos and indicate, through the notion of <b>Fischer</b> <b>information,</b> that this is optimal in terms of information processing. We also consider finite size effects, i. e. {{the difference between the}} mean field situation when neuronal populations are of infinite size and the real situation, when the size is finite and show that the mean field approximation is very good for populations of reasonable size...|$|E

50|$|The {{theory of}} {{cognitive}} dissonance {{was developed in}} the mid-1950s to explain why people of strong convictions are so resistant in changing their beliefs {{even in the face of}} undeniable contradictory evidence. It occurs when people feel an attachment to and responsibility for a decision, position or behavior. It increases the motivation to justify their positions through selective exposure to confirmatory <b>information</b> (<b>Fischer,</b> 2011). Fischer suggested that people have an inner need to ensure that their beliefs and behaviors are consistent. In an experiment that employed commitment manipulations, it impacts perceived decision certainty. Participants were free to choose attitude-consistent and inconsistent information to write an essay. Those who wrote an attitude-consistent essay showed higher levels of confirmatory <b>information</b> search (<b>Fischer,</b> 2011). The levels and magnitude of dissonance also play a role. Selective exposure to consistent information is likely under certain levels of dissonance. At high levels, a person is expected to seek out information that increases dissonance because the best strategy to reduce dissonance would be to alter one's attitude or decision (Smith et al., 2008).|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{regression models}} involving multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with one hidden layer and a Gaussian noise. The data {{are assumed to}} be generated by a true MLP model and the estimation of the parameters of the MLP is done by maximizing the likelihood of the model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel methodology for {{the allocation of}} sensors in multi-station assembly processes. It resolves two core issues pertaining to the determination of an optimal number of sensors to be employed and their best locations. To make the traditional approach more effective, the effect of noise on sensor placement is minimized by maximizing the determinant of the <b>Fischer</b> <b>information</b> matrix. A state-space approach is adopted to model the variation propagation pertaining to the transfer of parts in a given multi-station assembly process. Further, the objective function conceived is significant over other contributions with respect to adding the effect of noise coupled with the sensors. Moreover, a new algorithm is developed to optimize the newly formulated objective function. The proposed algorithm combines chaotic sequences with traditional evolutionary fast simulated annealing (EFSA), hence it is termed chaos-embedded fast-simulated annealing (CEFSA). It can find the optimal sensor distribution with the minimum effect of noise in the sensor data. This paper reports on conceptual work, which underpins the research, and also presents details of a numerical example carried out in an industrial context to test {{the efficacy of the}} proposed algorithm. Further analysis reveals that the proposed approach obtains optimal distribution of sensors and offers more generic results compared with previously concluded analysis...|$|E

Official documents include a passport, residence certificate, and educational certificates for Fanny Fischer Skaletzky and for her sister Laura, whose papers also include a handwritten cookbook. Two folders hold texts of then Corporal Max Fischer on the use of telegraphs and telephones in the Austrian infantry, such as a handwritten manual from 1907 - 1908 and similar texts a decade later during World War I. Joseph Fischer's papers document his death in 1917 and gravesite. Felix (Feivel) Fischer (died 1933) and Clara (Chaya) née Scheiner (died 1925 in NY) had 6 children: Regina; Max; Libe (Laura); Joseph; David; and Fanny (Frime). Feivel and Chaya immigrated to the United States in 1921. Regina Fischer married Cassel Hartenstein in Austria and immigrated to the United States with their daughter Antoinette (Toni), ca. 1920. Joseph Fischer fought in WW I and was killed in 1917 at age 26. David Fischer and Fanny Fischer immigrated to the United States in 1921, joining their sister Regina. David died soon after from a brain tumor. They all settled in New York. Fanny Fischer, a milliner, married Julius Skaletzky in 1926; they had two daughters, Claire (later Glasser) and Diana. Fanny became legally blind and died 1991 in New Jersey. Max Fischer and Laura Fischer together with their parents, joined their sisters Regina and Fanny in New York in 1921. Max had served in WW I. He lived with his sister Laura in NY until his death in 1958. Laura then joined her niece Claire in NJ, where she lived until 1970. Processeddigitize...|$|E
