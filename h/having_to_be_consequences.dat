40|$|AbstractMany proofs of concept {{studies have}} {{established}} the mechanical sensitivity of functionalized microcantilevers {{to a large}} spectrum of target molecules. However, moving to real-life applications also requires the monitored mechanical effect <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly specific. On the other hand, describing the involved surface effects in the continuum mechanics framework is still challenging. Several attempts to overcome the “surface stress” failure to satisfy field equations tend to show such a description <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> non-local, so that at least one’characteristic length’parameter <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used. The <b>consequence</b> <b>is</b> twofold: first, suited modelings <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed <b>to</b> describe the surface effects at the cantilever scale; and second, the involved characteristic length <b>is</b> (thermodynamically) connected <b>to</b> the molecular mechanisms at the cantilever surface, and may therefore be a key parameter for the target molecules identification.

40|$|Key {{findings}} and perspectives from a relapse study of correctional {{clients in the}} Nordic countries are presented and discussed. The findings are {{based on data from}} national computer registers of correctional offenders. Methodologically, a common definition of reoffending, a common observation period and a shared classification of offender groups are applied. Selected national differences are pointed out and discussed. In the article it is argued that the overall national differences in reoffending rates mainly reflect the national differences in the criminal sanction systems, such as the distribution and the proportion of principal crime type groups serving in prison compared to those serving community sanctions, and differences in risk of committing new offences. The latter is clearly reflected by the different percentages of previous prison sentences among different offender groups in prison and probation. Except for traffic offences, in total, all crime type groups reoffended more often to a different primary crime type than the original offence. This strongly indicates that most reoffenders seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> comprehensive crime problems that <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed.

In modern internet-based businesses, however, traditional trust gaining mechanisms cannot be used and new ways to build trust be-tween e-business partners <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found. In <b>consequence,</b> a lot of models describing trust and the mechanisms <b>to</b> build it <b>were</b> developed. Unfortunately, most of these models neither provide the right formalism to model relevant aspects of the trust gaining process (e. g., context and time of a trust-related interaction), nor they allow refinement proofs ver-ifying that a trust management tool implements a certain trust model. Therefore, we propose the temporal logic-based specification and veri-fication technique cTLA which provides a formalism enabling to model context- and time-related aspects of a trust building process. Moreover, cTLA facilitates formal refinement proofs. In this paper, we discuss the application of cTLA to describe trust purposes by means of simple ex-ample systems which <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> decide about the application of certain policies based on the reputation of a party. In particular, we introduce a basic and a refined reputation system and sketch the proof that the refined system is a correct realization of the simple one. ...|$|R

Titration of aqueous peptide solutions with liposomes allows {{the determination of the}} association isotherm, i. e. a plot of bound peptide per lipid versus the free peptide concentration. We have scrutinised the various steps in the evaluation procedure, considering circular dichroism as well as fluorescence intensity as possible signals for the binding process. First of all the measured data <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> corrected for light scattering effects which may otherwise appreciably falsify the final results. Uncertainties due to inherent difficulties regarding the reproducibility of lipid preparations and inevitable titration errors <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered. The <b>consequences</b> of these errors for the quantitative analysis of the titration curves were investigated. The plotted curves can be reasonably well fitted by a functional relationship derived from a Gouy–Chapman model approach that assumes a partitioning of monomeric peptide. The two relevant parameters, partition coefficient and effective charge number, and their error ranges have been determined for mastoparan-X and a series of phosphatidylcholine vesicle sizes and various ionic strengths. These findings show that the applied analysis implies a sufficient basis for calculations of the amount of lipid bound peptide in practice. However, the possible existence of peptide aggregates cannot generally be excluded from a formal monomer associated curve fit as indicated by computer simulations...|$|R

Thus losing Hitachi and Aiwa with its local suppliers association shared partly with its parent Sony, meant its supplier links disappeared. Global-scale crisis in Asia {{at the turn of}} the millennium meant that the South Korean government enforced LG to sell Microchip assets to Hyundai. So LG could never implement its strategy to support university research. At that crisis time, purchase by Tata of Corus Steel meant closure of its 200 -person new materials research laboratory. Embryonic ‘Triple Helix’ relations among universities, businesses and government agencies atrophied with the loss of regional personnel to act as intermediaries and commissioners of research. The second shock was that large numbers of jobs were lost even during this “second restructuring” undermining Wales’ emerging reputation by some 44, 000 jobs between 1998 and 2002. This meant that a further readjustment towards a “post-industrial” future and one based on less engineering <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> faced.

It argues that the szlachta’s and the gentry’s (the lesser nobility in Poland and England respectively) relations with their social superiors seem not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> undergone such significant changes since the late Middle Ages as has often been argued. The aristocracy were seen as the wealthier, more powerful and more respectable section of the wider class of gentlemen. They <b>were</b> expected <b>to</b> act as leaders of the gentry and the people in peace and at war, and to assist the monarch in running the country through participation in government and administration. From the perspective of the gentry, the great nobles were providers or brokers of patronage who, in exchange for loyalty and service, offered protection and rewards as well as access to the court. This symbiosis, which worked rather well despite occasional disputes, was cemented by traditions of reciprocity, blood links and personal allegiances. The differences in wealth and power between individual nobles and the rank-and-file szlachta and gentry were often great, but in the sixteenth century both lesser nobilities felt quite confident of their relations with their superiors. In the case of England, this seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a <b>consequence</b> of the gentry oligarchies’ direct links with the court as well as their increasing importance as provincial magistrates and administrators.

Many research efforts in the field of adaptive hypermedia and adaptive Web-based systems have resulted in solutions for user-adapted access to Web content, often in terms of systems that provide an adaptive hypermedia structure of content pages and hyperlinks. With pages and links that depend on the user, it <b>is</b> feasible <b>to</b> offer a high degree of personalization. Next to research into engineering and realizing adaptation, research into user modeling has been crucial for the success of adaptation. To apply the right adaptation it <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> know the user and her relevant properties and the research field of user modeling has focused on theories and techniques for eliciting knowledge about the user. Naturally, the research fields of adaptive web-based systems and user modeling have always lived in close harmony.

He had worked in Britain carrying out neuroanatomical and neuropathological research for almost two decades before his famous monograph on Histological Studies on the Localisation of Cerebral Function appeared in 1905. In that year he returned to his native Australia and practiced for over 30 years in Sydney as a neurologist rather than a neuropathologist, publishing mainly clinical material though he was involved in the investigation of the epidemic of Australian X disease, a viral encephalitis.

The extent and character of these relationships are not, however, fully understood {{and it is not}} known whether these hypothesized co-evolutionary and co-dependent relationships are consistent across varying technological and task-type conditions. Here, six key biometric parameters of the hand are investigated in terms of their statistical relationship with cutting efficiency using both flakes and handaxes over extended periods of use and in multiple types of cutting task. Results indicate that (1) both handaxe and flake cutting efficiency is significantly related with biometric variation of individual tool-users, (2) relationships between biometric parameters and efficiency are consistent across extended durations but vary {{dependent upon}} task-type conditions, (3) manipulative strength is the most significant biometric trait in terms of predicting flake efficiency, while (4) hand size is the strongest predictor of handaxe cutting efficiency. These results demonstrate the long-term impact that stone tool use likely had on the evolution of hominin biometric variation during the Lower Palaeolithic, while also highlighting the variable influence of different tool use contexts. Most notably, results indicate that the onset of the Acheulean may have been dependent, a priori, upon hand dimensions that <b>are</b> close <b>to</b> the modern human range, and that prior to the appearance of this anatomy, handaxe use would have been an impractical (i. e. inefficient) tool use behaviour compared to the use of flakes...|$|R

The resulting simulated changes in runoff (precipitation minus actual evapo-transpiration) were slight, and frequently opposite to the observed trends. Larger changes in precipitation are plausible and <b>are</b> required <b>to</b> explain the data. The required precipitation increase in N Europe from 9 ka (low) to 6 ka (high) is suggested by GCM experiments <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a <b>consequence</b> of interacting insolation and residual ice-sheet effects on the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. The explanation of other observed changes, including the drying trend during the Holocene in S Europe, has not been provided by GCM experiments to date. Explanations may lie in changes in mesoscale circulation, sea-surface temperature patterns and the coupling between these phenomena that may not follow orbital changes in any simple way...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} SO 42 – {{availability}} on the microbially mediated reductive transformation of As(V) -coprecipitated schwertmannite (Fe 8 O 8 (OH) 3. 2 (SO 4) 2. 4 (AsO 4) 0. 004) was examined in long-term (up to 400 days) incubation experiments. Iron EXAFS spectroscopy showed siderite (FeCO 3) and mackinawite (FeS) were the dominant secondary Fe(II) minerals produced via reductive schwertmannite transformation. In addition, 25 % to 65 % {{of the initial}} schwertmannite was also transformed relatively rapidly to goethite (αFeOOH), with the extent of this transformation being dependent on SO 42 – concentrations. More specifically, the presence of high SO 42 – concentrations acted to stabilize schwertmannite, retarding its transformation to goethite and allowing its partial persistence over the 400 day experiment duration. Elevated SO 42 – also decreased the extent of dissimilatory reduction of Fe(III) and As(V), instead favoring dissimilatory SO 42 – reduction. In contrast, where SO 42 – was less available, there was near-complete reduction of schwertmannite- and goethite-derived Fe(III) as well as solid-phase As(V). As a result, under low SO 42 – conditions, almost no Fe(III) or As(V) remained {{toward the end of}} the experiment and arsenic solid-phase partitioning was controlled mainly by sorptive interactions between As(III) and mackinawite. These As(III) –mackinawite interactions led to the formation of an orpiment (As 2 S 3) -like species. Interestingly, this orpiment-like arsenic species did not form under SO 42 –-rich conditions, despite the prevalence of dissimilatory SO 42 – reduction. The absence of an arsenic sulfide species under SO 42 –-rich conditions appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a <b>consequence</b> of schwertmannite persistence, combined with the preferential retention of arsenic oxyanions by schwertmannite. The results highlight the critical role that SO 42 – availability can play in controlling solid-phase arsenic speciation, particularly arsenic–sulfur interactions, under reducing conditions in soils, sediments, and shallow groundwater systems...|$|R

Knowledge of their ecology is essential for proper conservation and management, but environmental policies still do not consider long-term ecological studies. Here we present the application of multi-proxy analyses to a 115 cm-thick core from La Molina mire (Alto de la Espina) located in NW Iberia, with a chronology spanning from the local Iron Age (ca. 2500 cal BP) to the present. The mire is located in an area intensively mined for gold during the Roman period, and close to a water-canalization system used for mining operations at that time. Our aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get insights into the development of the wetland by combining hydro-hygrophytes, non-pollen palynomorphs and geochemical analyses, supported by 14 C datings and multivariate statistics (PCA). The results indicated a complex pattern of ecological succession. First, the data suggest the wetland was a minerogenic mire in the Iron Age. After that, and since Roman times, it <b>was</b> subjected <b>to</b> dramatic hydrological changes due to the rise of the water-table, fluctuating between the presence of open water and several phases of drawdown. Finally, by ca. 1350 years ago, the wetland experienced a rapid evolution towards ombrotrophy. High grazing pressure was also detected for the last 100 years. The significant change occurred during Early Roman Empire seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the <b>consequence</b> of the direct use of the wetland as a water-reservoir of the canalisation system used for gold-mining. Thus, the current nature of the mire may be the result of an anthropogenic forcing; although multiple anthropogenic and natural causes <b>were</b> potentially linked <b>to</b> the shifts detected, which at least in three phases supposed a threshold response. Our investigation suggests that palaeoecological research <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> understand the origin of wetlands ecosystems, their long-term ecology and the role played by human activities.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that unethical behavior is promoted when people <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> develop {{and maintain a}} biased characterization of an unethical action as being morally acceptable was tested in an experiment in which 120 participants were overpaid for {{taking part in a}} study. The variable of interestwhether the partici-pants pointed out the overpaymentwas examined in a between-participants design under three sets of contrasting manipulations designed to affect differentially participants abilities to convince themselves that keeping the overpaymentwas acceptable. Logistic regressions revealed a decrease in unethical behavior when participants abilities to construct neutralizations for keeping the overpayment were impeded. A follow-up study indicated that these results <b>were</b> unlikely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a <b>consequence</b> of changes in the ethicality of keeping the money {{as a function of the}} specific experimental manipulations used. The influence of moral atti-tudes and gender on moral behavior was also examined. Moral attitude measures were not predictive, but males <b>were</b> more likely <b>to</b> act unethically. Unethical behavior is not a rare event, nor is it preva-lent amongonly certain segments of society. In a random sample of 401 people drawn from a large metropolitan community in the southwest, 25 % of the respondents reported having evaded taxes in the past, a fifth had stolen something worth more than $ 20, and more than half had taken an item worth less than $ 20 at sometime in their lives (Grasmick&Scott, 1982). Research suggests that one in three employees steals at work (Hefter, 1986), whereas the average base rate of employee theft in the retail sector is an even higher 42 % (Werner, Jones, & Steffy, 1989). In a study by a security firm, 500 shoppers were chosen at random and followed. One in 12 was observed shoplifting (Farrell & Ferrara, 1985). In apparent contradiction to the preceding data, a major theme in social psychology has been the influence of self-image management processes (e. g., Steele, 1988...|$|R
40|$|Until the {{decision}} of the High Court in Mabo, the universal acceptance and application of the English doctrine of tenure in Australia led to the view that all titles, rights and interests in land <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the direct <b>consequence</b> of some grant of the Crown. In Mabo, however, six justices of the High Court agreed that the common law, as it had been previously understood, should <b>be</b> changed <b>to</b> recognise native title rights to land; rights which do not derive from a Crown grant. The common law device adopted by the High Court to effect this change, and thereby reconcile the doctrine of tenure and native title when the Crown acquired sovereignty of Australia, was ‘radical title’. This two-part article examines how the Mabo High Court redefined the English doctrine of tenure, or, more accurately, defined the Australian doctrine of tenure, by developing the concept of radical title. It will be seen that in order to achieve this redefinition, the court <b>had</b> <b>to</b> clarify two interrelated aspects of the common law: the applicability of the English (feudal) doctrine of tenure in Australia and the legal effect of the classification of Australia as settled. Part 1 lays the foundation for this analysis by examining the genesis of the doctrine of tenure in pre-Conquest England and the pre-Mabo effect of the colonisation of Australia and the reception of English land. The question posed in Part 2 is twofold: first, how and why the Australian doctrine of tenure, with radical title as its postulate, diverges from the doctrine of tenure in English land law. Secondly, what are the implications, beyond recognition of native title, of the redefined doctrine of tenure for Australian real property law? Crucially, it will be seen that the implications of the Australian doctrine of tenure are suggested by either pre-feudal forms of landholding or the traditional exceptions to the feudal doctrine of tenure, which both include allodial landholding. In particular, it will be seen that the High Court’s restatement of the common law provides a basis upon which ‘Aboriginal customary law title’ can be a valid source of non-derivative common law title to land and thus an alternative to native title...|$|R
40|$|Planning a {{redevelopment}} {{project of}} a 27 hectare industrial area into a high-quality urban living environment means that sufficient information <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available of <b>consequences</b> of process changes. The management of Park Strijp CV is confronted with this situation. Park Strijp CV {{is a joint}} venture between the municipality of Eindhoven and project developer 2 ̆ 2 VolkerWessels 2 ̆ 2. Its aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make the land of the Philips industrial area 2 ̆ 2 Strijp-S 2 ̆ 2 ready for building and to organise the area's redevelopment. The management of Park Strijp CV <b>has</b> assigned ADMS <b>to</b> look at her planning and {{to come up with a}} tool that supports decision-making on planning topics. The assignment has been picked up by five ADMS trainees, all with an urban or landscape planning background. The design process passed through four phases; (1) information gathering and scope definition, (2) a literature study and process analysis resulting in a theoretical tool, (3) the translation of the tool into a practical application, and (4) the final complete tool with an explanatory scenario and a users' and administrators manual. The final answer on the assignment was a Management Support System, named DirectView. DirectView is a Microsoft Excel file, which consists of different databases containing time, budget and quality information regarding all the project activities. The list of project activities is the base of the tool, to which the time, budget and quality databases are related. Information overviews can be generated from the DirectView databases by using specific information filters. In these overviews, activities and their related time, budget and quality parameters are listed, that <b>are</b> related <b>to</b> the allocated change. As a result DirectView <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> show <b>consequences,</b> when an activity delays, a budget exceeds or quality goals change. The information input for DirectView is transferred from three plans: a time planning, a budget table and a quality tree. In the quality tree, the main quality goal of the project is divided into sub goals. Finally sub qualities are translated into quantitative goals, which can <b>be</b> subscribed <b>to</b> different activities. The main goal for the Strijp-S project is; creating a high-quality urban living environment...|$|R
