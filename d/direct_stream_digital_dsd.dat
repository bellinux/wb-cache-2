50|$|Blue Coast Records {{was founded}} by producer/{{engineer}} Cookie Marenco and French engineer Jean Claude Reynaud in 2007. The label is known for using the <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> hi-resolution format, using the labels’ proprietary recording technique Extended Sound Environment (E.S.E.). Artists include Kai Eckhardt, Tony Furtado, Rob Ickes, and others. The label is closely associated with OTR Studios, a recording studio located on the San Francisco Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|On 29 December 2011 the {{original}} {{mix of the}} album was reissued in Japan in a miniature replica of {{the original}} album artwork.

50|$|To {{reduce the}} space and {{bandwidth}} requirements of <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> (<b>DSD),</b> a lossless data compression method called Direct Stream Transfer (DST) is used. DST compression is compulsory for multi-channel regions and optional for stereo regions. This typically compresses {{by a factor of}} between two and three, allowing a disc to contain 80 minutes of both 2-channel and 5.1-channel sound.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, Mobile Fidelity {{began to}} sell CDs in {{addition}} to LPs. In the 2000s it began to sell SACDs. As with the LPs, the CDs and SACDs are remastered from the original analog masters. SACDs use <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> (<b>DSD)</b> encoding rather than the more common Pulse-code modulation (PCM). Mobile Fidelity sells its remasters in limited editions of 5000 copies or less.|$|E
50|$|DMP Digital Music Products was {{an early}} user of the SACD digital audio format. In 1997 their release Alto by Joe Beck & Ali Ryerson was the first {{commercial}} recording captured with Sony's <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> recording technology. The label's Just Jobim by Manfredo Fest in 1998 was the first project captured with the new Meitner DSD conversion technology. In 2000, DMP released the world' s first multi-channel SACD—Sacred Feast by Gaudeamus.|$|R
50|$|In {{more recent}} times, the <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> sound {{encoding}} method was introduced, {{which uses a}} generalized form of pulse-width modulation called pulse density modulation, at a high enough sampling rate (typically {{in the order of}} MHz) to cover the whole acoustic frequencies range with sufficient fidelity. This method is used in the SACD format, and reproduction of the encoded audio signal is essentially similar to the method used in class-D amplifiers.|$|R

50|$|The SACDs in the Warner Premium Sound series all include <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> or DSD coding {{of music}} {{with both a}} 5.1 {{surround}} sound and a stereo mix, {{as well as an}} ordinary Compact Disc or CD coding with a stereo mix, on separate layers; that is, they are hybric multichannel-stereo discs. Thus these discs can be played on any CD player, although the playback of the DSD contents, most importantly multichannel mix, the require a Super Audio CD compatible player. So far this series comprises ten rock and pop record albums, most of which have previously been available in the DVD-Audio format in North America.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Significant {{misrepresentation}} of both 1 -bit SDM and multi-bit LPCM coding paradigms persist within both {{professional and}} commercial arenas that impacts directly upon {{the perception of}} DVD-A and SACD formats. A balanced appraisal of these schemes is presented in order to expose the core differences in the technology both in the theoretical and instrumentation domains. Some observations are made about the fallacy of performance comparisons and the consequence of misinformation that subsequently is derived.

5000|$|Telarc {{is noted}} {{for the high}} quality of its recordings, {{encapsulated}} in the slogan [...] "The Telarc Sound". Its audio engineers are highly regarded within the recording business and have led Telarc to 54 Grammy Awards on its own label and two others it distributes, Heads Up and MCG.

Telarc {{was one of the}} first labels to record music with a 20-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in the late 1980s and has used 24-bit formats since 1996. Currently, the majority of Telarc's releases are (generally hybrid) Super Audio CDs (SACDs) based on <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> (<b>DSD)</b> recordings.|$|E
50|$|On Aug. 28, 2013, Acoustic Sounds {{launched}} SuperHiRez.com, an Internet site selling mainstream title high-resolution album downloads {{from major}} record labels, produced using <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> (<b>DSD)</b> {{as well as}} PCM audio formats. Uncompressed DSD technology results in music {{as close to the}} master recording as possible and is the same technology employed in the manufacture of SACDs. Kassem said publicly he expected the service to offer as many as 500 titles by year-end. On Sept. 4, 2013, Acoustic Sounds announced an agreement with Sony Music Entertainment to provide the company's new digital download service with albums that have been produced or remastered in Direct Stream Digital format. The deal followed an earlier agreement reached with Universal Music Group.|$|E
50|$|Analog-to-digital {{converters}} {{are integral}} to 2000s era music reproduction technology and digital audio workstation-based sound recording. People often produce music on computers using an analog recording and therefore need analog-to-digital converters {{to create the}} pulse-code modulation (PCM) data streams that go onto compact discs and digital music files. The current crop of analog-to-digital converters utilized in music can sample at rates up to 192 kilohertz. Considerable literature exists on these matters, but commercial considerations often play a significant role. Many recording studios record in 24-bit/96 kHz (or higher) pulse-code modulation (PCM) or <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> (<b>DSD)</b> formats, and then downsample or decimate the signal for Red-Book CD production (44.1 kHz) or to 48 kHz for commonly used radio and television broadcast applications.|$|E

50|$|The Super Audio CD (SACD) format {{was created}} by Sony and Philips, who were also the {{developers}} of the earlier standard audio CD format. SACD uses <b>Direct</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Digital</b> (<b>DSD),</b> which works quite differently from the PCM format discussed in this article. Instead of using {{a greater number of}} bits and attempting to record a signal's precise amplitude for every sample cycle, a DSD recorder uses a technique called sigma-delta modulation. Using this technique, the audio data is stored as a sequence of fixed amplitude (i.e. 1- bit) values at a sample rate of 2.884 MHz, which is 64 times the 44.1 kHz sample rate used by CD. At any point in time, the amplitude of the original analog signal is represented by the relative preponderance of 1's over 0's in the data stream. This digital data stream can therefore be converted to analog by the simple expedient of passing it through a relatively benign analog low-pass filter. The competing DVD-Audio format uses standard, linear PCM at variable sampling rates and bit depths, which at the very least match and usually greatly surpass those of a standard CD Audio (16 bits, 44.1 kHz).|$|E
40|$|High-resolution {{digital audio}} systems {{currently}} embrace {{two forms of}} encoding. DVD-audio uses multi-level linear pulse code modulation (LPCM) while Super-Audio CD (SACD) uses sigma-delta modulation (SDM) in a scheme designated by Sony as <b>direct</b> <b>stream</b> <b>digital</b> (<b>DSD)</b> [1].

40|$|Although much of {{this section}} {{contains}} fundamental information on basic audio technology, extensive information on new evolving digital audio formats and recording and reproduction systems has been added since the last edition. As noted herein, DVD-Audio, for example, {{is based on the}} same DVD technology as DVD-Video discs and DVD-ROM computer discs. It has a theoretical sampling rate of 192 kHz with 24 -bit processing and can store 4. 7 gigabytes on a disc with a choice of two- or six-channel audio tracks or a mix of both. Super Audio CD (SACD) has the same storage capacity. It uses <b>direct</b> <b>stream</b> <b>digital</b> (<b>DSD)</b> with 2. 8 MHz sampling in three possible disc types. The first two contain only DSD data (4. 7 gigabytes of data on a single-Iayer disc and slightly less than 9 gigabytes on the dual layer disc). The third version, the SACD hybrid, combines a single 4. 7 gigabyte layer with a conventional CD that can be played back on conventional CD players. MPEG audio coding variations continue 10 evolve. For example: • MPEG-I is a low-bit-rate audio format. • MPEG- 2 eXlcnds MPEG-l toward the audio needs of digital video broadcasting. • MPEG- 2 Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is an enhanced multichannel coding system. • MP 3 is the popular name for MPEG-l Layer UI...|$|E
