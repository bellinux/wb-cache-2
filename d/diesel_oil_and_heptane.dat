40|$|In 1999, 38000 litres of <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> was spilled in Gros Morne National Park, much {{of which}} leached onto on a small area of coastline. The goal of this project was to {{determine}} the effects of the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> resulting clean-up procedures, on the coastal environment. Chapter 1 focuses on assessing conditions at the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> spill site by examining hydrocarbon levels in sediments and organisms at the site, and by conducting a survey of the algal taxa present. Significant quantities of diesel were present for at least two years after the spill, both in sediments <b>and</b> biota. The <b>oil</b> spill site was also affected by uncharacteristically low-salinity conditions, as evidenced by the predominance of fresh-water tolerant algae. Chapter 2 focuses on determining the range of effects of the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> using caged invertebrates, transplanted at a gradient from the point source of diesel and analyzed using binary logistic regression. Both distance from the source and length of time at the site (i. e. length of exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> low-salinity conditions) affected the survival time of transplanted organisms; organisms transplanted closer to the source died faster than those farther away, though all organisms eventually perished. Chapter 3 examines the effects, combined and individual, of diesel and reduced salinity on the survival rates of three invertebrates commonly found along the Newfoundland coastline. Survival of these invertebrates, Mysis stenolepis, Gammarus oceanicus, and Littorina obtusata, was examined using one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey's test, two-factor analysis of variance, and regression analysis. Not all marine intertidal invertebrates react equally when exposed to <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> reduced salinity, alone or combined, however, when considering that these organisms represent those potentially affected by a coastal oil spill, it can be concluded that even a short-term exposure could be devastating...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, silica {{nanoparticle}} aggregates (SNPAs) {{have been}} used to decrease the injection pressure of wells in low permeability reservoirs achieving good results. In order to study the mechanisms for reduction in the injection pressure of low permeability wells by the SNPA-diesel oil system injection, the microstructure of SNPAs was observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The particle size distribution of SNPAs was also measured by the laser scattering method. The viscosities of <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> SNPA-diesel <b>oil</b> system were measured with a capillary viscometer. The effect of SNPAs on the solubility of wax in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> was experimentally studied. The influencing factors, including temperature and SNPA concentration in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil,</b> on wax solubility were analyzed. A pore-throat film displacement model (PTFDM) was built for mechanism explanation. The microstructure and size distribution analyses show that the SNPAs are in the nanometer size range. The viscosity of the SNPA-diesel oil system is lower than that of the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil.</b> The solubility of wax in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> increases greatly due to SNPA addition, the solubility ratio reaches 7.5. The solubility of wax in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> increases with increases in the concentration of SNPAs in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> with the temperature. It is proved that the addition of SNPAs to <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> helps remove the wax deposited near the wellbore. This maybe one of the main mechanisms for injection pressure decreases in low permeability reservoirs.|$|R
