5|$|The {{majority}} of all passengers travelling by air {{to or from}} the UK are carried by UK airlines, {{of which there are}} around forty, {{and at the end of}} 2006 the UK air transport fleet numbered 963 aircraft, flying just under 1.2million flights and averaging over <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> flying daily. Together the two largest airlines as measured by passenger numbers; British Airways and easyJet, account for nearly half of the 127million passengers flown on UK airlines. In terms of capacity, both available and used, British Airways is again the largest airline, whilst easyJet is pushed into third place by Virgin Atlantic Airways. British Airways passenger flights also account for over 50 per cent of all cargo carried by UK airlines, and when combined with its cargo operations the airline carries over 60 per cent of all cargo carried by UK airlines.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the year, {{near the}} ruins of Nineveh, Heraclius engaged Rhahzadh before {{reinforcements}} could reach the Persian commander. The Battle of Nineveh took place in the fog, reducing the Persian advantage in missile troops. Heraclius feigned retreat, leading the Persians to the plains, before reversing his troops to the surprise of the Persians. After <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> fighting, the Persians suddenly retreated to nearby foothills, but the battle did not become a rout. During the battle, approximately 6,000 Persians were killed. Patriarch Nikephoros' Brief History suggests that Rhahzadh challenged Heraclius to personal combat, and that Heraclius accepted and killed Rhahzadh in a single thrust; two other challengers fought against him and also lost. However, he received an injury to his lip.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} further {{reinforced}} with 300 sailors the next day, before another {{attack on the}} town was launched on 29 May. A few ships had been sent as a decoy to split the Royalist forces, but only succeeded in sending a small detachment of cavalry and foot away, though they quickly returned {{when it was clear}} that the ships were not going to land. Around midday, the batteries began to heavily bombard the town, followed by a ground attack which managed to breach the fortifications. After <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> fighting, the Parliamentarians rebuffed the attack. Fourteen more ships arrived two days later, bringing further provisions and ammunition, and news that a relieving force would be sent to aid the town. By this stage, Maurice realised that he was unlikely to be able to capture the town, and so was determined to destroy it instead; fires were set on 1 June and then no attacks other than light bombardments were made until 11 June, when heavier, red-hot shot was fired to try and set more fires in the town.|$|E
