40|$|The {{mechanism}} of Au dispersion in sediments of mountainous desert environments {{has been studied}} in two {{different areas of the}} Chilean Andes. The San Pedro de Cachiyuyo placer (ca. 1800 m a. s. l.) consists of alluvial fans and ephemeral stream sediments deposited in a stable piedmont. The primary Au source is Cu-Au-bearing hydrothermal tourmaline breccia. The relief of this area is low (1850 m) and the average annual rainfal is ca. 20 mm. The La Coipa area (ca. 4000 m a. s. l.) is characterized by a rugged relief. The annual average rainfall is ca. 100 mm. The sedimentary deposits are less sorted than in San Pedro de Cachiyuyo and consist of ephemeral stream alluvium and slope deposits formed in a periglacial environment. The primary Au sources are two volcanic-hosted epithermal precious metal deposits. At San Pedro de Cachiyuyo, the halo is less than 1 km in length and the highest Au concentration ware observed at the break in slope between the hillside and the piedmont.

40|$|Abstract Among the {{periodic}} system's elements, mercury (Hg) is most liable to dispersion and, simultaneously, most liable to secondary enrichment. Consequently, mercury enrichments can {{occur as a}} result of a number of geologic as well as anthropogenic processes. If the geologic processes cease, quite extended <b>dispersion</b> <b>halos</b> can form around a former accumulation center. Hydrothermal mineralization is a typical process giving rise to mercury concentration. As a result, regional mercury impacts can occur in the floodplains of rivers flowing from the mining and heavy industrial regions of Transylvania and Slovakia. Elsewhere, mercury anomalies detectable at the intermediate scale (1 : 50, 000) can be found in the Zemplén and Mátra Mountains and, subordinately, in the Börzsöny Mountains. Typically mercury anomalies develop above major structural lineaments as well, unless they are buried under thick young sediments. A remarkable example is the deep fault separating the Pilis and Visegrád Mountains. Another group of Hg anomalies is caused by well-known mercury contamination sources (Kazincbarcika, Balatonfűzfő), which are truly local: they cannot be detected at the scale of the given study. ...|$|R

The results display a U- 234 /U- 238 AR signature with depth which may be common to all U ore bodies.

The amplitude of the profile is a function of local conditions.

Mass balance requires the solid material left behind the redox front to have a U- 234 /U- 238 AR reduced below I. Local second order effects may be superimposed on the signature.

The sample density (one sample per 60 – 100 km 2, depending on sample availability) {{and extent of}} the coverage (c. 400 000 km 2, including large unsampled areas in drainage) mean that the data are potentially valuable for both exploration and environmental purposes. More than 3100 samples have been analysed for 53 elements by XRF, ICP-AES and ICP-MS, with selected samples also analysed for PGE. Elevated Au abundances in the NE of the survey area not only cluster around known gold deposits but extend beyond them, indicating the likelihood of more widespread mineralization in these areas. A chalcophile element index illustrates potential for Au and base metal mineralization in the westernmost part of the Yilgarn Craton, whereas a pegmatophile index shows a regional NW trend parallel to regional structures. Abundant chromium in granite-dominated areas might indicate mafic-ultramafic remnants (some with anomalous Au) beyond known greenstone belts.

40|$|The massive {{sulphide}} deposits at Areachap and Kantienpan Cu-Zn Mine are {{hosted by}} a ~ 1600 Ma old volcano sedimentary succession {{known as the}} Areachap Group, {{in the eastern part}} of Namaqua Metamorphic Province, South Africa. The deposits were affected by a complex deformation and metamorphic history and represent examples of upper amphibolite to granulite grade metamorphosed volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) deposits. The host rocks of both ore deposits are peraluminous-gneisses and the dominant sulphide minerals in the ore zone are pyrite, pyrrhotite sphalerite, and chalcopyrite and trace amounts of galena. Other ore related minerals include barite and anhydrite. The metamorphic minerals in the alteration zones at the Areachap and Kantienpan VHMS deposits are characterized by the presence of plagioclase, almandine and pyrope, enstatite and clinoenstatite, cummingtonite and gedrite, cordierite, sillimanite, and retrograde chlorite and chamosite. Lithogeochemical methods are widely used in exploration geochemistry to identify the primary alteration zones related to VHMS mineralization, as these zones are often exposed, while the massive sulphide ore body itself may be concealed. Especially in areas that were not affected by high grade metamorphism and intensive deformation. Some of these methods include the variation in the relative abundance of major element concentrations throughout the rock successions, mineral chemistry of silicates and spinel minerals near the ore zone, and normative compositions of the rock successions. However, the application of these methods is limited by complex geology in regional metamorphic terranes, such as the Namaqua Metamorphic Province. Therefore, in addition, three of the more advanced lithogeochemical approaches, known as the Isocon method, the Box Plot and Pearce Elemental Ratios, are combined here and adapted for application in such regions. Based on the mineral chemistry, it is evident that plagioclase is more Ca-rich adjacent to the ore zone, pyroxene has the highest relative Mg* ratio (Mg* ratio = 100 x cationic ratio of Mg / (Mg + Fe + Ca)), the almandine and pyrope components of garnet are high and the spessartine and grossular components are low. In addition, the Mg-rich variety of mica (phlogopite) is more common near the ore zone and the peraluminous nature of the footwall zone is revealed by the presence of gahnite. Cordierite and retrograde chlorites show the highest Mg#’s (Mg# = Mg/ (Mg + Fe)) in the ore zone. In addition to the above, Pearce Element Ratio analyses of cordierite, pyroxene and garnet may be used to define proximity to sulphide mineralization. Geochemically, the ore zone and alteration zones at Areachap and Kantienpan VHMS ore deposits display a high peraluminous ratio (Al 2 O 3 / (Na 2 O+K 2 O+CaO)) confirming the peraluminous nature of these zones as indicated by the mineral chemistry discussed above. The intervals identified in sampled borehole core with low CaO and Na 2 O and with high MgO and K 2 O contents represent the alteration zone in the original footwall rocks of the deposit. Isocon studies have shown that the alteration zones at the Areachap and Kantienpan deposits are enriched in Mg, Fe (total), S, Zn, Si, Co and F and depleted in Na, Ca, Sr, Ni, V and La. Elements that behaved relatively immobile include Zr, Ti, P, Mn, Al, Y, and U. The box plot, alteration index versus the chlorite-carbonate-pyrite index, was originally proposed to illustrate the combined effects of hydrothermal and diagenetic alteration and is based on characteristic primary mineral reactions in regions not affected by regional metamorphism. It is demonstrated here that these primary mineral reactions are preserved in a unique set of metamorphic minerals, and that the box plot can be modified for high-grade metamorphic rock types. When samples with very high Mg contents (MgO>>K 2 O, AI> 90 % and CCPI> 98 %) are plotted in the box plot they may be classified as representative of anomalous areas that are highly prospective. Samples with high Mg contents (MgO>K 2 O, AI> 64 % and CCPI> 93 %) may be considered representative of areas that may be classified as of moderate priority in an exploration programme. The findings of the mineral chemical and geochemical investigations of the footwall alteration at the Kantienpan, Areachap and Prieska Cu-Zn ore bodies are used to define various statistical factors. The applicability of these factors in lithogeochemical exploration is demonstrated by calculating the respective factor scores for a regional lithogeochemical data set. It is demonstrated how these factors could be used to identify samples collected from localities that are highly prospective for the discovery of concealed VHMS style mineralization. Based on the statistical analyses of the regional data set, the altered rocks may be distinguished from the metapelitic rocks by their high scores for the alteration factor and low scores for the peraluminous factor. The peraluminous rocks may be separated from the hornblende-gneisses by their high scores for the peraluminous factor, and from the amphibolites by their very low ortho-amphibolite factor scores and high peraluminous factor scores. The variation, of trace elements in the surface calcrete layer that conceals the mineralization in the studied areas, displays the geochemical signature of mineralization, but the concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb are much lower at and near surface and increase down depth within the profiles. The absolute concentrations and peak to background ratios of the elements of interest at the surface therefore depend on the thickness of the underlying calcrete layer in the area. Two methods, a total analysis (x-ray fluorescence, XRF) and partial extraction (NH 4 EDTA solution), were applied in to evaluate results, which would be successful and commercially viable in a general exploration programme, using regolith samples. The results of the two methods above were then compared to another patented partial extraction method (mobile metal ion, MMI) on a data set previously reported on by Rossouw (2003). At Kantienpan, where the sand cover is very shallow to absent, dispersion appears to be more related to the secondary redistributions of gossaniferous clasts, than to dispersion of mobile metal ions on the surface of sand particles. The XRF method shows a wider <b>dispersion</b> <b>halo</b> here than methods based on partial extraction. Whereas, at Areachap, where a relatively thick sand (approximately one metre) covers the calcrete layer, partial extraction (based on a NH 4 EDTA solution extraction) results in a larger, recognizable, <b>dispersion</b> <b>halo</b> than that detected by XRF. The MMI results show a larger span for Zn, followed by NH 4 EDTA and finally XRF. For Cu, the NH 4 EDTA method exhibits the largest span followed by XRF and then MMI. The anomalous Cu, Zn and Pb contents extracted by partial extraction methods from the wind blown sand deposits indicate that these elements were derived from the ore minerals related to the massive sulphide deposits. However, Mn and Fe contents analysed by XRF also show high values that could not be only related to derivation from massive sulphide ores. Some of the high concentrations of these elements in the sand cover is ascribed to the weathering of other iron-rich rock forming minerals. Thesis (PhD (Geology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|In {{tropical}} areas, {{the high}} rainfall induces severe-and pervasive weathering, producing a thick soil cover. The lithologies underneath may b~ recognised using geochemical mapping, {{which is based}} on certain elements that have the ability to differentiate between various lithologic units. Elements that are independent of the weathering process are normally selected for this purpose. The chemistry of mobility of base metals is an important factor to take into account when evaluating the mobility and distribution of these elements in a soil profile. Factors such as pH, Eh, organic material, clay minerals, Fe and Mn oxides are normally key aspects to be considered. When iron-rich rocks undergo deep weathering, lateritic profiles are developed. These are widespread in a belt bordering the equatorial zone, including the Brazilian shield, West and East Africa, parts of India and Northern Australia. In these profiles, the high rainfall promotes intense leaching of the different horizons. Where the pre-existing profiles are mostly preserved, the base metals are distributed throughout the profile: in the upper ferruginous horizon, goethite and hematite can adsorb large amounts of Mo, resulting in large <b>dispersion</b> <b>halo.</b> Other base metals such as Cu and Zn are less resistant in these freely-drained profiles and, therefore, they may be partly leached from the profile. In the lower horizons, Cu,,zn, Ni and Co are retained, hosted in kaolinite and smectite, and thus, a high geochemical contrast will be identified in this horizon at the expense of a decline {{in the size of the}} dispersion haloes. The pre-existing profiles can be truncated, with a thin stone line developing at the contact between the lateritic profile and the recent soil. The conditions in these environments favour the retention of most of the pathfinder and target elements in all soil horizons, with the B horizon showing the highest contrast. If the primary rock is rich in AI, a bauxitic profile will be developed. The world distribution of bauxites closely resembles that of laterites. The behaviour of Co and Ni is very similar to that of iron during the bauxitization. Furthermore, the factors that induce residual enrichment of Al with removal of Fe in the soil profile will cause significant depletion of Co and Ni in these profiles. These metals are then concentrated at the base of the profile because of precipitation from downward percolating solutions. Many karst bauxite deposits in Southern Europe are enriched with Ni and Co in the basal horizon. Such horizon is mined as nickel ore in the bauxites of the Lokris region in Greece. Copper and molybdenum are strongly enriched. in bauxitic profiles. Concentration ratios are 8 and 3. 2 for Cu and Mo respectively. Molybdenum is closely related to goethite and hematite, and therefore, the high concentration of Mo in a bauxitic profile will be consistent with the horizon where iron is concentrated. Copper concentrates at the base of the iron rich-horizon but also appears enriched in the saprolite together with Co. When sulphide bodies occur, in this environment, deep and penetrative weathering has resulted in considerable near-surface mobilization of iron and silica. The supergene alteration commonly obscures the identity of the primary sulphides at the surface. In this case, geochemical assessment of the resulting gossan has proved to be crucial in mineral exploration. A search in the secondary mineral assemblage, volatile and precious metals may lead to the information on the composition of the primary sulphide assemblage. The conclusion that will be reached is that if the geochemical properties (mobility, affinities with Fe or Mn oxides and/or clay minerals) of each of the base metals are understood, an appropriate sampling (optimum size-depth combination) will then be done. In such cases, a subdued, weak, but significant, geochemical response will be identified in the surface horizon. ...|$|E
40|$|The Umkondo Sedimentary Basin {{in eastern}} Zimbabwe {{has been studied}} by various {{individuals}} and organizations since 1901. Their interest had been in finding limestone and beryl and base metal deposits, especially copper, iron and uranium, but these occurrences had proved to be of no economic value (Watson, 1969). The recent discovery of placer diamonds within the Proterozoic basal conglomerates of the Umkondo Sedimentary Basin has now attracted worldwide interest in the basin’s diamond economic potential, in understanding of the geology, and the diamond provenance of the Umkondo conglomerates. The Umkondo Sedimentary Basin basal conglomerate placer deposit might narrowly {{be defined as a}} mega-placer because of its sheer large size and high grades, especially on the 70, 000 hectare western margin diamond <b>dispersion</b> <b>halo</b> where alluvial diamonds are being mined.

On craton placers are residual, and transient placers are eroded and deposited into the exit drainage, while terminal placers, the final depositories of diamonds with the highest chances of being mega-placers are deposited into terminal basins like oceans and foreland basins. Though data is limited at the moment, the Umkondo conglomerates caratage is likely to run into hundreds of millions of carats, with a diamond gem content of between twenty and twenty-five percent, as is indicated from recent diamond production data. The greater part of the Umkondo diamonds are likely to be lodged beneath the deep gravels of the Middle and Lower Save River basin, because small remnant tilted mountain blocks and inselbergs forming the caps of hills are what remains of the host conglomerate on the western margin of the Umkondo Basin. Areas to be examined in this document will be the geology; the mode of formation of the Umkondo basin and its sedimentary system; the regional kimberlite exploration around the basin; and diamond production in the Marange diamond field, in order to come up with indications of the provenance of the diamonds within the Umkondo conglomerates. The kimberlite clusters in and around the Umkondo sedimentary basin have all proved to be barren or only nominally diamondiferous and that the kimberlites are between 200 Ma and 500 Ma and thus much younger than the greater than 1. 1 Ga Umkondo diamondiferous conglomerates.

This paper is an attempt to clear up some of the misconceptions surrounding the Marange diamond deposit and to raise interest in the urgent rquirement to study and understand the Umkondo Basin and the origin of its diamonds. The only meaningful studies on diamond occurrence and diamond exploration of the basin were undertaken from 1996 to 2006 by Kimberlitic Searches Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd, the then Zimbabwe kimberlite exploration arm of De Beers, Zimbabwe, in their quest to find kimberlites, which were thought to be related to the Umkondo alluvial diamond deposit. As will be shown in the following chapters, many of the discovered kimberlites range from very low grade to non-diamondiferous, and are much younger than the Umkondo conglomerates, whose diamonds are in turn a great deal older. Thus the basic question concerning the origin or provenance of the Umkondo placer diamonds still remains unresolved. Because of the sheer size of the basin, modern, wide-area-coverage, geophysical exploration methods become appropriate to effectively generate diamond potential targets for further examination. This document will attempt to collate various data available to paint a true picture of the state of exploration within the Umkondo Basin...|$|E

40|$|Propylitic {{alteration}} halos to porphyry deposits {{are characterized}} by low- to moderate intensity replacements of primary feldspars and mafic minerals by epidote, chlorite, calcite ± actinolite, pyrite, prehnite and zeolites. The pyrite halo that surrounds porphyry deposits typically extends part way through the propylitic halo, and provides strong responses to conventional geochemical and geophysical exploration techniques. When exploring outside of the pyrite halo, porphyry deposits {{have proven to be}} difficult to detect based simply on the presence of weak epidote-chlorite alteration. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of epidote from propylitic alteration zones around porphyry and skarn deposits in the central Baguio district, Philippines, have shown that low-level hypogene geochemical <b>dispersion</b> <b>halos</b> can be detected at considerably greater distances than can be achieved by conventional rock chip sampling of altered rocks. Epidote chemistry can provide vectoring information to the deposit center and potentially provides insights into the potential metal endowment of the porphyry system, providing explorers with both vectoring and fertility assessment tools. Epidote chemistry varies with respect to distance from porphyry deposit centers, with the highest concentrations of proximal pathfinder elements (e. g., Cu, Mo, Au, Sn) detected in epidote from close to the potassic alteration zone. Distal pathfinder elements (e. g., As, Sb, Pb, Zn, Mn) are most enriched in epidote more than 1. 5 km from the deposit center. Rare earth elements and Zr are most enriched in epidote {{from the edge of the}} pyrite halo. The lateral zonation in epidote chemistry implies that at Baguio the geochemical dispersion patterns were produced by lateral outflow of spent fluids from the porphyry center, rather than from ingress of peripheral, non-magmatic waters...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cuttings from 22 holes drilled through steeply dipping, {{weathered}} shales and volcanics at Panglo, 30 km N of Kalgoorlie, {{help define}} mineralogical and geochemical variations around flat-lying supergene Au mineralization within a stripped lateritic profile. The regolith profile contains very saline groundwaters {{only a few}} metres below the suface. Ore occurs in saprolite and saprock, below a mottled zone which is generally unconformably overlain by c. 0. 5 m of fluvial/colluvial sediments. Apart from some surface enrichment associated with pedogenic carbon-ate, Au is strongly depleted in the saprolite above the supergene ore horizon, and only subeconomic mineralization occurs in the underlying fresh rocks. The Au mineralization at depth is accompanied by pyrite and elevated Ag, As, Co, Cu, Sn, W and Zn contents and {{is associated with the}} destruction of albite and formation of muscovite. In the regolith, supergene Au ore at Panglo occurs in the basal portion of the saprolite and Au maintains its association with these elements because they are incorporated into secondary oxide minerals. These elements are thus useful pathfinders for Au, especially as some (e. g. As and Cu) form substantial <b>dispersion</b> <b>haloes</b> about ore. Although the ore is oxidized, it is still within its original primary hydrothermal alteration zone, characterized by muscovite and peripheral paragonite development, especially in shale sequences. Because these micas are resistant to weathering, their distributions can be readily mapped in the regolith. Alternatively, elevated K and depleted Na, Ba and Sr can be used as lithogeochemical indicators of mineralization in weathered shales. Use of Na in alteration indices is complicated by its presence in halite at Panglo, but K/Ba ratios do identify the relict zones of hydrothermal alteration within the regolith...|$|R
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The northwestern Flinders Ranges hosts {{a variety of}} Pb/Zn/Cu/Ag mineralised sites. It is, therefore, an ideal setting to investigate the plant biogeochemical expression of proximal base metal mineralisation in bedrock geochemistry. Twigs and leaves from Eremophila freelingii along with bedrock collected from traverses across four sites of known and background mineralisation have been analysed to show this expression in biogeochemistry as well as disparities in this expression throughout plant organs. Increased concentrations of Ni, As, Mo, and Cd in bedrock and to an extent in plant biogeochemistry {{are associated with the}} distribution of the commodity elements, Pb, Zn, Cu, and Ag. This corresponds with a decrease in the concentration of Na, Ca, Al, Fe, and Y {{in the vicinity of the}} mineralisation. Plant biogeochemistry results are able to identify a discriminatory signature for different geological settings and display the effects of regolith – landform settings on the distribution of elemental concentrations in the landscape and also display different sized geochemical <b>dispersion</b> <b>halos</b> for each commodity element. Biogeochemistry analytical results have also shown that concentrations of most selected elements vary between leaf and twig organs from the same plant, with concentrations generally lower in twigs. An implication of this study is that Eremophila freelingii leaf biogeochemistry would be a suitable sampling medium for geochemical exploration for base metal mineralisation in areas of shallow transported cover. Its advantages over bedrock sampling are that once regolith-landform settings are accounted for, samples are reasonably representative of underlying geological substrate, light weight (assisting field transport) and have negligible long-term environmental impact to the sample site.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{properties}} of dark matter haloes of a LCDM model in different environments. Using {{the distance of the}} 5 th nearest neighbour as an environmental density indicator, we show that haloes in a high density environment are more massive, richer, have larger radii and larger velocity <b>dispersions</b> than <b>haloes</b> in a low density environment. Haloes in high density regions move with larger velocities, and are more spherical than haloes in low density regions. In addition, low mass haloes {{in the vicinity of the}} most massive haloes are themselves more massive, larger, and have larger rms velocities and larger 3 D velocities than low mass haloes far from massive haloes. The velocities of low mass haloes near massive haloes increase with the parent halo mass. Our results are in agreement with recent findings about environmental effects for groups and clusters of galaxies from deep (SDSS and LCRS) surveys.

40|$|The {{survey of}} Lyman α {{emitters}} (LAEs) with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, called SILVERRUSH (Ouchi et al.), is producing massive data of LAEs at z≳ 6. Here we present LAE simulations {{to compare the}} SILVERRUSH data. In 162 ^ 3 comoving Mpc^ 3 boxes, where numerical radiative transfer calculations of reionization were performed, LAEs have been modeled with physically motivated analytic recipes {{as a function of}} halo mass. We have examined 2 ^ 3 models depending on {{the presence or absence of}} <b>dispersion</b> of <b>halo</b> Lyα emissivity, <b>dispersion</b> of the <b>halo</b> Lyα optical depth, τ_α, and halo mass dependence of τ_α. The unique free parameter in our model, a pivot value of τ_α, is calibrated so as to reproduce the z= 5. 7 Lyα luminosity function (LF). We compare our model predictions with Lyα LFs at z= 6. 6 and 7. 3, LAE angular auto-correlation functions (ACFs) at z= 5. 7 and 6. 6, and LAE fractions in Lyman break galaxies at 5 <z< 7. The Lyα LFs and ACFs are reproduced by multiple models, but the LAE fraction turns out to be the most critical test. The dispersion of τ_α and the halo mass dependence of τ_α are essential to explain all observations reasonably. Therefore, a simple model of one-to-one correspondence between halo mass and Lyα luminosity with a constant Lyα escape fraction has been ruled out. Based on our best model, we present a formula to estimate the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, x_ HI, from the observed Lyα luminosity density at z≳ 6. We finally obtain x_ HI= 0. 5 _- 0. 3 ^+ 0. 1 as a volume-average at z= 7. 3. Comment: Submitted to PASJ, 29 pages, 20 figure...|$|R
40|$|Using {{adaptive}} mesh-refinement cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with {{a physically}} motivated supernova feedback prescription {{we show that}} the standard cold dark matter model can account for extant observed properties of damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs). We then examine the properties of DLA host galaxies. We find: (1) While DLA hosts roughly trace the overall population of galaxies at all redshifts, they are always gas rich. (2) The history of DLA evolution reflects primarily {{the evolution of the}} underlying cosmic density, galaxy size and galaxy interactions. With higher density and more interactions at high redshift DLAs are larger in both absolute terms and in relative terms with respect to virial radii of halos. (3) The variety of DLAs at high redshift is richer with a large contribution coming from galactic filaments, created through close galaxy interactions. The portion of gaseous disks of galaxies where most stars reside makes relatively small contribution to DLA incidence at z= 3 - 4. (4) The vast majority of DLAs arise in halos of mass M_h= 10 ^ 10 - 10 ^ 12 Msun at z= 1. 6 - 4. At z= 3 - 4, 20 - 30 % of DLA hosts are Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). (5) Galactic winds play an indispensable role in shaping the kinematic properties of DLAs. Specifically, the high velocity width DLAs are a mixture of those arising in high mass, high velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>halos</b> and those arising in smaller mass systems where cold gas clouds are entrained to high velocities by galactic winds. (6) In agreement with observations, we see a weak but noticeable evolution in DLA metallicity. The metallicity distribution centers at [Z/H]=- 1. 5 to - 1 at z= 3 - 4, with the peak moving to [Z/H]=- 0. 75 at z= 1. 6 and [Z/H]=- 0. 5 by z= 0. (7) The star formation rate of DLA hosts is concentrated in the range 0. 3 - 30 Msun/yr at z= 3 - 4, gradually shifting lower to peak at ~ 0. 5 - 1 Msun/yr by z= 0.

40|$|Limitations on the life-of-mine of the {{sediment-hosted}} Rosh Pinah deposit urged exploration for extensions {{to existing}} ore and similar new deposits in the Gariep Belt. Identification and quantification of hydrothermal wall rock alteration {{and the extent}} of <b>dispersion</b> <b>haloes</b> of ore indicator elements were considered supportive to this cause. The results from detailed lithogeochemical traverses on the C Mine and Eastern Orefield, coupled with mineralogical studies and the interpretation of a large (n > 400) multi-element data set of the mine area, showed that the extent of wall rock alteration and associated element dispersion is limited. Barium has shown the most extensive dispersion in argillaceous, arkosic and dolomitic-arkosic wall rocks with anomalous values evident up to 100 m into the footwall and 50 m into the hanging wall of the ore zone. Alteration of detrital K-feldspar clasts by Ba-rich hydrothermal fluids provided a visual, qualitative index, which exceeds the limits of the elemental halo by 10 - 20 m. Zinc and Pb, as well as Fe and Mn, were considerably less effective as indicator elements. Indices devised for the various lithologies of the Rosh Pinah deposit, such as the Barium Alteration Index and Combined Index, as well as modifications to previously proposed indices are based on variations in Fe(t), MnO, MgO, Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, BaO, and K 2 O. The indices are aimed at minimizing the influence of sedimentologically induced variation in chemistry and maximizing those superimposed by hydrothermal alteration. These quantitative parameters allowed the successful distinction between unaffected and hydrothermally altered wall rocks, as well as an indication of proximity to the ore zone. The results confirmed the limited extent of alteration demonstrated by single element distribution, but indicated that a slightly broader zone has been affected. The limited alteration of feldspathic, dolomitic and siliciclastic sediments {{is a function of the}} physico-chemical properties and evolution of the mineralizing fluids. It indicates that the fluids were near neutral to weakly acidic, whereas high concentrations of Ba in the ore and wall rocks required the fluids to be reduced (H 2 S-dominant). These physico-chemical properties of the fluids resulted in rapid precipitation of the metal load in response to a variety of processes such as cooling, increases in pH, dilution or addition of H 2 S. Consequently, mineralization has proven to be distinctly concentrated within a favourable horizon, with only limited vertical metal dispersion. © 2005 Geological Society of South Africa.

Ultrafiltration showed that U isotopes migrate in ARUP groundwaters largely as true solute species. Solute U levels and 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios in shallow aquifers of orebody <b>dispersion</b> <b>haloes</b> approximate a simple twocomponent dilution-by-infiltration model. Desorption of U to the aquifer probably derives from vertical leaching by infiltration. Uranium adsorption in the aquifer is not significant in the short term. Thorium isotopes are significantly associated with colloids. There was no evidence for recoil enhancement of 230 Th dissolution from U ores. 230 Th solute levels were universally lower than expected on thermodynamic grounds. 232 Th is not significantly enriched in ARUP deposits. Competition between rates of complexation and rapid adsorption appeared to cause equivalent ambient levels of complexed solute 232 Th to exceed those of 230 Th. Colloids were composed principally of iron and silicon species, probably ferrihydrite associated with silicate and discrete colloidal silica. Colloidal clays were not evident. Radioactive ferruginous pisoliths from above an orebody were evaluated for their potential as permanent 2 ̆ 2 sinks 2 ̆ 2 for U and Th. Fission track autoradiography and chemical tests indicated an absence of postdepositional leaching of U. No 230 Th/ 234 U activity ratios in excess of unity were found in oxide phases.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dependence of}} the Vainshtein screening mechanism on the cosmic web morphology of both dark matter particles and halos as determined by ORIGAMI. Unlike chameleon and symmetron screening, which come into effect in regions of high density, Vainshtein screening instead depends on the dimensionality of the system, and screened bodies can still feel external fields. ORIGAMI is well-suited to this problem because it defines morphologies according to the dimensionality of the collapsing structure and {{does not depend on}} a smoothing scale or density threshold parameter. We find that halo particles are screened while filament, wall, and void particles are unscreened, and this is independent of the particle density. However, after separating halos according to their large scale cosmic web environment, we find no difference in the screening properties of halos in filaments versus halos in clusters. We find that the fifth force enhancement of dark matter particles in halos is greatest well outside the virial radius. We confirm the theoretical expectation that even if the internal field is suppressed by the Vainshtein mechanism, the object still feels the fifth force generated by the external fields, by measuring peculiar velocities and velocity <b>dispersions</b> of <b>halos.</b> Finally, we {{investigate the}} morphology and gravity model dependence of halo spins, concentrations, and shapes...|$|R
