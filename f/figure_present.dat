6000|$|Those {{particular}} {{passengers in}} the <b>figure,</b> <b>present</b> the New Republic. It is a dissension, an inquiry, {{it is the}} vague unconsolidated matter for a new direction. [...] "We who are young," [...] says {{the spirit of the}} New Republic, [...] "we who are in earnest can no more compass our lives under these old kingships and loyalties, under these old leaders and these old traditions, constitutions and pledges, with their party liabilities, their national superstitions, their rotting banners and their accumulating legacy of feuds and lies, than we can pretend we are indeed impassioned and wholly devoted subjects of King Edward, spending our lives in the service of his will. It is not that we have revolted from these things, it is not that we have grown askew to them and that patching and amendment will serve our need; it is that we have travelled outside them altogether--almost inadvertently, but quite beyond any chance of return to a simple acceptance again. We are no more disposed to call ourselves Liberals or Conservatives and to be stirred to party passion at the clash of these names, than we are to fight again the battles of the Factio Albata or the Factio Prasina. These current dramas, these current conflicts seem scarcely less factitious. Men without faith may be content to spend their lives for things only half believed in, and for causes that are contrived. But that is not our quality. We want reality because we have faith, we seek the beginning of realism in social and political life, we seek it and we are resolved to find it." ...|$|E

This includes the complex understanding of factors such as individual temperament, parental psychopathology, and possible neurochemical predispositions.

50|$|In {{professional}} wrestling, {{a referee}} is an authority <b>figure</b> <b>present</b> {{in or near}} the ring during matches. The referee's on-stage (kayfabe) purpose {{is similar to that of}} referees in combat sports such as boxing or mixed martial arts, that is, as an arbiter of the rules and the person charged with rendering decisions. In reality, the referee is, like the wrestlers, a participant in executing a match in accordance with its script including its pre-determined outcome, and is responsible for controlling the flow of the match and for relaying information or instructions from backstage officials to the wrestlers. Like wrestlers, referees are also responsible for maintaining kayfabe, and must render decisions in accordance with the promotion's kayfabe rules.|$|E

A couple of weeks later King Shabaka rang me up and said ‘hey let’s make a record’ so we booked three days in Total Refreshment Centre studios. It all came together at an incredible speed. We played and recorded to 1/4 tape with no pre-written material. By the end of three days we had recorded hours of music.|$|E

50|$|Research on {{the topic}} of content {{expertise}} has been done in the field of medical education. Traditionally, medical education was delivered in large lecture format by content experts. In the 1960s, Problem-based learning was first introduced at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. Problem-based learning involves small groups working within a tutorial system. Students are encouraged to brainstorm within the group and generate questions based on the scenario they are working on. Problem-based learning fosters self-directed learning, with the teacher taking on a new role as a facilitator, using their expertise only subtly and sparingly. This style of learning is built on collaborative learning work theory. Students with a common interest are encouraged to reflect, share their thoughts with their peers and develop analytical thinking and communication skills during the process. The break from the true collaborative approach is in having an authority <b>figure</b> <b>present.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Koblenz {{had been}} the {{administrative}} capital of the Prussian Rhine Province since 1822. Amidst the turmoil of economic collapse, it was here that, on 15 August 1923, the [...] "United Rhenish Movement" [...] (...) was formed from a merging of several existing separatist groups. Leaders included Dorten of the [...] "Rhenish Peoples' Union" [...] (die Rheinische Volksvereinigung) and a journalist named Josef Friedrich Matthes (1886-1943) of the [...] "Rhenish Independence League" [...] (der Rheinischen Unabhängigkeitsbund) which had been founded by Josef Smeets from Cologne. Another leading <b>figure</b> <b>present</b> was Leo Deckers from Aachen. The unambiguous goal of the United Rhenish Movement was the complete separation of the Rhineland from Prussia, {{and the establishment of}} a Rhenish Republic under French protection. The creation of the republic was to be publicly proclaimed: meetings would be convened across the Rhineland. Endorsement from the French, with their military headquarters in Mainz, was taken for granted: {{it is not clear what}} thought was given to the possibility that commanders of France's junior partner in the occupation might take a less benign view of separatist activities just across the border from Belgium's Eupen enclave, west of Aachen, only recently incorporated into Belgium under the terms of the Versailles settlement.|$|E

30|$|The third {{learning}} test consisted of presenting {{a completely new}} word (e.g., Zafo) as sample, and the blank comparison, a familiar stimulus and the <b>figure</b> <b>presented</b> in the exclusion trials as the comparisons (e.g., Mido). The response indicative of learning was {{the selection of the}} blank comparison, which indicates that the participant identified the <b>figure</b> <b>presented</b> in the exclusion trial as a defined stimulus and therefore not corresponding to the new undefined name dictated in the trial. Conversely, the selection of the <b>figure</b> <b>presented</b> in the exclusion trials when presented with the undefined stimulus sample indicates that, for the participant, the figure maintained the status of undefined stimulus and that the relation between the dictated word and figure had not been established through exclusion trials.|$|R

One recommendation is that water managers must address the {{effects of climate change}} when combating cyanobacterial blooms (2). However, recent studies suggest that controlling nutrients may be more important in increasing aquatic ecosystem resilience to these blooms. Justin D. Brookes and Cayelan C. Care...|$|E

The study {{is based on the}} nature of ecological events, students' understanding in the context of meaningful learning, and the cultural context in which learning takes place. One hundred and fifty-nine Oregon students and 157 Maine students in 4 th, 8 th, and 11 th grades were interviewed using modified clinical interview techniques. Results indicate great similarity in a number of conceptual areas and misconceptions. However, there was a distinct difference in some geological and natural resource areas. These differences may be attributable to regional, geo-cultural differences between the samples. One table and one <b>figure</b> <b>present</b> study findings.

40|$|Spanish Golden Age Culture is an age {{of secrets}} and secrecy. Among its playwrights, Pedro Calderón de la Barca shows the most complex {{comprehension}} of this subject. During the entirety of his career he refers to it in numerous comedies, creates metaphors concerning different aspects of secrecy and employs it {{for the construction of}} his comedias de enredo/comedies of intrigue. In summary: Calderón has an ongoing interest in this anthropological phenomenon. The article analyses the motive of secrecy in selected plays, tragic and comic, starting with the San Secreto <b>figure</b> <b>present</b> in different plays, for example in La vida es sueño. After tracing the temporal aspect of secrecy the article ends with some thoughts about the relation between the public and the secret spheres.

40|$|While a {{great number}} of {{scholars}} have addressed Miguel de Cervantes's dramatisation of the historical fall of Numancia to Scipio Aemilianus's (185 – 129 BC) Roman army in 133 BC, Golden Age studies lack a thorough investigation of his portrayal of the individual historical characters in his play La destrucción de Numancia (c. 1583). Scipio was the most prominent historical <b>figure</b> <b>present,</b> but the portrayal of the characters Jugurta and Bariato has been virtually ignored by scholarship in relation to their historical counterparts. An analysis of Jugurtha (c. 155 – 104 BC; King of Numidia (118 – 106 BC)) and Viriatus (d. 139 BC) in comparison with Cervantes's characters reveals that he intentionally manipulated the historical information available to him in order covertly to criticise Spain's imperial policies. Rome defeated both these historical figures with unjust military tactics and deceit, thus paralleling them with the collective plight of the Numantians...|$|E
