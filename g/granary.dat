5|$|Parachute: The {{earliest}} {{primitive form}} of the parachute was made some 4,000 {{years ago when the}} Chinese noticed that air resistance would slow a person's fall from a height. The Western Han Dynasty writer Sima Qian in his book Historical Records records the story of Shun, a legendary Chinese emperor who ran away from his murderous father by climbing onto the top of a high <b>granary.</b> As there was nowhere to go, Shun grabbed two bamboo hats and leapt off the <b>granary</b> and glided downward to safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} is reenacted {{annually on}} March 5 {{under the auspices}} of the Bostonian Society. The Old State House, the massacre site, and the <b>Granary</b> Burying Ground are all part of Boston's Freedom Trail, connecting sites important in the city's revolutionary-era history.|$|E
5000|$|Elevators and <b>granaries</b> - The Company {{owns and}} uses seven modern {{elevators}} {{as well as}} <b>granaries,</b> potato and seed storage facilities with a total capacity of 650,000 tons for drying, treatment, and storage of harvest.|$|R
5000|$|These {{buildings}} {{have been built}} by Samuel Gotlieb Engelmann, a merchant, as a complex of five <b>granaries,</b> and worked for over 150 years. In February 1960, a great fire destroyed two other adjacent <b>granaries</b> close to the Fish Market (at N°13 and N°15). From this date on, the municipal authorities have re-allocated <b>granaries</b> {{for the needs of}} the District Museum [...] "Leon Wyczółkowski". Between 1998 and 2006, a general overhaul have been carried out.|$|R
50|$|Although on most baserris {{produce is}} stored inside the main building, some have {{stand-alone}} <b>granaries</b> called garai in Basque. These are small, wooden or stone-built structures on staddle stones and very reminiscent of such <b>granaries</b> {{in other parts}} of the world.|$|R
5|$|This bread retells {{your history}} … You {{were brought to}} the {{threshing}} floor of the Lord and were threshed … While awaiting catechism, you were like grain kept in the <b>granary</b> … At the baptismal font you were kneaded into a single dough. In the oven of the Holy Ghost you were baked into God's true bread.|$|E
5|$|Built for Richard Churche, {{a wealthy}} Nantwich merchant, and his wife, it {{remained}} {{in their family}} until the 20thcentury. In 1930, it was rescued from being shipped to the USA by Edgar Myott and his wife, who began restoration work. As well as a dwelling, the mansion {{has been used as}} a school, restaurant, shop, and <b>granary</b> and hay store.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the {{increased}} agricultural productivity allowed Nguyễn Ánh {{to support an}} army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state <b>granary</b> was used to facilitate the importing of supplies for military purposes. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh moved northwards and in 1802 he conquered all of Vietnam and became emperor, ruling {{under the name of}} Gia Long.|$|E
50|$|Building I {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} <b>granaries,</b> separated by a 15 ft wide space that once contained ovens. The presence of the ovens and remains of cereal indicate that this area was probably used for drying grain. It is unknown whether this area was roofed. The <b>granaries</b> themselves each measured 66 ft long (east-west) and were of a standard Roman plan, with external buttressing and with windows for ventilation. The <b>granaries</b> were rebuilt on at least one occasion.|$|R
5000|$|Sedentism of {{this time}} allowed for the {{cultivation}} of local grains, such as barley and wild oats, and for storage in <b>granaries.</b> Sites such as Dhra′ and Jericho retained a hunting lifestyle until the PPNB period, but <b>granaries</b> allowed for year-round occupation.|$|R

5|$|Most of the convents of {{the town}} have disappeared; the Dominican convent {{is the only one}} to have {{retained}} much of its original appearance. It was built in the 13th century and still has its church and cloister. The Franciscan convent was completely destroyed, apart from the choir of its church, which now serves as a Protestant church. Sélestat also has an old <b>granary</b> that belonged to the Benedictine priory, and a 16th-century commandery built by the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|The Bailey lies to {{the south}} of the walled Inner Court and was {{originally}} topped by a wooden palisade and earthworks, of which only the latter survive. The Bailey would have entered from an eastern gate and contained a range of buildings, probably including a Sergeant's Chamber, a Knights' Chamber, the Great Stable, barns and a <b>granary.</b> Modern visitors to the castle enter the complex through the Bailey from the south, which also contains the modern car park for the castle.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is home to}} the Museum of Matija Skurjeni (opened in 1984), {{a gallery}} of works by the renowned painter. It is located in the former <b>granary</b> of Novi Dvori. The art gallery Razvid, that opened in 1991, has held {{exhibitions}} of works by many important Croatian artists, such as Franjo Ferenčak, Ivan Lovrenčić, Drago Grgas, Davor Vuković (a native of Zaprešić) and Krešimir Trumbetaš.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bristol's {{architecture}} is the Bristol Byzantine style. Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style {{was used in}} the construction of factories, warehouses and municipal buildings built in the Victorian era. Surviving examples include the Colston Hall, the <b>Granary</b> on Welsh Back, and the Gloucester Road Carriage Works, along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the Arnolfini, which now houses an art gallery. Clarks Wood Company warehouse, the St Vincent's Works in Silverthorne Lane, and the Wool Hall in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's {{economic}} health rested primarily on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching {{as far north as}} Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the Empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large <b>granary</b> on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.|$|E
5|$|In 1655 the Massachusetts {{assembly}} {{passed a}} law requiring its governor to live closer to Boston; this was probably done in response to Endecott's sixth consecutive election as governor. Endecott was consequently obliged to acquire a residence in Boston; although he returned to Salem frequently, Boston became his home {{for the rest of}} his life. Endecott died in Boston on 15 March 1664/5. Although early accounts claim he was buried at Boston's King's Chapel, later evidence has identified his burial site as tomb 189 in the <b>Granary</b> Burying Ground.|$|E

5|$|Other public {{relations}} blunders {{in the run-up}} to the campaign included the distribution of a number of Easter eggs containing traces of nuts without nut allergy warnings, a £5 million campaign for Trident chewing gum which was cancelled after complaints that it was offensive, and the temporary closure of <b>Granary</b> Burying Ground, a historic cemetery near Boston, United States, as a result of a treasure hunt organised as a sales promotion. In mid-2007, Cadbury announced that it would be cutting around 7,500jobs. An internal memo which later leaked revealed that many of the jobs would be moved to Poland, causing an outcry from the manufacturers' trade unions.|$|E
5|$|The French {{soldiers}} {{charged with}} holding the citadel soon became stretched by the guerrilla {{attacks on the}} military installation. De Genouilly had decided to withdraw some of his forces back to central Vietnam. In addition, the inland position of the French forces lessened their technological advantage. As a result, the French decided to evacuate and destroy the fort. This was achieved on March 8. Captain Deroulede used 32 chests of explosives. He also razed the citadel by setting the rice <b>granary</b> ablaze, along with the weapons and munitions. The resulting fire was improbably claimed to have smoldered for a further three years. The French withdrew {{to the outskirts of}} the city, before returning to central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward is {{guarded by}} four large {{circular}} towers. Over time these acquired various names: in 1343, clockwise from the north-east, {{they were called}} Le Prisontour, Turris Ultra Gardinium, Le Wedercoktour and Le Chapeltour, but by 1564 they had been renamed the Debtors', Mortimer, Bronwen and Armourer's Towers respectively. Le Prisontour incorporated a dungeon and the Le Chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in the 16th century. Several ranges of buildings were built around the inner ward, including a chapel, kitchen, service buildings, a <b>granary</b> and a great hall. The battlements may originally have been built with triple finials {{in a similar fashion}} to Conwy, although little remains of these in the modern era.|$|E
50|$|Parish <b>granaries</b> (sockenmagasin, pitäjänmakasiini) were {{communal}} <b>granaries</b> {{established in}} Sweden and Finland during the 18th and 19th century. They were built for storing grains {{in case of}} poor harvest or crop failure. Farmers could borrow seeds at low rates of interest and the possible profit {{was used for the}} poor.|$|R

5|$|The {{massacre}} was {{remembered in}} 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, an African American abolitionist {{who saw the}} death of Crispus Attucks {{as an opportunity to}} demonstrate the role of African Americans in the Revolutionary War. Partly because of this activism, artwork commemorating the massacre was produced that changed the color of a victim's skin to black (which in Revere's original engraving was white) to emphasize Attucks' claimed martyrdom. In 1888, a monument was erected on the Boston Common to the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims, along with Christopher Seider, were reinterred in a prominent grave in the <b>Granary</b> Burying Ground.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{withering}} fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, {{where his}} men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French {{for nearly an}} hour. Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry poured into the village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the <b>granary</b> was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions {{in the second and}} third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th {{century the}} Lower Ward was rebuilt in stone by Reynold Mohun; this {{was paid for}} in part by Reynold {{commuting}} his tenants' ongoing duty to repair the castle walls into a single, one-off financial payment to their lord, and partially through his marriage to a rich local heiress. A survey of the castle in 1266 described the Upper Ward {{on the top of}} the motte as containing a hall with a buttery, a pantry, a kitchen, a bakehouse, the chapel of Saint Stephen and a knight's hall, guarded by three towers. The Lower Ward included a <b>granary,</b> two towers and a gatehouse; one of the towers, called the Fleming Tower, was used as a prison. The castle stables lay outside the defences, further down the slope. By the end of the 13th century some of the castle's roofing had been covered in lead, while other parts still used wooden shingles.|$|E
