5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Whitlam {{was seen as}} a {{leadership}} contender once the existing Labor leaders exited the scene. Most of the party's major figures, including Evatt, Deputy Leader Arthur Calwell, Eddie Ward, and Reg Pollard, were in their sixties, twenty years older than Whitlam. In 1960, after losing three elections, Evatt resigned and was replaced by Calwell, with Whitlam defeating Ward for deputy leader. Calwell came within a handful of votes of winning the cliffhanger 1961 election. He <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> Whitlam as deputy leader, and believed Labor would have won if Ward had been in the position.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement. The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. Carter <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E
5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862. He did not want the {{responsibility}} of the position and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit {{was the only one of}} the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.|$|E

5|$|The family {{received}} the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from the video that it was all right to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to attend the funeral.|$|E
5|$|Lenin <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to return}} to the Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E

25|$|In September 1916 Lloyd George, now Secretary of State for War, {{visited the}} Western Front and asked Wilson (he had already put the same {{questions}} to Foch) why the British had performed so much more poorly than the French on the Somme.

25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to do a sequel to Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day {{by a team of}} lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and just seems to have come out of nowhere.|$|E
25|$|On 17 May, Colebatch resigned, {{having been}} premier for exactly one month. It remains the state's {{shortest}} premiership term on record. His decision to resign {{was influenced by}} the stress of the wharf crisis and extensive subsequent criticism. However his health was an issue, and he had been unable to find a Legislative Assembly seat in a country electorate as desired. H.G.P. Colebatch (2004) also asserts that Colebatch resigned as premier because he was not ambitious and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> the job in the first place.|$|E

25|$|By 1966, however, it {{was clear}} that Hartnell's health was {{affecting}} his performances, and {{that he would not be}} able to carry on playing the Doctor for a long period of time. By this point Savory had moved on as Head of Serials and his successor, Shaun Sutton, was more agreeable to change, allowing Wiles' replacement, Innes Lloyd, to make many of the very changes that Wiles had been barred from. Lloyd discussed the situation with Hartnell and the actor agreed that it would be best to leave, although later in life he would claim that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to go.|$|E
25|$|In May 1945 Peres married Sonya Gelman, {{whom he had}} met in the Ben Shemen Youth Village, {{where her}} father served as a {{carpentry}} teacher. The couple married after Sonya finished her military service as a truck driver in the British Army during World War II. Through the years Sonya chose {{to stay away from}} the media and keep her privacy and the privacy of her family, despite her husband's extensive political career. Sonya Peres was unable to attend Shimon's 2007 presidential inauguration ceremony because of ill health. With the election of Peres for president, Sonya Peres, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> her husband to accept the position, announced that she would stay in the couple's apartment in Tel Aviv and not join her husband in Jerusalem. The couple thereafter lived separately. She died on January 20, 2011, aged 87, from heart failure at her apartment in Tel Aviv.|$|E
25|$|The Naval Staff angst {{that had}} been a feature of the Chevaline project {{surfaced}} here too. For several reasons the Navy <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> Chevaline and had actively lobbied against it. Their preference for Poseidon was in large part based on commonality of equipment. Polaris was being phased out of use by the US Navy and supplies of spares and repair facilities were becoming unavailable. To keep the Polaris missile in use in the UK meant that some production lines had to be re-opened at great cost to supply a very small force. A missile common to both navies was desirable, and the Naval Staff strongly argued against Chevaline. Although the papers will not be declassified for some time yet, {{it seems likely that the}} Naval Staff made the same case with Trident with some success when their influence was at its height after the Falklands War.|$|E

Both Lynott's mother, Philomena Lynott, and Thin Lizzy lead guitarist Scott Gorham criticised its use, suggesting that Lynott would <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> his music used for any political use, including endorsing politicians, and furthermore would likely have objected to the policies of Ryan and his running mate Mitt Romney.|$|R

25|$|In May 1988, Zia {{dissolved}} the assemblies {{and called}} a November election. He <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> Bhutto to win, and {{his choice of}} date may have been deliberately chosen {{to coincide with the}} date when Bhutto was projected to give birth, thus hindering her ability to campaign. He also sought to hinder her chances by declaring that the election would be held on a non-party basis, with candidates standing as individuals rather than as representatives of a political party. Bhutto and the PPP launched a legal challenge against this latter stipulation. In August, Zia suddenly died when his aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from Bahawalpur Airport. A joint U.S.-Pakistani investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of the crash, although sabotage was widely suspected. After his death, the Supreme Court announced that the election should take place on a party basis, rather than the non-party basis that Zia had desired. Bhutto insisted that the PPP campaign separately from the MRD, and dropped its socialist platform in favour of economic Thatcherism and a commitment to the free market. Amid predictions that the PPP would win, it received 18,000 prospective candidates, many offering the party money for their selection; this influx of new members and candidates caused upset among many established members, who felt that Bhutto was deserting them.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February, Captain Winecoff {{received}} {{a message from}} Colonel Barrow, 9th Marines Commanding Officer, {{to set up an}} ambush along Route 922. The Captain's men needed rest, and he requested a postponement but was denied by Colonel Barrow. The Captain utilized his 1st and 2nd Platoons, and at 16:10, 1st Platoon moved out and made its way to 2nd Platoon's position. At 18:30, Winecoff briefed his men on the ambush. After dark they moved out towards route 922, about 900 meters away. By 01:00, Captain Winecoff and Hotel Company were in place and setting up the ambush. Within minutes of getting into position they started hearing trucks coming down the road and continued to observe as 40 minutes later, a lone truck and one PAVN soldier also walked through the kill zone. Winecoff <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> the ambush sprung on one truck or soldier, realizing that eventually a bigger target would come down the road. At 02:30, the lights of eight trucks appeared, and as three trucks came into the kill zone the column of vehicles stopped. Not wanting to give away the ambush or their position Winecoff, set off the claymores and the ambush. The Marines poured small arms and automatic weapons fire on the three vehicles, the forward observer alerted the artillery, and rounds bracketed the company position.|$|E
25|$|Somba Opu {{proved a}} strong fort to be defeated. The attackers {{suffered}} 50 dead and 68 wounded, {{among them were}} several Dutch and native officers. On 22 June, after a 6 days of continuous rain, Arung Palakka decided to led his Bugis, Bacan and Ambon soldiers to enter the breach in the wall. The attack by Arung Palakka was fierce, forcing the Somba Opu warriors to abandon the breach as the Bugis and their allies breached in. Despite the rain, the Bugis managed to set up fire to force the Makassar soldiers to retreat from the eastern and western bastions of the citadel. The Makassar soldiers reestablish their defenses at the southern half of Somba Opu. During the retreat, the Makassar soldiers utilized the largest cannon of Somba Opu, the Anak Mangkasar ("Child of Makassar"), which was heaved {{over the side of}} the northwestern bastion. As the Dutch-Bugis army advanced from the west, a report came mentioning that the Makassar forces had fled and abandoned Somba Opu. Sultan Hasanuddin of the Makassar force <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to leave but the flames, fanned by a strong northwesterly wind, forced him to leave. The only Makassarese within the fort were Karaeng Karunrung who remained in the palace surrounded by his kris-wielding followers. The people inside the mosque had also been driven out, only the Malay wife of Datu Soppeng, and all her children, plus 80 of her retinue remained.|$|E

25|$|The most {{well-known}} of his literary jabs at Boulstred is his “Epigram on the Court Pucell,” which many critics call a “disturbingly ‘personal’ {{attack on a}} woman.” Jonson supposedly wrote this poem {{as a response to}} a criticism Boulstred made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out of his pocket when he was drunk and given to Boulstred, which he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to happen. Regarding the title of the poem, “pucell” was the early modern term for prostitute, so Jonson seems to be calling Boulstred a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses Boulstred of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and much more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Boulstred, the work was meant to be one of a “generic court pucelle, and by that means, an image of the false world.” Yet another reading is that the poem is a representation of Jonson’s frustration with having to rely on a woman, like the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent “inversion of traditional gender codes,” so he used the “trope of prostitution” in this poem to reassert his position of power as a male.|$|E
