40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that many hoverfly species (Diptera: Syrphidae) mimic the morphological appearance of defended Hymenoptera, such as wasps and bees. However, {{it has also been}} repeatedly suggested that some mimetic hoverflies respond with sounds on attack that resemble the warning or startle sounds of their hymenopteran models. In this study, we set out to quantitatively compare the spectral characteristics of the sounds produced by a range of nonmimetic flies, wasps, bumblebees, honeybees, and their <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimics</b> when they were artificially attacked. The sounds made by wasps and honeybees after simulated attacks were statistically distinguishable from their <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimics.</b> Bumblebee models of their <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimics</b> share some similarities in the sound they produce on attack, but they were no closer acoustically to their model than a range of other hoverfly species that morphologically resemble other models. All the mimetic hoverflies tested in this study tended to sound similar to one another, regardless of the model they resemble morphologically. Overall, we found little evidence that mimetic hoverflies sound like their hymenopteran models on attack, and we question whether acoustic mimicry has evolved in this complex.

25|$|<b>Hoverfly</b> <b>mimics</b> {{can be seen}} {{in almost}} any garden in the {{temperate}} zone. The Syrphidae are a large (5600+ species) family of flies; their imagoes feed on nectar and pollen, and are well known for their mimicry of social hymenoptera. The mimicry is Batesian in nature: hoverflies are palatable but hymenoptera are generally unpalatable and may also be protected by stingers and/or armour.|$|R
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimics</b> a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|R
25|$|Observers in {{a garden}} can see for {{themselves}} that <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimics</b> are quite common, usually many times more common than the models, and are (to our sight) relatively poor mimics, often easy to distinguish from real wasps. However, it {{has been established in}} other cases that imperfect mimicry can confer significant advantage to the mimic, especially if the model is really noxious. Also, not only is polymorphism absent from these mimics, it is absent in the wasps also: these facts are presumably connected.|$|R
50|$|Mimicry: Many {{species have}} the trait known as mimicry which allows {{normally}} harmless creatures to appear dangerous. Harmless hoverflies are {{an example of}} a species that exhibits mimicry. <b>Hoverflies</b> <b>mimic</b> the look and sound of wasps. Though most of them resemble the wasps very closely, others barely pass as looking like the wasps. In order to solve this Darwinian puzzle of why certain hoverflies do not resemble the wasps closely, Canadian researchers conducted a study. In this study the researchers determined that larger hoverflies will closely resemble the wasps where the smaller species barely mimic them. This was determined to be due to the larger species having a greater threat of being attacked by birds. The smaller species do {{not have to worry about}} closely impersonating the wasps as much because the birds will not even bother to try to attack them due to their size. Since the larger hoverflies impersonate the wasps, they will have a greater chance of surviving and will therefore increase their fitness.|$|R
40|$|Synopsis The {{effect of}} wing {{flexibility}} in hoverflies was investigated using an at-scale mechanical model. Unlike dynamically-scaled models, an at-scale model can include all phenomena related to motion and deformation {{of the wing}} during flapping. For this purpose, an at-scale polymer wing <b>mimicking</b> a <b>hoverfly</b> was fabricated using a custom micromolding process. The wing has venation and corrugation profiles which mimic those of a hoverfly wing and the measured flexural stiffness of the artificial wing is {{comparable to that of}} the natural wing. To emulate the torsional flexibility at the wing-body joint, a discrete flexure hinge was created. A range of flexure stiffnesses was chosen to match the torsional stiffness of pronation and supination in a hoverfly wing. The polymer wing was compared with a rigid, flat, carbon-fiber wing using a flapping mechanism driven by a piezoelectric actuator. Both wings exhibited passive rotation around the wing hinge; however, these rotations were reduced {{in the case of the}} compliant polymer wing due to chordwise deformations during flapping which caused a reduced effective angle of attack. Maximum lift was achieved when the stiffness of the hinge was similar to that of a hoverfly in both wing cases and the magnitude of measured lift is sufficient for hovering; the maximum lift achieved by the single polymer and carbon-fiber wings was 5. 9 10 2 mN and 6. 9 10 2 mN, respectively. These results suggest that hoverflies could exploit intrinsic compliances to generate desired motions of the wing and that, for the same flapping motions, a rigid wing could be more suitable for producing large lift.

40|$|Batesian mimicry, {{in which}} a {{harmless}} mimic resembles a more aversive model, can encompass {{a wide range of}} morphological traits, but the resemblance is never perfect. Previous studies have used abstract “prey” designs to show that differences in certain traits may not be relevant to mimicry if they are not perceived or recognized by a predator. Here, we extend these results by examining how human “predators” respond to realistic variation in traits of aposematic wasps and their <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimics.</b> We measured the ability of humans to discriminate between images of wasps and hoverflies in which only certain traits were visible, to determine the contributions of those traits to discrimination decisions. We found that shape is a particularly useful and easily learnt trait for separating the two taxa. Subjects did not successfully discriminate on the basis of abdominal patterns, despite those containing useful information. Color similarity between wasps and hoverflies is relatively high in comparison with other traits, suggesting that selection has acted more strongly on color. Our findings demonstrate the importance of consideration of natural variation in the traits of prey and their salience to predators for understanding the evolution of prey defenses...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{similarity}} between Batesian mimics and their models varies widely and occurs across {{a range of}} sensory modalities. We use three complementary experimental paradigms to investigate acoustic mimicry in hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) which mimic stinging Hymenoptera. First, we analyse sounds made by 13 hoverfly species and 9 Hymenoptera species with and without simulated predation (“alarm” and “flight” sounds, respectively). We demonstrate that the bumblebees Bombus terrestris, B. hortorum, and B. lucorum, and the hoverfly Cheilosia illustrata exhibit alarm sounds that are significantly different to their respective flight sounds, and indistinguishable between species. We then demonstrate that the B. terrestris alarm sound reduces predation on artificial prey by wild birds, but that the <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimic</b> alarm sound does not. Finally, we trained chicks to avoid distasteful food in the presence of different acoustic stimuli. Overall the chicks showed no difference in response to bee and hoverfly stimuli, demonstrating no innate aversion to the Bombus alarm sound. We therefore conclude that (i) similarity of acoustic signals exists among Hymenoptera and hoverflies, (ii) acoustic aposematic signals (but not the almost identical mimetic signals) are effective at reducing predation, and (iii) wild birds exhibit learned rather than innate aversion to certain acoustic stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>hoverflies</b> (Syrphidae) <b>mimic</b> wasps or bees through colour or {{behavioural}} adaptations. The {{relationship between}} phenotypic variation in colour pattern and mimetic perfection (as determined by pigeons) {{was investigated in}} three species of Müllerian mimics (Vespula spp.) and 10 Batesian <b>hoverfly</b> <b>mimics,</b> plus two non-mimetic species of flies. Four predictions were tested: (i) Batesian mimics might be imperfect {{because they are in}} the process of evolving towards perfection, hence there should be a positive relationship between variation and imperfection; (ii) some Batesian mimics are imperfect because they do not have the appropriate genetic variation to improve and have evolved to be as good as possible, hence there should be no differences between species, all displaying a low level of variation; (iii) very common hoverflies should show the highest levels of variation because they outnumber their models, resulting in high predation and a breakdown in the mimetic relationship; and (iv) social wasps (Vespula) have such a powerful defence that anything resembling a wasp, both Müllerian and perfect Batesian mimics, would be avoided, resulting in relaxed selection and high variance. Poor mimics may still evolve to resemble wasps as well as possible and display lower levels of variation. The data only provided support for the fourth prediction. The Müllerian mimics, one of the most perfect Batesian mimics, and the non-mimetic flies displayed much higher levels of variation than the other species of Batesian mimics...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with Batesian mimicry in British Syrphidae (Diptera), and examines {{the question of whether}} the ifies gain protection from mimicry. Batesian mimicry is the resemblance of a palatable animal (the mimic) to a distasteful or otherwise protected animal (the model), such that protection is gained by the <b>mimic.</b> Syrphidae (<b>hoverflies)</b> are colourfUl but defenceless insects which often resemble members of the Hymenoptera. This study provides evidence that certain species of hoverfly gain protection from their resemblance to Hymenoptera. In collaboration with Liverpool Museum the British Syrphidae were matched by eye to presumed model Hymenoptera. Once presumed model/mimic pairs had been suggested, a comprehensive survey of three sites in the north west of England was undertaken during 1994. Each site was visited once a week and counts were made of all Syrphidae and Hymenoptera on three plots at each site. Mean frequencies of models and mimics were compared, and it was found that mimics usually occurred when. models were present, and models were usually more abundant than the mimics; the data were also analysed usingan analysis of variance, and it was found that for most species tested there was a significant covariance between the mimic and presumed model numbers. Survey work in 1994 and 1995 showed that bumble bee mimics follow model rank order on each site, but not on all individual habitat plots. One aspect of fly behaviour of a bumble bee mimic was also studied (time spent feeding on flowers) and compared to other hoverifies and the presumed model. The results showed that the time the mimic spent on flowers was not the same as that of the presumed model. In the quest to understand hoverfly predation, immunological techniques are developed to test wild bird blood for evidence of antibodies against hymenopteran venom. The theory is that birds which have learned though a nasty experience that a particular colour pattern is distastefUl will also avoid other similar patterns, i. e. Wa bird is stung by a wasp it may not predate a hoverfly resembling the wasp. The main conclusion is that there are specific and non-specific mimics, and that nonspecific mimics significantly covary with model numbers, but specific mimics do not, which is not what one might have predicted if these hoverilies really do gain protection through Batesian mimicry. Also, it is possible to detect an immune response against wasp venom in birds and a method has been developed to embark on field trials in the future...|$|R
40|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{evolution}} of imperfect mimicry are reviewed. Their relevance to the colours patterns of hoverflies (Diptera, Syrphidae) are discussed in detail. Most {{if not all of}} the hoverflies labelled as mimetic actually are mimics. The apparently poor nature of their resemblance does not prevent them from obtaining at least some protection from suitably experienced birds. Mimicry is a dominant theme of this very large family of Diptera, with at least a quarter of all species in Europe being mimetic. <b>Hoverfly</b> <b>mimics</b> fall into three major groups according to their models, involving bumblebees, honeybees and social wasps. There are striking differences in the general levels of mimetic fidelity and relative abundances of the three groups, with accurate mimicry, low abundance and polymorphism characterizing the bumblebee mimics: {{more than half of all}} the species of bumblebee mimics are polymorphic. Mimics of social wasps tend to be poor mimics, have high relative abundance, and polymorphism is completely absent. Bumblebee models fall into a small number of Muellerian mimicry rings which are very different between the Palaearctic and Nearctic regions. Social wasps and associated models form one large Muellerian complex. Together with honeybees, these complexes probably form real clusters of forms as perceived by many birds. All three groups of syrphid mimics contain both good and poor mimics; some mimics are remarkably accurate, and have close morphological and behavioural resemblance. At least some apparently 'poor' mimetic resemblances may be much closer in birds' perception than we imagine, and more work needs to be done on this. Bumblebees are the least noxious and wasps the most noxious of the three main model groups. The basis of noxiousness is different, with bumblebees being classified as non-food, whereas honeybees and wasps are nasty-tasting and (rarely) stinging. The distribution of mimicry is exactly what would be expected from this ordering, with polymorphic and accurate forms being a key feature of mimics of the least noxious models, while highly noxious models have poor-quality mimicry. Even if the high abundance of many syrphid mimics relative to their models is a recent artefact of man-made environmental change, this does not preclude these species from being mimics. It seems unlikely that bird predation actually controls the populations of adult syrphids. Being rare relative to a model may have promoted or accelerated {{the evolution of}} perfect mimicry: theoretically this might account for the pattern of rare good mimics and abundant poor ones, but the idea is intrinsically unlikely. Many mimics seem to have hour-to-hour abundances related to those of their models, presumably as a result of behavioural convergence. We need to know much more about the psychology of birds as predators. There are at least four processes that need elucidating: (a) learning about the noxiousness of models; (b) the erasing of that learning through contact with mimics (extinction, or learned forgetting); (c) forgetting; (d) deliberate risk-taking and the physiological states that promote it. Johnston's (2002) model of the stabilization of imperfect mimicry by kin selection is unlikely to account for the colour patterns of hoverflies. Sherratt's (2002) model of the influence of multiple models potentially accounts for all the patterns of hoverfly mimicry, and is the most promising avenue for testing...|$|R
