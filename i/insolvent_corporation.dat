40|$|Although {{the power}} of the English Court of Chancery to appoint {{receivers}} is 2 ̆ 2 one of the oldest remedies 2 ̆ 2 of that Court and although {{some of the most important}} questions arising in the whole field of commercial law concern the liquidation of <b>insolvent</b> <b>corporations</b> by receivers, many portions of the law of receivers remain curiously unsettled. This is particularly so as to the question of claims provable against the assets in the hands of a receiver. Thus in Connecticut the Aetna Indemnity Company has been in process of liquidation by receivers since early in 1911, but it is only now that the law has been partially settled by two recent decisions in these proceedings: Bashford-Burmister Company v. Aetna Indemnity Company (1919, Conn.) 105 At. 470; Husbandsv. Aetna Indemnity Company (1919, Conn.) 105 Atl. 480...|$|R
50|$|In 1991, P. D. W. & A., Inc., an <b>insolvent</b> <b>corporation</b> taxed under Subchapter S, {{excluded}} {{its entire}} discharge of indebtedness amount from its gross income. David Gitlitz and other shareholders were assessed tax deficiencies because {{they used the}} untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in S corporation stock and to deduct suspended losses. Eventually, the Tax Court held that Gitlitz could not use the S corporation's untaxed discharge of indebtedness to increase their basis in corporate stock. In affirming, the Court of Appeals held that the discharge of indebtedness amount first had {{to be used to}} reduce certain tax attributes of the S corporation and that only the leftover amount could be used to increase their basis. Gitlitz appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court decided to hear the case.|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{importance}} of the subject it is unfortunate that so few of the reported cases on equitable receiverships of corporations have dealt in any comprehensive way with the principles underlying the administrating of the fund for the benefit of creditors. The result is that controversy has outstripped authoritative decision, and the subject is unsettled. To this generalization an exception must be noted in respect of the special topic of the application of current railway income to current expenses, before the payment of mortgage indebtedness. On another disputed topic, the provability of immature claims, the law, or at least the right principle of decision, has been settled, by the notable opinion of Judge Noyes in Pennsylvania Steel Company v. New York City Railway Company, followed and reinforced by that of Mr. Justice Holmes in William Filene 2 ̆ 7 s Sons Company v. Weed. Notwithstanding these important exceptions, the dearth of authority on the general subject is such that Judge Noyes refers to a case cited in his opinion as 2 ̆ 2 almost the only case in which rules have 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 been formulated with respect to the provability of claims against 2 ̆ 2 <b>insolvent</b> <b>corporations.</b> 2 ̆ 72 ̆...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{suggests}} {{that such a}} proposal will harmonize the bankruptcy policy of rehabilitating financially distressed corporations with the tax policy of ensuring that true economic income is subject to federal income taxation. 27 Parts II and III of this Article will trace the common law evolution of the stock-for-debt exception and its statutory codification in 1980, with particular emphasis on the stated policy justifications for the exception. Part IV will then examine {{the history of the}} repeal of the stock-for-debt exception, demonstrating that the repeal was the result of hasty political maneuvering rather than reasoned legislative decision-making. In Part V, the Article will first explore the exception 2 ̆ 7 s critical role in realizing the fundamental rehabilitative goals of chapter 11 bankruptcy and will justify the exception under both bankruptcy and tax theory. It will propose the reinstatement of the stock-for-debt exception for <b>insolvent</b> <b>corporations</b> and those in bankruptcy, and will resolve three tax issues relating to the exception that remained unanswered {{at the time that the}} exception was repealed. The Article will conclude that reinstating the stock-for-debt exception will improve the success rate of chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganizations and reduce the devastating economic impact of corporate liquidations...|$|R
40|$|These volumes {{deal with}} {{a branch of the}} law where there has been great need of further {{analysis}} and discussion. Receivership law concerns extremely important questions, such as those connected with the liquidation of <b>insolvent</b> <b>corporations</b> by receivers. Yet there has been no authoritative work upon the subject with the exception of High, even the last edition of which was published before much important litigation arose. The present work seems adequately to accomplish the writer 2 ̆ 7 s purpose. It is encyclopedic rather than analytic in form. As such it has many commendable features. Especially helpful are the forms collected in the second volume, being selections from actual cases, though a more careful editing of and exclusion of extraneous detail from the forms reproduced would have saved much valuable space without detracting from the usefulness of this portion of the work. The index is extraordinarily complete and is very conveniently arranged, far more so than is usual in law text books. The chapters on the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Alien Property Custodian are interesting, although it is rather hard to see how these subjects elucidate the general subject of receivers. And the citation of cases seems to be as reasonably complete as could be expected. It is true there are some notable omissions. For instance the important decisions in New York in connection with the receiverships of the Metropolitan Surety Company aid of the Empire State Surety Company, and in Connecticut in connection with the receivership of the Aetna Indemnity Company, are either only barely mentioned or else omitted altogether. It is a pleasure to see the opinion of Judge Noyes of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second District, in The Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. New York City R. R. (1912) 198 Fed. 721, 736, on the subject of provable claims against receivers, given the prominence it deserves, but in all fairness the opposing authority should have been fully stated...|$|R
50|$|The Prudential re-entered the Irish market {{under its}} own name, then sold their second Irish {{operation}} to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland (ICI). Allied Irish Banks took over Insurance Corporation of Ireland. Shortly afterwards, the general insurance company became <b>insolvent.</b> The Insurance <b>Corporation</b> of Ireland Life (ICI Life) was the Life Assurance subsidiary of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. The Government of Ireland wrote off the debts of Insurance Corporation of Ireland and sold the ICI Life arm as a profitable going concern to Prudential. Prudential Life operated in Ireland until its acquisition by Irish Permanent Building Society. The life office then traded as Progressive Life. In 1999, Irish Life Assurance plc and the Irish Permanent Building Society merged to form the Irish Life and Permanent Group, and the operations of Progressive Life and Irish Life Assurance were merged.|$|R
40|$|Banking law and {{bankruptcy}} law clash. This is most evident when a {{bank holding company}} (parent company) becomes insolvent after it has made an asset transfer to its financially troubled bank subsidiary. The Bankruptcy Code (Code) governs the insolvency proceedings of the bank holding company. Predictably, the parent company 2 ̆ 7 s trustee, appointed {{for the protection of}} all the creditors of the bankrupt entity, uses the fraudulent conveyance provision of the Code to have any asset transfers that were made to the bank subsidiary returned to the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s estate. The good faith exception to that provision will protect the asset transfer only if the parent company made the transfer for “good and fair consideration. ” The banking laws govern the regulation of the entire banking industry, including the insolvency of a financial institution. The banking laws, arguably, provide preferential treatment for the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund as a failed financial institution 2 ̆ 7 s potentially largest unsecured creditor. Banking law allows the parent company to make an asset transfer to avoid the threat of mandated restrictions. It also gives an unfulfilled payment a priority status in bankruptcy. The rules do not state, however, under what circumstances an unfunded capital obligation ought to be allowed. The legality of the asset transfer when a parent company seeks bankruptcy protection is a crucial question for the banking industry. Part II of the article identifies the statutory basis for the dormant conflict between Titles 11 and 12. Specifically, this section lists the broad array of somewhat identical discretionary powers that both the bankruptcy court and the banking regulatory agencies have as trustee and receiver for <b>insolvent</b> <b>corporations</b> and financial institutions, respectively. Part II concludes with an analysis of the cases in which these discretionary powers of the trustee and the receiver have come into conflict. Part III discusses the bankruptcy of the Bank of New England Corporation (BNEC). The factual history of this case provides an example of the types of legal issues that an insolvent holding company faces under the banking laws when it files for protection under the Bankruptcy Code. The section ends by specifying post-BNE legislative reforms designed to address issues raised during the liquidation of that failed enterprise. Part IV identifies the statutory rights that creditors have under the fraudulent conveyance law, including the good faith exception. Finally, Part V proposes an amendment to the current regulatory scheme that would require asset transfers from an insolvent holding company. It posits that the policies supporting the good faith exception are not compromised by the concomitant goal of protecting the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund. The banking enterprise exception establishes a procedure for regulatory assets transfers that is reviewable by the bankruptcy court, and operates as a credit against cross-guarantee liability. The proposed change will more closely merge the policies and purposes of the two schemes that converge when a bank holding company becomes insolvent...|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, at just 20 years old, Peizer was {{recruited}} by Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and {{was believed to}} be the youngest associate during that era. In 1983 he {{was recruited}} by First Boston, where Peizer instantly became the most profitable high yield bond trader. He was occasionally referred to as the [...] "Michael Milken of the East Coast", as he provided Drexel Burnham Lambert clients with an alternative to the Milken controlled High Yield Bond market. During his time at First Boston, Peizer led the first financing for a little known reverse merger company, Danaher Inc. Today Danaher is one of America's largest industrial companies. Peizer's most notable work while at First Boston came in 1984 when Peizerled the restructuring and financing of Ted Turner's <b>insolvent</b> Turner Broadcasting <b>Corporation</b> which specifically capitalized Turner Broadcasting Corp's CNN and WTBS Super Station with $185 Million; thereby saving it from bankruptcy.|$|R
