5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than <b>heterosexual</b> women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than <b>heterosexual</b> women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than <b>heterosexual</b> women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although <b>heterosexual</b> women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. <b>Heterosexual</b> arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first <b>heterosexual</b> encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early <b>heterosexual</b> activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, <b>heterosexual</b> sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as well because the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and {{allowing}} the <b>heterosexual</b> clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments {{would have been a}} violation of that ordinance.|$|E
50|$|In Bowers, the Attorney General of Georgia had {{conceded that}} the sodomy law could not be applied to married <b>heterosexuals,</b> given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut. Justice John Paul Stevens had {{observed}} in his Bowers dissent that Eisenstadt v. Baird had extended Griswold to unmarried <b>heterosexuals,</b> so the sodomy law should not apply to unmarried <b>heterosexuals</b> either.|$|R

25|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{separate}} dissent {{that focused on}} the selective enforcement of the law against homosexuals. The Georgia statute could not be applied to married <b>heterosexuals,</b> as consensual sexual activity within the bounds of marriage was protected under Griswold v. Connecticut. Nor could the law be applied to unmarried <b>heterosexuals,</b> as Eisenstadt v. Baird had extended Griswold to unmarried people. Since <b>heterosexuals</b> could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.|$|R
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants {{were more likely to report}} having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the <b>heterosexual</b> participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their <b>heterosexual</b> counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than <b>heterosexual</b> and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than <b>heterosexual</b> participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike <b>heterosexual</b> relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than <b>heterosexual</b> ones.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to <b>heterosexual</b> women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than <b>heterosexual</b> women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that <b>heterosexual</b> men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Hercules, in {{previous}} {{works such as}} Hercules: Fall of an Avenger and X-Treme X-Men have been portrayed as bisexual. However, Marvel’s editor-in-chief Axel Alonso stated that Hercules in the new series will be <b>heterosexual,</b> which disappointed fans and critics for “straightwashing” an LGBT character.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and <b>heterosexual</b> women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than <b>heterosexual</b> women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E

5|$|The {{focus of}} this debate often centers on a {{phenomenon}} named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than <b>heterosexual</b> or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from <b>heterosexual</b> to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} {{going back}} at least to Menander (Fr. 258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs for love of Phaon, a ferryman. This is regarded as unhistorical by modern scholars, perhaps invented by the comic poets or originating from a misreading of a first-person reference in a non-biographical poem. The legend may have resulted in part from a desire to assert Sappho as <b>heterosexual.</b>|$|E

5|$|In general, {{speculative}} fiction {{on television}} and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality.
