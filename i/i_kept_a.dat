500|$|From medieval times, beagle {{was used}} as a generic {{description}} for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood [...] at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a [...] "pocket" [...] or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and {{it is possible that the}} two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: [...] Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.|$|E

6000|$|In his chamber, he said: [...] "First, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> journal; then by and by, after years, I {{took the}} journal {{and turned it}} into a book. How long ago that was!" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> eye on Orlick {{after that}} night, and, {{whenever}} circumstances were favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that demonstration. He had struck root in Joe's establishment, {{by reason of}} my sister's sudden fancy for him, or I should have {{tried to get him}} dismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I had reason to know thereafter.|$|R

60|$|MANGAN. Not out of ill-nature, you know. And you'll {{admit that}} <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> job {{for him when}} I had {{finished}} with him. But business is business; and I ruined him {{as a matter of}} business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] with a lowered voice, coolly {{opening and}} {{shutting}} his little door, [...] "only this: when <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> toy-stand {{at the fair}} in Cincinnati last month, I sold more than one old man a child's rattle." ...|$|E
60|$|They were half-wild, {{starving}} beasts, {{and though}} utter cowards, yet where {{nine or ten}} of them get together they will mob and kill and eat an English dog. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> whip with a long lash for them.|$|E

60|$|I got {{her back}} to the house and to her bed, whither she went obediently enough, and soon fell into the sleep of exhaustion. But there was no more sleep for me that night. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> grim vigil with dread.|$|E
60|$|Which goes to {{show what}} chance I had of convincing Warden Atherton of my ignorance of the dynamite. His very {{persistence}} in the quest convinced a man like Jake Oppenheimer, who could only admire me for the fortitude with which <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> close mouth.|$|E

6000|$|... "He did," [...] said Torrance grimly. [...] "Still, for 'most {{two years}} <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> curb on my temper. Then one evening I {{told him he}} had to choose right then between his fancies and me. I could have no {{dealings}} with any man who talked as he did." ...|$|E
60|$|I was so {{well acquainted}} with the river as to know every crook and turn for at least ten miles above Benedict, and when it seemed certain the pungy had run three miles or more, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> sharp {{look-out}} on the banks in order {{to comply with the}} old man's request.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> diary {{on part of}} the trip, and as I read it {{over now}} I note one {{persistently}} recurring phrase, namely, [...] "Living fine." [...] We did live fine.

60|$|But, to deprecate her anger, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> {{her hand}} <b>an</b> instant, and then bent my venerable head and kissed it. I think I appeased her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I don't {{know what}} there is to explain. I suppose you think I got him drunk; I know what you thought that night. But he was pretty well loaded when he struck my champagne. It wasn't a {{question}} of {{what he was going to}} do any longer, but how he was going to do it. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> eye on him, and at the right time I helped the caterer's man to get him up into that room where he wouldn't make any trouble. I expected to go back and look after him, but I forgot him." ...|$|R
60|$|But if {{that was}} like to be my part, I found at least that I was not alone in it; for, James More {{returning}} suddenly, the girl was changed into a piece of stone. Through the rest of that evening, until she made an excuse and slipped to bed, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> eye upon her without cease: and I can bear testimony that she never smiled, scarce spoke, and looked mostly on the board in front of her. So that I really marvelled to see so much devotion (as it used to be) changed into the very sickness of hate.|$|R
6000|$|You can't {{imagine how}} {{brilliant}} and beautiful that new brass fender is, and how perfectly naturally it takes its {{place under the}} carved oak. How they did scour it up before they sent it! I lied {{a good deal about}} it when I came home--so for once <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> secret and surprised Livy on a Christmas morning! ...|$|E
60|$|I rose {{upon the}} instant, and my fears rose with me. But <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> bold front as I went {{down into the}} hall, where Ramiro and the blackguards of his Court were sitting, {{with three or four}} men-at-arms at {{attention}} by the door. Close to the pulleys appertaining to the torture of the cord stood two leather-clad ruffians--Ramiro's executioners.|$|E
60|$|MISS P.--To quit you, now {{you know}} what has passed? I never {{supposed}} it could be otherwise--I deceived you, Mr. Milliken--as <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> secret from you, and must pay the penalty. It is a relief to me, the sword has been hanging over me. I wish I had told your poor wife, as I was often minded to do.|$|E
6000|$|The first money I {{laid out}} was to buy two young stone horses, [...] which <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> in <b>a</b> good stable, {{and next to}} them the groom is my [...] {{greatest}} favourite; for I feel my spirits revived by the smell he [...] contracts in the stable.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, nothing, nothing!' said Festus crossly. 'You {{know well}} enough what it is, ma'am; only you make pretence otherwise. But I'll {{bring her to}} book yet. You shall drop your haughty airs, my charmer! She little thinks <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> account of 'em all.' ...|$|R
60|$|Even this equestrian novelty did {{not affect}} me. <b>I</b> still <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> fixed gaze on Melons's eye, {{and he began to}} tremble and visibly shrink in his capacious garment. Some other desperate means--conversation with Melons was always a desperate means--must be resorted to. He recommenced more artfully.|$|R
