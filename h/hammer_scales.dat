40|$|A {{very severe}} {{drawback}} of metal construction parts made {{of iron and}} steel is their susceptibility to corrosion. There {{are a number of}} processes for attaining long-term material protection. In the case of hot-dip galvanisation the parts are coated with negatively electric metals, chiefly zinc. The surface of the metal being subjected to this process must be bright. To achieve this the parts are first pickled in a hydrochloric acid bath. In the course of time the hydrochloric acid used for the pickling becomes spent as rust, <b>hammer</b> <b>scales,</b> iron and so on are deposited in the solution. This waste mixture has to be disposed of. In the techniques most commonly used up to now (oil-emulsion separation, CP units) the waste mixture is neutralized/precipitated and subsequently deposited on an special dump. The HYC-process recovers from the waste mixture valuable raw materials (iron chloride and zinc chloride) which can then be reintegrated in the processing cycle. A multiphase process removes the secondary constituents fouling the product or interfering with the separation process. The liquid is passed through an activated charcoal adsorption unit to remove the grease, inhibitors etc. from it. In a two-phase carburizing process heavy metals introduced through the steel being galvanized and the zinc used for this purpose are precipitated. The core of the unit consists of a zinc specific liquid-liquid extraction in which the iron chloride and zinc chloride are separated from one another. After passing through several re-treatment phases in an evaporation unit both the FeCl_ 2 and the ZnCl_ 2 solutions have reached the concentration desired. (orig.)

40|$|Deep {{drilling}} technologies use MWD (Measuring While Drilling) and LWD (Logging While Drilling) systems {{near the}} drill bit {{in order to}} gather large amounts of directional and geological information. The data are mostly processed downhole. To transmit the main results to the surface in nearly real time a high speed data communication system with more than 100 bit/s is highly advantageous. The most commonly usedprocessfor data transmission in boreholes is the so called mud pulse telemetry. However, mud pulse telemetry systems cannot transmit such high data rates. A significant improvement is expected {{through the use of}} acoustic waves along the drill string for data transmission. In the 1980 s and 1990 s there were some attempts to transmit the downhole data by means of acoustic signals along the metallic drill string to the surface. However, these trials were not much of a success, because the acoustic transmission channel of a real drill string was too complex for the applied modulation schemes. In details, a drill string channel configuration consisting {{of a large number of}} drill pipes and tooljoints with different diameters causes multiple signal reflections and depending on the superimposing of all reflections with the original signal, pass- and stop bands will be created. This limits the achievable data rate, because only thepassbands are suitable for use by data transmission. Moreover, the characteristics of the pass- and stop bands vary with each change in the drill string configuration. Because of such challenging issues, the acoustic transmission process is significantly complex. However, the deployment of new actuators in combination with latest state of the art techniques from mobile communications can overcome the mentioned difficulties. Such techniques enable for instance an adaptive bi-directional communication to be applied, whereby the data transmission can continuously be adapted to the changing channel characteristics. As a first step for the application of the acoustic communication system on a real drill string a prototype systemfor unidirectional communication (uplink transmission) was developed and built up. Due to their relatively large sizes (outer diameter: 11 1 / 4 "), the current prototype components cannot be used in standard deep bottom hole assemblies. However, suitable drill strings for such prototype sizes are found in mining drilling operations, for example with raise bore drilling. Thus, the initial prototype components were designed to be integrated into a raise bore drill string. The highly robust communication concept was developed to allow initial data rates of up to 30 bit/s. The prototype transmitting system consists of two units. The first one is located downhole. It includes a generator, a battery and a transmitter-sub. Furthermore there is the surface unit, which includes a receiver module, a WLAN access point and a terminal computer. The downhole batteiy can be recharged by a downhole alternator, which is driven by the drilling mud. The receiver module is attached to the uppermost drill string element and connected via a WiFi module to the terminal computer. At the surface unit the received data will be decoded and evaluated. The communication system is ready to be tested on a real well to transmit different types of data to the surface and to decode them there. The data to be transmitted during the initial field test will include information about the battery status, the temperature of the downhole unit in addition to dynamic and directional drilling data. In order to test the application limits as well as the robustness of the novel acoustic data transmission system, the influence of different interferences and noise sources on the data transmission quality were to he investigated. Unfortunately, the field trial was delaved several times and in the end cancelled in the scope of this project. But results from laboratory tests are available. During these investigations with the new acoustic communication telemetry system several interfering signals were generated to simulate real operation. Water waspumped through the system and the mechanical interaction between the drill string and the borehole wall was reproduced by rubbing on the drill string with sandpaper and applying <b>hammer</b> <b>scales</b> as well as combinations thereof Although the induced interferences reduced the quality of the data stream, the data transmission along the drill string was still possible in the presence of any kind of interference. The next development step would be the implementation of an adaptive, bi-directional communication system. This already has been built up and tested in the laboratory setup. The bi-directional communication system will significantly increase the transmission rate...|$|E

50|$|Seeing {{as it is}} a {{seemingly}} natural part of earlier ironworking techniques, hammerscale finds have been noted at numerous archaeological excavations in numerous world regions such as Northern Europe, Great Britain, and the Levant. The earliest mention of hammerscale in an archaeological context derived from a 1941 study of Roman-built fort in Great Britain, located on Hadrian’s wall. An excavation in 1960 of a Roman ironworking site in Norfolk also yielded <b>hammer</b> <b>scale.</b> In more recent excavations, hammerscale recovery has been conducted in a more systematic manner, utilizing the grid method noted above. For example, in an excavation in 1992, by means of establishing a grid and collecting local samples, the former location of a hearth and an anvil was determined despite the lack of the direct remains of either. Arne Jouttijärvi writes of three sites at which hammerscale deposits and concentration were utilized to map out the different areas of smithies in Viking Age pithouses in modern-day Denmark and Norway. For example, he writes how the “blacksmith himself shielded the floor where he stood, leaving a ‘shadow’ in the distribution of hammer scale.” Therefore, the distribution of hammerscale is not only able to aid in the location items within a workshop, but can also inform scholars of where the smiths themselves stood. Smithy discoveries involving hammerscale are well documented and generally a high presence of hammerscale is considered sufficient to identify a find as a smithy. Interestingly, there is even evidence of hammerscale at a bronze age site in Upper Bucklebury, West Berkshire, suggesting early ironworking in Britain.|$|R
5000|$|Flake Hammerscale is {{produced}} in large quantities during multiple stages of the smithing process. To create the pure iron necessary for forging, a smith must first purify the iron ore. The smelting of ore creates a ‘bloom’, a porous mixture of slag and metal. The smith then repeatedly heats and hammers the bloom to remove impurities. This technique creates hammerscale of varying composition. As the purification process continues, the hammerscale’s iron content increases. [...] Additional hammerscale {{is produced}} during the forging of the pure iron from the heating and hammering necessary to shape the piece. The scale produced at this stage is characterized by its blue-black color and tends to be slimmer and darker due to its incredibly high iron oxide content. Archeologists believe that spheroidal hammerscale is produced primarily during the process known as fire welding. Also known as forge welding, this technique is used to connect two pieces of metal by heating them to a high temperature and forcing them together with a hammer or other tool. For this method to be successful, the surface of each piece of metal must be molten. As the smith hammers the pieces together, some metal is forced out from between them, often {{in the form of}} a molten jet which cools in the air to form spheroidal <b>hammer</b> <b>scale.</b> It is also possible for spheroidal hammerscale to form during the purification of slag. As the smith hammers a bloom, it compacts which can drive molten metal out of the slag into the air.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{observations}} and tests under small scale in 1 -gravity condition {{are intended to}} obtain a comparative behavior of a model and prototype of geotechnical case by imposing the scaling relations.

To simulate pile loading test (PLT) on clay, the following models of: clay, pile, driving simulation and procedure of PLT based on ASTM D 4410 were set-up. The PLT in reduced scale environment was then followed by performing normal practice of full scale PLT in original clay site. Load settlement curves obtained from both “pile loading test ” in small and full scale simulations showed closely good agreement. Further observation and investigation on simulation of pile loading test in clay revealed that modeling the following: clay sub-soil resulted in new properties of clay, em=ep+Ln(N) which reflects stress scaling factor, N, pile size and pile driving <b>hammer</b> need <b>scaling</b> factor n and n 3 respectively whereas PLT time needs time scaling factor, tp (n...|$|R

40|$|Not many 7 th c. {{blacksmith}} workshops {{have been}} properly excavated in Italy up to now. The still ongoing excavations carried out since 2005 at Aiano-Torraccia di Chiusi, near San Gimignano (Siena) in Tuscany {{by the team}} of the Université catholique de Louvain, directed by Prof Marco Cavalieri, have brought to light architectural structures belonging to a Roman villa, dated between the 3 rd {{and the end of}} the 5 th/ beginning of the 6 th c. AD. Up to now only a small part of the large villa - shown by geodiagnostic surveys to extend over 1 hectare - has been excavated. The excavations and the researches represent a relevant part of the international project “VII REGIO. Elsa Valley during the Roman Age and late Antiquity”. The building was abandoned in the 6 th c., but in the period between the 6 th and the 7 th c. AD a group of Lombardic (Langobard) artisans coming from Eastern Europe, settled down in the villa remains and installed various workshops in the rooms of the representative part of the villa. They include a ceramic workshop with a kiln and spaces for different working stages, three rooms in which Roman glass mosaic tesserae and glass fragments were recycled, and a large and well organized iron smithy. Apparently there was also a workshop for the production of copper-based items, based on indications gathered from the remains behind the North/North-East wall, in not yet fully excavated areas, where the waste from the workshops was dumped. Other remains suggest that, in one or more rooms of the Roman architectural structure, gold was also worked. Rational and efficient Lombardic workshops for so many different productions, dated to this period, have never been identified and thoroughly studied before in Italy. The workshops were connected one to another and were provided with water from a complex system of channels, probably fed by a higher positioned reservoir. In the smithy all important structures are well preserved and can be reconstructed in detail. The blacksmith workshop was well organized and a large amount of iron working debris, such as bun-shaped working slag and <b>hammer</b> <b>scale,</b> but also iron objects and object fragments have been recovered from the excavated area. This paper presents the reconstruction and the graphic renderings of the different workshop features. It also shows the preliminary analysis data of part of the large amount of materials from the excavation which will be studied in detail in the next years...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a vertical cylindrical drum, heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most active region for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual pipe unions through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual <b>scaling</b> <b>hammer.</b> This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus for scale or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by thermal shock, by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid heating coils flexed continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study that investigated the exposure of workers in a foundry to vibration and related physical stresses. The primary objective of this research was to show that use of vibrating tools in the foundry involves exposure not only to vibration, but also to physical stresses both while the tool is running and while it is not running. Four types of tools were investigated: (1) small handheld grinders, (2) <b>scaling</b> <b>hammers,</b> (3) inline hammers, and (4) chipping hammers. The paper {{describes the}} characteristics of these tools with respect to physical work factors such as muscle load, upper extremity posture, hand repetition, and exposure to hand/arm vibration. The analysis is based on the use of instrumentation as well as the use of observational methods to quantify the physical work elements. With the exception of the grinders, all the tools investigated in this study produced vibration levels that limited their time of acceptable use, according to published guidelines. In addition to vibration exposure, workers experienced high peak muscle loading, medium to high levels of hand repetition, and extreme or awkward posture of the elbow and shoulder. All tools met or exceeded published recommendation limits for hand activity level. Relevance to industry The use of vibrating tools is common in many industrial settings. This paper describes how, in addition to the stress imposed by hand/arm vibration, workers who use these tools are exposed to other physical stresses such as han...|$|R
40|$|Operators {{continue}} {{to look for ways}} to improve hard rock drilling performance through emerging technologies. A consortium of Department of Energy, operator and industry participants put together an effort to test and optimize mud driven fluid hammers as one emerging technology that has shown promise to increase penetration rates in hard rock. The thrust of this program has been to test and record the performance of fluid <b>hammers</b> in full <b>scale</b> test conditions including, hard formations at simulated depth, high density/high solids drilling muds, and realistic fluid power levels. This paper details the testing and results of testing two 7 3 / 4 inch diameter mud hammers with 8 1 / 2 inch hammer bits. A Novatek MHN 5 and an SDS Digger FH 185 mud hammer were tested with several bit types, with performance being compared to a conventional (IADC Code 537) tricone bit. These tools functionally operated in all of the simulated downhole environments. The performance was in the range of the baseline ticone or better at lower borehole pressures, but at higher borehole pressures the performance was in the lower range or below that of the baseline tricone bit. A new drilling mode was observed, while operating the MHN 5 mud hammer. This mode was noticed as the weight on bit (WOB) was in transition from low to high applied load. During this new ''transition drilling mode'', performance was substantially improved and in some cases outperformed the tricone bit. Improvements were noted for the SDS tool while drilling with a more aggressive bit design. Future work includes the optimization of these or the next generation tools for operating in higher density and higher borehole pressure conditions and improving bit design and technology based on the knowledge gained from this test program...|$|R
