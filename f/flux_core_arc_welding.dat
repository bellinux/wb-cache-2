40|$|The {{current study}} used <b>flux</b> <b>core</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> {{to produce a}} series of {{hypereutectic}} Fe-Cr-C claddings with various carbon content. Depending on the carbon content, this research produced hypereutectic microstructures of gamma-Fe + (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. As the carbon content of a cladding increased from 3. 73 to 4. 85 wt. %, the surface fractions of carbides increased from 33. 8 % to 86. 1 % The morphology of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides also transited from a blade-like to a rod-like shape. With regard to wear performance, the relationship between wear resistance and hardness (H) is non-linear. However, the mean free path (lambda) of primary (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides must be considered. Wear resistance is proportional to H/lambda. The primary carbides can prevent the eutectic colonies from selective abrasion The rod-like (Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 carbides also provide much better wear resistance because rod-like carbides have a greater hardness After an abrasive wear process, abrasive particles cause plastic plows when the cladding has lower surface fractions of carbides. The fracture of primary carbides leads into the craters where it occurs in the worn cladding surface with higher surface fractions of carbides. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{have been}} sited away from coasts {{in the last}} decade to exploit the tremendous potential of wind energy on the vast oceans, especially in Northern Europe where there is relatively limited space on land and large sea areas. To date most of the existing offshore wind farms are located in shallower water but the current focus in the offshore wind industry is to explore the more stable wind energy in intermediate water depths, say the depths between 30 - 70 m. Increased water depths require novel technologies to make wind energy more economically competitive in such hostile site conditions. Among other things, the search for cost-efficient support structures is a critical challenge, because these can amount to 20 - 30 % of the total project cost, and even more in deeper waters. This thesis aims to examine the practicability of full height lattice towers to accommodate wind turbines in intermediate water depths. Lattice towers are first geometrically optimized to determine the possibilities for cost efficient designs when respecting the ultimate limit state. Then, since it is the main design driver of offshore wind turbine support structures, the fatigue life of promising designs is assessed, using the frequency domain method. If necessary, the structures are modified. All the studies for this thesis draw upon the load values derived from the NREL 5 MW Offshore Baseline Wind Turbine model, situated in the North at a water depth of 35 m. This thesis concentrates on three and four-legged lattice towers, and studies their behavior under variation of geometrical parameters; such as top distance between the legs, brace inclination, and number of segments along the tower height. To seek the most economic design each of the considered lattice tower configurations was assessed by varying the distance between the bottom legs, while maintaining the height constant. The complete series of configurations was evaluated under extreme turbine and wave loads. The towers were further quantitatively judged against the relevant criteria, including their structural performance under the ultimate limit state, the mass of the structures, and the fabrication costs, all in orderto determine the optimal solution. The best side topology for the chosen reference site was identified as the one consisting of ten X-shaped braces, with inclined diagonals of constant angle throughout. The threelegged lattice tower was found to be approximately equal in tower mass to the fourlegged type, but with simpler geometry and consequently a less complex fabrication procedure. It was also indicated that the tower mass varied as the bottom distance between the legs changed, and reached its lowest values at distances of 17 - 25 m for all the configurations under consideration. One of the most significant challenges encountered in the design of offshore wind turbine support structures is the fatigue assessment, since wind and waves are random and occur with significant intensities in many different frequency regions. Being timeefficient, the full frequency domain method was adopted in this work to assess the fatigue life of those promising designs first determined in the static analysis. If needed, the thickness of the tubes was modified to enable the towers to meet the fatigue criteria. After applying the joint detailing technology, the mass of lattice towers was found to be less than 50 % of their counterpart; i. e., corresponding tubular-monopile hybrid support structures. The three-legged and four-legged lattice towers come out equal in material usage. However, the three-legged type wins in fabrication cost, thanks to the smaller number of members and joints. To render the geometrical parameter studies efficient, an in-house finite element (FE) method space-frame code was programmed. Using this code, FE models could be built to assess the different lattice tower configurations quickly and flexibly. The code also provides the ability to modify structures gradually, until they are able to meet specified criteria. Complex fabrication procedures are often regarded as the main drawback of lattice type wind turbine towers. A rough estimate of the fabrication time was made for the two lightest lattice towers, one three-legged and one four-legged tower. A sequence of values representing the variable efficiencies was set for each contributing parameter which plays {{a significant role in the}} fabrication cost of lattice towers. The results indicate that the three-legged lattice towers need less fabrication time than the fourlegged ones, in most cases. The comparison to a tubular-monopile structure allows for concluding that a lattice tower, especially the four-legged type, is costlier than a tubular tower with the currently standard welding rate. However, the difference can be lessened with <b>flux</b> <b>core</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (FCAW) technology being improved. To introduce mass production to the fabrication of lattice towers will offer greater potential to reduce the manufacturing costs of these structures.

Proeutectic carbides undergone to several microstructural changes in response to higher carbon content in the cladding. The morphologies of proeutectic (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides changed from blade-like to rod-like with hexagonal cross section. The amounts of proeutectic (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides increased with increase of the C contents. The nucleation sites of proeutectic (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides increased under high undercooling condition. Hence, the latent heat of solidification can be released by formed proeutectic (CrFe) (7) C(3) carbides and then the growth of proeutectic (CrFe) (7) C(3) carbides were suppressed.

However, the study of fracture toughness with various welding consumables of 7 % nickel alloy steel is insufficient for ensuring the structural safety of LNG storage tanks. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate fracture toughness of several different weldments for 7 % nickel alloy steels. The weldment of 7 % nickel alloy steel was fabricated by tungsten inert gas (TIG), <b>flux</b> <b>cored</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (FCAW), and gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GMAW). In order to assess the material performance of the weldments at low temperature, fracture toughness such as crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) and the absorbed impact energy of weldments were compared with those of 9 % nickel steel weldments...|$|R
50|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} energy necessary for <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes, {{a number of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common classification is constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> the voltage {{is directly related to the}} length of the arc, and the current is related to the amount of heat input. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> <b>flux</b> <b>cored</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|R
5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty <b>weld.</b> Shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as <b>flux</b> <b>cored</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> plasma <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of the {{analysis}} of composition, microstructure, properties and weldability of 2205 duplex stainless steel, the <b>flux</b> <b>cored</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (FCAW) process is made. Then the microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of welded joint were analyzed. The results shows using FCAW process, in order to obtain high strength, perfect impact toughness and overall and partial resistance to stress corrosion in welded joint, the Ni content of duplex stainless steel welding material should be 2 % to 4 % higher than that of base metal, multi-layer and multi-channel welding is adopted with the strict control of energy input {{less than or equal to}} 0. 926 KJ/mm, layer temperature is less than 120 ℃, thus the appropriate proportion of two-phase structure in the welded joint can be got. Using a reasonable welding procedure, the microstructure in weld beam is austenite (A) + ferrite (F), and in heat affected zone is ferrite (F) + austenite (A) + a small amount of third phase, the content of austenite in weld beam and heat affected zone is higher than that of the base metal. Tensile strength of the welded joint is up to 854. 5 MPa and the fracture occurs in the base metal and the heat affected zone. The welded joint has high strength, good plasticity, toughness and corrosion resistance...|$|R
