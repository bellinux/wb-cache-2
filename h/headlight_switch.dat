2500|$|... 1985 models {{received}} minor updates while styling remained unchanged. The {{interior was}} updated for 1985, marking its most significant update since 1977. The simulated woodgrain appliqué {{used on the}} dash was replaced with a simulated silver metallic appliqué. The shaft-style radio was replaced with a more modern DIN-and-a-half style radio, while the pull-out <b>headlight</b> <b>switch</b> {{was replaced by a}} push button style switch. The climate controls were updated with rotary switches for the fan and rear window defroster replacing the toggle style switches. The instruments were updated to have a more modern appearance, with a horizontal speedometer while a round speedometer was included with the optional gauge package.|$|E
5000|$|... 1987 - New {{steering}} wheel; {{final year}} for optional alloy wheels, two-tone paint, and rear stereo amplifier were offered. Also {{the last year}} for 17-ounce deep-pile carpeting and the last year the radio, <b>headlight</b> <b>switch</b> and climate control panels were silver.|$|E
5000|$|The 1927 DeLuxe {{featured}} machined {{and polished}} [...] "Ricardo" [...] cylinder-heads and developed 35 hp at 3,800 rpm. The clutch was strengthened with two extra plates. There {{was a new}} tank top instrument cluster, featuring speedometer, ammeter, oil pressure gauge and a <b>headlight</b> <b>switch.</b> There were new valve spring covers and an updated Zenith carburetor.|$|E
25|$|Huff {{topped the}} wet first {{practice}} session on Saturday morning. Fabio Fabiani and Kano were black flagged {{for not having}} their <b>headlights</b> <b>switched</b> on.|$|R
25|$|The <b>headlight</b> dimmer <b>switch</b> {{was also}} {{removed from the}} floor and {{incorporated}} into the turn signal lever for all 1977 models.|$|R
2500|$|Nuvolari and {{co-driver}} Battista Guidotti won the Mille Miglia in a Zagato-bodied Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 GS, {{becoming the}} first to complete the race {{at an average of}} over [...] At night, leading on elapsed time but still lying behind his team-mate Achille Varzi on the road because he had started after him, he tailed Varzi at speeds of up to [...] with his <b>headlights</b> <b>switched</b> off, so that he could not be seen in the other car's rear-view mirrors. He eventually switched them on to overtake [...] "the shocked" [...] Varzi near the finish at Brescia.|$|R
50|$|Major {{changes were}} made to the {{dashboard}} with new instruments, touch switches mounted either side controlling wipers, rear window demister, electric antenna (Berlina/Calais), and the <b>headlight</b> <b>switch</b> moved from the right-hand dash side to the indicator stalk. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning control graphics changed slightly, the center console offered more storage with new transmission shifter and surround.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Twilight Sentinel {{also allows}} {{the driver to}} set a timer (located with the <b>headlight</b> <b>switch)</b> that delays {{shutting}} off the headlights for a specified time period, usually up to three minutes. The driver can park the vehicle, shut off the car's engine and exit the automobile after dark, then use the headlights to light the path into a nearby building, such as a house, before the system shuts the headlights off automatically.|$|E
5000|$|During this year, GMC {{detached}} {{many options}} from packages {{in order for}} customers to save money. Additionally, the I6 engine received a small increase of [...] For the XL model, a new engine was introduced, a 5.3 Liter V8 with [...] Other notable changes included making front side-impact airbags previously standard on the 2002 model, optional, recreating the <b>headlight</b> <b>switch</b> to allow a Daytime Running Lamp (DRL) off switch, and also increasing the fuel tank to 22 gal. Articulating headrests are no longer available.|$|E
50|$|Hilux/Unimog Winch: A wide {{series of}} 1/10-1/16 {{vehicles}} with working winches, detailed bodies, and 4WD, various features on different models such as working <b>headlights,</b> 2wd/4wd <b>switch,</b> two gears, horn, {{and even some}} of the above functions operated by the transmitter.|$|R
5000|$|A {{family of}} 4 (a mother, father and two daughters) lived in thehouse of Kundanbagh colony. It is told that, {{one day the}} father left the house and never returned. Nobody knows {{anything}} about him ever since then. According to some neighbours, {{the mother and the}} daughters were too weird. The daughters used to play outside the house with a blood filled bottle[...] The neighbours also used to hear some weird sounds from inside the house. Apparently, one day a thief barged into the house and saw three dead bodies. When he got nabbed by the police, he revealed about the three dead bodies in the house.Interestingly, the post-mortem report said that they have been dead for almost 6 months then. So, the neighbours began to wonder about the girls and the songs which the lady sang in glory.. It became a big news in 2002 and later the house was locked. Now Kundanbagh House is a deserted property with no electricity supply.===Different Views=== Similar to many haunted places, the story of Kundanbagh haunted house is a much debated one. Some firmly say that the story was created to stop other people from buying it. Many say that it is haunted and they have had some strange experiences. One resident of a nearby locality said that he and his friend met with an accident in front of the Kundanbagh House gate. He said it was weird that his bike's <b>headlight</b> <b>switched</b> off as soon as he entered that lane. His friend who happen to come from the opposite side came and crashed into him because even his bike's <b>headlight</b> got <b>switched</b> off as he came near. These versions of stories have not stopped people from getting a sneak-peek into the property. Now even police patrol the area and nabs anyone who tries to enter the gate or create a nuisance.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the race}} degenerates into a violent {{demolition}} derby, Messer is blown up by Bennie, while McMillan attempts to cheat by having his Blazer flown from LAX to New York's LaGuardia Airport where he waits out the race with his mistress Louisa (Louisa Moritz). Beutell's borrowed Lincoln gets progressively more damaged as the race goes on, while Jim and Maryann face engine trouble {{with a broken}} fan belt. The rivalry between Coy and the increasingly unstable Redman gets out of control as the two fight and attempt to force each other off the road, with Coy crashing his Trans Am after Redman breaks the <b>headlights.</b> <b>Switching</b> to a 1969 Ford Mustang he borrows from some local hot-rodders, Coy has a last showdown with Redman, who has kicked Perman and Sharma {{out of his car}} after arguing with them. A piece of Perman's guitar, which Redman smashed in a rage after getting sick of Perman's singing and on-the-road radio broadcasts, gets lodged behind the car pedals, causing Redman to lose control and crash over the side of an unfinished bridge. He dies when the car explodes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973 the 140 series {{received}} a major facelift, {{with a new}} plastic grille, new larger indicators and a completely revised tail end. Also, the S designation was dropped and the range consisted of 3 trim levels, standard (with no designation, known as L, or [...] "luxe") de Luxe and the most upmarket, Grand Luxe. The interior also had a completely revised dashboard with a new instrument cluster consisting of dials rather than the strip speedometer previously used, rocker switches replacing the push-pull switches (with {{the exception of the}} <b>headlight</b> <b>switch),</b> and vents to direct air towards the person augmenting the defrost and floor vents.|$|E
5000|$|Sgt. Mark Smith, {{head of the}} {{forensics}} unit of the Saint John Police Force, said {{he spent}} 3 days following the July 14, 2011 search of Dennis's home doing a [...] "very thorough search" [...] of Dennis's car. [...] Ten {{different areas of the}} car were swabbed, including the driver's side door inside latch and handle, the trunk release button, the <b>headlight</b> <b>switch,</b> signal light switch, the steering wheel, the emergency brake, and seats of the car. The swabs were sent away on July 21, 2011, for forensic testing at the RCMP crime lab in Nova Scotia, but no blood or DNA was detected through these tests, either.|$|E
5000|$|... 1985 models {{received}} minor updates while styling remained unchanged. The {{interior was}} updated for 1985, marking its most significant update since 1977. The simulated woodgrain appliqué {{used on the}} dash was replaced with a simulated silver metallic appliqué. The shaft-style radio was replaced with a more modern DIN-and-a-half style radio, while the pull-out <b>headlight</b> <b>switch</b> {{was replaced by a}} push button style switch.

The instruments were updated to have a more modern appearance, with a horizontal speedometer while a round speedometer was included with the optional gauge package.|$|E
50|$|Motorists {{may carry}} jumper cables {{in case of}} {{accidental}} discharge of the vehicle battery (for example, by <b>headlights</b> or ignition <b>switch</b> left on while the engine is not running). Safe procedures for connecting and disconnecting cables are given in the vehicle manual.|$|R
50|$|This car was {{announced}} and a sample {{displayed at the}} October 1950 motor shows in Paris and at Earls Court on stand 145. Its full-width body was built on a Standard Vanguard chassis with an engine given twin down-draught carburettors and a higher output. This envelope type coachwork incorporated more power actuated components than any previous British car. Those components including: headlights concealed behind shutters automatically opened when the <b>headlights</b> were <b>switched</b> on; convertible head; windows; seat; and radio aerial.|$|R
50|$|Several {{states on}} the Eastern seaboard, the Southeast, and Gulf Coast (except Texas) have {{enforced}} vehicular laws since the early 1990s that require <b>headlights</b> to be <b>switched</b> on when windshield wipers are in use. This prompted the phasing in of DRLs in the affected states (from Maine to Florida including Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama).|$|R
5000|$|MY2002: The 3.5L {{replaced}} the 3.2L, {{and the water}} pump issues on the 2.7L were now resolved, New wheel covers were available for 2002. the R/T received an extra [...] from PCM programming changes which allowed it to have [...] on 89-octane fuel. This was also the year when DaimlerChrysler began cost-cutting {{that led to the}} deletion of various features from the Intrepid. Most notable were the deletion of the illuminated <b>headlight</b> <b>switch,</b> illuminated traction control switch, illuminated lock and window switches, door courtesy lights (replaced with red reflectors), illuminated ashtray receptacle, trunk lid liner, armrest power outlet, door emblems, driver's seat map pocket, and the blacked-out front fascia paint scheme. Cost-cutting {{was one of the reasons}} why sales of the Intrepid started to slump.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark VI {{had more}} ornate styling than the Town Car, {{befitting}} its place {{on top of}} the model line. It sported vacuum-operated concealed headlamps, non-functional fender vents, oval opera windows on the C-pillars, a [...] "Continental-esque" [...] trunklid, and a slightly different grille. An unusual optional feature, called [...] "touring lights", were installed externally on the concealed headlamp doors, which gave an appearance of being headlights, when the actual headlights were behind the doors. The touring lights would only turn on if the <b>headlight</b> <b>switch</b> was in the parking light position, and gave a soft glow, but didn't provide enough light to drive in dark conditions. This generation was also installed with Ford's [...] "Auto Lamp" [...] feature, and if the system was active, the touring lights would not be used when the conventional headlights came on. The touring lights also did not function as daytime running lights.|$|E
50|$|Aug 1980: Introduction of the Maxi 2 {{range in}} 1750 L, 1750 HL and 1750 HLS variations. All models feature new {{revisions}} including new bumpers incorporating indicators (front) and reversing lights (rear), new side repeaters, full cover plastic wheel trims and broader side moulding inserts. Inside the instrument bezels were now in matt black, the switchgear was also again revised, the <b>headlight</b> <b>switch</b> was {{now on the}} steering column {{and there was a}} choke warning light. The L replaced the previous Base model and added LM/MW push button radio, nylon trim, door bins, laminated windscreen and walnut veneer dashboard. The HL gained intermittent screen wipe, velour seats, tinted glass and extra sound insulation. The HLS gained a burr walnut veneer dashboard. However, LHD export Maxi 2s were still referred to as 'Austin' Maxis in sales literature, only one version being available, the single carburettor HL, though unlike the UK spec cars it did not feature a radio as standard.|$|E
5000|$|The Eldorado was {{redesigned}} but rode on {{the same}} 129.5 in wheelbase. The elevated tailfins were removed, with fins planed flat, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The <b>headlight</b> pairs <b>switched</b> from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared with a tempered glass backlight. New standard features included lamps for luggage and glove compartments and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower [...] V8. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room.|$|R
2500|$|British-made Mokes were {{fitted with}} a low-end 848cc {{transverse}} inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10inch wheels as the standard Mini. In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable canvas top were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves. The base price was GB£ 405. The [...] "Mk I" [...] Mokes had a single windscreen wiper and a floor-mounted <b>headlight</b> dip <b>switch,</b> and the only colour available was [...] "Spruce Green". In 1967, the [...] "Mk II" [...] Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.|$|R
5000|$|There was a 12-volt {{electrical}} system for lighting and starting. Timing {{was at the}} back of the engine. From there on the off-side were driven in-line the generator, water-pump and magneto. Reported refinements for the 1929 Motor Show included: chromium-plated exterior fittings, Triplex glass, improved (dome type) [...] "mud wings (front mudguards) and new gas (sic) and ignition control levers [...] "neatly placed above the steering wheel". For 1930 the specification included Biflex magnetic dip and <b>switch</b> <b>headlights</b> and wire wheels.|$|R
5000|$|... 1992 {{models were}} similar to 1991s - {{the only way to}} tell the {{difference}} is the rear back glass (the rear glass does not have any trim to which two black buttons serve as the back glass strut mounting points) and front grille (chrome shell with argent silver inserts). The interior was a carryover from 1991 {{with the exception of the}} center console and steering wheel (X-bar style similar to the one used in the GMT400 trucks). Also, the [...] "S-15" [...] name was dropped from the Jimmy. The S10 Blazer also introduced an upscale Tahoe trim package, the Tahoe LT, which was rebadged as the LT in 1995 whilst the Tahoe package was renamed as the LS. The Tahoe LT had its own exterior décor with faded lower body lines on the lower rockers along with Tahoe LT badges - this also included an overhead console and keyless remote door locks). 1992 was the first model year where the S10 Blazer and Jimmy offered an NP233 electronic transfer case for as a drive train option. This deleted the Manual gear range selector with a 3 position switch located to the left of the gauge cluster in the same location that the rear defrost button would be located on non-electronic transfer-case and 2WD model Blazers and Jimmies (when optioned with the electronic transfer case the defrost button assembly is positioned below the <b>headlight</b> <b>switch).</b> The electronic transfer-case added luxury however there was no neutral position with the electronic transfer case, so the owner's manual stated that the drive shaft had to be removed when the vehicle was being towed. The fuel lines, which were routed on the driver side frame rail to the TBI fuel injectors, were redesigned where the fuel inlets entered the rear of the engine (same as the GMT400). This was phased in because of the L35 option which used a similar fuel line setup. The serpentine accessory drive for the 4.3L motor was modified where the air pump was eliminated and further lightened.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 {{there was}} another minor facelift, with trim pieces now in black and a black band between the <b>headlights.</b> The engine <b>switched</b> from a timing chain to a timing belt, and the {{interior}} changed to gray. Air conditioning was now available as an option. In 1987 the Mitsubishi Minicab received Mitsubishi's new three-cylinder engine, but the Porter Cab had to soldier on with the old two-cylinder. In June 1989, after twenty years of continuous production {{with nothing more than}} facelifts, the Porter Cab was finally retired. It was replaced by the Autozam Scrum, a mere badge-engineered Suzuki Carry.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to use Polya urn {{processes}} to model the emergence of conformity {{in an environment where}} people interact with each other sequentially and indirectly, through a common physical facility. Examples include rewinding video tapes, erasing blackboards, and <b>switching</b> <b>headlights,</b> etc. We find that a minimum amount of imitation is able to generate a maximum l evel of conformity. We then reinterpret the result in a group imitation setup, and show that as long as groups imitate each other with positive probabilities, they will end up with the same population composition, irrespective of the initial conditions, and the imitating probabilities. Polya urn, conformity, emergence, social norms...|$|R
50|$|The Grand Am {{included}} Strato bucket seats {{upholstered in}} Naugahyde vinyl or corduroy cloth featuring manual recliners and adjustable lumbar supports - both features common on European-style sports/luxury sedans, but unusual for American cars of that time. Also included were an instrument panel from the Pontiac Grand Prix featuring a Rally gauge cluster with fuel, oil, water and volt gauges (a tachometer or fuel economy gauge was optional, and on cars so equipped, the clock {{was moved to}} a space on the lower instrument panel under the radio), three-spoke padded steering wheel with brushed-stainless spokes, and Genuine Crossfire African Mahogany trim on the dash facing, radio and clock surrounds, {{as well as the}} center console between the front seats. Grand Ams also were among the first U.S.-built cars with a turn-signal mounted <b>headlight</b> dimmer <b>switch</b> that had been common on imported cars for decades. Other standard equipment included concealed windshield wipers, a 1.12 in front stabilizer bar, and an in-the-windshield radio antenna. Upscale options included air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows-locks-seat, rear defogger, various sound systems, and tilt-steering-wheel. AM/FM stereo with a tape player was optional.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} design {{tradition}}s have {{ended with the}} fifth generation. The side windows are no longer frameless, ending a Subaru tradition started with the first generation Leone in the early 1970s. On wagons, the [...] "D" [...] pillar is no longer covered in glass. The parking light switch traditionally installed {{on top of the}} steering wheel column has also been removed, with Subaru using conventional headlight electrics, meaning if the headlights are left on when the engine is turned off, the headlights remain on unless the automatic <b>headlight</b> feature <b>switch</b> position is being used. An engine coolant temperature gauge is no longer offered, replaced by a fuel economy gauge instead that gives estimates in either miles per gallon or kilometers per liter based on regional requirements where the vehicle is sold. When the engine temperature is below normal, an indicator light shines blue and when the engine is overheating, the light turns red. Using the key to unlock the drivers' door after locking the vehicle with the remote will set off the security system; the vehicle must be unlocked with the remote, a tradition going back to the second generation when remote keyless access was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|As it {{had been}} since DeVille became a {{separate}} series, DeVille denoted Cadillac's mainstream model, falling between the Calais (which had replaced the Series 62) and the Sixty Special and Eldorado. The DeVille was redesigned for 1965 but rode on the same 129.5 in wheelbase. Tailfins were canted slightly downward, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The <b>headlight</b> pairs <b>switched</b> from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared, and convertibles acquired tempered glass backlights. New standard features included lamps for luggage, glove and rear passenger compartments and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower [...] V8, which would {{be replaced by the}} [...] for 1968. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room. Pillared sedans appeared on the DeVille series for the first time, while six-window hardtop sedans were dropped. A padded vinyl roof was a $121 extra-cost option on the hardtop model. All four DeVille models had small [...] "Tiffany-like" [...] script nameplates on the ends of their rear fenders just above the chrome side molding.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1968, the '69 Torana' was released, {{sometimes}} called the HB Series II. This featured locally made body panels, replacing the imported bodies of the original HB. The model lineup now included a four-door sedan which was developed in Australia, with four-door bodies shipped back to the UK to be constructed and sold as the Viva. A collapsible steering column was now fitted, together with a new recessed instrument cluster, new indicator switch, and new steering wheel borrowed from the contemporary full-sized Holden. These local components replaced the previously imported Vauxhall items. A consequence of using these local components was {{the loss of the}} stalk-operated <b>headlight</b> dip <b>switch</b> and horn. The dip switch ended up on the floor, as was the case for full-sized Holdens. Dual-circuit brakes were now standard on all models, though power-assisted front disc brakes were still optional with the standard [...] engine. The Brabham Torana was still available, in two-door form only. It now included a sports steering wheel similar to the contemporary Holden Monaro GTS, full instrumentation, different badging, and different black accenting. The HB Torana continued until late 1969. Total production was 16,318 with imported panels and 20,243 with the locally manufactured bodies.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{described}} by a motoring correspondent of The Times as follows:The four-door body has four sidewindows and makes a comfortable four-seater; the doors have roll armrests and ashtrays {{and there is a}} central pull-down rest. The rear windows are [...] "carried well back and allow a very fair view". The doors have slip pockets and glass louvres that conform to the body's lines. There is a cupboard in the instrument panel and the instruments and ashtray are centrally placed. There are two-way visors, independent wiper controls (left and right), a spring steering wheel and in its centre ignition, dip and <b>switch</b> (<b>headlights),</b> signalling and horn controls. There are ventilators in the scuttle, a sliding roof and a fully opening windscreen. The front seats are adjustable, the backrests will tip up and beneath them there are floor wells for the feet of the back passengers. A stabilising bumper and two horns are fitted at the front.|$|R
