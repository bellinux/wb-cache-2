Two types of anonymous question-forms form the basis of this work. One is determined to the hospitalized <b>elderlies</b> <b>and</b> the other to the nursing staff. The research probes how the nursing staff manage to communicate with hospitalized <b>elderlies</b> <b>and</b> how are the seniors satisfied with such communication.

5|$|A Scottish Mason, Samfield was {{committed}} to public service. When Tennessee's first Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Children was formed in 1880, he became its first vice-president, and in 1889, he led the fundraising for Memphis's first civilian hospital, St. Joseph's, a Catholic institution. He founded Memphis's Hebrew Relief Association, and the non-sectarian United Charities, and was {{a director of the}} New Orleans Jewish Orphans' Home, Denver's Jewish Consumptive House, and New York's Sheltering House Association. For the last fifteen years of his life he worked to create a home for <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> infirm Southern Jews, completed in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E
40|$|In {{asthmatic}} subjects {{an imbalance}} between elastase and alpha 1 -antitrypsin (alpha 1 -PI) exists. This study aims {{to evaluate whether}} ageing per se affects the levels of elastase. Both young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> asthmatics with comparable severity and duration of disease, as well as young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> healthy subjects, underwent an induced sputum procedure to measure levels of elastase and alpha 1 -PI. The percentage of sputum neutrophils and eosinophils was higher in young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> asthmatics than in young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> controls. The levels of both total and active elastase were significantly higher in young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> asthmatics than in young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> controls, <b>and</b> directly correlated with the percentage of neutrophils. In addition, in both young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> asthmatics the levels of total and active elastase were negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in one second values, but positively correlated with {{the duration of the}} disease. This study indicates that ageing per se does not necessarily lead to a progressive elastase/alpha 1 -antitrypsin imbalance in asthma, and suggests that an important variable in the development of airway remodelling in both young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> asthmatics is represented by the duration of the disease...|$|R

5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or <b>elderly,</b> <b>and</b> then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack}} of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small children, all the <b>elderly,</b> <b>and</b> all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber.|$|E
5|$|The breed was {{originally}} developed for general {{use on the}} farms of the Appalachian foothills, where it was found pulling plows and buggies, working cattle and being ridden by both adults and children.

40|$|Abstract: Effects of nine {{social life}} {{indicators}} on age-adjusted and age-specific annual suicide mortality {{of male and}} female Japanese population in the years 1953 – 96 were investigated by multiple regression analysis on time series data. Unemployment rate was significantly related to the age-adjusted mortality in both males and females. Also, female labour force participation was positively related to the male mortality; persons and 65 and above was inversely related to the male mortality. Results on the age-specific mortality indicated that: during the 44 yr, (1) unemployment significantly related with the mortality of young, middle-aged <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> males <b>and</b> young females; (2) female labour force participation significantly related with the mortality of young <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> males <b>and</b> young females; aged population significantly related with the mortality of middle-aged <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> males; (4) young population significantly related with the mortality of young and middle-aged males and females; (5) divorce significantly related with the mortality of middle-aged <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> males <b>and</b> young males and females; (6) persons employed in primary industries significantly related with the mortality in middle-aged males and young males and females; and (7) population density significantly related with the mortality of middle-age...|$|R

5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the <b>elderly,</b> <b>and</b> in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects the <b>elderly</b> <b>and</b> {{accounts for more}} than half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E
