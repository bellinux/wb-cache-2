2500|$|The Hamburger Morgenpost {{questioned}} whether RTL misquoted DSDS Top 10 candidate Anna-Carina Woitschack. In an interview, Anna-Carina {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "It was cut together all wrong. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I hate Sarah – but on the contrary, I do not hate Sarah Engels. That is what I said. But it was cut this way by RTL, because it looks good for the show." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after winning}} the 2012 Miss Korea pageant, younger photos of Ms. Kim {{appeared}} online showing a dramatic difference in her appearance before and after cosmetic surgery, causing a stir in the Korean media about the prevalence of cosmetic surgery.

6000|$|... "Never once!" [...] said Fancy emphatically, {{and with}} {{eyes full of}} earnest truth. [...] "I don't like him indeed, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> heard of his doing this before!

"That {{was about}} losing a friend… But then people cryptically tweet {{about what you}} meant. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that.

2500|$|The Lord of Heaven is Heaven itself[...] [...] [...] In {{the empire}} {{we have a}} temple for honoring Heaven and sacrificing to Him. We Manchus have Tiao Tchin.

But <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Israel is like Nazi Germany, and I don't know why I am quoted like that in Israel. <b>I</b> also <b>never</b> compared Gaza to an extermination camp. I visited the death camps in Austria, with Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, and I think it is terrible that people did not try to stop the genocide of the Jewish people." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Yongzheng Emperor {{was firmly}} against Christian {{converts}} among the Manchus.

2500|$|National Catholic Register {{columnist}} Patrick Kenny {{questioned whether}} the bones found in 1975 were from the Bon Secours Home or {{from one of the}} previous institutions which had occupied the same building, as well as whether or not the structure Corless speculated was a mass grave was a disused septic tank or a [...] "19th-century burial vault."

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{mezzotint}} ignored {{light and}} shade, or {{ought to do}} so. Mezzotint is properly to be considered as chiaroscuro drawing on metal.

6000|$|... "I never wished it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I wished it.

6000|$|I.--But {{listen to}} me, my good man.

5000|$|Steele {{himself has}} <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{he does not}} object to free verse--"Free verse," [...] he maintains, [...] "is just as much poetry as verse is"—but {{to the idea that}} it has {{superseded}} meter and rendered it obsolete. Though acknowledging he feels a special interest in metrical composition, he has insisted that his preference [...] "is personal and aesthetic, however; <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> imagined that it provided me with access to cultural or spiritual virtue. And despite allegations to the contrary about Missing Measures, <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> vers libre is somehow wrong and immoral or that meter is somehow right and pure. The experimental school of Pound, Eliot, Lawrence, and Williams has its own beauties and achievements. But we can prize them justly and build on them, it seems to me, only if we retain a knowledge and appreciation of the time-tested principles of standard versification. Free verse cannot be free, unless there is something for it to be free of." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{so excited}} {{that she could not}} speak connectedly at first, the practised air which she had brought home with her having disappeared.

6000|$|... "Perhaps, Mrs. Tappitt," [...] said Mrs. Cornbury, [...] "we needn't mind {{discussing}} Miss Ray. It's {{not good}} {{to talk about a}} young lady in that way, and I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I thought she was engaged to Mr. Rowan. Had I done so I should have been very wrong, for I know nothing about it. What little I saw of the gentleman I liked;" [...] and as she used the word gentleman she looked Tappitt full in the face; [...] "and for Miss Ray, I've a great regard for her, and think very highly of her. Independently of her acknowledged beauty and pleasant, ladylike manners, she's a very charming girl. About the vote, Mr. Tappitt--; at any rate you'll think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|In fact, this is Mr. Max Muller's own opinion, for he next reports his {{anonymous}} author (myself) as saying ('we are now told'), 'though without {{any reference to}} Pausanias or any other Greek writers, that the young maidens, the [Greek], when dancing around Artemis, were clad in bearskins, {{and that this is}} a pretty frequent custom in the dances of totemic races. In support of this, however, we are not referred to really totemic races [...] . but to the Hirpi of Italy, and to the [Greek] in Egypt.' Of course <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the [Greek] danced around Artemis! I did say, after observing that they were described as 'playing the bear,' 'they even in archaic ages wore bear-skins,' for which I cited Claus {141a} and referred to Suchier, {141b} including the reference in brackets [ ] to indicate that I borrowed it from a book which I was unable to procure. {142a} I then gave references for the classical use of a saffron vest by the [Greek].|$|E

[...] And, indeed, if the reader will look back he will see {{there is nothing in}} the {{dialogue}} to preclude it. He was misled, that's all. I merely said that Mrs. Dangerfield had left her husband a few days before. So she had--to do some shopping in New York. She thought it mean of him to follow her. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Dangerfield had any connection whatever with The Woman with whom Marsden was in love. Not at all. He knew her, of course, because he came from Brick City. But she had thought he was in Philadelphia, and naturally she was surprised to see him back in New York. That's why she exclaimed [...] "Back!" [...] And as a matter of plain fact, you can't pick up a revolver without its pointing somewhere. No one said he meant to fire it.|$|E
60|$|The {{story of}} those three men, if the reader will be content to have me give it in their own persons, without taking upon me to either vouch the {{particulars}} or answer for any mistakes, I shall give as distinctly as I can, believing the history {{will be a very}} good pattern for any poor man to follow in case the like public desolation should happen here. And if there may be no such occasion, (which God of his infinite mercy grant us!) still the story may have its uses so many ways as that it will, <b>I</b> hope, <b>never</b> be <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the relating has been unprofitable.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{reported}} in the press that the Sauber, Lotus and Force India teams had considered withdrawing from the race to signal a message to Formula One's commercial leaders about the current financial state of the sport following Caterham and Marussia's non-participation in the race. Ecclestone stated that if two of those teams left Formula One then [...] "that is what will happen" [...] and that teams should only be taking part if they were competitive. Force India team principal Bob Fernley said discussions about a boycott but it would only be performed as a final recourse. Lotus owner Gérard Lopez later admitted he had not heard about the proposed boycott and the team insisted that they would contest the Grand Prix. Vijay Mallya, the owner of Force India, severely criticised suggestions of a boycott six days after the race: [...] "Who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we wanted to boycott the race? Please tell me. If I am wrong, you educate me. I speak on behalf of Force India. <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we are going to boycott, and I have clarified this in Austin. Why would we? We have come to go racing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah me! yes; it {{was thus}} he argued {{to himself as}} on that morning {{he went through the}} {{arrangements}} of his toilet.

But this I remark, that many such brutes are to be met with in the beaten paths of the world's highway. When Patience Woolsworthy had answered him coldly, bidding him go back to London and think over his love; while it seemed from her manner that at any rate as yet she did not care for him; while he was absent from her, and, therefore, longing for her, the possession of her charms, her talent and bright honesty of purpose had seemed to him a thing most desirable. Now they were his own. They had, in fact, been his own from the first. The heart of this country-bred girl had fallen at the first word from his mouth. Had she not so confessed to him? She was very nice--very nice indeed. He loved her dearly. But had he not sold himself too cheaply? ...|$|R
