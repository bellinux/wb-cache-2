50|$|A more {{successful}} expansion effort came with Telecom PTT's {{entry into the}} Internet, as the company set up the service provider Blue Window (later Bluewin), which became the country's leading Internet service provider (ISP). The company had also introduced digital <b>ISDN</b> <b>subscriber</b> services, building up its subscriber base from 250,000 in 1996 to {{more than two million}} by 2003.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, {{the number}} of <b>ISDN</b> <b>subscribers</b> dwindled as {{alternative}} technologies such as ADSL, cable Internet access, and fiber to the home gained greater popularity. On November 2, 2010, NTT announced plans to migrate their backend from PSTN to the IP network from around 2020 to around 2025. For this migration, ISDN services will be retired, and fiber optic services are recommended as an alternative.|$|R

Task Force team of IEEE 802. 3 ah has accomplished the standardization of EPON which is the next generation <b>subscriber</b> <b>access</b> network. EPON doesn’t still have the bandwidth enough to support the new service(e. g various multimedia service) which demands the high bandwidth. For these new multimedia services, 10 G EPON is the next generation <b>subscriber</b> <b>access</b> network which expanded the up-down bandwidth range of 1 G EPON 10 times {{in order to support}} demanding high bandwidth. We have proposed the model which can accommodate IEEE 802. 1 AVB traffics smoothly in 10 G EPON and suggesting the Intra-ONU scheduling model which makes this model operate effectively...|$|R
