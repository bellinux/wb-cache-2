500|$|In May 2006, Megadeth {{announced}} that its eleventh studio album, United Abominations, was near completion. Originally {{scheduled for release}} in October, Mustaine said that the band was [...] "putting {{the finishing touches on}} it" [...] and postponed its release to May of the following year. He commented on the release: [...] "Metal needs a really good old-school record again. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> delivered." [...] United Abominations was the band's first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover, and James Lomenzo. It also has a newer version of [...] "À Tout le Monde" [...] entitled [...] "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)". The 2007 version is a duet with Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil; it was recorded at a slightly faster tempo than the original and contains an extended solo.|$|E
500|$|During the evening, Elliot and Smith {{discussed}} {{destroying the}} three junks and deploying men {{to attack the}} battery the next day, but Smith acceded to Elliot's recommendation not to do so. Elliot stated that an attack would destroy the village and cause [...] "great injury and irritation" [...] to the inhabitants. In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt {{that it would be}} unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his [...] "poor Cutter" [...] could do under their batteries. He wrote: [...] "Perhaps I ought not to have fired at all but every man's patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried. I am afraid I have disappointed the men's ardent spirits here but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done well to refrain." [...] He circulated a paper on shore the same day which stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Stockhausen, {{along with}} John Cage, {{is one of}} the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in {{penetrating}} the popular consciousness ( [...] ; [...] ). The Beatles included his face on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [...] This reflects his influence on the band's own avant-garde experiments as well as the general fame and notoriety he had achieved by that time (1967). In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...) [...] Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham. Asked [...] "Have you heard any Stockhausen?", he is alleged to have replied, [...] "No, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> trodden in some" [...] ( [...] , annotated on 366: [...] "Apocryphal; source unknown").|$|E
60|$|I {{made my way}} to Mr. Waterbrook, and said, that <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the {{pleasure}} of seeing an old schoolfellow there.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you know}} {{anything}} about West Australia?' he asked, changing the subject. 'It's a fine country, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thought of going there at one time.' ...|$|R
60|$|In this {{arrangement}} we rested, {{and as we}} walked back to camp I cared nothing for the sly words or glances of our fellow artists. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> won my case.|$|R
2500|$|In 1885 Van Gogh {{wrote his}} brother Theo of his {{attempts}} to manage the backlit lighting, [...] "especially figures à contre jour (English against daylight). I have studies of heads, both lit and against the light, and I have worked on the whole figure a number of times, a seamstress, [...] winding yarn or peeling potatoes. En face and en profil. I {{do not know whether}} or not I shall ever finish it, as this is a difficult effect, although <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> learned one or two things by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eight {{remaining}} slave states {{continued to}} reject calls for secession. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's March 4, 1861, inaugural address declared that his administration would not initiate a civil war. Speaking {{directly to the}} [...] "Southern States", he attempted to calm their fears of any threats to slavery, reaffirming, [...] "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly {{to interfere with the}} institution of slavery in the United States where it exists. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so." [...] After Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy, efforts at compromise failed and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on [...] "King Cotton" [...] that they would intervene, but none did, and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.|$|E
2500|$|When Romanian Premier Alexandru Marghiloman {{traveled}} to Bessarabia to canvass for the unionist cause, {{he found the}} Peasant Faction divided between followers of Ion Inculeț, who endorsed the Romanian viewpoint, and deputies who sided with Tsyganko. Zamfirescu, who traveled with Marghiloman, recalls that Tsyganko [...] "thrice in one month" [...] attempted to recall the Republic's Directorate, his moves resisted by Inculeț. He also protested the selection of pro-Romanian students from Kiev and Odessa as representatives of the Transnistrian Moldavians, in which he saw efforts to shake {{the balance of power}} inside the Sfatul. Zamfirescu claims to have saved Tsyganko from an undisclosed mortal danger, and then to have conversed with him, trying to gain insight into his political motivations. The latter, he concluded, were [...] "most phantasmagorical socialist ideas", not dissuaded by the prospect of [...] "death, suffering, military disaster, sheer destitution, or degeneracy". He adds: [...] "It was late at night, I was experiencing chills, and so <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> insulted the convictions of this visionary youth, reassuring him that all opinions lead to a ministerial chair, provided one makes sure to discard them on cue." ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not wish}} to {{discourage}} him by saying that I did not think we had yet reached Crocker's, but <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a much better appreciation of our horse's slowness than he had.|$|R
60|$|I {{came to the}} plaza, crossed it, {{and then}} did not know which {{direction}} to take. Concluding {{that it did not}} matter I hurried on in an endeavor to reach the ranch before Steele. Although I was not sure, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> succeeded.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you will}} not; I shall {{wait till you}} are gone to bed, for I am sure Lionel and Johnny ought to know nothing about it. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better not have told you; but, Gerald, you are all <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> and <b>I</b> can't help telling you everything." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{publication}} on 30 August of the U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government’s Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21, 2013, President Obama {{gave a speech}} in the White House Rose Garden on 31 August in which {{he announced that he}} would seek authorization from Congress before using American military forces to intervene in the Syrian civil war. In the speech, he announced that he was [...] "prepared to give that order," [...] referring to ordering a strike on Syria. [...] Obama argued that it was necessary to intervene because the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria [...] "risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemicals weapons" [...] and that it put U.S. regional allies that share a border with Syria in danger. [...] In his speech, Obama also said that, [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective." [...] Introduction of S.J. Res. 21 in the Senate soon followed.|$|E

60|$|It {{was opened}} {{by an old}} man, whom <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen more than once since {{we had come to}} this village of York in {{converse}} with some of the red-coated officers, and even then I strove to pull Pierre back that we might make our escape in the darkness.|$|R
60|$|If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{been some}} years younger, what with shame, weariness, and disappointment, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> burst into tears. As it was, I {{could find no}} words, neither black nor white, but handed him the letter, {{and sat down to}} the {{porridge}} with as little appetite for meat as ever a young man had.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> lied again, if Mr. Gracedieu had {{not called}} me to the bedside.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is my business," [...] said Arthur, haughtily, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been invited}} here {{to attend to}} yours. Your wife is dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eight or nine dollars, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> mine charged; but it don't {{matter if}} you have n't got the money. I can lend you some." ...|$|E
60|$|HON. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{heard of}} all this; but, indeed, good Faithful was hardest put {{to it with}} Shame: he was an unwearied one.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{better not}} be there with Richard," [...] added Norman. [...] "I don't like coming into {{contrast}} with him, and I don't think he can like it, poor fellow, and it isn't his fault. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> rather stay another year here, {{get one of the}} open scholarships, and leave the Stoneborough ones for those who can do no better." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{started down}} toward the office, {{and on the way}} {{encountered}} another bosom friend, who told me that a quart of salt-water, taken warm, would come as near curing a cold as anything in the world. I hardly thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> room for it, but I tried it anyhow. The result was surprising. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thrown up my immortal soul.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor old cock! Look here, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better write, and {{say that}} I'm awfully touched and obliged, but that I can't come into his views, or break my word, and then, you know, he can just make another will. It would be a swindle to let him die, and come into his property, and then go dead against his wishes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not intend}} to do so until the very morning of the fight. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> that right within the terms of our wager." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had the {{pleasure}} of meeting Mr. Conolly," [...] said the Rev. George, formally, when they met. [...] "I am glad to see you." ...|$|E
60|$|Well! I {{told her}} I {{would do that}} at the last, if all else failed. She took my hand--my rough, coarse hand--and put it to her lips. She {{put it to the}} child's lips, and the child kissed it. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the {{strength}} of half a dozen men in me, from that moment, until the fight was over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> if {{you will}} excuse me, Mr. Knightley, {{if you will}} not {{consider}} me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and {{go out for a}} quarter of an hour.

We invalids think we are privileged people." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Those tins of soup," [...] said Hallett, [...] "have {{been really}} splendid. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> gained {{seven or eight}} pounds in weight, {{in spite of this}} sweltering heat." ...|$|E

60|$|Besides these {{striking}} {{suggestions of}} the Seer and the curate, however, I felt vaguely conscious of having seen and observed {{the man himself}} whom the water-colour represented, at some time, somewhere. It was not at Nice; it was not at Seldon; it was not at Meran; {{it was not in}} America. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been in a room with him somewhere in London.|$|R
60|$|And {{so long as}} Dr. John was absent, <b>I</b> really <b>believed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{courage to}} test him with such a question.|$|R
