She spoke of heating water electrically to house tropical fish {{at home in the}} early 1920s, and of having given talks on radio 2FC about tropical fish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> she was doing electrical contracting work. In January 1933 the American journal Aquariana published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.|$|E
25|$|One reason Olympic runners Cram and Coe {{found the}} {{challenge}} so tough {{is that they}} started at {{the middle of one}} side of the court, thereby having to negotiate four right-angle turns. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> students started at a corner, only three turns were needed.|$|E

As also reported, in the mid 16th century, the palace was guarded by 2000 men and the city had a garrison of 5000 men headed by Nammouth Chan, an Italian.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the attractions}} on the Newry Canal Way is Moneypenny's Lock, {{a site that}} {{includes}} an 18th-century lock-keeper's house, stables and bothy. This provided accommodation for workers on the canal and their horses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the canal {{was part of the}} industrial transport network. Today it is administered jointly by the Museum Services and the Lough Neagh Discovery Centre at Oxford Island.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> human {{muscles were}} the only power source {{available}} aboard ship, shanties served practical functions. The rhythm of the song served to synchronize {{the movements of the}} sailors or to pace the labor as they toiled at repetitive tasks. Singing helped to alleviate boredom and to lighten, perhaps, the psychological burden of hard work. Shanties may also be said to have served a social purpose, as to build camaraderie.|$|E

25|$|The 2004 film Stage Beauty {{concerns}} London theatre in the 17th {{century and}} is based on Jeffrey Hatcher's play Compleat Female Stage Beauty, which in turn was inspired by a reference in Pepys's diary to the actor Edward Kynaston, who played female roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> women were forbidden to appear on stage. Pepys is a character in the film and is portrayed as an ardent devotee of the theatre. Hugh Bonneville plays Pepys.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} sole purpose of Jamaica College from 1903 onwards was to train {{potential}} university students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the University of the West Indies did not exist, in practice most students did not go further than fourth or fifth forms. That was considered sufficient education for just about any managerial or clerical job in Jamaica. It was also considered uneconomical to run a school of less than eighty boys, and therefore a deliberate attempt to expand the school to include those of parents who were able to afford the fees was embarked upon. By the 1930s, the student population rose to over one hundred and fifty.|$|E
25|$|When these volunteers {{reached the}} city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the Taliban were evacuating, {{many of them}} were alone and confused. The group, chiefly {{consisting}} of teenage boys, gathered in the Sultan Razia Girls' School, where they began negotiating their surrender, but hundreds of them were ultimately killed. For almost two days as the group gathered in the abandoned Sultan Razia Girls' School and built up their fighting positions, the town officials and Northern Alliance attempted negotiations for their surrender, but the fighters vehemently refused, ultimately killing two peace envoys, one town mullah and a soldier escort. All the while they constantly fired at anyone who moved within the vicinity of the building, including civilian bystanders.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of using only whole {{numbers in the}} definitions comes from practical considerations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> only whole cycles {{could be counted on}} paper records. This leads to gaps in the definitions, as seen elsewhere on this page. The theoretical definitions have always been more carefully defined to include all frequencies. Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be – values for the upper end of alpha and lower end of beta include 12, 13, 14 and 15. If the threshold is taken as 14Hz, then the slowest beta wave has about the same duration as the longest spike (70ms), which makes this the most useful value.|$|E
25|$|Hatton {{became very}} wealthy {{as a result}} of his {{progressing}} career and the Queen's fondness for him, so much so that in 1583 he embarked on the construction of a magnificent house in Holdenby, Northamptonshire. It was, at the time, the largest privately owned Elizabethan house in England. It contained 123 huge glass windows, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> glass was very expensive (indeed, a good show of wealth was how many windows you could afford in your house). It had two great courts and was as large as the palace of Hampton Court. It was three storeys high and had two large state rooms, one for himself and another for the queen should she ever come and stay, which she never did.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Herod {{was king}} of Judea, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee to {{announce}} to a virgin named Mary, who was betrothed {{to a man}} named Joseph, that a child would be born {{to her and she}} was to name him Jesus, for he would be the son of God and rule over Israel forever. When the time of the birth drew near the Roman Emperor commanded a census of all the world, and Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem, the city of David, as he was of the House of David. So it came to pass that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and as there was no room in the town the infant was laid in a manger while angels announced his birth and shepherds worshiped him as Messiah and Lord.|$|E

25|$|In the {{obituary}} of Wason written for The Times newspaper, he {{was described as}} a political Radical. He was said to be a frequent speaker in the House of Commons (unlike his brother Cathcart) and usually gave expression to advanced radical views. On one important radical issue of the day, women’s suffrage, he himself claimed to have always voted in favour. His support of Home Rule all Round was also indicative of radical sentiments. However, after he left Parliament, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the old Liberal tradition was collapsing under the strains and stresses of party splits, the confusion of the electorate as to Liberal policy and the massive expansion of the electorate {{as a result of the}} Representation of the People Act 1918, Wason’s radicalism was tested. At the general elections of 1923 and 1924 in Wason’s home area of South Ayrshire no Liberal candidate could be persuaded to stand, leaving a straight fight between Labour and Conservative parties.|$|E
25|$|Corbett {{was born}} Bertie Oswald Corbett in Thame, Oxfordshire {{one of three}} sons of Rev. Elijah Bagot Corbett (Vicar of Thame 1872–1893). He was educated at Thame Grammar School and played soccer for Oxfordshire {{at the age of}} 15. He went on to Oxford University where he won his soccer blue. He later played soccer for the Corinthians and the Casuals, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the famous amateur side could beat {{professional}} teams. He played in the game against Bury which the Corinthians won 10–3 to take the Sheriff of London Charity Shield. The team which Bury put into the field that day contained nine of the eleven players which had beaten Derby County F.C. in the 1903 FA Cup final by 6–0. Corbett made one appearance for the English football team, against Wales on 18 March 1901, playing at outside left. England won the match 6–0 thanks to four goals from Steve Bloomer. Throughout his career he played at outside-left and was noted for his pace and body swerve. He is highly regarded for his first history of the club The Annals of the Corinthian F. C. written in 1906.|$|E
25|$|Squamish {{is a minor}} {{deepwater}} port. It was {{the original}} southern terminus of the BCR <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> it was the Pacific Great Eastern, and had a busy ferry terminal where travellers would disembark from ferries and steamers bringing them in from Vancouver harbour. In the 1960s what was then called the Squamish Highway was finally pushed through from Vancouver. This made the former steamer service unnecessary. Once a thriving forestry town, with recent cutbacks in logging along with the closure and dismantling of a major sawmill in 2004, Squamish has become a tourist destination and a commuter community for workers in nearby Whistler and Vancouver. The recent closure of the Woodfibre pulp mill in 2006 signals {{an end to the}} resource based economy here. Squamish is a world centre for rock climbing, with the 1500' bulk of the Stawamus Chief, a huge rock formation always busy with climbers, along with other formations overlooking downtown and the head of Howe Sound. In addition,the strong winds and flat waters at the upper end of Howe Sound have made Squamish a mecca for windsurfers, kite boarders and keelboat sailors.|$|E

500|$|The stadium {{has been}} altered and {{upgraded}} {{several times during}} its history, notably following a fire that destroyed the old City [...] Stand in 1984.

The stadium's record attendance since becoming an all-seater ground is 27,137, set during a Premier League match versus Newcastle United on 2 April 2016. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> fans could stand on terraces, Carrow Road saw a crowd of 43,984 when hosting Leicester City for an FA Cup match in 1963.|$|E
500|$|After his father's {{death in}} 1898, Chekhov bought {{a plot of}} land on the {{outskirts}} of Yalta and built a villa, into which he moved with his mother and sister the following year. Though he planted trees and flowers, kept dogs and tame cranes, and received guests such as Leo Tolstoy and Maxim Gorky, Chekhov was always relieved to leave his [...] "hot Siberia" [...] for Moscow or travels abroad. He vowed to move to Taganrog as soon as a water supply was installed there. In Yalta he completed two more plays for the Art Theatre, composing with greater difficulty than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he [...] "wrote serenely, the way I eat pancakes now".

[...] Earp was described in the promotional copy as [...] "Deputy Sheriff to Bat Masterson of Dodge City, {{known as one of}} the three greatest gun-men that ever lived, along with Bat Masterson and 'Wild Bill' Hickok". In reality, Earp was a virtually unknown assistant marshal in Dodge City when Wild Bill Hickok was murdered in 1876.|$|E
