It was {{against this background}} that risk factors for the occurrence and spread of HPAI H 5 N 1 among commercial poultry farms in the State were evaluated. A total of 64 farms comprising 32 affected (AF) and 32 non-affected (NAF) farms were enrolled for this study. Questionnaires were designed and administered to the selected farms through interviews with farm owners or farm managers during on-site visits. Information on flock profile including farm characteristics and environment, husbandry practices, biosecurity practices, farm trade practices and employee activities were obtained and analyzed. Pearson Chi square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Values of p< 0. 05 were considered significant. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to measure the strength and statistical significance of associations between the variables and occurrence and spread of HPAI H 5 N 1 in commercial poultry farms in the State.

40|$|The windcatcher {{system is}} a green {{architectural}} feature that uses natural ventilation to induce external airflow into residential buildings. This paper presents different configuration and ventilation strategies for the windcatcher to evaluate {{the performance of the}} system in relation to ventilation and indoor particle dispersion. A commercial computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code is used to evaluate the windcatcher's performance using different numbers of louvers and louver lengths. The effects of buoyancy and window positions on the system's performance are considered. The flow rate of air induced into the windcatcher is found to increase with the number of louver layers and the highest ventilation rate is reached when the louver length equates with the reference length. With respect to the buoyancy effect, the results show that the system performs well in stimulating airflow and removing contaminants when a window is positioned on the leeward side. A uniform and low particle concentration is created when a window is positioned on the leeward side. However, due to the high air velocity below the windcatcher, the general airflow distribution of the system is not uniform.

Objectives To determine the incidence of pressure ulcers in critically ill children, to compare the characteristics of patients in whom pressure ulcers do and do not develop, and to iden-tify prevention strategies associated with less frequent devel-opment of pressure ulcers. Methods Characteristics of 5346 patients in pediatric inten-sive care units in whom pressure ulcers did and did not develop were compared. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine which prevention strategies were associated with less frequent development of pressure ulcers. Results The overall incidence of pressure ulcers was 10. 2 %. Patients at greatest risk were those who were more than 2 years old; who were {{in the intensive care unit}} 4 days or longer; or who required mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventila-tion, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Strategies associated with less frequent development of pressure ulcers included use of specialty beds, <b>egg</b> <b>crates,</b> foam overlays, gel pads, dry-weave diapers, urinary catheters, disposable under-pads, body lotion, nutrition consultations, change in body position every 2 to 4 hours, blanket rolls, foam wedges, pil-lows, and draw sheets.

30|$|Numerous {{fretting}} damages {{exist at}} {{various parts of}} nuclear power systems [7], such as reactor fuel assembly, control rod assembly [8], reactor component, steam generator, pressure vessel [9], main pump, and coolant pump. The steam generator is a key equipment in nuclear power systems, and fretting damage {{is one of the}} main reasons [10] causing its failure. With high thermal strength, good corrosion resistance, anti-oxidation, and other characteristics, alloy 690 is extensively used in the nuclear power and aerospace fields. In nuclear power plants, U-tubes in the steam generator are supported by structures called <b>egg</b> <b>crates.</b> Flow-induced vibration of the U-tubes causes wear to occur on the zone of contact and generates combinations of impacting and sliding motions between the U-tube against the support [11 – 14]. Recently, most of the domestic and foreign studies on wear have concentrated on the sliding wear or bending behavior of the steam generator tubes. In another study, bending (four-point or three-point bending) has been used to determine the damage behavior of tubes or rods [15]. Gueout, et al [16] report that wear of pure sliding is larger than impact wear in the case of anti-vibration bar testing. In particular, the wear amount of impact sliding increase more than that of pure sliding or impact wear test. Jeong, et al [17], indicate that the friction coefficient in air is higher than that in water. The friction coefficient and wear rate increased as the temperature of water increase in the water environment. Chung, et al [18], conclude that the wear coefficient in ambient room temperature is lower than 80  °C in water conditions and explain that the protective nature of the tribologically transformed layers could decrease the wear volume. Most of study focus on the tangential fretting wear of alloy 690 tubes, and research on impact fretting wear of alloy 690 tubes is limited. The impact fretting wear behavior of alloy 690 is significant in the evaluation of the life of steam generator tubes in nuclear power plants and in better understanding the wear mechanisms of steam generator tube materials.|$|R

40|$|The first avian {{adenovirus}} (AAV) {{associated with}} clinical disease was isolated from {{an outbreak of}} respiratory disease in quail in 1950 (Olson, 1950). Since that time, AAVs {{have been found in}} all types and breeds of chickens and from a variety of other avian species. The infections may be asymptomatic or associated with several clinical and pathological conditions. Vertical transmission via the egg is the most common way of transmission. Also horizontal transmission through faeces, contaminated <b>egg</b> trays, <b>crates</b> and trucks {{play a role in the}} infection route. Studies have demonstrated the presence of antibodies in healthy poultry, and viruses have been isolated from normal birds. Avian adenoviruses in chickens are the etiological agents of 2 diseases known as inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) and hydropericardium syndrome (HP). In some cases each condition is observed separately, however, recently the 2 conditions have frequently been observed as a single entity; therefore, the name hepatitis hydropericardium has been widely used to describe the pathologic condition. The syndrome is an acute disease of young chickens associated with anemia, haemorrhagic disorders, hydropericardium and high mortality. Egg-Drop-Syndrome (EDS) is caused also by an adenovirus. The disease is characterised by a severe drop in egg production as well as the production of shell-less, thin-shelled, discoloured or misshapen eggs in apparently healthy birds. Ducks and geese are the natural host of the EDS virus. It was first described in chickens in the 1970 s and spread to several countries world wide. The birds usually do not show any other signs of disease, and mortality is not expected. There is no specific treatment of the AAV infections.
