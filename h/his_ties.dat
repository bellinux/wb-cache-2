5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Clarke decided not to run for {{re-election}} in 1883. He was losing too much support due to <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with the Hudson's Bay Company. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.|$|E

He shows {{the class that}} if he tightens <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> he looks more handsome. The kids find it very funny and encourage him to tighten <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> even more, and Stephen does so, which makes him choke the more tighter he pulls <b>his</b> <b>tie,</b> until he pulls <b>his</b> <b>tie</b> so tight that it rips in half. Stephen fears {{that he no longer}} looks good, but Mrs. Jewls says that it is what is on the inside that counts, so that if he needs to look important, he'll have to wear expensive underwear instead of a tight tie.|$|R

5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the officer corps. This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E
5|$|Turner met Johnny Stompanato {{during the}} spring of 1957, shortly after ending her {{marriage}} to Barker. After she discovered <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to the Los Angeles underworld (in particular, his association with gangster Mickey Cohen), she tried to break off the affair out of fear of bad publicity. Stompanato was not easily deterred, however, and {{over the course of the}} following year, they carried on a relationship filled with violent arguments, physical abuse, and repeated reconciliations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to mafia figures but did not result in any charges.

5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, {{in spite of his}} conservative militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies as a result of <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E

Murray won both of <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> against Donald Young and Sam Querrey respectively, helping Britain to their first Davis Cup quarterfinal since 1986. Murray's next tournament was the Rotterdam Open after {{receiving}} a late wild card, however he lost to Marin Čilić in straight sets in the quarterfinals. His following competition, the Mexican Open in Acapulco, ended in a semifinal defeat by Grigor Dimitrov in a thrilling three-setter that required two tiebreakers to decide the final two sets.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. After 1968, his {{political}} activities were {{centered on the}} PLP. The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam, but two other faculty members criticized the procedures. Putnam permanently severed <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with the PLP in 1972. In 1997, {{at a meeting of}} former draft resistance activists at Arlington Street Church in Boston, Putnam described his involvement with the PLP as a mistake. He said that he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{retired from}} his {{surveying}} work in 1800, for reasons unknown. Various reasons have been suggested; Jones {{was known as}} an extremely hard worker, and may have wanted less strenuous work as a farmer, <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to Joseph Brant may have been politically problematic as Brant was frequently in conflict with Upper Canada authorities, and {{his status as a}} loyalist to the British Empire may have come into question as it became known his brother in law, James Gage, had fought with the Americans during the revolution, and his brother Ebenezer may have as well. Whatever the cause of his retirement, Jones returned to his farm in Saltfleet Township and began life as a farmer.|$|E
5|$|On May 13, 1800, President John Adams {{appointed}} Harrison as {{the governor}} of the newly established Indiana Territory, based on <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to the west and seemingly neutral political stances. Harrison, caught unaware, was reluctant to accept the position until he received assurances from the Jeffersonians {{that he would not be}} removed from office after they gained power in the upcoming elections. After Harrison's governorship was confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he resigned from Congress to become the first Indiana territorial governor in 1801.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{became an}} agent {{representing}} hockey players in 1996. Along with investors, Orr purchased the Woolf Associates agency founded by Boston lawyer Bob Woolf. To prevent conflicts of interest, Orr sold {{an investment in}} the Lowell Lock Monsters minor pro hockey team and cut <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> {{with a credit card}} firm that had a contract with the NHLPA. Orr became a certified agent, although he would not be negotiating with hockey clubs. Player agent Rick Curran merged his agency with Orr's in 2000.

5|$|While al-Ma'mun's origin {{was less}} prestigious than the purely Arab al-Amin, <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to Khurasan and the Iranian-dominated eastern provinces were an {{important}} factor in his choice as heir. In contrast to the exclusively Arab-ruled Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid state was under heavy Iranian, and particularly Khurasani, influence. The Abbasid Revolution, which brought the Abbasids to power, originated in Khurasan, and the Abbasid dynasty relied heavily on Khurasanis as military leaders and administrators. Many of the original Khurasani Arab army (Khurasaniyya) that came west with the Abbasids were given estates in Iraq and the new Abbasid capital, Baghdad, and became an elite group known as the abnaʾ al-dawla ("sons of the state/dynasty"). Khurasan retained a privileged position among the Caliphate's provinces, and Harun al-Rashid in particular was careful to cultivate <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with the Iranian element of the Caliphate, not least through his promotion of the Khurasani Barmakid family to positions of power. Both al-Amin and al-Ma'mun had been tutored in their youth by the Barmakids, al-Amin by al-Fadl ibn Yahya and al-Ma'mun by Ja'far ibn Yahya. While al-Amin would distance himself from the Barmakids and become closely associated with the abnaʾ aristocracy of Baghdad, al-Ma'mun remained influenced by Ja'far and his associates.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was officially}} Drusus {{who was the}} heir to Tiberius, in practice, it was the Praetorian prefect Sejanus who was the second man in the empire. As early as AD 20, Sejanus had sought to {{strengthen}} <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to the imperial family by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of Claudius, Claudius Drusus. At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was prevented when the boy accidentally died {{a few days later}} of asphyxiation. Regardless, his ambition to further expand his power was clear.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV owed nominal {{allegiance}} to the Imperial Habsburgs {{as a member of}} the Order of the Golden Fleece. His relationship with the Habsburgs was relatively strong; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies, like France, he refused Cardinal Richelieu's 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them, despite potential lure of territorial gains in Silesia. He realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily Catholic Commonwealth, that he likely lacked the authority and power to push such a change of policy through the Sejm, and that the resulting conflict would be very difficult. From 1636 onward, for the next few years, Władysław strengthened <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with the Habsburgs.|$|E

5|$|After the Civil War {{began in}} 1861, {{the demand for}} horses {{increased}} and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them {{as far away as}} New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861 Anderson traveled south with brother Jim and Judge Baker, in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had stated to a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons, rather than loyalty to the Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing loyalty to the Union. One way that he sought to prove that loyalty was by severing <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam, having {{consolidated}} {{his control}} over Baghdad, now {{turned to face}} the threat posed by the Buyids. To this end, he strengthened <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> with the Baridis of Basra, by handing over Wasit, as previously agreed, appointing Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as vizier of the Abbasid court (although the latter remained at Wasit and did not visit Baghdad), and, finally, by marrying himself to one of al-Baridi's daughters. Bajkam's success against the Buyids was mixed: Wasit was saved from Buyid attack, and the Baridis led a successful campaign in Susiana, but an expedition into Jibal was crushed by the third Buyid brother, Hasan. The alliance with the Baridis quickly soured, however, as al-Baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing Bajkam, and ajkam was aware of this. In late August 940, Bajkam removed al-Baridi from the vizierate and launched an attack on Wasit, which the Baridis abandoned without resistance. In the meantime, the Baghdad was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace, with fanatical members of the Hanbali school imposing their tenets on the general populace.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Plamen Pavlov conjectures that Ivan the Russian was a Ruthenian {{born in the}} Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (centred {{on modern}} western Ukraine), a hypothesis based only on <b>his</b> <b>ties</b> to Hungary, the western neighbour of Galicia–Volhynia. Hungarian sources from 1288 make notice of one Russian named Ivan (Iwan dicto Oroz) as an ally of the ban of Severin, Theodore Vejtehi from the kindred Csanád, {{who was one of}} the nobles that opposed the rule of Charles I of Hungary in 1316–1317. The land to the south of Severin was governed for Bulgaria by the despot of Vidin, Michael Shishman, a supporter of Vejtehi. Thus, as the Hungarian king established his authority over Severin and suppressed Vejtehi's rebellion, Ivan the Russian may have fled to Vidin and entered the service of Michael Shishman. Ivan is thought to have been joined, as a commander subordinate to the despot of Vidin, by his personal forces which consisted of Hungarians and, presumably, Russians.|$|E
