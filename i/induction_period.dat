In this work, the sol of SDS@Fe 3 O 4 (named as SDS@Fe 3 O 4) were prepared and used as promoters in methane hydrate formation. Compared with SDS, SDS@Fe 3 O 4 produced much better promotion and the main superiority was that SDS@Fe 3 O 4 could significantly shorten the <b>induction</b> <b>periods</b> of hydrate formation. When SDS was used, the <b>induction</b> <b>periods</b> lasted about 40 - 60 min, while when SDS@Fe 3 O 4 was used at the same concentrations, hydrates nucleated within 10 min, especially, even no obvious <b>induction</b> <b>periods</b> were observed when SDS@Fe 3 O 4 was used in some experiments. Particle size showed significant influences on the promotion of SDS@Fe 3 O 4 to methane hydrate formation and smaller particles resulted in rapider hydrate formation.

It is proposed that generation of electron-hole pairs leads to a quenching of the electric field strength and consequent modification of the vacancy structure, leading to a decrease in the flux of cation vacancies across the barrier layer.

Releases of industrial, ship, and agricultural effluents in the river increased substantially, fish yields decreased, and toxic damage to marine organisms increased. Among the divers (16, 343 person-years follow-up from 18 years of age to year 2000), the observed/expected ratio for all tumors was 2. 29 (p < 0. 01).

But available techniques for detecting interaction do not account for residential mobility, nor do they evaluate sensitivity to <b>induction</b> and latency <b>periods.</b> This is an important problem for cancer, where latencies of a decade or more occur. Methods New case-only clustering techniques are developed that account for residential mobility, latency and <b>induction</b> <b>periods,</b> relevant covariates (such as age) and risk factors (such as smoking). The statistical behavior of the methods is evaluated using simulated data to assess type I error (false positives) and statistical power. These methods are applied to 374 cases from an ongoing study of bladder cancer in 11 counties in southeastern Michigan, and the ability of the methods to localize space-time interaction at the individual-level is demonstrated. Results Significant interaction is found for <b>induction</b> <b>periods</b> of ~ 5 years and latency ~ 19. 5 years. Data are still being collected and the observed clusters may be attributable to differential sampling in the study area. Conclusion Residential histories are increasingly available, raising the possibility of routine surveillance in a manner that accounts for individual mobility and that incorporates models of cancer latency and induction. These new techniques provide a mechanism for identifying those geographic locations and times associated with increases in cancer risk above and beyond that expected given covariates and risk factors in geographically mobile populations. </p...|$|R
