5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Twin Mountains <b>Formation</b> of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers <b>Formation</b> of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly <b>Formation</b> of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel <b>Formation</b> in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose <b>Formation</b> of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains <b>Formation.</b> This indicates that the Twin Mountains <b>Formation</b> lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers <b>Formation</b> contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly <b>Formation,</b> which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In the Abrahams Creek watershed, 94 {{percent of}} the rock is {{interbedded}} sedimentary rock. The remaining 6 percent is sandstone. The main rock formations in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Catskill <b>Formation,</b> the Llwellyn <b>Formation,</b> the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk <b>Formation,</b> and the Pocono <b>Formation.</b> These formations mainly consist of coal, limestone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone.

English Study Program, Dian Nuswantoro University. Advisor: Dr. Jumanto, Drs.,M. Pd. This thesis entitled A Contrastive Analysis between English Noun <b>Formations</b> with suffix and Their Indonesian Equivalents in the English Merriam Webster on-line dictionary, Bilingual printed dictionary by Enchols and shadily (2014), and Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI) on-line. This study directs {{to find the}} similarities and the differences.
