500|$|From my New Left years I took {{a love of}} {{political}} struggle. From my New Age years I took a conviction that politics needs to be about more than endless struggle– that responsible human beings need to search for reconciliation and healing and mutually acceptable solutions. From my time in the legal profession <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> understanding (and it is no small understanding) that sincerity and passion are not enough– that to be truly effective in the world one needs to be credible and expert.… ...|$|E
500|$|Paul {{returned}} to his private medical practice and managing several business ventures after losing the 1988 election; but by 1996, {{he was ready to}} return to politics, this time running on the Republican Party ticket again. He said that he had never read the entire Libertarian platform when he ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988, and that [...] "I worked for the Libertarians on my terms, not theirs." [...] He added that in terms of a political label he preferred to call himself [...] "a constitutionalist. In Congress <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> oath to uphold the Constitution, not the (Republican) platform." ...|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} fifth season of The X-Files, series creator Chris Carter noted, [...] "we {{knew we were}} going to be hitting these very {{dramatic}} marks which were the mythology episodes, and we wanted to lighten, or leaven, the season with quirky episodes." [...] Carter wanted to write a Frankenstein-inspired episode, but found it difficult to reconcile Mary Shelley's unbelievable tale with the style of the show. To achieve his vision, he wrote a script that blurred the real world with the X-Files reality and that had a distinct fantasy element. Carter combined elements of the original story with fairy tales and elements of folk tales. In order to make the episode [...] "as moving" [...] as possible, Carter sought to echo elements of James Whale's 1931 film version of Frankenstein. He later noted that, by [...] "using modern science, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> old style, which is black and white, and an old approach, which is a kind of James Whale approach to science fiction, and came up with a story about a love-lorn monster".|$|E

2500|$|Kaine {{personally}} opposes capital punishment, but {{presided over}} eleven executions while governor. Kaine said: [...] "I really struggled with [...] as governor. I {{have a moral}} position against the death penalty. But <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> oath of office to uphold it. Following an oath of office is also a moral obligation." [...] During his time in office he commuted one death sentence in June 2008, that of Percy Levar Walton to life imprisonment without parole on grounds of mental incompetence, writing that [...] "one cannot reasonably conclude that Walton is {{fully aware of the}} punishment he is about to suffer and why he is to suffer it" [...] and thus executing him would be unconstitutional. Kaine vetoed a number of bills to expand the death sentence to more crimes, saying: [...] "I do not believe that further expansion of the death penalty is necessary to protect human life or provide for public safety needs." [...] Some of the vetoes were overridden, while others were sustained.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>an</b> instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
