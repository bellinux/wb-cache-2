50|$|Straight-eight engines {{were used}} in {{expensive}} luxury and performance vehicles until after World War II. Bugattis and Duesenbergs commonly used double overhead cam straight-eight engines. Other notable straight-eight-powered automobiles were built by Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Isotta-Fraschini, Alfa Romeo, Stutz, Stearns-Knight and Packard. One marketing feature of these engines was their impressive length — some of the Duesenberg engines were over 4 ft long, resulting in the long <b>hoods</b> (<b>bonnets)</b> found on these automobiles.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle {{referred}} to as a full-size van is usually a large, boxy vehicle that has a platform and powertrain similar to their light truck counterparts. These vans may be sold with the space behind the front seats empty for transporting of goods (cargo van), or furnished for passenger use by either the manufacturer (wagon) or another company for more personal comforts, such as entertainment systems (conversion van). Full-size vans often have a very short <b>hood</b> (<b>bonnet),</b> with the engine block moved to within the passenger cabin.|$|R

50|$|Diesel {{switchers}} {{tend to have}} a high cab {{and often}} lower and/or narrower <b>hoods</b> (<b>bonnets)</b> containing the diesel engines, for all round visibility. Slugs are often used because they allow even greater tractive effort to be applied. Nearly all slugs used for switching are of the low hood, cabless variety. Good visibility in both directions is critical, because a switcher may be running in either direction; turning the locomotive is time-consuming. Some earlier diesel switchers used cow-calf configurations of two powered units in order to provide greater power.|$|R
5000|$|Automobiles {{are much}} more {{dangerous}} to pedestrians than they are to drivers and passengers. Two-thirds of 1.3 million yearly auto related deaths are pedestrians. Since at least the early 1970s, attention has also been given to vehicle design regarding the safety of pedestrians in car-pedestrian collisions. Proposals in Europe would require cars sold there to have a minimum/maximum <b>hood</b> (<b>bonnet)</b> height. From 2006 the use of [...] "bull bars", a fashion on 4x4s and SUVs, became illegal in the European Union, after having been banned on all new cars in 2002.|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{an outcome of}} the work carried out in doing and {{completing}} my final year project, Design and analysis <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> fairing for cars. The paper presents {{a model of the}} <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> fairing for cars that can reduce the drag coefficient of the car, model that been used is proton Iswara. The overall duty is modeling and analyzes to get the best model that can reduce the coefficient of drag of the proton Iswara because of the high drag force at front windscreen. It happen when the airflow at the windscreen is disturbed by car wiper during high speed. It is often that the wiper system generates unwanted noise and vibration during the high speed. The report starts off with an introduction in aerodynamics vehicle and design. Then proceed to investigation about the problem at the front windscreen to get information. After gathering all the relevant information, the project undergoes design process. In this steps, from the knowledge gathered before is use to make a design refers to case data that suitable for the project. Several sketches have been made and only a few have been selected based on the suitability of the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> and dimension of the windscreen. Based on the sketches, all the sketches will be draw into CAD software and simulate in the CFD software. At the end, the fairing that can reduce more coefficient of drag will be selected. The result shown by adding fairing at the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> will decrease the pressure and wind noise also can be reduced. Then, the airflow will smooth and the performance of the car greater than before...|$|R

Since the 1990s, crash engineers have begun to use design principles that have proved successful in protecting car occupants to develop vehicle design concepts that reduce the likelihood of injuries to pedestrians {{in the event of a}} car-pedestrian crash. These involve redesigning the bumper, <b>hood</b> (<b>bonnet),</b> and the windshield and pillar to be energy absorbing (softer) without compromising the structural integrity of the car.|$|R

50|$|The Ursaab {{design was}} {{improved}} by Sixten Sason in 1947, resulting in another prototype: the 92002. The most remarkable difference between 92001 and 92002 is the <b>hood</b> (<b>bonnet).</b> The earlier <b>hood</b> {{design and the}} use of a hood mechanism from an Opel Kadett made removal of the engine difficult, as one would have to turn it 90 degrees and bring out the drive package with the gearbox first. Inspired by American cars that had cascading front-ends, the redesigned hood allowed for improved access to the engine bay. After an additional four prototypes the design was ready for production as the Saab 92. Ursaab was first shown to the press on June 10, 1947 at Saab AB's headquarters.|$|R
