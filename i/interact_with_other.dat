5|$|Californium-249 {{is formed}} from the beta decay of berkelium-249, {{and most other}} {{californium}} isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> particles (high neutron cross-section).|$|E
5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others.|$|E

While the {{appearance}} and name of the pilot can be customized by the player, the player never gets to personally <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> characters in the game. The pilot is also never shown in the game's cinematics or any other media.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Golden Sun is a {{contemporary}} {{presentation of the}} traditional role-playing video game formula, in which the player controls a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful abilities and equipment, and take part in an ongoing narrative. Although many of the player's actions are compulsory, Golden Sun often allows the player to visit previous locations and complete certain objectives out of order.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and provide assistance in combat against enemies. As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player can move around the USS Voyager and <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> members of its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> drugs. For example, {{acetazolamide}} and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|The Lost Age {{presents}} a similar traditional role-playing video game formula that its first half pioneered. Players guide {{a cast of}} characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and {{take part in a}} building, predefined narrative. While many actions the player takes are compulsory and central to the story, The Lost Age allows the player to complete many objectives in the order of their choice, visiting previous locations to advance story elements and complete gameplay objectives are given a stronger emphasis than in the previous game.|$|E

5|$|Manning was {{ultimately}} charged with 22 offenses, including aiding the enemy, {{which was the}} most serious charge and could {{have resulted in a}} death sentence. She was held at the Marine Corps Brig, Quantico in Virginia, from July 2010 to April 2011, under Prevention of Injury status—which entailed de facto solitary confinement and other restrictions that caused domestic and international concern—before being transferred to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she could <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> detainees. She pleaded guilty in February 2013 to 10 of the charges. The trial on the remaining charges began on June 3, 2013, and on July 30 she was convicted of 17 of the original charges and amended versions of four others, but was acquitted of aiding the enemy. She was sentenced to serve a 35-year sentence at the maximum-security U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth. On January 17, 2017, President Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence to nearly seven years of confinement dating from her arrest on May 27, 2010 by military authorities.|$|E
