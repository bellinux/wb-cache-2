The next year, Witherspoon had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film S.F.W., directed by Jefery Levy.

The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the San Francisco Chronicle, with Mick LaSalle commenting, [...] "Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other." [...] Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and helped establish her as a rising star.

500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing.

500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

500|$|Following his transfer, Garland {{opened his}} stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against Bucknell, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes {{off the bench}} and {{recording}} 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running out, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E

Gamboa won the early rounds using his speed advantage, but Crawford eventually adjusted, knocking Gamboa down once in the 5th round, again in the 8th, and finally twice in the 9th to secure a TKO win. Crawford stated after the fight [...] "I was warming up, getting used to his style in the first couple of rounds.
