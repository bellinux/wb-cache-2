25|$|A {{majority}} of people do not start smoking at adulthood because of <b>informed</b> <b>decision-making.</b> As a result, much cigarette advertising was intended to target youth and depicted youths smoking and using tobacco {{as a form of}} leisure and enjoyment. Major cigarette companies would advertise their brands in popular TV shows such as The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies, which were watched by many children and teens. In 1964, after facing much pressure from the public, The Cigarette Advertising Code was created by the Tobacco companies, which prohibited advertising directed to youth.|$|E

According to the code of conduct, members should [...] "protect and advance the free flow of accurate and truthful information; foster <b>informed</b> <b>decision-making</b> through open communication... and work to strengthen the public's trust in the profession." [...] The code states that members [...] "adhere to the highest standards of accuracy and truth." [...] A story in CBS criticized the code: [...] "Show me a PR person who is 'accurate' and 'truthful,' and I'll show you a PR person who is unemployed." [...] The code of ethics has been revised in 1954, 1959, 1963, 1977, 1983, 1988 and 2000.|$|E

But who is really failing to consider how our money is spent? As Lomborg notes, [...] "We will never have enough money," [...] and therefore, [...] "Prioritization is absolutely essential."

40|$|ABSTRACT: CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: National health {{research}} systems aim to generate high-quality knowledge {{so as to}} maintain and promote the population's health. This study aimed to analyze the impact of maternal mortality/morbidity research funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and institutional partners, on the dimensions: advancing in knowledge, research capacity-building and <b>informing</b> <b>decision-making,</b> {{within the framework of}} the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study based on secondary data, conducted at a public university. METHODS: The advancing in knowledge dimension was estimated from the principal investigators' publication counts and h-index. Data on research capacity-building were obtained from the Ministry of Health's information system. The <b>informing</b> <b>decision-making</b> dimension was analyzed from citations in Stork Network (Rede Cegonha) documents. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2010, R$ 21. 6 million were invested in 128 maternal mortality/morbidity projects. Over this period, the principal investigators published 174 articles, resulting in an h-index of 35, thus showing progress in the advancing in knowledge dimension. Within the research capacity-building dimension, training of 71 students (undergraduate/postgraduate) was observed. Progress in the <b>informing</b> <b>decision-making</b> dimension was modest: 73. 5 % of the 117 citations in the Stork Network documents were institutional documents and norms. One of the projects funded, the 2006 / 7 National Demography and Health Survey, was cited in program documents. CONCLUSION: Impacts were shown in the advancing in knowledge and research capacity-building dimensions.

40|$|In {{the energy}} realm {{there is a}} {{pressing}} need to make decisions in a complex world characterized by biophysical limits. Exergy has been promoted as a preferred means of characterizing the impacts of resource consumption and waste production {{for the purpose of}} improving decision-making. This paper provides a unique and critical analysis of universal and comprehensive formulations of the chemical exergy reference environment, for the purpose of better understanding how exergy can <b>inform</b> <b>decision-making.</b> Four related insights emerged from the analysis, notably: (1) standard and universal chemical exergy reference environments necessarily encounter internal inconsistencies and even contradictions in their very formulations; (2) these inconsistencies are a result of incompatibility between the exergy reference environment and natural environment, and the desire to model the exergy reference environment after the natural environment so as to maintain analytical relevance; (3) the topics for which exergy is most appropriate as an analytical tool are not well served by comprehensive reference environments, and (4) the inconsistencies point to a need for deeper reflection of whether it is appropriate to adopt a thermodynamic frame of analysis for situations whose relevant characteristics are non-thermodynamic (e. g., to characterize scarcity). The use of comprehensive reference environments may lead to incorrect recommendations and ultimately reduce its appeal for <b>informing</b> <b>decision-making.</b> Exergy may better <b>inform</b> <b>decision-making</b> by returning to process dependent reference states that model specific processes and situations for the purpose of engineering optimization...|$|R
