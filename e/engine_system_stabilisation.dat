40|$|Testing of a {{powerpack}} configuration (turbomachinery and {{gas generator}} assembly) {{and the first}} complete <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> of the liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen propellant J- 2 X rocket engine have been completed at the NASA Stennis Space Center. The combustion stability characteristics of the gas generator assemblies on these two systems are of interest for reporting since considerable effort was expended to eliminate combustion instability during early development of the gas generator assembly with workhorse hardware. Comparing the final workhorse gas generator assembly development test data to the powerpack and <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> test data provides an opportunity to investigate how the nearly identical configurations of gas generator assemblies operate with two very different propellant supply systems one the autonomous pressure-fed test configuration on the workhorse development test stand, the other the pump-fed configurations on the powerpack and <b>engine</b> <b>systems.</b> The development of the gas generator assembly {{and the elimination of}} the combustion instability on the pressure-fed workhorse test stand have been reported extensively in the two previous Liquid Propulsion Subcommittee meetings 1 - 7. The powerpack and <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> testing have been conducted from mid- 2011 through 2012. All tests of the powerpack and <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> gas generator systems to date have been stable. However, measureable dynamic behavior, similar to that observed on the pressure-fed test stand and reported in Ref. [6] and attributed to an injection-coupled response, has appeared in both powerpack and <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> tests. As discussed in Ref. [6], these injection-coupled responses are influenced by the interaction of the combustion chamber with a branch pipe in the hot gas duct that supplies gaseous helium to pre-spin the turbine during the start transient.
