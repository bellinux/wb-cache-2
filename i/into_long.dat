5|$|Carlton Hill's {{pattern of}} {{development}} {{was defined by}} the long-established structure of land ownership around Brighton, whereby land was divided <b>into</b> <b>long,</b> narrow strips with many different owners. This encouraged the development of terraced housing—the predominant housing pattern until the council undertook large-scale demolition and high-density rebuilding in the mid-20th century. This work introduced more open space and varied land uses: Brighton Art College was able to expand into the area, and American Express opened a large, visually dominant headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Roanoke Regional {{features}} a large surface parking lot, which is divided <b>into</b> <b>long</b> term (996 spaces) and short term (226 spaces) parking. An additional 598 parking spaces {{are available in}} an overflow lot across Aviation Drive during peak travel times. In service since 1990, a small parking shuttle bus operates every 10 to 15 minutes between 6 a.m. and midnight. Future improvements to the parking areas {{will result in the}} construction of a multi-level parking garage atop the site of the existing long term lot.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien devised several {{themes that}} were reused in {{successive}} drafts of his legendarium, beginning with The Book of Lost Tales, written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during The Battle of the Somme.

5|$|After being underfed {{and forced}} <b>into</b> <b>long,</b> grueling marches through rough terrain {{for nearly two}} months, the Batetela in Dhanis' column mutinied against their {{officers}} in February 1897. The mutiny {{broke out in the}} advance guard, which had been pushed the hardest of those in the expedition, but soon spread to the main army, where the massively outnumbered Belgian officers were detained by their men and killed. Dhanis himself escaped the massacre by hiding in the forest, although his brother did not manage to survive. The now disbanded army went on to rampage throughout the immediate area, terrorizing the northern Congo and causing great consternation among the Belgian officials whose jobs it was to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed <b>into</b> <b>long</b> straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Pilgrim {{numbers have}} greatly {{increased}} in recent years, {{which has led}} to numerous accidents and deaths due to overcrowding. The first major accident during Hajj in modern times occurred in 1990, when a tunnel stampede led to the death of 1,462 people. Afterwards, various crowd-control techniques were adopted to ensure safety. Because of large crowds, some of the rituals have become more symbolic. For example, it is no longer necessary to kiss the Black Stone. Instead, pilgrims simply point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba. Also, the large pillars used for pebble throwing were changed <b>into</b> <b>long</b> walls in 2004 with basins below to catch the stones. Another example is that animal sacrifice is now done at slaughterhouses appointed by the Saudi authorities, without the pilgrims being present there.|$|E

5|$|Within {{eukaryotic}} cells DNA {{is organized}} <b>into</b> <b>long</b> structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated {{in the process}} of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.|$|E

25|$|Traditional noodles—lokshen—are {{made from}} a dough of flour and eggs rolled into sheets and then cut <b>into</b> <b>long</b> strips. If the dough is cut into small squares, it becomes farfel. Both lokshen and farfel are usually boiled and served with soup.|$|E
25|$|The diphthongs all {{transformed}} {{over the}} historical period. Ai and oi changed <b>into</b> <b>long</b> ī and eu merged with ou, both becoming long ō. Ei became long ē.
