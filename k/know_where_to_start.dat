In this paper we present an approach for identifying candidate classes for {{reverse engineering}} and reengineering efforts. Our solution is based on summarizing the changes in the evolution of object-oriented software systems by defining history measurements. Our approach, named Yesterday's Weather, is an analysis based on the retrospective empirical observation that classes which changed the most in the recent past also suffer important changes in the near future. We apply this approach on two case studies and show how we can obtain an overview of the evolution of a system and pinpoint its classes that might change in the next versions...|$|R

They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought that things were not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> looking for point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E

Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain".

Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

Fiona has moved on to a new job with her new bounty hunter boyfriend. Sam and Jesse continue to help Michael despite, or perhaps because of, intrusions on their personal and professional lives.

It doesn't take long for Michael to find out that James works for peace and justice in the world, but uses extreme methods to get what he wants. After Michael kills Sonya to protect Fiona, James sends his men to kill Maddie, Charlie, and Jesse.

40|$|It’s not {{uncommon}} in nursing circles, whether in practice or academe, to see eyes roll back and mouths utter words of anguish when those proposing a solution or new initiative know that leaders will expect solid financial rationale {{as an integral part}} of the proposal. For many historical and contextual reasons, nurses and nursing have often shied away from putting serious effort into the development of financial expertise. What is now incredibly clear is that if one expects to be “at the table” influencing key decisions affecting healthcare, then the development of one’s own financial acumen is an imperative. Developing expertise involves both a basic understanding of financial/accounting principles as well as the ability to use financial information to think strategically and realistically about the pros and cons of various decisions. In addition, all leaders need an in depth understanding of how healthcare is reimbursed and which levers can be used to maximize revenues while protecting resources that most ensure the quality and safety of patient care.

40|$|Incentives for {{coral reef}} {{resource}} use have, historically, been skewed toward extractive options that yield private returns, and against protection options that provide predominantly public good benefits.
