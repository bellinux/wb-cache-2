25|$|The ecclesial union {{engineered}} by Michael VIII was never popular in Byzantium, and, {{after his death}} (December 11, 1282), his son and successor, Andronicus II, repudiated it. On the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas,</b> 1282, John Bekkos withdrew to a monastery; the former patriarch, Joseph I, was brought into the city on a stretcher, {{and a series of}} councils and public meetings ensued, led by a group of anti-unionist monks. Bekkos, in fear of violent death {{at the hands of a}} mob, was induced to sign a formal renunciation of his unionist opinions and of his priesthood (January, 1283), a renunciation which he afterwards disowned as extorted under duress, but which was used against him. After this, Bekkos spent some years under house arrest at a large monastery in Prusa in Asia Minor. From there, he began a literary campaign to exonerate himself, and succeeded in having a council called to reexamine his case; it took place at the imperial palace of Blachernae in Constantinople, meeting in several sessions from February to August in the year 1285. Although the Council of Blachernae reaffirmed Bekkos’s earlier condemnation, in the council’s aftermath Bekkos, by a series of writings, succeeded in bringing its dogmatic statement against him (the Tomus of 1285) into such disrepute that its principal author, the Patriarch Gregory II, resigned (1289). Bekkos saw this as vindicating his position. He spent the remaining years of his life in prison in the fortress of St. Gregory, revising his writings, maintaining friendly relations with the Emperor and prominent Byzantine churchmen, but unwilling to give up his unionist opinions; he died in 1297.|$|E
500|$|While the Browns {{came into}} 1954 {{as one of}} the top teams in the NFL, the future was far from certain. Graham, whose {{leadership}} and throwing skills were instrumental in the Browns' championship runs, said he planned to retire after the season. Motley, the team's best rusher and blocker, retired at the beginning of the season with a bad knee. Star defensive lineman Bill Willis also retired before the season. Still, Cleveland finished the regular season 9–3 and met Detroit the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas</b> in the championship game for a third consecutive time. This time Cleveland dominated on both sides of the ball, intercepting Bobby Layne six times while Graham threw three touchdowns and ran for three more. The Browns, who lost the last game of the regular season to the Lions only a week before, won their second NFL championship 56–10. [...] "I saw it, but still hardly can believe it", Lions coach Buddy Parker said after the game. [...] "It has me dazed." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, [...] "Kvo, kvo, kvo", with the family's children imitating chicks, [...] "Piju, piju, piju", while they pick at the straw. In Čečava, northern Bosnia, the children then {{lie down on the}} straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year. In the Bay of Kotor, the ceremony is accompanied by the words [...] "Kuda slama, tuda slava"—"Whither straw, thither celebration." [...] A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw. It will be collected and taken out of the house {{on the morning of the}} second <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas.</b> Some of the straw may be set aside and used in apotropaic practices in the coming year.|$|E

2500|$|Druids {{began to}} figure widely {{in popular culture}} with the first advent of Romanticism. Chateaubriand's novel Les Martyrs (1809) narrated the doomed love of a druid priestess and a Roman soldier; though Chateaubriand's theme was the triumph of Christianity over pagan druids, the setting was to {{continue}} to bear fruit. Opera provides a barometer of well-informed popular European culture in the early 19th century: in 1817 Giovanni Pacini brought druids to the stage in Trieste with an opera to a libretto by Felice Romani about a druid priestess, La Sacerdotessa d'Irminsul ("The Priestess of Irminsul"). The most famous druidic opera, Vincenzo Bellini's Norma was a fiasco at La Scala, when it premiered the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas,</b> 1831; but in 1833 it was a hit in London. For its libretto, Felice Romani reused some of the pseudo-druidical background of La Sacerdotessa to provide colour to a standard theatrical conflict of love and duty. The story {{was similar to that}} of Medea, as it had recently been recast for a popular Parisian play by Alexandre Soumet: the chaste goddess (casta diva) addressed in Normas hit aria is the moon goddess, worshipped in the [...] "grove of the Irmin statue".|$|E

2500|$|In August he {{was officially}} {{transferred}} to Company E, 2d Battalion, 506PIR. A fellow soldier {{and author of}} his own World War II experiences, David Kenyon Webster also took note of Clancy and described him as, [...] "very young, likable, and chatty." [...] Webster also recorded their Platoon Sergeant Floyd Talbert's view of Clancy as, [...] "a bright and eager younger brother who....would turn into a great soldier." [...] Introduced with Clancy was Mike Massaconi, who Clancy would call his closest buddy during the war. [...] In September 1944, Clancy jumped in the daring but doomed Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands. He {{was wounded in the}} leg in fighting there in October. [...] Clancy recovered from his wound and returned to his unit now located at Mourmelon, France. In December they were moved to the front in Belgium and fought in Bastogne, Belgium into January 1945. During the fighting there he was wounded a third time. It happened on the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas</b> - December 26, 1944. He was wounded in the head. It was bandaged up and he was further treated for his wound in a building. It would be the only time he saw the inside of a building during the entire Bastogne campaign.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-December 2007, Giuliani {{was keeping}} to his {{strategy}} of campaigning in big {{states such as}} New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, Illinois, Missouri, and other Super Duper Tuesday states, while the other contenders focused on the earlier states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. However, the strategy was now seen as at risk. [...] Not only were his poll numbers in the early states falling — despite an attempt {{for a while to}} boost his standing in New Hampshire with $3 million of radio and television advertising, which ended up not having any effect — but he had lost his national lead and had fallen into statistical ties with Mike Huckabee. [...] Most dangerously, his lead in Florida, the first state that he planned to heavily contest, was dwindling as well. [...] Furthermore, changes in Giuliani's campaign messaging went largely unnoticed by the press, given that they were focused on Iowa and New Hampshire developments. [...] Giuliani's woes were further symbolized when he got sick with flu-like symptoms during a campaign flight and was admitted overnight to Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri as a precaution. [...] Giuliani resumed limited campaigning in subsequent days; the campaign would not give precise details of tests done; Giuliani then stated it had been a [...] "terrible headache", not flu, and a full medical report would be given after Christmas; but the health question had become an ongoing campaign story. [...] Giuliani did indeed get {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor on the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas,</b> but again a minor amount of political damage had been done.|$|E
2500|$|The Army of the Cumberland marched {{southeast}} the <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas</b> {{in three}} columns, or [...] "wings", towards Murfreesboro, {{and they were}} effectively harassed by Wheeler's Confederate cavalry along the way, which delayed their movements. Although Rosecrans had reported his army to have 81,729 effectives in Nashville, his force on the march was barely {{more than half of}} that since he needed to protect his base and supply lines from the harassment of the Confederate cavalry. The left wing of 14,500 men under Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden (divisions of Brig. Gens. Thomas J. Wood, John M. Palmer, and Horatio P. Van Cleve) took a route that was parallel to the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, passing through La Vergne and south of Smyrna. The right wing of 16,000 men under Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook (divisions of Brig. Gens. Jefferson C. Davis, Richard W. Johnson, and Philip H. Sheridan) marched south along the Nolensville Turnpike to Nolensville, south to Triune, and then eastward to Murfreesboro. The center wing of 13,500 men under Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas (divisions of Maj. Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau and Brig. Gens. James S. Negley, Speed S. Fry, and Robert B. Mitchell) moved south along the Wilson Turnpike and the Franklin Turnpike, parallel to the Nashville and Decatur Railroad, then eastward through Nolensville and along the same route used by Crittenden south of the Nashville and Chattanooga. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. David S. Stanley (a single cavalry division under Col. John Kennett) preceded each of the three columns. The separation of the wings was designed to conduct a turning movement against Hardee at Triune, but when the U.S. march began, Bragg moved Hardee back to Murfreesboro to avoid a confrontation.|$|E
