In this article we describe a mayor improvement in the structural behaviour of glass panels by making the glass curved, or more accurately, corrugated. Both the in- and out-plane loading meet far more resistance against deformation, and the corrugated glass panels have a largely increased bearing capacity with the same thickness of glass the flat panel has.

40|$|Accurate {{modelling}} of the behaviour {{of crack}} propagation {{has important implications}} {{in the design and}} risks assessment of glazing façade when subject to extreme load conditions. This paper presents an investigation into the propagation of cracks <b>in</b> annealed <b>glass.</b> The investigation involved physical experimentation using a high-speed camera to capture the propagation of cracks <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> <b>panels</b> <b>in</b> response to static and impact loading. The physical experimentation revealed that cracks initiated from impact loading did not propagate continuously as in static conditions. Instead, the crack could stop propagating and then restart following a short pause. This phenomenon was investigated numerically through simulation of crack propagation by incorporating fracture mechanics theory into the finite element model. The finite element analyses were based on a discrete crack model which employed an advance re-meshing technique. The re-meshing modelling technique involved the following steps: (i) calculation of stress intensities surrounding the tip of the crack; (ii) identification of the location of the propagating 'crack tip'; (iii) re-meshing of the finite element model. Results from the analyses are presented and interpreted in this paper...|$|R
