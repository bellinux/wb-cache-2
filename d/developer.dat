Thus, the true power of testing visualizations lies not only with the faults that visualizations can highlight; it also lies in how visualizations can change how <b>developers</b> think about testing.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{seeks to}} find {{characteristics}} {{of relationships between}} <b>developers</b> within various clusters of FLOSS ecosystems. We have mined the repository of the open source programming language Ruby, and linked <b>developers</b> and projects {{on the basis of}} collaboration. We used Social Network Analysis, and more specifically, the concept of modularity to expose underlying clusters or sub-communities. A survey was constructed to aid in the qualitative part of this research. The data shows that Ruby’s ecosystem consist mostly of single <b>developers</b> who work independently. <b>Developers</b> within clusters of a few <b>developers</b> often have personal relationships formed through friendship, work and the open source community. Personal relationships formed through the open source community grow as clusters consist of more <b>developers.</b> <b>Developers</b> in clusters with large number of <b>developers</b> are often unaware of friend-of-friend relationships. Project administrators, however, fail to list <b>developers</b> that contribute through pull/request issues as authors, making data on Ruby’s repository incomplete...|$|R

Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic. Citing the user license agreement, Blizzard closed discussion threads about the film and prohibited links to it. Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form. Discussion ensued about boundaries between MMORPG player and <b>developer</b> control.

Existing treatment of the location of economic activity between cities either ignore <b>developers</b> entirely (e. g. Stiglitz 1977) or endow them with limitless power (e. g., Henderson 1988). Reality lies somewhere in between; most cities have been partly shaped by the actions of <b>developers,</b> but even the largest <b>developers</b> are limited. In this paper organizational limits to <b>developers</b> are discussed, and a model of a system of cities is presented in which a land assembly problem may prevent <b>developers</b> from acquiring efficient amounts of land. We examine the consequences of land assembly for land prices, city sizes, and infrastructure provision.
