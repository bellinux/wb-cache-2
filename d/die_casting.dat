5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> {{also known}} as direct-injection <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> or runnerless <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> is a zinc <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E

40|$|Understanding tensile and {{fracture}} {{behaviors of}} <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> magnesium alloys is {{of importance for}} proper design of various emerging automotive applications. In the present study, magnesium alloy AM 50 was high pressure <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> into rectangular coupons with section thicknesses of 2, 6, and 10 [*]mm. Effect of section thicknesses on strain-hardening and fracture behaviors of the <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 50 was investigated. The results of tensile testing indicate that the tensile properties including yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and elongation (Ef) decrease with increasing section thicknesses of <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 50. The analysis of true stress versus strain curves shows that the straining hardening rates during the plastic deformation of the alloy increase with decreasing section thicknesses. The observation via SEM fractography illustrates that the fracture behavior of <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AM 50 is influenced by section thicknesses. As the section thickness increases, the fracture of AM 50 tends to transit from ductile to brittle mode due to increasing porosity content and coarsening microstructure...|$|R

5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is {{the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E

5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|Bosses {{are added}} to die {{castings}} to serve as stand-offs and mounting points for parts that {{will need to be}} mounted. For maximum integrity and strength of the <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> bosses must have universal wall thickness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Die</b> <b>casting</b> {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
40|$|A 380 alloy with a {{relatively}} thick cross-section of 25 mm was squeeze cast using a hydraulic press with an applied pressure of 90 MPa. Microstructure and tensile properties of the squeeze cast A 380 were characterized and evaluated {{in comparison with the}} <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> counterpart. Results show that the squeeze cast A 380 possesses a porosity level much lower than the <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> alloy, which is disclosed by both optical microscopy and the density measurement technique. The results of tensile testing indicate the improved tensile properties, specifically ultimate tensile strength (UTS: 215. 9 MPa) and elongation (Ef: 5. 4 %), for the squeeze cast samples over those of the conventional high-pressure <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> part (UTS: 173. 7 MPa, Ef: 1. 0 %). The analysis of tensile behavior shows that the squeeze cast A 380 exhibits a high tensile toughness (8. 5 MJ·m- 3) and resilience (179. 3 kJ·m- 3) compared with the <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> alloy (toughness: 1. 4 MJ·m- 3, resilience: 140. 6 kJ·m- 3), despite that, during the onset of plastic deformation, the strain-hardening rate of the <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> specimen is higher than that of the squeeze cast specimens. The microstructure analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that both the squeeze and <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> specimens contain the primary α-Al, Al 2 Cu, Al 5 FeSi phase and the eutectic Si phase. But, the Al 2 Cu phase present in the squeeze cast alloy is relatively large in size and quantity. The SEM fractography evidently reveals the ductile fracture features of the squeeze cast A 380 alloy...|$|R

5|$|<b>Die</b> <b>casting</b> is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E

5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
