60|$|While {{we cannot}} explain these things, that door, at least, between the gallery and the gallery chamber, {{excluded}} James {{from most of}} his friends. Can the reader believe that he purposely had that door locked, we know not how, or by whom, on the system of compelling Gowrie to ‘come and be killed’ {{by way of the}} narrow staircase? Could we see Gowrie House, and its ‘secret ways,’ as it then was, we might understand this problem of the locked doors. Contemporary criticism, as minutely recorded by Calderwood, found no fault with the number of locked doors, but only asked ‘how could the King’s fear but increase, perceiving Mr. Alexander’ (the Master) ‘ever to lock the doors behind them?’ If the <b>doors</b> <b>closed</b> with <b>spring</b> locks (of which the principle had long been understood and used), the King may not have been aware of the locking. The problem cannot be solved; we only disbelieve that the King himself had the door locked, to keep his friends out, and let Gowrie in.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a <b>door</b> <b>closer</b> which has a <b>closing</b> <b>spring</b> for automatically <b>closing</b> the <b>door.</b> When the door is opened manually, the <b>closing</b> <b>spring</b> is compressed. An opening resistance is thus produced. The <b>door</b> is then <b>closed</b> automatically through {{the action of the}} <b>closing</b> <b>spring.</b> To obtain greater operating convenience, the invention strives to achieve as low an opening resistance in the <b>door</b> <b>closer</b> as possible when the door is opened manually, but nevertheless <b>closing</b> the <b>door</b> reliably during the closing process. This problem is solved {{by the fact that the}} characteristic of the torque acting on the leaf and depending on the rotary angle of the leaf is different for opening than for closing as a result of the interaction of the sliding spring with a control curve which has separate curve sections for opening and closing. This is achieved by a gear wheel in the form of a cam gear interacting with the <b>closing</b> <b>spring</b> with one opening cam and one closing cam. The separate control curve section for opening is on the opening cam and the separate control curve section for closing is on the closing cam. Between the <b>closing</b> <b>spring</b> and the opening and closing cams there is a pressure piece controlled by a switching spring...|$|R
60|$|A noise {{fell upon}} his ear. He was all {{attention}} in an instant. The alley <b>door</b> <b>closed</b> softly. He <b>sprang</b> {{to the corner}} of the brick store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men would get away with the box and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> The {{operation of}} the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working door open and <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, {{the door open and}} <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are used to manually open or <b>close</b> the <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons immediately <b>closing</b> the <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so the <b>door</b> cannot be <b>closed</b> until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button has no effect. However, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> will immediately <b>close</b> the <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in the US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

40|$|<b>Door</b> <b>closing</b> {{sound is}} one of the most {{influential}} parameters to the customer while buying a car. It {{is one of}} the first impressions one can get while interacting with the vehicle and this contributes to the overall quality perception. Thus, it is very interesting for automotive developers to understand the influence of several parameters on the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound quality. Various experimental and simulation research has already been performed in this field. This thesis is focusing on the experimental part, where classical methodologies, such as standard vibration and acoustical measurements were applied. However, alternative methods, like the acoustic camera, have hardly ever been used. The acoustic camera is typically implemented to measure stationary sound sources. On the other hand, the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound is a transient phenomenon. In this thesis, both, the classical and the acoustic camera approach were used to develop a methodology to quantify the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound quality. The measurements with the acoustic camera identified various sound sources, distributed over the complete door. The main hot-spots are localized at the striker and around the junction of the upper rail and the B-pillar. The other sources are less contributing to the overall <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound. These results have been used to choose adequate measurement positions for accelerometers and were ultimately verified by the classical approach. Based on that, the influence of variations of the door seal stiffness and the inclination of the car were investigated. The main outcome of this was that the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound can be damped or amplified within certain frequency ranges by changing these parameters...|$|R
