40|$|Small, {{informal}} enterprises play {{an important}} role in shaping the growth of a developing economy undergoing a process of structural reforms. The informal sector as defined in the resolution of the 15 th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), January 1993, consists of unincorporated household enterprises which differ from formal enterprises in terms of technology, economies of scale, use of labor intensive processes, and virtual absence of well maintained accounts. Although the informal sector has been characterized as above, no clear-cut operational <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> is available for the purpose of data collection. In India and in other developing countries in Asia and the Pacific, however, the “unorganized ” segment of the economy closely approximates the ICLS concept of the informal sector. The unorganized segment is labor intensive and provides employment to a sizable section of the population. This paper examines the problems of measuring the unorganized sector and explains the approach taken by the Indian Central Statistical Office. The size of the informal sector is examined in terms of the employment it generates and its contribution to value added...|$|E

40|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) in 2008, Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) has been using the same methodology to derive the <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> employment throughout the years, focusing on the enterprise registration status to classify workers (which include both self-employed and employees) as either formal or <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> workers. Although there are difficulties with attempting to provide any consistent trend data (Yu, 2007 & Essop & Yu, 2008), it is generally accepted that <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> employment grew relatively more rapidly in the late 1990 s, and then stabilized at about 2 million in the early 2000 s before it increased (albeit more slowly) again since 2005. Nonetheless, recent papers by Devey, Skinner & Valodia (2006) as well as Heintz & Posel (2008) argue that the current classifications used by Stats SA hide a significant degree of informality in the formal economy, as some formal jobs are characterized by conditions that are typical <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> work. Therefore, they propose alternative <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> employment, focusing on worker characteristics instead of enterprise characteristics. This paper aims to address the reliability or otherwise of these recent approaches, as well as to suggest better ways to define <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> employment.

Registered workers are eligible to social security benefits which include health insurance, pension, child care, housing loans, life and work-risk insurance and access to sports and cultural facilities.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} effects of schooling on earnings and employment in the <b>informal</b> private <b>sector,</b> compared {{with those in the}} public and formal private sectors, in South Africa. The estimations are conducted by race and gender as well to examine the difference between various subgroups. The research also examines the heterogeneity in returns to schooling. The returns to schooling are estimated using two-stage least squares with multinomial two-step selection corrections to control for both endogeneity of schooling and sector sample selection bias. Quantile regression and piecewise linear spline function methods were applied to deal with the heterogeneity of the returns to schooling. Moreover, the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was conducted to explore the contribution of returns to schooling and educational endowments to wage differentials between sectors. To analyze {{the effects of}} schooling on the probability of employment in different sectors of the economy, multinomial logit and probit models were estimated. The instrumental variable probit model was also used to control for the endogeneity of schooling. Even after controlling for both endogeneity of schooling and sample selection bias, a significant difference was found in returns to schooling between the formal and <b>informal</b> private <b>sectors.</b> Returns to schooling in the formal private sector are higher than those in the <b>informal</b> private <b>sector</b> in general. These findings apply across race and gender, except for Whites and Asians whose sample size in the <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> was too small. They were robust even after controlling for district, industry, and occupation, and using different <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> <b>sector.</b> Therefore, the dissertation concludes that formal private and informal private labor markets are segmented in terms of returns to schooling in South Africa. The study also showed a positive effect of schooling on employment in the public and formal private sectors versus employment in the <b>informal</b> private <b>sector.</b> The effect of schooling on employment in the formal private sector - when compared to that in the <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> - was much stronger for females than males, except for Whites and Asians.

We define the level of financial development as the fraction of external finance over total income in the formal sector and show in a theoretical model that there exists an inverted-U relationship between the level of financial development and the size <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> <b>sector.</b> The effects <b>of</b> informality on financial sector repression in the presence of financial sector capacity constraints is central to our theory. Specifically, for a given state of institutional development we show that high levels <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> activity increases the level of financial repression in the formal financial sector and therefore suppressing the <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> size benefits the level of financial development in the economy. However, if the initial level <b>of</b> <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> size is small enough, the losses due to financial repression are negligible in the formal financial sector. In this latter case, if the capacity constraints of the formal financial institutions are binding, lowering the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> <b>sector</b> would retard the level of financial development. We also support our theoretical prediction in a cross-country panel data analysis and present robust empirical evidence for the existence of an inverted-U relationship between financial development and the size <b>of</b> the <b>informal</b> <b>sector.</b>|$|R
