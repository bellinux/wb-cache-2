40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} during winter season at rural livestock farm of district Sargodha, Pakistan, in order to define the macrominerals status in blood plasma of lactating and <b>dry</b> Desi breed <b>cows.</b> Material and methods. Twenty lactating and twenty <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> were used and their blood plasma was analyzed for Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu and Fe using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results. In lactating cows, the plasma Ca concentration was lower than <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> (6. 8 vs. 7. 6 mg/dl, p< 0. 001), while Mg concentration was similar between lactating and <b>dry</b> <b>cows.</b> Plasma Zn concentration in lactating cows was higher than <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> (0. 78 vs. 0. 60 mg/l, p< 0. 01) and it resulted lower than the normal range in both groups. Plasma Cu level in lactating cows was lower than <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> (0. 56 vs. 0. 76 mg/L, p< 0. 001) and it was lower than the normal range only in lactating cows. Lactating cows resulted in higher plasma Fe concentration compared to <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> (3. 8 versus 2. 6 mg/L; p< 0. 01). Conclusions.

40|$|Influence of the {{dry period}} on mammary growth was studied using {{multiparous}} Holstein cows. Sixty days before expected parturition, 13 <b>cows</b> were <b>dried</b> off, and another 13 cows were milked throughout the prepartum period. Lactating <b>cows</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> were slaughtered at 53, 35, 20, and 7 d prepartum. Total mammary parenchymal DNA increased twofold from 53 to 7 d prepartum without influence of lactation status. However, overall rate of [H- 3]thymidine incorporation by mammary tissue was 80 % greater in <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> than in lactating cows, indicating that replacement of mammary cells was greater in <b>dry</b> <b>cows.</b> Of the mammary cells labeled with [H- 3]thymidine, the percentage of epithelial cells in <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> was greater than that in lactating cows (96 % vs. 86 %). By 7 d prepartum, epithelial calls accounted for {{a greater percentage of}} total mammary cells in <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> than in lactating cows (83 % vs. 74 %). Tissue area occupied by alveolar or ductular lumina decreased by 25 d into the dry period (35 d prepartum) and then increased to a maximum by 7 d prepartum.

50|$|After {{receiving}} {{his doctorate}} from the University of Innsbrück in Austria, Bornemissza fled central Europe {{to escape the}} post-World War II Soviet regimes and travelled to Western Australia, where he arrived on 31 December 1950. Six months after arriving on Australian shores, while working with the Department of Zoology at the University of Western Australia, he remarked upon {{the large number of}} old, <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> dung pads that covered cattle grazing fields near Wooroloo, Western Australia and compared this to the relatively dung-free cattle fields of his native Hungary. In Hungary and elsewhere in the world, dung beetles have adapted to be able to roll and bury large, moist cattle dung pads but native Australian beetles, which co-evolved alongside the marsupials, were not able to utilise bovine dung, since cattle were only relatively recently introduced to Australia in the 1880s. Bornemissza hypothesised that the introduction of foreign dung beetle species that were able to roll and bury cattle dung pads would aid not only Australia’s soil fertility by recycling the dung nutrients back into the ground, but would also reduce the number of pestilent flies and parasitic worms which use the dung pads as a breeding ground. Bornemissza joined CSIRO in 1955 and continued to advocate his plan whilst he worked on a number of other projects and studies (see Publications). The Australian Dung Beetle Project finally secured funding from the Australian Meat Research Committee and commenced in 1965.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{investigated}} the effect of milk yield on blood flow variables in the milk vein and musculophrenic vein in dairy cows. Methods Five healthy <b>dry</b> <b>cows,</b> five cows with a daily milk yield of 10 kg and five others with a daily milk yield of 20 kg underwent B-mode and colour Doppler sonographic examination. The diameter of the veins, blood flow velocities and blood flow volumes were measured on both sides in standing, non-sedated cows using a 7. 5 MHz linear transducer. Results Lactating cows had significantly higher blood flow velocities in the milk vein than dry cows; the maximum blood flow velocity of <b>dry</b> <b>cows</b> and those with a daily milk yield of 10 and 20 kg were 14. 04, 38. 77 and 39. 49 cm/s, respectively, the minimum velocities were 0. 63, 3. 02 and 2. 64 cm/s, respectively, and the mean maximum velocities were 8. 21, 26. 67 und 28. 22 cm/s, respectively. Cows producing 20 kg of milk a day had a blood flow volume of 3. 09 l/min, which {{was significantly higher than}} 0. 79 l/min recorded in <b>dry</b> <b>cows.</b> Lactating cows had significantly higher mean maximum blood flow velocities in the musculophrenic vein than <b>dry</b> <b>cows.</b> Blood flow variables of both veins did not differ significantly between the left and right side. Conclusion This study showed that milk yield has a profound effect on blood flow variables in the milk vein {{and to a lesser extent}} the musculophrenic vein. This must be taken into consideration in future Doppler sonographic studies of these veins and possibly other vessels. Furthermore, measurements on one side are representative of both sides. </p...|$|R
5000|$|They {{started by}} {{carefully}} placing {{all of the}} pots to be fired in a fire pit, and then covered them carefully with broken pieces of pottery and aluminum sheets or any metal scraps they could find. In order to allow ventilation to keep the fire burning, they left small spaces uncovered, after which they meticulously surrounded the homemade kiln with cow chips - very <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> dung - used to fuel the fire, careful to leave the vents free. The goal was to prevent any flame from actually touching the pots, hence the protective metal sheets. After covering the kiln with the cow chips, they lit the kindling on all sides to ensure an even distribution of heat. They continued to feed the fire with dry cedar until the fire reached the desired temperature of around 12 to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on what look they were attempting. If the fire continued to burn, the pottery would achieve a red-brown color. But {{in order to make}} the black pottery that Maria was famous for, the fire was smothered with dry powered horse dung. By doing this, the amount of oxygen within the kiln was greatly reduced, therefore creating a reduction atmosphere which caused the color of the pots to turn black. After several hours, they shifted the horse dung around to kill the fire and bury the pots so they could cool slowly. After the kiln had cooled enough, they carefully pulled the pots out using either a stick if the pots were still hot, or waiting until they were cool enough to touch.|$|E
40|$|In {{the dairy}} industry, udder health is {{associated}} with mastitis management, of which blanket <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment {{has been an important}} part for decades. To prevent the udder from new intramammary infections during the dry period, the use of blanket <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment has been advocated for more than 50 years as part of the five-point mastitis prevention program. The goal of <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment is to reduce the prevalence of intramammary infections by eliminating infections already present at drying off and by preventing new infections from occurring during the dry period. Since 2012, preventive use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine is prohibited in the Netherlands. Therefore blanket <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment has been replaced by treatment of infected cows only, known as ‘selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment’. Although selection of cows {{is an important part of}} selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment and has a great effect on the consequences, not much research had been done in this field. Therefore it was considered valuable to evaluate the effect of various approaches to select cows for <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment on parameters such as udder health, antimicrobial use, and economics. Understanding and balancing these effects contributes to an optimal strategy in <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment and to prudent antimicrobial use in the dairy industry. The aims of this thesis were to quantify the effects of selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment on clinical and subclinical mastitis, antimicrobial use and economics. The effect of different somatic cell count threshold-scenarios for selecting cows for <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment on these parameters were evaluated. The economic consequences of using different numbers of dairy cows with antimicrobials at drying off, were evaluated as was the attitude of the dairy farmer and the veterinarian with respect to selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment and to reduction of antimicrobial use on dairy farms in general. This thesis shows that reduction of antimicrobial use at drying-off leads to an increased risk of mastitis at the individual level. The effect at the herd level was, however, very small. Criteria chosen to select cows for <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment had a limited effect on udder health, while the effect on the amount of antimicrobials used was large. Economics was found not to be an argument not to reduce the use of <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> antimicrobials by applying selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment, because in almost all scenarios selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment was economically beneficial over blanket <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment. Application of selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment appeared to be associated with farmers’ and veterinarians’ attitude. Their mindset towards reduction of antimicrobial use is crucial for successful implementation of a selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment strategy. Over the last years antimicrobial use in the dairy industry in the Netherlands decreased enormously, in which the introduction of selective <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> treatment played an important role. Although reduction of antimicrobial use at drying-off leads to more mastitis at the individual level, it was successfully implemented in the Netherlands without dramatic effects on udder health. These changes were realized by constructive cooperation between farmers and veterinary practitioners in the field, supported by the main stakeholders...|$|E

Because a thorough review of the guideline is important, the aim of this evaluation was to quantify the opinion of veterinarians on the guideline, to identify perceived bottlenecks and to propose possible improvements. To execute the study an online survey was chosen enabling all qualified bovine practitioners (in Dutch: geborgde rundveedierenartsen) to give their opinion on the guideline <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> therapy. Therefore, the public list of qualified bovine practitioners was used as recipient list. In general, the opinions of bovine practitioners on the guideline <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> therapy seem to be positive. Veterinarians responded positively to questions on clarity and communication of the guideline and most of them have been informed about the guideline by the communication paths from the KNMvD, which indicates these paths being effective. Besides this, the implementation rates of the guideline in veterinary practices (78 %) and at clients of the veterinarians (76 % implemented the guideline written in the herd treatment plan of 90 - 100 % of their clients) were high. Finally, 65 % of the interviewed practitioners agreed on the fact the cell count cut-off values stated in the guideline are manageable and practicable. Nevertheless, the survey showed there is still some lack of clarity on the exact aim and way of using the guideline, as well as the frequency of evaluating the drying-off strategy. A large majority (84 %) of the respondents has a need for more selection criteria {{to be included in the}} guideline <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> therapy. However, the selection criteria mentioned for integration in the guideline are mainly indicative of prophylactic use of antimicrobials, which makes it is not acceptable to use these in decision making on <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> therapy. Thereby, veterinarians indicated they evaluated the drying-off procedures with their farmers with very different frequencies (46 % schedules evaluation once per year; 20 % once every six months and 18 % once per quarter). Hence, it is recommended to communicate to the bovine practitioners in the Netherlands what the aim of the guideline is exactly and how the guideline should be interpreted and used to reach that aim. At the same time, there should be communicated the guideline is not designed to be seen as legislation. Taking all results of the survey into consideration, bovine practitioners in the Netherlands are generally pleased with the guideline 'Antimicrobial use in <b>dry</b> <b>cow</b> therapy'.
