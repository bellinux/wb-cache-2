40|$|Background: Despite {{increasing}} {{attention on}} the role of bone marrow <b>derived</b> stem <b>cells</b> in repair or rejuvenation of tissues and organs, cellular mechanisms of such cell-based therapy remain poorly understood. Methods: We reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by transplanting syngeneic GFP+ bone marrow (BM) cells. Subsequently, the recipients received subcutaneous injection of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and were subjected to acute renal ischemic injury. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were performed at various time points to assess engraftment and phenotype of BM <b>derived</b> stem <b>cells.</b> Results: Administration of G-CSF increased the release of BM <b>derived</b> stem <b>cells</b> into circulation and enhanced the ensuing recruitment of BM <b>derived</b> stem <b>cells</b> into injured kidney. During the second month post injury, migrated BM <b>derived</b> stem <b>cells</b> lost hematopoietic phenotype (CD 45) but maintained the expression of other markers (Sca- 1, CD 133 and CD 44), suggesting their potential of transdifferentiation into renal stem cells. Moreover, G-CSF treatment enhanced the phenotypic conversion. Conclusion: Our work depicted a time-course dependent transition of phenotypic characteristics of BM <b>derived</b> stem <b>cells,</b> demonstrated the existence of BM <b>derived</b> stem <b>cells</b> in damaged kidney and revealed the effects of G-CSF on cell transdifferentiation...|$|R

5000|$|HIV, {{which causes}} AIDS, {{can bind to}} {{dendritic}} cells via various receptors expressed on the cell. The best studied example is DC-SIGN (usually on MDC subset 1, but also on other subsets under certain conditions; since not all dendritic cell subsets express DC-SIGN, its exact role in sexual HIV-1 transmission is not clear). When the dendritic cell takes up HIV and then travels to the lymph node, the virus can be transferred to helper CD4+ T-cells, contributing to the developing infection. This infection of dendritic cells by HIV explains one mechanism by which the virus could persist after prolonged HAART. Many other viruses, such as the SARS virus seems to use DC-SIGN to 'hitchhike' to its target cells.

50|$|Early growth {{response}} protein 2 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the EGR2 gene. EGR2 (also termed Krox20) is a transcription regulatory factor, containing two zinc finger DNA-binding sites, and is highly {{expressed in a}} population of migrating neural crest cells. It is later expressed in the neural crest <b>derived</b> <b>cells</b> of the cranial ganglion. The protein encoded by Krox20 contains two cys2his2-type zinc fingers. Krox20 gene expression is restricted to the early hindbrain development. It is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, humans, mice, chicks, and zebra fish. In addition, the amino acid sequence and most aspects of the embryonic gene pattern is conserved among vertebrates, further implicating its role in hindbrain development. When the Krox20 is deleted in mice, the protein coding ability of the Krox20 gene (including the DNA-binding domain of the zinc finger) is diminished. These mice are unable to survive after birth and exhibit major hindbrain defects. These defects include {{but are not limited}} to defects in formation of cranial sensory ganglia, partial fusion of the trigeminal nerve (V) with the facial (VII) and auditory (VII) nerves, the proximal nerve roots coming off of these ganglia were disorganized and intertwined among one another as they entered the brainstem, and there was fusion of the glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve complex.|$|E

METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis by confocal laser microscopy of fluorescence labelled cells and by immunohistochemistry for beta 2 -microglubulin, 72 hours after intraportal delivery, showed engraftment of infused cells in liver parenchyma of rats with I/R, but not in control animals with non-injured liver. Transplantation of bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>cells</b> obtained from GFP-transgenic rats into Lewis rats resulted in the presence of up to 20 % of GFP positive hepatocytes in I/R liver lobes after one month. The repopulation rate was proportional to the number of transplanted cells. Infusion of GFP negative bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>cells</b> into GFP positive transgenic rats resulted in the appearance of GFP negative hepatocytes, suggesting that the main mechanism underlying parenchymal repopulation was differentiation rather than cell fusion. Transplantation of wild type bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>cells</b> into hyperbilirubinaemic Gunn rats with deficient bilirubin conjugation after I/R damage resulted in 30 % decrease in serum bilirubin, the appearance of bilirubin conjugates in bile, and the expression of normal UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzyme evaluated by polymerase chain reaction.

In this study, bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured with bioactive glass and sol-gel silica, and seeded into porous polymer composite scaffolds that were then implanted femorally and subcutaneously in rats to monitor their migration inside host tissue. Bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>cells</b> were also injected intraperitoneally. Transplanted cells migrated to various tissues inside the host, including the lung, liver spleen, thymus and bone marrow. The method of transplantation affected the time frame of cell migration, with intraperitoneal injection being the fastest and femoral implantation the slowest, but not the target tissues of migration. Transplanted donor cells had a limited lifetime in the host and were later eliminated from all tested tissues. Bioactive glass, however, affected the implanted cells negatively. When it was present in the scaffold no donor cells were found in any of the tested host tissues. Bioactive glass S 53 P 4 was found to support both osteoblastic and osteoclastic phenotype of bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>cells,</b> but it was resistant to the resorbing effect of osteoclastic bone marrow <b>derived</b> <b>cells,</b> showing that bioactive glass is rather dissolved through physicochemical reactions than resorbed by cells.
