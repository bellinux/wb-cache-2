5|$|Kohlberg's stages are not {{culturally}} neutral, {{as demonstrated}} by its application {{to a number of}} different cultures. Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and {{nonflammable}} under standard conditions. They were once labeled group0 in {{the periodic table}} because it was believed they had a valence of zero, meaning their atoms cannot combine {{with those of other}} elements to form compounds. However, it was later discovered some <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> form compounds, causing this label to fall into disuse.|$|E

5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> use their bladders for both.|$|E

25|$|Although LPG-powered {{vehicles}} {{are supposed to}} be relatively non-polluting, and <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> reduce roadside pollution, a 2007 study by Polytechnic University indicated that older LPG taxis emitted at least double the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons compared to diesel.

25|$|Borges imagines a Tlönite {{working his}} way out of the problem of solipsism by {{reasoning}} that if all people are actually aspects of one being, then perhaps the universe is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining.

25|$|Mucosal immunity, which {{includes}} immune {{function in the}} female reproductive tract, is not as well understood as humoral immunity. This may be an issue for certain contraceptive vaccines. For instance, in the second LDH-C4 primate trial that had negative results, all of the immunized macaque monkeys developed high antibody titers against LDH-C4 in serum, but antibodies against LDH-C4 were {{not found in the}} monkeys' vaginal fluids. If antibodies against LDH-C4 <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from humoral immunity may be critical to the efficacy of contraceptive vaccines.|$|E

25|$|Stove {{notes that}} in part one he has only {{demonstrated}} how an irrational position might be expressed, {{in such a way}} as it had some appearance of credibility, not that such a position is actually held by the subjects of his study. He now turns to establishing this second point. The philosophers he is criticising not only use language in unusual ways, but <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> also make plain language assertions of an irrationalist nature. Stove presents examples of what he believes are the clearest statements of irrationalism in their writing. Ultimately he considers providing examples from Karl Popper suffices. He presents the quotes and paraphrases apparently in ascending order of irrationality.|$|E

25|$|Planetary nebulae {{are created}} when a {{red giant star}} ejects its outer envelope, forming an {{expanding}} shell of gas. However it remains a mystery why these shells are not always spherically symmetrical. 80% of planetary nebulae {{do not have a}} spherical shape; instead forming bipolar or elliptical nebulae. One hypothesis for the formation of a non-spherical shape is the effect of the star's magnetic field. Instead of expanding evenly in all directions, the ejected plasma tends to leave by way of the magnetic poles. Observations of the central stars in at least four planetary nebulae have confirmed that they <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> possess powerful magnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|On the {{initiative}} of the municipality of Linkebeek, the Constitutional Court of Belgium was asked for an opinion on the constitutionality of article 23 {{of the law of}} 18 July 1966 that stipulates that the internal language of administration in the rim municipalities has to be Dutch. In its ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998, the Court ruled this was not in violation with articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution of Belgium and that the mayor and aldermen <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> {{not have the right to}} speak in another language than Dutch during council meetings. The Court further specified that the language facilities do not alter the principle of Dutch unilingualism of the concerned municipalities and that the Constitution guarantees the primacy of Dutch.|$|E

The philosopher Thomas Kuhn credited Piaget's work with helping him to understand the transition between modes of thought which characterized his theory of paradigm shifts. Yet, that said, it is {{also noted that the}} implications of his later work <b>do</b> <b>indeed</b> remain largely unexamined. Shortly before his death (September 1980), Piaget was involved in a debate about the relationships between innate and acquired features of language, at the Centre Royaumont pour une Science de l'Homme, where he discussed his point of view with the linguist Noam Chomsky as well as Hilary Putnam and Stephen Toulmin.|$|E
