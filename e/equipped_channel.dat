Temperature maps, derived from oxygen band measurements, showed that the typhoon eye had a single peak varying in amplitude with time. Water line and window measurements were used to develop a coordinate system having mutually orthogonal atmospheric variables of column water-vapor content and cloud liquid-water content. Vapor measurements showed a maximum around the intensifying typhoon with a more developed structure during typhoon development.

Comparisons with infrared cloud imagery and aircraft flight data show different time variations, attributed to poor typhoon-eye resolution in the microwave images...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Petri nets with name {{creation}} and management have been recently introduced {{so as to}} make Petri nets able to model the dynamics of (distributed) systems <b>equipped</b> with <b>channels,</b> cyphering keys, or computing boundaries. While traditional formal properties such as boundedness, coverability, and reachability, have been thoroughly studied for this class of Petri nets, formal verification against rich temporal properties has not been investigated so far. In this paper, we attack this verification problem. We introduce sophisticated variants of first-order µ-calculus to specify rich properties that simultaneously account for the system dynamics and the names present in its states. We then analyse the (un) decidability boundaries for the verification of such logics, by considering different notions of boundedness. Notably, our decidability results are obtained via a translation to data-centric dynamic systems, a recently devised framework for the formal specification and verification of business processes working over relational database with constraints. In this light, our results contribute to the cross-fertilization between areas that have not been extensively related so far. ...|$|R
