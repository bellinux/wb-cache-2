40|$|Abstract. Monolithic {{behavior}} {{is one of}} the most important characteristics that historical masonry should have. Without this basic feature, in fact, no structural analysis could be considered reliable. If this characteristic is absent, strengthening the bearing masonry – by giving it a transversal monolithic behavior- {{is one of the}} first retrofitting actions to undertake in order to improve the seismic performance of the masonry. Hence, the idea to develop a new consolidation technique especially formulated for historical masonry. Stitching masonry through continuous <b>flexible</b> <b>elements</b> is an innovative technique that enables the connection of several masonry components. Moreover, thanks to these <b>flexible</b> <b>elements</b> it is possible to attribute stitching masonry a monolithic behavior according to the principles that govern the intervention on existing buildings: minimal intervention, compatibility, reversibility, respect of authenticity, matter conservation, control of the visual impact and possibility of recognizing the intervention. 4 mm basalt fibers ropes of nominal diameter (declared by manufacturer), have been used in this experimental program as continuous <b>flexible</b> <b>elements.</b> The technique has been already tested and proved to be effective in improving the behavior against in-plane actions.
