25|$|Tunnels were blasted {{through hard}} rock by {{drilling}} {{holes in the}} rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled {{out of the tunnel}} for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A foot or so advance on a tunnel <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented nitroglycerin explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Kou Kiet (translation: Redeem Honor; {{also called}} Operation About <b>Face)</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> major Laotian Civil War {{victory for the}} anti-communist troops of the Kingdom of Laos. Patterned after prior Operation Raindance, it {{depended}} upon extensive air strikes blasting communist units and clearing them from {{the path of the}} Royalist offensive. Powered by 150 daylight and 50 night sorties daily, with 50 to 80 day strikes directed by Raven Forward Air Controllers, Kou Kiet ran from 6 August to 30 September 1969. It was successful beyond expectations. After the Royal Lao Government troops achieved their objectives, General Vang Pao insisted on pushing forward while they had the initiative. As a result, the Royalists regained control of the entire Plain of Jars while also capturing a huge stock of munitions from the communists. Their triumph came at a cost. However successful the Royalists were, by battle's end their battle-worn forces had exhausted their pool of potential recruits, while the Vietnamese could easily replace their personnel losses.|$|E

500|$|Shostakovich was in {{many ways}} an obsessive man: {{according}} to his daughter he was [...] "obsessed with cleanliness". He synchronised the clocks in his apartment and regularly sent cards to himself to test how well the postal service was working. Elizabeth Wilson's Shostakovich: A Life Remembered (1994 edition) indexes 26 references to his nervousness. Mikhail Druskin remembers that even as a young man the composer was [...] "fragile and nervously agile".

His <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> perfect oval, {{his hair was}} as black as a raven's wing, {{and his eyes were}} large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E

500|$|The game artists {{regularly}} drafted {{variations on}} Tali's face throughout the series' development. BioWare's position {{on whether to}} reveal her <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long-standing internal debate, and the developers announced they were still unsure during Mass Effect 3s development. Concept artist Matt Rhodes felt it would {{interesting to see how}} players compared her personality to her appearance, and how they would respond to an appearance that challenged their expectations as [...] "a little too alien, just a little too repellant". They were aware that either decision would likely annoy some people, and that no reveal could universally fit all views of Tali. BioWare wished to unveil her face in a [...] "tasteful way" [...] outside of the game engine, and decided that a gift from Tali would be the best way. A stock photo was used to ensure the face's closeness to a real photograph. An in-game photo of Tali's face is available as a gift to the player-character Commander Shepard upon pursuing her Mass Effect 3 romance event tree.|$|E
500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] was {{developed}} by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. During development of Mass Effect 2, Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company's overall philosophy. The pack was announced to be in development on July 22, 2010 {{with the release of}} three brand-new screenshots of the game. BioWare stated that the decisions players make in the pack would affect certain storylines in the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. Animating the Shadow Broker's <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> challenge for the developers. According to BioWare, the game's default digital-acting system [...] "could not handle the stresses of the new face, so custom work had to be done to animate his multiple eyes and triangular mouth." [...] The pack was released on September 7, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. Like Mass Effect 2s earlier downloadable content packs [...] "" [...] and [...] "", [...] "Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] is freely included in the PlayStation 3 edition of the game, which was released on January 18, 2011.

2500|$|On the December 23, 2013 {{episode of}} Raw, a {{vignette}} aired announcing {{the return of}} Batista on January 20, 2014 episode of Raw. It was later announced that Batista would be participating in the 2014 Royal Rumble match. Batista returned as a face to confront WWE World Heavyweight Champion Randy Orton on the January 20 Raw, and vowed to win the Royal Rumble match and become champion at WrestleMania XXX. Later that night, Batista confronted Alberto Del Rio, who had been trash talking him for several weeks, and eventually attacked him with a Batista Bomb. Six days later at the Royal Rumble, Batista entered the Rumble match at number 28 and last eliminated Roman Reigns to win the match, becoming the fifth wrestler to win multiple Rumble matches, and the first, and so far only multi-time Royal Rumble winner to win from the same entrant number (28). The live crowd reacted negatively towards Batista's win, as Daniel Bryan did not {{take part in the}} match. Despite a positive reaction originally, the crowd began to boo Batista after Reigns was eliminated. After the show went off the air, Batista mocked Bryan and gestured his middle finger at the crowd. According to Batista, he thought a return as <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bad idea because of the fans being so invested in Daniel Bryan's [...] "Yes Movement". On the February 3 Raw, Batista was confronted and was ultimately assaulted by Del Rio before chasing him off. Batista retaliated the following week, powerbombing Del Rio through the announce table.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866 {{they put}} in a [...] {{vertical}} shaft {{in the center of}} the summit tunnel and started work towards the east and west tunnel faces, giving four working faces on the summit tunnel to speed up progress. A steam engine off an old locomotive was brought up with much effort over the wagon road and used as a winch driver to help remove loosened rock from the vertical shaft and two working faces. By the winter of 1866–67, work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue. The cross section of a tunnel <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> , [...] oval with an [...] vertical wall. [...] Progress on the tunnel sped up to over [...] per day per face when they started using the newly invented nitroglycerin—manufactured near the tunnel. They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required [...] height after the four tunnel faces met, and made even faster progress. Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle. Depending on the material the tunnels penetrated, they were left unlined or lined with brick, rock walls or timber and post. Some tunnels were designed to bend in the middle to align with the track bed curvature. Despite this potential complication, nearly all the different tunnel center lines met within [...] or so. The detailed survey work that made these tunnel digs as precise as required were nearly all done by the Canadian born and trained Lewis Clement, the CPRR's Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track, and his assistants.|$|E
