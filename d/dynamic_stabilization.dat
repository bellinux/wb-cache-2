40|$|PURPOSE: Surgery {{involving}} arthroscopic {{reconstruction of}} the injured ligament is the gold standard treatment for torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Recent studies support the hypothesis of biological self-healing of ruptured ACL. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate, in an animal model, the efficacy of a new technique, <b>dynamic</b> intraligamentary <b>stabilization</b> that utilizes biological self-healing for repair of acute ACL ruptures. METHODS: The ACL in 11 adult female white alpine sheep was transected and in 8 sheep reconstructed by <b>dynamic</b> intraligamentary <b>stabilization.</b> To enhance the healing potential, microfracturing and collagen were used in all animals. The contralateral, non-operated knees served as controls. At 3 months postkilling, all animals were submitted to magnetic resonance imaging and biomechanical and histological evaluation. RESULTS: No surgery-related complications were observed. Postoperatively, all animals regularly used the operated leg with full weight bearing and no lameness. At the time of killing, all animals exhibited radiological and histological healing of the transacted ACL. Biomechanical tests confirmed successful restoration of anteroposterior translation in the <b>dynamic</b> intraligamentary <b>stabilization</b> knees. Histological examination revealed dense scar tissue at the ends of the transected ligaments exhibiting hypercellularity and hypervascularization. CONCLUSION: The <b>dynamic</b> intraligamentary <b>stabilization</b> technique successfully induced self-healing of ruptured ACL in a sheep model. Knee joints remained stable during the healing period allowing free range of motion and full weight bearing, and no signs of osteoarthritis or other intraarticular damage in the follow up were observed...|$|R
50|$|The popliteus tendon’s main {{attachment}} {{is on the}} femur at {{the proximal}} portion of the popliteus sulcus. As the tendon runs posteriorly and distally behind the knee, it gives off 3 fascicles that attach to and stabilize the lateral meniscus. The popliteus tendon provides static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> to the knee during posterolateral rotation. The iliotibial band (IT band) is mainly divided into two layers, the superficial and capsuloosseus layers. The superficial layer runs along the lateral knee and attaches to Gerdy’s tubercle and sends a deeper portion that attaches to the lateral intermuscular septum (IM septum). The capsuloosseus layer extends from the IM septum and merges with the short head of the biceps femoris attaching with it at the anterolateral aspect of the tibia. The IT band stabilizes the posterolateral corner by helping to prevent varus opening.The lateral gastrocnemius tendon inserts on the supracondylar process of the femur slightly posterior to the FCL.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> of the lumbar spine {{has gained}} {{increasingly}} popularity. These nonfusion systems are alleged to maintain or restore the intradiscal pressure to magnitudes of the intact spine and have little {{negative effect on}} the adjacent segments to the stabilized one. Compliant Nitinol alloy (Ni-Ti) has been used in the manufacture of the rods of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> systems. In this study, we investigated a <b>dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> system with its coiled rods made of Nitinol alloy. Four porcine lumbar spines (T 12 -L 6) were prepared: intact, fixed by a conventional rigid fixation system, fixed by a <b>dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> system with 2 -coiled rods, fixed by a <b>dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> system with 3 -coiled rods. Intradiscal pressures were measured at all levels before and after insertion of the implant. Our results show that the rigid stabilization system resulted in great changes of disc pressure in flexion and extension regardless of spinal levels. However, Intradiscal pressures (IDPs) remained relatively unchanged in models fixed by the <b>dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> systems. Changes in intradiscal pressure can lead to altered metabolism within the disc, with potential long-term disc degeneration. These results suggest that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>stabilization</b> systems are superior over traditional fusion implants in maintaining the intradiscal pressure to the intact level at surgical level and adjacent level and can therefore be considered as an alternative method to fusion surgery in these indications while the intradical pressure is preserved...|$|E

30|$|Recently, four {{different}} operative techniques, {{referring to the}} primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair, were described.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the already-published, clinical, and pre-clinical results of those techniques. A literature review was conducted and implemented by three independent researchers. Inclusion criteria were clinical or cadaveric or animal studies about patients suffering from ACL rupture, who were treated with one of those {{four different}} arthroscopic techniques of primary ACL repair.
