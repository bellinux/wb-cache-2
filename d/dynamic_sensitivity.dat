Sensitivity {{is a fundamental}} and commonly-used sensing characteristic of an ESA. However, the usually used spatial sensitivity, which is called static sensitivity here, is not proper for moving particles or capable of reflecting array signal processing algorithms integrated in an ESA. Besides, reports on ESAs for intermittent particles are scarce yet, especially lacking suitable array signal processing algorithms. To solve the problems, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of ESA is proposed, and a hemisphere-shaped electrostatic sensors’ circular array (HSESCA) along with its application in intermittent particle monitoring are taken as an example.

40|$|Electrostatic sensors are key {{components}} of electrostatic monitoring systems. Their sensitivity characteristics have a direct influence on monitoring accuracy. In previous studies, spatial sensitivity, which is called static sensitivity here, was {{used to describe the}} sensitivity characteristics. However, it only reflects a basic relationship between static charged particles and induced charges on an electrostatic sensor’s probe. Besides, as a three-dimensional defined parameter, it is difficult to build a unified model if actual boundary conditions are considered. Thus, it is not quite proper for applications that detect moving particles. To solve this problem, <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is proposed in this article. As for a hemisphere-shaped electrostatic sensor, first, a more accurate model of static sensitivity is built. Based on it, <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is defined and modeled analytically. Then, a calibration method is proposed to improve the model’s accuracy under actual boundary conditions. In the end, finite element method simulations are done for validations. The results demonstrate that <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> reflects a relationship between moving charged particles and the actual output signals of a sensor, thus it is direct and practical for moving particles.

On biological AFM force mode, the coupling {{effects of the}} liquid environment, spot size of laser beam and laser spot location on AFM cantilever backside, must be considered to correlate the static sensitivities from force curves in air and in liquid for calibration. An effective model has been developed first and experimentally elucidated to calibrate the static sensitivity in liquid. The proposed model eliminates inconvenience of static sensitivity calibration in liquid with possible contamination sources. The static sensitivity based on force curve can not be directly applied on dynamic modes. The second part of our work analyzed optimization of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of an AFM vibrating at different flexural modes.

A new friction mode is developed in the third part to bypass the difficulties and directly measure friction force or friction coefficient instead, by applying a special T–shape cantilever. An effective method has been proposed to minimize possible errors with this friction mode.

40|$|In {{phenotype}} {{experiments in}} mice, determination of <b>dynamic</b> insulin <b>sensitivity</b> often uses the insulin tolerance test. However, {{the interpretation of}} this test {{is complicated by the}} counterregulation occurring at low glucose. To overcome this problem, we determined the <b>dynamic</b> insulin <b>sensitivity</b> after inhibition of endogenous insulin secretion by diazoxide (25 mg/kg) in association with intravenous administration of glucose plus insulin (the DSGIT technique). Estimation of insulin sensitivity index (SI) by this technique showed good correlation to SI from a regular intravenous glucose tolerance test (r = 0. 87; P < 0. 001; n = 15). With DSGIT, we evaluated <b>dynamic</b> insulin <b>sensitivity</b> in mice with a rat insulin promoter (beta-cell-targeted) dominant-negative mutation of hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) - 1 {alpha} [RIP-DN HNF- 1 {alpha} (Tg) mice]. When insulin was administered exogenously at the same dose in Tg and wild-type (WT) mice, plasma insulin levels were higher in WT, indicating an increased insulin clearance in Tg mice. When the diazoxide test was used, different doses of insulin were therefore administered (0. 1 and 0. 15 U/kg in WT and 0. 2 and 0. 25 U/kg in Tg) to achieve similar insulin levels in the groups. Minimal model analysis showed that SI was the same in the two groups (0. 78 ± 0. 21 x 10 – 4 min·pmol– 1 ·l– 1 in WT vs. 0. 60 ± 0. 11 in Tg; P = 0. 45) as was the glucose elimination rate (P = 0. 27). We conclude that 1) the DSGIT technique determines the in vivo dynamic insulin action in mice, 2) insulin clearance is increased in Tg mice, and 3) chronic islet dysfunction in RIP-DN HNF- 1 {alpha} mice is not compensated with increased insulin sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA calibration of two Endevco piezoresistive microphones {{was carried out}} under static and dynamics pressures. The dynamic pressure calibrations were done by comparison with a B&K condenser microphone. The calibration {{was carried out in}} a small closed volume in air and helium. In helium, the codes volume was pressurized to atmospheric pressure and then 10 Atm. The dynamic calibration would determine the "flatness" of the calibration curve, as well as determine a sensitivity value over the range of frequencies used. The results showed that the calibration curve for the piezoresistive microphones are flat from static pressures to about 300 Hz and then begin to fall off. The value of the sensitivity of the "flat" region of the calibration curve for one microphone was within 0. 4 % of the value for sensitivity calculated under the static pressure calibration.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{mathematical}} model to understand, predict, control, or even design a real biological {{system is a}} central theme in systems biology. A dynamic biological system is always modeled as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. How to simulate the dynamic behavior and dynamic parameter sensitivities of systems described by ODEs efficiently and accurately is a critical job. In many practical applications, e. g., the fed-batch fermentation systems, the system admissible input (corresponding to independent variables of the system) can be time-dependent. The main difficulty for investigating the dynamic log gains of these systems is the infinite dimension due to the time-dependent input. The classical <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> analysis {{does not take into}} account this case for the dynamic log gains. Results We present an algorithm with an adaptive step size control that can be used for computing the solution and dynamic sensitivities of an autonomous ODE system simultaneously. Although our algorithm is one of the decouple direct methods in computing dynamic sensitivities of an ODE system, the step size determined by model equations can be used on the computations of the time profile and dynamic sensitivities with moderate accuracy even when sensitivity equations are more stiff than model equations. To show this algorithm can perform the <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> analysis on very stiff ODE systems with moderate accuracy, it is implemented and applied to two sets of chemical reactions: pyrolysis of ethane and oxidation of formaldehyde. The accuracy of this algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the dynamic parameter sensitivities obtained from this new algorithm and from the direct method with Rosenbrock stiff integrator based on the indirect method. The same <b>dynamic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> analysis was performed on an ethanol fed-batch fermentation system with a time-varying feed rate to evaluate the applicability of the algorithm to realistic models with time-dependent admissible input. Conclusion By combining the accuracy we show with the efficiency of being a decouple direct method, our algorithm is an excellent method for computing dynamic parameter sensitivities in stiff problems.

We studied responses to loads and muscle forces in stick insect tibial campaniform sensilla, including a subgroup of receptors (Group 6 B) with unusual round cuticular caps in oval-shaped collars. Loads were applied in different directions and muscle contractions were emulated by applying forces to the tibial flexor muscle tendon (apodeme). All sensilla 1) were maximally sensitive to loads applied in the plane of joint movement and 2) encoded muscle forces but did not discharge to unresisted movements. Identification of 6 B sensilla by stimulation of cuticular caps demonstrated that receptor responses were correlated with their morphology.
