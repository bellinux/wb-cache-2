These problems in wireless networks can be modeled as a cooperative game since it is highly likely that each wireless user can obtain a better utility value by forming groups and controlling resources cooperatively rather than individually.

30|$|Traditionally, the {{construction}} of polar codes requires intense computations to sort all bit channels. In previous works, two types of partial orders (POs) of polar codes were proposed to decrease the computations in {{the construction}} process. In this paper, a procedure is presented to employ POs with complexity O(N 2), which {{is lower than the}} existing procedures, where N= 2 n is the code length (n≥ 1). To further reduce the computation complexity, in this paper, we propose a general partial order (GPO), which works at a lower dimension (nu<n) to sort bit channels. The principle of the GPO is to divide the binary <b>expansion</b> of <b>bit</b> channels into two parts: the upper part and the lower part. First, the relationships among bit channels formed from the upper part (with length nu) are completely determined. Existing algorithms are called in this new level nu when needed. Second, we prove that the ordering at this lower dimension nu can be combined with the PO ordering of bit channels formed from the lower part. Therefore, more intrinsic relationships among bit channels are obtained. Working at the lower dimension nu<n, the complexity of GPO is inherently smaller than the existing sorting algorithms. The studies show that for n= 10 and the code rate R= 0.5 (the worst code rate from the empirical studies), the GPO can order 82 % of bit channels, which is 32 % larger than that obtained from using only POs. The proposed GPO in this paper can significantly reduce computations in {{the construction of}} polar codes.|$|R

3000|$|For a given channel W, {{to reduce}} the {{computation}} complexity {{of the construction of}} polar codes, we introduce a general partial order (GPO), which works by dividing the binary <b>expansion</b> of <b>bit</b> channels into two parts: the upper part with nu≥ 1 bits and the lower part with nl=n−nu bits (here, n= log 2 N). Considering the upper part as a set of new bit channels with nu bits, the ordering of these new bit channels at this smaller level i̇N_u = 2 ^n_u can either be derived from the two POs or from calling any sorting algorithm [12, 13]. Since the channel independent ordering of Nu bit channels is part of POs, we only consider their new channel-dependent ordering obtained from the existing sorting procedures such as [12, 13]. This paper proves that this channel-dependent ordering of Nu bit channels can be combined with ≼ 1 and ≼ 2 to obtain the ordering for the given underlying channel W and block length N. The POs and GPO aim to find the intrinsic relationship between any two bit channels. After applying POs and GPO, additional intrinsic relationships can be identified when considering the transitivity of bit channel degradation (or upgradation). These transitive relations are termed indirect relations. Algorithms to explore PO ≼ 1, PO ≼ 2, GPO, and the transitivity of bit channel degradation (or upgradation) are provided to quantify the savings of each.

Among them, the first input first output (FIFO) and channel parameter control are used to store the data and control parameters for each channel, respectively.

Because the official ICD document of the Galileo system does not give the way of its PRN code generation, the PRN code generation of Galileo signal can only be realized by register storage. Therefore, the system’s pseudo-code generator module includes a universal code generator and a memory code controller. The former is used to generate PRN codes for GPS, BDS, and GLONASS systems, and the latter is used in the Galileo system.|$|R

Let W: X→Y be the underlying channel with a transition probability W(y|x). Sorting the bit channels is difficult {{because of the large}} number of output alphabets |Y|^N. Evaluating this large number of transition probabilities for each bit channel is beyond the reach of a practical system. Monte-Carlo simulations are proposed in [1] to sort the bit channels, with a high complexity of O(M N [...] N) (M denotes the iterations of the Monte-Carlo simulations). Density evolution is used in [12] to construct polar codes. The density evolution process involves function convolutions whose numerical calculation precisions are limited by the complexity. In [13], bit channel approximations are proposed with a controlled complexity of O (N ·μ ^ 2 μ) (μ represents a user-defined parameter {{to limit the number of}} output alphabet at each approximation stage). Another family of polar code construction is to use Gaussian approximation (GA) on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels [14 – 16]. The GA method is inherently limited by the approximation function [16] and may not be applicable to all block lengths. Partial order (PO) relations are reported in [12, 17, 18]. We borrow the notations from [17] to denote the two types of POs: ≼ 1 and ≼ 2. The first type of PO, ≼ 1, is investigated in [17] and [18]; it orders the bit channels with the same Hamming weight (here, the Hamming weight is the Hamming weight of the binary <b>expansions</b> of the <b>bit</b> channel indices). The second type of PO, ≼ 2, is stated in [12], which orders the channels with different Hamming weights. These two POs are channel independent: the orders are universal for all types of underlying channels. In [17], the authors show that the two POs can be used to simplify the encoding construction. However, no algorithm is presented to employ these two POs; therefore, no detailed results are provided there in [17] to quantify the exact savings.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technology provided a suitable environment {{for the people in}} which they can benefit from online services in their daily lives. Despite several advantages, online services also constitute serious privacy risks for their users as the main input to algorithms are privacy sensitive such as demographic information, shopping patterns, medical records, etc. While traditional security mechanisms can eliminate a number of attacks from outside, these mechanisms can not protect the privacy of the users as the service provider itself constitutes the biggest potential risk. In this thesis, we focus on principled solutions to protect the privacy of users in multimedia applications. For this purpose we propose to keep the privacy-sensitive data safe by means of encryption during processing. This approach eliminates the risk of possible privacy abuse as the sensitive data is only available to the owner but no other party. However, once encrypted, the structure in data is destroyed {{as a consequence of the}} encryption procedure and thus we need appropriate tools to process encrypted data. Therefore, we focus on a number of cryptographic tools such as homomorphic encryption schemes and multiparty computation (MPC) techniques to realize privacy-preserving multimedia applications. The proposed principled solutions consider the signal processing aspect of the multimedia applications which is a new idea to the best of our knowledge. In particular, we focus on a number of prototypical applications namely, face detection, user clustering in a social network, recommendation generation and anonymous fingerprinting. Based on these selected applications, we addressed the major challenges for secure signal processing: data representation, data expansion, realizing linear and non-linear operations and efficiency of the proposed protocols in terms of communication and computational costs. We propose to scale and round the signal values prior to encryption as these operations are highly inefficient to be realized in the encrypted domain. Moreover, we reserve sufficient space in terms of bit length for each signal sample to accommodate the possible <b>expansion</b> in <b>bit</b> size in the subsequent processing steps. However, reserving more bits for signals does not contradict with the data expansion problem. As the cipher text space is much larger than the size of the original [...] and even scaled [...] signal samples, data expansion after encryption increases data transmission and storage costs significantly. In order to minimize the cost we propose to pack a number of signal samples in one encryption and process them when they are in the packed form. This approach requires cryptographic protocols particularly designed for the packed data but in the end saves considerable resources regarding bandwidth and storage capacity, even computational power. Homomorphism plays a crucial role in our proposed solutions. With the help of homomorphic encryption, we are able to implement linear operations such as correlation and projection without interaction. However, linear operations are only a part of the signal processing. For the non-linear operations like distance computation, thresholding and comparison, we exploit MPC techniques. These techniques are often interactive and computationally expensive compared to the original systems in plain. However, by using data packing and designing the protocols with care, the communication and computational costs were reduced significantly. In this thesis, we have shown that preserving privacy for multimedia signal processing is feasible. We determined the major challenges of secure signal processing and combined a set of cryptographic tools successfully with signal processing to realize the applications in the encrypted domain. The proposed solutions demonstrate that the privacy concerns in multimedia signal processing applications can be coped with by using cryptographic tools. Moreover, protocols that are designed to realize certain operations in the encrypted domain can be used in other applications and settings with a number of modifications.

40|$|Bilateral {{investment}} treaties (BITs) typically obligate a contracting {{country to}} grant "fair and equitable treatment" (hereinafter {{referred to as}} "fair treatment") to the investments of other contracting country's investors, such as their subsidiaries. In the past, the fair treatment obligation attracted scant attention due to the abstractness of the provision; such was certainly the case in Japan. However, the fair treatment obligation in recent years jumped into the spotlight as the provision is now frequently invoked in arbitration pursuant to BITs (also called "investor-state arbitration" or "BIT arbitration"). This is because certain investors filed arbitration cases claiming that their host government violated its fair treatment obligation and the arbitral tribunal broadly supported these claims. Unlike national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment obligations, the fair treatment obligation is an independently set standard with no consideration given to {{the circumstances of the}} host country. The wording of BIT fair treatment provisions is also generally unclear as to what obligation is being imposed. One interpretation is that the fair treatment obligation is meant to be the contracting governments' consent to grant foreigners the "minimum standard" as required under customary international law, while another interpretation is that it is meant to assure treatment in addition to or beyond that required by the minimum standards of international law. However, {{it should be noted that}} the obligation is provided for in individual BITs and the specific wording of the fair treatment provision differs from one treaty to another (particularly on whether or not references are made to customary international law). The fair treatment obligation first became a major issue in an investor-filed arbitration case under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The NAFTA arbitral tribunal in the case interpreted the obligation as referring to treatment in addition to or beyond customary international law minimum standards, thereby fully supporting the investor's claim. This interpretation was denied by subsequent NAFTA tribunals. On the other hand, through the accumulation of arbitral adjudications, the specific implications have emerged in which a contracting government is considered as having breached the fair treatment obligation if its "conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety. " Apart from NAFTA, a series of arbitral adjudications acknowledged a host government's responsibility for assuring fair treatment and these decisions, unlike those by NAFTA tribunals, continued to interpret fair treatment provisions as treatment in addition to or beyond the customary international law minimum standards. However, certain specific standards applied by non-NAFTA tribunals were also found to be in substance quite similar to those applied by NAFTA tribunals. The fair treatment obligation is a typical example of arbitration that uncovered new significance for BITs. Summarizing the various arbitral adjudications to date, the following statements can be made at this stage. First, although the general definition of the fair treatment obligation differs among NAFTA and other international agreements, the difference is considered attributable to the differing BIT provisions under NAFTA and those agreements (see Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic). Second, the specific content of the fair treatment obligation, which has been gradually clarified, is that a host government is considered as having breached its obligation if it "fail(s) to ensure a transparent and predictable framework" for investors (see Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States) or if the government's "conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety" (see Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States). As such, this definition barely reflects differences, in theory, in the application of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Investors' expectations stemming from BITs play a key role in deriving these specific criteria. The fair treatment obligation is interpreted as prohibiting a host government, as a contracting party to a BIT, from treating an investor in an "unreasonable" way in view of the basic expectations of the investor. This can be defined as an <b>expansion</b> of the <b>BIT's</b> effect. In international treaties that leave the interpretation of obligations to each contracting party, general provisions such as the fair treatment obligations have been seen as having little meaning (particularly in Japan). However, things are completely different when a third-party dispute settlement body, such as an arbitral tribunal, applies and interprets provisions under the treaty. It attempts to settle the dispute by reference to general obligations if it is unable to find a proper solution based on specific obligations. The fair treatment provision has been fulfilling this role. Arbitration adjudications hitherto made concerning the fair treatment obligation indicate that a government, in drafting a treaty that assumes dispute settlement through a third-party, needs a different approach than drafting a treaty that does not assume such settlement. The above considerations demonstrate that the fair treatment provision is meant to elevate the level of investment protection and such a provision must be included in investment treaties. ...|$|R
