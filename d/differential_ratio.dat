25|$|AC Cars also {{produced}} a Le Mans coupé. The {{car was a}} one-off and was nearly destroyed after a high-speed tire blow-out at the 1964 Le Mans race. The car was qualified conservatively second in GT. The race started well with the AC, chassis number A98, maintaining {{its position in the}} top two in GT and even leading the class for a time. This was not to last as an act of sabotage (newspaper in the fuel tank) began to block the fuel filter. The car lost time until this was diagnosed and cleaned out. The car proceeded on at the predetermined conservative lap time and for the next stint remained trouble free. The car was able to match the Shelby Daytona's speed despite running a higher <b>differential</b> <b>ratio</b> (2.88 instead of 3.07) and a lower state of engine tune for reliability (355hp instead of the Daytona's 385hp).|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{inflation}} fell from 36.1% in 1970 to 22.1% in 1971, while average real wages rose by 22.3% during 1971. Minimum real wages for blue-collar workers were increased by 56% {{during the first quarter}} of 1971, while in the same period real minimum wages for white-collar workers were increased by 23%, a development that decreased the <b>differential</b> <b>ratio</b> between blue- and white-collar workers’ minimum wage from 49% (1970) to 35% (1971). Central government expenditures went up by 36% in real terms, raising the share of fiscal spending in GDP from 21% (1970) to 27% (1971), and as part of this expansion, the public sector engaged in a huge housing program, starting to build 76,000 houses in 1971, compared to 24,000 for 1970. During a 1971 emergency program, over 89,000 houses were built, and during Allende’s three years as president an average of 52,000 houses were constructed annually. Although the acceleration {{of inflation}} in 1972 and 1973 eroded part of the initial increase in wages, they still rose (on average) in real terms during the 1971–73 period.|$|E

50|$|In addition, lower <b>differential</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>differentials</b> {{were usually}} {{used in other}} {{automatic}} transmission applications to improve gas mileage (again due to the inefficiency of the earlier automatics, especially when used with small engines). The BW 35 was a more efficient transmission and was quite successful in the USA with the smaller engined cars. This also made it a natural for European cars that usually had much smaller engines than American cars of that era. Production was transferred in 1960 to the Borg-Warner plant at Letchworth in Great Britain. The BW-35 was offered to European automobile producers where it was widely used.|$|R

However, present diagnostic methods {{are unable to}} satisfy the individualized treatment requirements of patients with MPLC. The present study aimed to establish a quantitative mathematical model and analyze its diagnostic value for distinguishing between MPLC and cases of the histologically similar disease, intrapulmonary metastasis (IPM).
