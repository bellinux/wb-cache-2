50|$|The initial {{motivation}} to develop that prototype {{was that a}} <b>junior</b> <b>translator</b> came to TAUM {{to ask for help}} in translating weather bulletins at Environment Canada. Since all official communications emanating from the Canadian government must be available in French and English, because of the Official Languages Act of 1969, and weather bulletins represent a large amount of translation in real time, junior translators had to spend several months producing first draft translations, which were then revised by seniors. That was a difficult and tedious job, because of the specificities of the English and French sublanguages used, and not very rewarding, as the lifetime of a bulletin is only 4 hours.|$|E
50|$|METEO 1 was {{formally}} adopted in 1981, replacing the <b>junior</b> <b>translators</b> in the workflow. Because {{of the need}} for high quality translation, the revision step, done by senior translators, was maintained. The quality, measured as the percentage of edit operations (inserting or deleting a word counts as 1, replacing as 2) on the MT results, reached 85% in 1985.|$|R
40|$|The article {{outlines}} the {{changes of the}} translation market, the development of Higher Education (HE) translator training and of the profession of translator in Slovenia. First, three HE translator-training programmes in Slovenia are briefly described. Second, through {{an analysis of the}} public database containing information on all business entities in Slovenia, a description of the translation market in 2014 is made and the findings are compared to those of a similar study carried out in 2007. Then two surveys of translation graduates of University of Ljubljana are presented, focusing in particular on graduate employment statistics and average earnings of <b>junior</b> <b>translators.</b> The results show that {{despite the fact that the}} Slovene translation market is thriving, this growth is not reflected in the average earnings of individual translators. Finally, in view of the fact that translation rates are constantly falling, it is argued that the role of professional associations becomes vital...|$|R
5000|$|Koryun (Armenian: [...] or , also transliterated as Koriwn, Koriun, Goriun or Gorune) was the {{earliest}} Armenian-language historian. Writing {{in the fifth}} century, his [...] "Life of Mashtots" [...] contains many details about the evangelization of Armenia and {{the invention of the}} Armenian alphabet. Some Armenian and European scholars, such as G. Alishan, O. Torosyan, G. Fintigliyan, A. Sarukhan, G. Ter-Mkrtchyan (Miaban), S. Weber and others, have speculated that Koryun could have been an ethnic Georgian (Iberian) or Georgian-Armenian. Having received his early education under Mesrob Mashtots, Koryun went to Byzantium for higher studies, returning to Armenia with other students in 432. He was a close friend of Eznik Koghbatsi and Ghevond. Later, he was appointed Bishop of Georgia. He has been listed among the <b>junior</b> <b>translators.</b> His style is original, but somewhat obscure due to grammatical irregularities. To him have been attributed the translations of the three apocryphal books of the Maccabees. Koryun was the origin of the claim that the Georgian alphabet was created by Mesrob Mashtots http://www.matiane.com/koryun.htm.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{construction}} of EBMPracticeNet, a national electronic point-of-care information platform in Belgium, was initiated in 2011 to optimize {{quality of care}} by promoting evidence-based decision-making. The project involved, among other tasks, the translation of 940 EBM Guidelines of Duodecim Medical Publications from English into Dutch and French. Considering {{the scale of the}} translation process, it was decided to make use of computer-aided translation performed by certificated translators with limited expertise in medical translation. Our consortium used a hybrid approach, involving a human translator supported by a translation memory (using SDL Trados Studio), terminology recognition (using SDL Multiterm termbases) from medical termbases and support from online machine translation. This has resulted in a validated translation memory which is now in use for the translation of new and updated guidelines. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of the hybrid human and computer-assisted approach in comparison with translation unsupported by translation memory and terminology recognition. A comparison was also made with the translation efficiency of an expert medical translator. Methods: We conducted a pilot trial in which two sets of 30 new and 30 updated guidelines were randomized to one of three groups. Comparable guidelines were translated (a) by certificated <b>junior</b> <b>translators</b> without medical specialization using the hybrid method (b) by an experienced medical translator without this support and (c) by the same <b>junior</b> <b>translators</b> without the support of the validated translation memory. A medical proofreader who was blinded for the translation procedure, evaluated the translated guidelines for acceptability and adequacy. Translation speed was measured by recording translation and post-editing time. The Human Translation Edit Rate was calculated as a metric to evaluate the quality of the translation. A further evaluation was made of translation acceptability and adequacy. Results: The average number of words per guideline was 1, 195 and the mean total translation time was 100. 2 min/ 1, 000 words. No meaningful differences were found in the translation speed for new guidelines. The translation of updated guidelines was 59 min/ 1, 000 words faster (95 % CI 2 - 115; P=. 044) in the computer-aided group. Revisions due to terminology accounted for one third of the overall revisions by the medical proofreader. Conclusions: Use of the hybrid human and computer-aided translation by a non-expert translator makes the translation of updates of clinical practice guidelines faster and cheaper because of the benefits of translation memory. For the translation of new guidelines there was no apparent benefit in comparison with the efficiency of translation unsupported by translation memory (whether by an expert or non-expert translator...|$|R
50|$|As part of French Indochina both Laos and Cambodia {{were seen}} {{as a source of}} raw {{materials}} and labor for the more important holdings in Vietnam. French colonial presence in Laos was light; the Resident Superieur was responsible for all colonial administration from taxation to justice and public works. The French maintained a military presence in the colonial capital under the Garde Indigene made up of Vietnamese soldiers under a French commander. In important provincial cities like Luang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Pakse there would be an assistant resident, police, paymaster, postmaster, schoolteacher and a doctor. Vietnamese filled most upper level and mid-level positions within the bureaucracy, with Lao being employed as <b>junior</b> clerks, <b>translators,</b> kitchen staff and general laborers. Villages remained under the traditional authority of the local headmen or chao muang. Throughout the colonial administration in Laos the French presence never amounted to more than a few thousand Europeans. The French concentrated on the development of infrastructure, the abolition of slavery and indentured servitude (although corvee labor was still in effect), trade including opium production, and most importantly the collection of taxes.|$|R
