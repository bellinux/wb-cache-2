Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed <b>for</b> <b>toxic</b> fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement <b>for</b> <b>toxic</b> phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E
5|$|For {{surface water}} {{sources such as}} lakes and reservoirs, the volume {{available}} for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO4) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, {{with the possible exception}} of fluorine. The elements iron, manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies <b>for</b> <b>toxic</b> trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency <b>for</b> <b>Toxic</b> Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E

50|$|One {{well known}} group of {{substances}} which are <b>toxic</b> <b>for</b> reproduction are teratogens - substances which cause birth defects - of which (S)-thalidomide is {{possibly the most}} notorious.

25|$|Toxicity of {{contaminants}} is generally {{a function of}} concentration and exposure (dose), and therefore the effects increase with the ambient pressure. The consequence is that breathing gases for hyperbaric use must have proportionately lower acceptable limits <b>for</b> <b>toxic</b> contaminants compared to normal surface pressure use. The allowable concentration is also affected by whether the effect is cumulative and {{whether there is a}} threshold for acceptable long-term exposure.|$|E
25|$|In order <b>for</b> <b>toxic</b> {{substances}} like {{heavy metals}} to cause effects in organisms, {{they must be}} bioavailable. For organisms residing in contaminated sediments, the contaminants are most bioavailable when dissolved in the pore water, {{as opposed to being}} precipitated as a solid or sorbed to a sediment particle. Metals in the solid metal-sulfide form are thus considered non-bioavailable, and are unlikely to cause toxicity in sediment-dwelling organisms.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} arsenic {{poisoning}} is possible. British anti-lewisite (dimercaprol) is prescribed in doses of 5mg/kg up to 300mg every 4hours {{for the first}} day, then every 6hours for the second day, and finally every 8hours for 8 additional days.
