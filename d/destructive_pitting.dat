40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} worm gear test stands were {{conducted}} {{in order to find}} out conditions for avoiding or limiting a <b>destructive</b> <b>pitting.</b> The theoretical pressure distribution at the contact points of the test gears was determined by FE calculations. It is shown that worm gear service life is not directly limited by <b>destructive</b> <b>pitting</b> but by one of the sequential damages wear, disturbed speed transfer behaviour or tooth fracture. Three sequential phases of destruction are defined: formation of pitting, growth of pitting and wear. Empirical approximated equations are given to compute the relevant time phases. From these equations criteria of failure of worm gears can be derived for the evaluation of the service life.

40|$|A tooth of the {{collector}} gear {{of a helicopter}} has failed by fatigue. Multiple fatigue cracks {{were found to have}} initiated at the spalled region on the working flank of the tooth and propagated simultaneously across the thickness to critical lengths before giving way to final overload failure. Examination revealed spalling, <b>destructive</b> <b>pitting</b> and wear on all the teeth of the sector of the gear provided for investigation. The damages were predominantly observed below the pitch line. Severe wear and sliding marks were observed over a band on the dedendum of the flank suggesting unusual loading during the tooth withdrawal cycle...|$|E
40|$|A deep {{comprehension}} of the damage mechanisms involved in contact fatigue should optimize material and heat treatment choice for a specific application. In this work rolling disc-on-disc contact fatigue tests have been performed on a hardened and tempered UNI EN 42 CrMo 4. The adopted test method creates the best conditions {{in order to develop}} micro-pitting on disc surface. Extensive micro-fractographic examinations have been carried out, on the damaged surfaces, through a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). For this steel, loaded with Hertzian pressure of 1000 MPa, the failure mode is always micro-pitting which begins at the surface, and it is not a sub-superficial damaging. If micro-pits develop, they will coalesce in larger craters. By this way, the probability that micropitting will degenerate into sub-superficial <b>destructive</b> <b>pitting</b> is very high...|$|E
50|$|The use of {{the land}} for public {{recreation}} originated {{with the creation of}} Cwmdonkin reservoir around 1850 by William Henry Smith and the Swansea Waterworks Company. The records of the Borough of Swansea and the Cambrian newspaper detail the somewhat controversial use of public funds to take over and run “the <b>destructive</b> <b>pit</b> at Cwmdonkin, euphemistically called a reservoir”.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoil depth is an {{important}} property for estimating crop production potential and soil water availability. Direct estimates of soil depth from <b>destructive</b> boreholes and <b>pits</b> are too costly for being extended to large areas. Geophysical methods are often cited as possible alternative. However their ability to provide reliable estimations of soil depth {{are known to be}} highly dependent on local site characteristics. Therefore combining geophysical methods based on different physical parameters generally enhances the probability to obtain a better prediction. This study, partly supported by the FP 7 -Digisoil project, examine the ability of the Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) method combined with classical high resolution Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) one to predict soil depths in a 500 m ranged Mediterranean hillslope (Southern France) with increasing soil depths along the slope. SASW was performed from data measured in the field with classical seismic equipment (impulse source and geophones along a profile). In the same place, 8 transects of ERT (Wenner-Schlumberger array, 1 meter electrode spaced) were measured in wet conditions and in dry one. In order to calibrate geophysical measurements, observations of 130 boreholes (4 meters deep) were made to determine the soil depths, defined here as the occurrence depth of an heterogeneous marine Miocene uncemented sandstone with centimetrical laminations. Firstly ERT and SASW sections were analysed separately. This showed that each geophysical method was not sufficient to predict soil depth along the whole hillslope (lower part with calcaric Cambisol / upper part with calcisol). SASW predicted well soil depth in {{the lower part of the}} hillslope (with calcaric Cambisol) whereas data from ERT were disrupted by shallow permanent groundwater. Conversely, soil depth was well predicted with ERT in the upper part of the hillslope whereas a high variability of SASW data near the topsoil provided difficulties in soil depth prediction. Significant differences in bedrock hardness along the slope explained a part of this high variability. From these results, it was possible to define a new estimator of soil depth that is a weighted mean of the estimations given by each methods, the weights being defined as varying along the slope so that more importance is given to ERT estimates in the upper part of the hillslope and more importance is given to SASW in the lower part. This study shows the interest of such a fuzzy logic based sensor combination to estimate soil properties when the uncertainty of prediction are variable between locations and geophysical methods...|$|R
40|$|A deep {{comprehension}} of the damage mechanisms involved in contact fatigue is basic to optimize materials and heat treatments for specific applications. In this work rolling disc-on-disc contact fatigue tests have been performed on three different materials: an hardened and tempered UNI EN 42 CrMo 4, a nitrided UNI EN 42 CrMo 4 steel and a carburized UNI EN 18 NiCrMo 5 steel. The test method adopted was optimized to best realize such conditions able to develop micro-pitting on different materials. The main aim of this test campaign was to investigate and compare damage on surface, in terms of initiating and propagating mechanisms. Extensive micro-fractographic analyses were performed on the damaged samples {{by the use of}} a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). For hardened and tempered steel, failure mode was micro-pitting, started from surface, but evolved into pitting because of crack path extending more deeply beneath the surface. Pits always originated on top surface and propagated as like a common fatigue crack. In the case of carburized steel, micro-pitting initiated at oxides at most surface grain boundaries, i. e. those sites characterized by greatest brittleness. Superficial cracks initiated and propagated inside the white-layer for the nitrided steel. Once initiated, micro-pits may develop. Damaging rate can significantly increase by coalescence of small closest pits into a larger crater so much micro-pitting phenomena do not arrest, but it can degenerate into <b>destructive</b> <b>pitting</b> and spalling...|$|E
