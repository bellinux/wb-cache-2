30|$|When a fire {{burned through}} a {{transect}} as predicted, {{the methods used}} in this study appear to estimate ROS without bias. An inevitable difficulty is accounting for factors such as wind that affect fire behavior in experimental fires (Gould et al. 2007) (Figure 1). During some of these prescribed fires, we observed flaming fronts advancing periodically through the vegetation in narrow strips. These leading strips usually occurred at focal points along the <b>ignition</b> <b>line</b> where fire was applied directly to the shrub canopy. Installing transects at predetermined focal points may increase the likelihood of collecting accurate one-dimensional ROS measurements.|$|E
30|$|To {{quantify}} fire severity, we {{estimated the}} fraction of total, live, and dead canopy fuel consumption in a 178 m × 160 m sampling located 100 m downwind of the <b>ignition</b> <b>line</b> (Figure 1 B) within each simulation. We calculated {{the fraction of}} canopy fuel consumption for each ∼ 4 m 2 cell by integrating the vertical column above each surface cell that had canopy above it and then dividing by {{the sum of the}} initial mass in each column. In addition, we qualitatively assessed fire type using definitions in Scott and Reinhardt (2001): surface fire = a fire spreading through surface fuels, torching = a crown fire in which individual or small groups of trees torch out, and active crown fire = a crown fire in which the entire fuel complex becomes involved.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elementary {{analysis on the}} difference and similarity between upslope fire and jump fire, {{by a series of}} experiments performed in laboratory. The rate of spread (ROS), fire line angle (separation angle of the two fire lines), angular velocity of fire line, flame residence time and non-dimensional radiant heat transfer for the two kinds of phenomena are investigated. For upslope fire, it is found that ROS remains almost steady for <b>line</b> <b>ignition,</b> while it increases with time for point ignition. For upslope fires with <b>line</b> <b>ignition,</b> the fire <b>line</b> angle decreases with time from the initial 180 o to a steady small value, while for point ignition, the initially generated fire line angle remains steady. The angular velocity of fire line does not depend on slope angle in an upslope fire with <b>line</b> <b>ignition.</b> For jump fire, the ROS first increases sharply and then decreases gradually, and it depends on slope angle more significantly than the initial fire line angle. The fire line angle increases with time, and the angular velocity of fire line varies with slope angle. For upslope fires with <b>line</b> <b>ignition,</b> the flame residence time increases with slope angle, while it remains almost constant for upslope tests with point ignition. For jump fire, under one specific initial fire line angle, the overall mean residence time increases with increasing slope angle. Non-dimensional heat radiation for fuel preheating is calculated which effectively explains the ROS development in upslope fire with <b>line</b> <b>ignition</b> and jump fire...|$|R
30|$|At {{all five}} sites, we {{established}} {{five to ten}} transects that were either 5 m or 10 m apart, depending upon {{size and shape of}} the burn unit. We collected plant community and fire severity data in 1 m 2 quadrats placed every 10 m along each transect. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, there were 50 quadrats per burn unit; at Mima Mounds, Scatter Creek, and West Rocky, there were 100 quadrats per burn unit. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, where ignition pattern treatments were applied, there were 21 to 29 quadrats per ignition pattern treatment (sample size was dependent upon where <b>ignition</b> <b>lines</b> met within the burn unit), so sample size between ignition patterns and sites varied slightly. Due {{to the fact that we}} could not replicate ignition pattern treatments within each burn, ignition pattern data are pseudo-replicated within a site (Hurlbert 1984, but see Oksanen 2003 for a rebuttal). Despite this design challenge, we still believe that these data provide a unique opportunity to evaluate fire behavior, severity, and effects associated with fire ignition patterns.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} firebreaks {{in the prevention of}} wildfires in the Arnhem Land Plateau, a vast, rugged and sparsely populated region with high biodiversity value and frequent wildfires. A total of 623 events where a fire met a permanent firebreak (cliffs, stream order, tracks and roads) in different fire seasons were compiled. Cliffs were more effective than streams at stopping fires, which were more effective than roads. Larger streams were more effective than small ones. The largest streams stop 75 % of early dry season fires, but there are no firebreak types with more than 50 % likelihood of stopping a late dry season fire. Geographic Information System (GIS) surfaces of the relative density of the three firebreak features in the landscape were randomly sampled and compared with the total number of fires and late dry season fires using generalised linear modelling. Several of the density variables were weakly but significantly related to fire frequency, and it appears that late dry season fires are influenced by features at a larger scale (16 -km radius) than total fires (4 km). The Aerial Prescribed Burning program for 2004 was studied to identify how effective it was at stopping subsequent wildfires by dividing <b>ignition</b> <b>lines</b> into 137 5 -km sections. Only 20 % of sections achieved a 100 % burn and where gaps occurred, a subsequent fire was 88 % likely to penetrate the line. Firebreaks are not certain instruments for fire management in this area...|$|R
40|$|A shrubland fire {{behaviour}} dataset was assembled {{using data from}} experimental studies in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and South Africa. The dataset covers {{a wide range of}} heathlands and shrubland species associations and vegetation structures. Three models for rate of spread are developed using 2 -m wind speed, a wind reduction factor, elevated dead fuel moisture content and either vegetation height (with or without live fuel moisture content) or bulk density. The models are tested against independent data from prescribed fires and wildfires and found to predict fire spread rate within acceptable limits (mean absolute errors varying between 3. 5 and 9. 1 m min- 1). A simple model to predict dead fuel moisture content is evaluated, and an <b>ignition</b> <b>line</b> length correction is proposed. Although the model can be expected to provide robust predictions of rate of spread in a broad range of shrublands, the effects of slope steepness and variation in fuel quantity and composition are yet to be quantified. The model does not predict threshold conditions for continuous fire spread, and future work should focus on identifying fuel and weather factors that control transitions in {{fire behaviour}}...|$|E
40|$|Idealized FIRETEC grassfire {{simulations}} {{were used}} to study some of the roles that three-dimensional aspects of coupled atmosphere/fire interactions play on fire behavior. Domains of various widths that were periodic in the cross-stream direction, simulating an infinite-length fireline, {{were used to}} isolate local fireline-scale threedimensional effects. Two-dimensional vertical plane (zero width) simulations were performed for comparison. Idealized finite-length fire simulations were used to study the larger fire-scale three-dimensional effects. In the infinitely long simulations the fireline remains fairly straight on a macroscale while significant heterogeneities develop along the fireline at fireline-scales. These simulations suggest {{that the nature of}} atmosphere–fire coupling and these heterogeneities are influenced by wind speed. At low wind speed, the spread rate is not significantly affected by the width of the domain (for domains greater than 10 m wide). For higher wind speeds, the flank of the simulated firelines is fingered and the front of the fireline exhibits lobes. The average spread rates vary by approximately 20 % for the different domain widths. In the finite-length fireline simulations, the fireline shape was fairly parabolic and the headfire rate of spread (ROS) increased with wind speed and length of <b>ignition</b> <b>line.</b> The curvature of the fire was also influenced by the length of the <b>ignition</b> <b>line.</b> The indrafts of the headfire and flanking fire lines compete for upstream wind. For wider fires, the separation between the flanking fire lines is larger and more of the upstream wind is able to reach the headfire. These finite-length simulations also suggest that there might be an overall negative pressure gradient from upwind of the fireline to downwind of the fireline near the ground. This pressure gradient is believed to be tied to the penetration of wind through the fireline and the convective heating of unburned fuel. Streamwise-vorticity pairs contribute to the heterogeneous appearance of the fire front by feeding upward momentum in the location where towers are seen on the fireline and thrusting hot gases through the fireline and down to the unburned fuel in the troughs between the firelines. These streamwise vorticies have also been recognized in the periodic infinite length and finite-length simulated firelines as well as laboratory tests. In the two-dimensional simulations with wind speeds above 3 m/s, one major effect of the two-dimensional restrictions is to preclude the nominally streamwise-vorticity structures from forming upstream of the fireline. This thus diminishes the ability of the wind to mix through the heated plume and entrain hot gases down into the fuels ahead of the fire. These simulations suggest that caution should be used when attempting to use one or two-dimensional models to simulate wildland fires. These simulations also suggest the significant value of experiments in which details of both flow and fire dynamics can be studied at scales ranging from fireline scale to overall fire geometry scales in order to better understand fire behavior. The hypothesis generated here can help provide insight in support of experimental design and analysis...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{propulsion}} {{research and}} technology require launch and space flight technologies, which {{can drastically reduce}} mission costs. Laser propulsion is a concept in which energy of a thrust producing reaction mass is supplied via beamed energy from an off-board power source. A variety of laser/beamed energy concepts were theoretically and experimentally investigated since the early 1970 's. During the 1980 's the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) research lead to {{the invention of the}} Laser Lightcraft concept. Based upon the Laser Lightcraft concept, the U. S. Air Force and NASA have jointly set out to develop technologies required for launching small payloads into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for a cost of $ 1. 0 M or $ 1000 /lb to $ 100 /lb. The near term objectives are to demonstrate technologies and capabilities essential for a future earth to orbit launch capability. Laser propulsion offers the advantages of both high thrust and good specific impulse, I(sub sp), in excess of 1000 s. Other advantages are the simplicity and reliability of the engine because of few moving parts, simpler propellant feed system, and high specific impulse. Major limitations of this approach are the laser power available, absorption and distortion of the pulsed laser beam through the atmosphere, and coupling laser power into thrust throughout the flight envelope, The objective {{of this paper is to}} assist efforts towards optimizing the performance of the laser engine. In order to accomplish this goal (1) defocusing of the primary optic was investigated using optical ray tracing and (2), time dependent calculations were conducted of the optically induced blast wave to predict pressure and temperature in the vicinity of the cowl. Defocusing of the primary parabolic reflector causes blurring and reduction in the intensity of the laser ignition site on the cowl. However, because of the caustic effect of ray-tracing optics the laser radiation still forms a well-defined <b>ignition</b> <b>line</b> on the cowl. The blast wave calculations show reasonable agreement with previously published calculations and recent detailed CFD computations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{objectives}} of the present study is to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} heat transfer mechanisms that control the spread of wildfires. Five experimental fires were conducted in the field across on plots of living vegetation. The lengths of the <b>ignition</b> <b>lines</b> were set in the range of 20 - 30 m to reproduce wildfire front conditions as closely as possible. The experiments were performed under various vegetation properties, wind conditions and plot topography to highlight different fire spread behaviours. This study focused on characterising heat transfer ahead of the flame front. The temperature and heat flux were measured at the top of the vegetation as the fire spread. The results showed the existence of two different fire spread regimes that were either dominated by radiation or governed by mixed radiant-convective heat transfer. For plume-dominated fires, the flow strongly responds to the great buoyancy forces generated by the fire; this guides the fire plume upward. For wind-driven fires, the flow is governed by inertial forces due to the wind, and the fire plume is greatly tilted towards unburned vegetation. The correlations of the temperature (ahead of the flame front) and wind velocity fluctuations change according to the fire regime. The longitudinal distributions of the radiant heat flux ahead of the fire front are also discussed. The data showed that neither the convective Froude number nor the Nelson convection number [...] used in the literature to predict fire spread regimes [...] reflect the observed behaviour of wind-driven fires...|$|R

Initial Nova experiments on gas-filled hohlraums showed that radiation temperature was reduced due to SBS and SRS scattering losses and that implosion symmetry had shifted compared with vacuum hohlraums and calculations. Subsequent single beam experiments imaging thermal x-ray emission showed the shift is due to laser-plasma heating dynamics and filarnentation in a flowing plasma. Experiments using a single beam have shown that scattering losses and effects of filamentation are reduced when the beam is smoothed with an random phase plate (RPP) or kinoform phase plate (KPP). Scattering is further reduced to less than 5 % of the incident laser energy when SSD is added...|$|R

Since the power is connected directly to the vehicle battery, the <b>ignition</b> sense <b>line</b> tells the radio when the vehicle ignition is on. The PA board connects to the RF board via J 600, a 10 -pin socket. This connector supplies power to the RF board through F 600 and provides control over the PA board. CR 600, a transorb prevents negative voltages and extremely high positive voltages from damaging the radio by conducting and blowing the 12 A in-line fuse. The main antenna {{is connected to the}} PA board through J 630, a mini-UHF connector. The transmitter output and main receiver input are provided through this 50 Ω connector.

30|$|Two {{fire spread}} {{observations}} {{were obtained from}} experimental burns. The experimental installation (Carrot Lake [CL hereafter]; Lavoie et al. 2006) consisted {{of a series of}} 4 ha plots that had been established prior to, and in anticipation of, MPB spread into the local area (approximately 90 km south of Vanderhoof, British Columbia, Canada). Experimental plots were ignited in early August 2006, using <b>line</b> <b>ignition</b> from handheld drip torches at the windward edge (Figure 2 D). In each plot, the time of fire arrival was recorded at each point in a uniform 15 m grid using thermocouple timers (WREN Systems, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Fire spread rate and direction were calculated from the fire arrival and location data by triangulation (Simard et al. 1984). Since this method yielded numerous measures of ROS, the final ROS value used for analysis was the median of individual triangulated ROS measurements within each plot. Median values were used to reduce the influence of one or two much higher ROS measurements obtained at the plot edges due to wind exposure.|$|R
40|$|Managed {{and wild}} fires play a {{significant}} role in the ecology of heathlands in the UK but we currently have little ability to forecast fire behaviour or the likelihood of accidental wildfires. Like many shrubland fuel types, heathlands display significant structural complexity and the role of different fuel components in governing flammability has not been clear. Using a series of small, field-based ignition tests, we demonstrate the critical importance of the moisture content of dead fine fuels in the lower canopy for determining when sustaining fires in the vegetation canopy can develop. At moisture contents above c. 70 % both spot and <b>line</b> <b>ignitions</b> failed but where moisture contents were less than c. 60 % fires developed rapidly. The initial rate of spread of successful ignitions was primarily controlled by the moisture content of the lower canopy and the moss/litter layer. Models that predict the moisture content of elevated dead fuels and the moss litter layer are urgently needed in order to protect heathlands from wildfire and to allow forecasts of the suitability of conditions for prescribed burning to be developed...|$|R
40|$|Re: Submission of Joseph W. Mitchell, Ph. D in {{the matter}} of the {{ignition}} of bushfires by power lines under extreme weather conditions Dear Commissioners; I recently learned that your Commission was investigating the possibility that electrical infrastructure was involved in the ignition of some of the February 2009 bushfires. This is a field of study of mine, and is currently a subject of considerable interest in the state of California. In October 2007, extreme weather conditions of low humidity and high winds caused the ignition of 20 bushfires (or wildland fires) throughout Southern California. Involvement of electric distribution or transmission infrastructure was attributed in 9 of these fires. In response, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which is the state regulatory agency that oversees electric utilities, has taken a number of measures to discover and address the causes of power line fires. I am an expert witness for a citizen's group that is involved in a number of the CPUC proceedings, and have submitted testimony and reports on the subject of power <b>line</b> <b>ignitions</b> of wildland fires. Additionally, I've presented one academic paper on the subject, presented at...|$|R
40|$|Unplanned, {{unmanaged}} wildfires are {{a significant}} threat to people, infrastructure and ecosystems around the world. Managed, planned burning is widely used for reducing the incidence, extent or intensity of wildfires. Fire weather and the season of burning are recognised as crucial factors influencing fire behaviour but the demonstrated influence of ignition technique on fire behaviour is not as prominently discussed in relation to planned fires. We found wildfires, irrespective of season, burnt the ground layer more completely (i. e. were less patchy) and produced greater crown scorch severity than did planned fires in a spinifex (Triodia spp.) -dominated open woodland. Fires ignited with a 50 -m line burning with the wind produced significantly higher intensities than did <b>line</b> <b>ignition</b> against the wind, and spot ignitions with or against the wind. These {{data suggest that the}} higher severity of wildfires in spinifex-dominated habitats is strongly influenced by long fire fronts, in addition to fire season and weather conditions. This study supports the value of planned burning for reducing fire severity and highlights the value of spot ignitions in ecological burning to create a patchily burnt landscape, with limited canopy severity...|$|R
40|$|San Diego Gas & Electric Company has {{proposed}} retrofits to seven of its transmission lines {{to reduce the}} lines’ potential for igniting fires and to increase their ability to withstand damage from wildfires. Since the company’s ratepayers will ultimately pay {{for the cost of}} these retrofits through electricity rates, the benefit of the projects in terms of wildfire risk reduction is a matter of public policy interest. This study estimates the range of potential monetary losses that the company could incur due to wildfires and compares those losses to the costs of the transmission line retrofits as a means of evaluating their risk reduction benefit. The study uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the losses for the company from wildfires in a given year. The model outputs the number of ignitions from the transmission lines, the acreage of the resulting wildfires, the property damage caused by those fires, the length of transmission line damaged by wildfires, and the costs of repairing those lines. The model is parameterized using empirical observations of transmission <b>lines</b> <b>ignitions,</b> wildfire sizes, and property values for San Diego County. Results suggest that although the expected value of losses is not large enough to justify the investment in the retrofits, the high risk of losses (driven by rare but extremely damaging events) may justify the investment. The transmission lines in closest proximity to populated areas are the best candidates for retrofits. The study provides a possible framework for regulators and electric utilities to discuss the public benefit of safety-related infrastructure investments as part of the regulatory process...|$|R
30|$|In contrast, surface {{head and}} back fires and crown fires {{are used in}} the {{communal}} fire paradigm by lighting fires as point ignitions, but there is no clear reason why point ignitions are used to ignite the fires other than convenience. Currently, point ignitions are assumed to have a greater pyrodiversity than perimeter-ignited fires. Pyrodiversity refers to the degree of variation in fire effects in terrestrial ecosystems and is assumed to promote biodiversity (Parr and Andersen 2006) because it is hypothesized that point ignitions generate more variable fires in terms of type and intensity resulting in highly diverse fire patterns, i.e., greater pyrodiversity. The effects of point ignitions versus perimeter ignitions on pyrodiversity are currently being investigated in a research project in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, referred to as the Savanna Fire Ignition Research Experiment (SavFIRE). The current fire policy in the park, involving Patch Mosaic Burning, uses point and short <b>line</b> <b>ignitions</b> as a means of promoting and maintaining biodiversity that has replaced the previous block burning program that used perimeter ignitions. This change in the fire policy in the Kruger National Park was influenced by the development of the patch mosaic burning system in the Pilansberg National Park in South Africa, where point ignitions have been used for several decades (Brockett et al. 2001). The experiment in the Kruger National Park is still in progress, but preliminary results suggest that, contrary to expectations, the major factors affecting pyrodiversity are weather conditions rather than type of ignition and size of burn. These preliminary results indicate that when burning fully cured grass fuel, the goal of greater pyrodiversity is achieved if fires are ignited when the air temperature is < 25 °C and the relative humidity > 50 %.|$|R
