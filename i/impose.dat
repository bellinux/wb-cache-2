5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that the state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to <b>impose</b> such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not <b>impose</b> regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to <b>impose</b> any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E

5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities <b>impose</b> another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to <b>impose</b> such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than <b>impose</b> those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not <b>impose</b> sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. A channel with 40 to 1 aspect ratio and rectangular cross-section {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>imposed</b> oscillations on transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Oscillations are <b>imposed</b> using a single rotating vane located in the flow downstream of the test section. Flows with Reynolds numbers ranging from 1100 to 3580 and Strouhal numbers from 0. 0211 to 0. 2418 are studied. For all cases, time-averaged velocity profiles are unaffected by <b>imposed</b> oscillations. <b>Imposed</b> oscillations have a destabilizing effect on the flow {{near the edge of the}} Stokes layer. Turbulence intensity magnitudes with <b>imposed</b> oscillations show that transition to turbulence begins at lower Reynolds numbers and extends over a wider range of Reynolds numbers than when no <b>imposed</b> oscillations are present. In addition, higher levels of intermittency are present with <b>imposed</b> oscillations for Reynolds numbers 1900 to 2200 at yd= 0. 90. At Reynolds numbers from 1450 to 1800, frequency spectra evidence high intensity intermittent turbulent fluctuations, followed and preceded by quiescent flow, both with and without <b>imposed</b> oscillations. A center mode of secondary instability is evidenced by high values of normalized longitudinal turbulence intensity measured in the channel center when no oscillations are <b>imposed</b> on the flow. <b>Imposed</b> oscillations are found to suppress this center mode of secondary instability, as evidenced by reductions in longitudinal turbulence intensity values near the channel center.
