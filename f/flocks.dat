5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} <b>flocks,</b> and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in <b>flocks</b> of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller <b>flocks</b> form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large <b>flocks</b> seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} often {{travels with}} small mixed <b>flocks</b> in winter.

40|$|<b>Flocking</b> {{involves}} {{the application of}} fine particles to adhesive coated surfaces. The majority of <b>flocking</b> is done using finely cut natural or synthetic fibers. <b>Flocked</b> finishes impart a decorative and/or required characteristics to functional surfaces such as fabrics, plastic films and sheet metals. <b>Flock</b> fibers are usually applied to adhesive coated surfaces mechanically, electrostatically, or {{by a combination of}} both techniques. The focal points of this year investigation are: (1) experimental verification of a mathematical model for <b>flock</b> fiber motion in an electric field and (2) objective color measurement of loose <b>flock</b> fibers and <b>flocked</b> surfaces. <b>Flock</b> motion in an DC <b>flocking</b> zone was investigated using a high speed digital CCD camera and an image analysis software package. The experimental evidences show that <b>flock</b> motion is influenced by the net charge on a <b>flock</b> fiber, relative humidity conditioning of <b>flock</b> fibers, and applied electric field strength. A color measurement protocol for loose <b>flock</b> fiber was also developed. PROJECT OBJECTIVE 1. Develop a fundamental understanding of <b>flock</b> motion in electrostatic, gravitational and pneumatic force field during the <b>flocking</b> process. 2. Establish an understanding of textile based <b>flock</b> materials and processes from the standpoint of test procedures as they pertain to materials processing properties such as electrical conductivity, fiber motion. 3.

5|$|Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are {{generally}} seen in <b>flocks</b> of varying sizes, though {{males and females}} pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within <b>flocks.</b> <b>Flocks</b> increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and common gull (Larus canus) in northwestern England. <b>Flocks</b> are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flocking</b> is an {{emergent}} {{behavior in}} which each individual agent follows a simple behavior rule {{that leads to a}} group behavior that appears cohesive and coordinated. In our work, we consider how to in-fluence a <b>flock</b> using a set of ad hoc agents. Ad hoc agents are added to the <b>flock</b> and are able to influence the <b>flock</b> to adopt a desired behavior by acting as part of the <b>flock.</b> Specifically, we first examine how the ad hoc agents can behave to quickly orient a <b>flock</b> towards a target head-ing when given knowledge of, but no direct control over, the behavior of the <b>flock.</b> Then we consider how the ad hoc agents can behave to herd the <b>flock</b> through turns quickly but with minimal agents being separated from the <b>flock</b> {{as a result of these}} turns. We introduce an algorithm which the ad hoc agents can use to influence the <b>flock.</b> We also present detailed experimental results for our algorithm, concluding that in this setting, short-term lookahead planning improves significantly upon base-line methods and can be used to herd a <b>flock</b> through turns quickly while maintaining the composition of the <b>flock.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Outside its {{breeding}} season, the russet sparrow is gregarious {{and forms}} <b>flocks</b> to find food, though it infrequently associates with other birds. Wintering <b>flocks</b> tend {{to keep away}} from human habitation. The russet sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes.

5|$|Scaly-breasted munias form <b>flocks</b> {{of as many}} as 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with calls that include a short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep <b>flocks</b> together.|$|E
5|$|Sheep are an {{important}} part of the global agricultural economy. However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow. China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern <b>flocks,</b> and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton. Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller <b>flocks</b> but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers. Especially in developing countries, such <b>flocks</b> may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade. Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.|$|E

The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large <b>flocks</b> may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E
40|$|The fires which {{recently}} occurred in <b>flock</b> machines in America {{have shown that}} toady's knowledge of the ignitability of <b>flock</b> clouds on <b>flock</b> machines is not sufficient. This is why it has been investigated {{within the scope of}} a research project which minimum spark energy is required to ignite <b>flock</b> clouds on <b>flock</b> machines. The first step taken for this purpose consisted in measuring the minimum ignition energy of more than 60 commercial <b>flock</b> samples on a minimum ignition energy apparatus optimized for high spark energies. It turned out that the minimum ignition energy of <b>flock</b> depends on fiber diameter, fiber length, fiber material, type and quantity of the chemical preparation compound and on the fiber color. Average <b>flock</b> has a minimum ignition energy of about 150 mJ. The lowest value of approx. 80 mJ was obtained for the finest commercial ground cotton <b>flock.</b> If the fines content can accumulate, it is, however, possible that even much lower values can be reached. In a second step it was tried to ignite the most ignitable <b>flock</b> samples by sparks and arc discharges from <b>flock</b> machines. It turned out that the single sparks of DC <b>flock</b> machines which are not ignition-optimized ignited the most ignitable <b>flock</b> samples only at discharge energies above 1300 mJ. Such discharges can occur only during failures of large DC facilities. (orig.)

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{asynchronous}} updating {{of the state}} of the agents in a Cucker-Smale <b>flocking</b> model is considered in this paper. The study of asynchronous update is important because in practical implementations the agents typically have internal clocks that are not synchronized. We considered how asynchronous update will affect the time it takes to achieve <b>flocking</b> (<b>flocking</b> time) as well as how close the agents in the <b>flock</b> are moving (<b>flock</b> diameter). These factors were largely ignored in most previous works as achieving asymptotic convergence was their main focus. Furthermore, previous simulations typically assume that the agents move with the same speed. We considered the effects of achieving consensus of both the speed and the heading. Through computer simulations, we showed that both the <b>flocking</b> time and <b>flock</b> diameter increase significantly with asynchronicity. Results also showed that the diameter of the <b>flock</b> is substantially larger when the agents start with different speeds. These results should be taken into account when designing <b>flocking</b> agents in practice...|$|R
