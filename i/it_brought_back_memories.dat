5000|$|Following her {{realization}} that Buffy is the Slayer, Joyce begins to express concern for Buffy's well-being and long-term plans. The third season showcases two episodes in which Joyce {{is a major}} character. Both of them posit Buffy as a parent figure over Joyce. With [...] "Band Candy" [...] the episode begins with Buffy being petulant and Joyce working with Giles to create a schedule for studying and slaying, but these roles quickly dissolve in the ensuing chaos. In an attempt to offer a sacrifice to a demon, Sunnydale's shadowy mayor intoxicates the adults of the town with drugged chocolate bars, making them devolve into adolescents. Joyce descends into {{the behavior of a}} 16-year-old, a prospect Kristine Sutherland found not only fun, but painful as <b>it</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>memories</b> she had not faced in years. Giles is also affected, turning into his adolescent miscreant self, which Joyce finds irresistible (the two have sex on a police car in the middle of downtown Sunnydale). Giles has become Buffy's father figure following her parents' divorce, and Buffy finds Joyce's attraction to Giles disquieting. Joyce had dated before ("Ted") but Buffy, and consequently the audience, do not see Joyce as a sexual character; she is foremost a mother. According to Lorna Jowett, Joyce is rare among the characters on the series: [...] "Joyce is always and only Buffy's mother, never just another person or a member of the team." ...|$|E

40|$|Re-reading my 1983 article 23 {{years after}} its {{publication}} {{has turned out to}} be quite an experience, in at least three dimensions: affective, conceptual and autobiographical. Affectively, <b>it</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> immediate <b>memories</b> of place and time and the students that I was working with. With that came some strange sense of loss: perhaps just a loss of youth and innocence, but then also a suspicion of current tiredness and age, rather than growth and wisdom. I see that the article is naïve in its approach to reading, but I was then on an upward trajectory, the sun was for me still in the ascendant and we were far from noon. Conceptually, the use of paragraphs as a formal level of analysis was in no way derived from a theory of text or reading, and the closing comments about the need “eventually to move away altogether from the paragraph-by-paragraph approach ” were prompted by an inquiry from the editor, Ray Williams, as to whether I was committed to this approach due to text-theoretical reasons. (I am not sure whether the regrettable “his ” in the second paragraph was Ray’s decision or mine, but I accept the responsibility.) The ideas, then, are explicitly procedural and classroom oriented, arising from a sense of “what works ” to help students deal with the need to shift from a school-world of readin...|$|R
5000|$|Dennis David's {{recollections}} of the autopsy and of Pitzer's materials were first made public in an anonymous 1975 {{interview with the}} Waukegan, Illinois News Sun. Since that time, Pitzer's name (often accompanied by misreported circumstances of his death) has appeared in many printed or televised lists of [...] "suspicious deaths" [...] having an alleged connection to the Kennedy assassination. Lt. Col. Dan Marvin (US Army, retired) claimed that when he saw such a list in 1993, <b>it</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to his <b>memory</b> an incident {{in the summer of}} 1965 in which he was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency to kill Pitzer. The author who Marvin engaged to co-write a book on the subject came to have serious doubts about Marvin's story. Dennis David alleged that Pitzer was left-handed but the bullet entry wound was {{on the right side of}} his head, from which David inferred that Pitzer may have been murdered. Pitzer was in fact right-handed. Pitzer is also sometimes said to have been present at the Kennedy autopsy at the NNMC, though he was not among those noted in official records.|$|R
40|$|The {{oil price}} hit {{a low of}} around USD 10 {{at the end of}} 1999. Since then it has moved upwards in a series of steps. In recent years it {{has been one of the}} most closely {{monitored}} components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a leading inflation indicator. When it topped the USD 50 mark in October 2004 and in March 2005 and, even more clearly, when it passed USD 60 in mid- 2005, <b>it</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> painful <b>memories</b> of the severe economic consequences of the 1970 s oil crisis. However, in real terms – after adjusting for inflation – the oil price is still lower now than it was then. Another striking factor is that between the mid 1980 s and the turn of the millennium the oil price fluctuated around an average of about USD 20. Since then, the average price level and volatility have greatly increased. Although a few years do not provide sufficient evidence to validate a trend, they do raise questions about the background to the oil price hike and its implications for monetary policy. This paper looks at the fundamental factors which suggest that oil prices are likely to remain both high and volatile. It also discusses the implications for monetary policy. Since maintaining price stability is the principal objective of monetary policy, this paper focuses primarily on the impact of oil prices on inflation; the effects on growth are considered insofar as they affect inflation. Section 2 outlines some of the reasons why oil prices are expected to remain high and volatile. Section 3 looks at forecasting oil prices while Section 4 outlines the possible implications of higher oil prices for economic growth and inflation. Finally, Section 5 examines the monetary policy implications of sustained high oil prices. The final section presents our conclusions. ...|$|R

40|$|Through the {{elimination}} of outside influences, a unique natural beauty, and peaceful locale Isle Royale allows for personal reflection and deep concentration leading to new inspirations on not only teaching but on life in general. Sharing this experience {{with others in the}} profession of teaching enhances motivation and reinforces a multidisciplinary approach to academics; it inspires me to think of additional ways to bring the Isle Royale experience to my students. There are so many interesting and varied aspects of Isle Royale to choose from for teachers and one way I felt {{that this would be a}} benefit for enhancing a mathematics unit was in the areas of data analysis and statistics. Almost every presentation, brochure, study, or text on Isle Royale had some type of graph or interpretive data included. Being a math teacher I thought this would be an excellent way to bring a variety of topics about Isle Royale into the classroom and would also allow for expansion on the topics from year to year as more data become available. Now admittedly, I was not thinking about bar graphs while I was on Isle Royale, but I do think it would be a cool way to allow students to see a range of topics concerning Isle Royale. <b>It</b> also <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> a <b>memory</b> from my aunt, now deceased, who taught in a one-room schoolhouse for 10 years in the 1930 ’s and 1940 ’s in New York State.

She also had the students plant something outside on Arbor Day each year. She was so inspiring to her students that years after the school was closed and consolidated a former student bought the school, made it his home, and published a booklet telling the story of this particular one room schoolhouse.
