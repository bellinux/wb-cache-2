It was previously shown that the shape of AEE-induced cell survival curves resembles that of High-LET irradiation and, therefore, poses the question of an increased biological effectiveness and a separate quality factor for Auger electrons. During electron capture or internal conversion an <b>electron</b> <b>vacancy</b> in an inner atomic shell is created. Filling the <b>electron</b> <b>vacancy</b> by a higher shell electron can initiate a process of non-radiative energy transmission, commonly termed as “Auger effect”. During the process numerous low-energy Auger electrons (up to 27 {{in the case of}} Iodine- 125) with a short range are emitted leading to energy densities and free radical production in the close vicinity of the emitter exceeding that of a 5 MeV alpha-particle traversing the DNA double-helix. Experimental data demonstrate, that the cyto- and genotoxicity of AEE is comparable to low-LET radiation per unit dose when the AEE is exclusively located in the cytoplasm. However, in case of DNA-incorporation RBEs ranging from 5 – 9 are frequently reported. Employing the alkaline and neutral comet assay, the high DSB/SSB ratio of I- 125 -iododeoxyuridine derived from Monte-Carlo simulations could be experimentally confirmed. The unique properties of AEE and the possibility to target DNA in a sequence-specific manner using AEE-labeled Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) enable to study the repair of complex DNA lesions at defined sites in more detail.

The site of the phosphorus ion has also been confidently identified. Three oxygenic-hole centres have been studied. Two of these {{are thought to be}} closely related, with one associated with yttrium and the other with an unknown ion. The third hole centre has been precisely determined as containing a boron ion substituting at a silicon lattice position. Three new Ti 3 + centres have been identified with two determined as analogues of the well known Zr 4 + substituted B(Ti 3 +) centre and the third as arising from a Ti 3 + ion in a silicon lattice position. Studies of the high-spin Nb 3 + (I = 9 / 2) and Gd 3 + (S = 5 / 2) centres were conducted in order to establish whether any high-spin Zeeman or mixed-spin terms might be determined but in both case were found to be small at best. Studies of an α -quartz single crystal have identified a previously unreported lithium-"compensated" aluminum oxygenic hole. It has been concluded that the <b>electron</b> <b>vacancy</b> in this centre is localised on one of the long-bonded oxygen atoms of the silicate tetrahedra and that the lithium compensating ion resides in one of the large c-axis cavities.

Lett. 79, 4778 (1997) ] nimmt neben dem Atom, an dem das ursprüngliche Elektronenloch lokalisiert war, noch ein weiteres Atom am Zerfall teil. So relaxieren Innervalenzvakanzen in schwach gebundenen Systemen innerhalb von fs durch Rekombination mit einem Valenzelektron des eigenen Atoms in Verbindung mit einem Energietransfer an ein benachbartes Atom, das daraufhin ein Valenzelektron emittiert. In Elektronenspektren von photoangeregten Neon van-der-Waals Clustern tritt oberhalb der Energieschwelle für die Bildung von Ne- 2 s-Innervalenzvakanz ein Elektronensignal mit kleinen kinetischen Energien auf, das einer Ionisation eines Nachbaratoms durch ICD zugeordnet werden kann. Die experimentellen Daten zeigen, dass es sich bei ICD in Ne-Clustern um einen hocheffektiven Mechanismus handelt, über den ein großer Teil, wenn nicht alle Ne- 2 s-Vakanzen zerfallen. In Ne-Ar-Mischclustern kann zusätzlich zum homoatomaren ICD-Kanal, an dem zwei Ne-Atome beteiligt sind, auch ein heteroatomarer Ne-Ar-ICD beobachtet werden.

High-energy radiation exceeding the ionization potential also generates free electrons which are negligible compared to those produced by electron beams which are charged. Charging of the sample following ionization is an extremely weak possibility when it cannot be guaranteed the ionized electrons leaving the surface or remaining in the sample are adequately balanced from other sources in time. The energy transfer to electrons {{as a result of}} ionizing radiation results in separated positive and negative charges which quickly recombine due partly to the long range of the Coulomb force. Insulating films like gate oxides and resists have been observed to charge to a positive or negative potential under electron-beam irradiation. Insulating films are eventually neutralized locally by space charge (electrons entering and exiting the surface) at the resist-vacuum interface and Fowler-Nordheim injection from the substrate. The range of the electrons in the film can be affected by the local electric field. The situation is complicated by the presence of holes (positively charged <b>electron</b> <b>vacancies)</b> which are generated along with the secondary electrons, and which may be expected to follow them around. As neutralization proceeds, any initial charge concentration effectively starts to spread out. The final chemical state of the film is reached after neutralization is completed, after all the electrons have eventually slowed down.

The theory poses that the continuum of negative energy states, that are solutions to the Dirac equation, are filled with <b>electrons,</b> and the <b>vacancies</b> in this continuum (holes) are manifested as positrons with energy and momentum that are the negative of those of the state. The discovery of the positron in 1929 gave a considerable support to the Dirac hole theory.|$|R
40|$|Metal oxide {{catalyst}} supports {{may contribute}} surface area, chemically active sites, {{or a combination}} to the catalytic reaction. Regarding cerium dioxide, the redox conversion between Ce 3 + and Ce 4 + is facile at conditions of industrial interest. When used as a catalyst support, this redox ability imparts CeO 2 with the capability to store and release oxygen to the catalytic reaction under various conditions of oxidant partial pressure. This work investigated the interaction of CO and O 2 with ceria-based catalysts reduced to varying degrees. Studies performed using in situ Raman spectroscopy provide direct, unambiguous evidence of surface carbon deposits on CeO 2, Ce 0. 75 Zr 0. 25 O 2, and Pd catalysts following CO exposure. The simultaneous appearance of bands attributed to Ce 3 + indicate that reduced Ce sites on the oxide supports are active for CO disproportionation (2 CO „³ Cs + CO 2). In order {{to account for the}} increase in intensity of the carbon bands with increasing time of exposure to CO, we propose a mechanism for CO disproportionation on CeO 2 -x involving aggregated oxygen vacancy sites. At the aggregated vacancy, the degree of electron density localization controls the rates at which CO acts as an electron donor or acceptor to form an energetically activated complex. We show that aggregated <b>electron</b> <b>vacancies</b> provide active sites for the autocatalytic disproportionation of CO on CeO 2 -x. After CO was disproportionated on the CeO 2 surface, subsequent exposure to O 2 at room temperature resulted in a decrease in the intensities of the carbon bands. At the same time, Raman modes characteristic of formate surface species appeared. We discuss the mechanism of formate formation on C/CeO 2 -x. Similar CO and O 2 exposure studies performed using a complimentary technique, IR spectroscopy, indicate that site blocking by carbonates {{may play a role in}} the increased oxygen storage capacity of ceria-zirconia catalysts compared to ceria catalysts alone...|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} type of defect {{of concern}} in quartz crystals is the substitution of an Al(III) for a Si(IV) atom in the crystal lattice. The aluminium ion has an associated interstitial charge compensator present nearby, {{which can be a}} H+ ion (attached to the nearby oxygen and forming a hydroxyl group, called Al−OH defect), Li+ ion, Na+ ion, K+ ion (less common), or an electron hole trapped in a nearby oxygen atom orbital. The composition of the growth solution, whether it is based on lithium or sodium alkali compounds, determines the charge compensating ions for the aluminium defects. The ion impurities are of concern as they are not firmly bound and can migrate through the crystal, altering the local lattice elasticity and the resonant frequency of the crystal. Other common impurities of concern are e.g. iron(III) (interstitial), fluorine, boron(III), phosphorus(V) (substitution), titanium(IV) (substitution, universally present in magmatic quartz, less common in hydrothermal quartz), and germanium(IV) (substitution). Sodium and iron ions can cause inclusions of acnite and elemeusite crystals. Inclusions of water may be present in fast-grown crystals; interstitial water molecules are abundant near the crystal seed. Another defect of importance is the hydrogen containing growth defect, when instead of a Si−O−Si structure, a pair of Si−OH HO−Si groups is formed; essentially a hydrolyzed bond. Fast-grown crystals contain more hydrogen defects than slow-grown ones. These growth defects source as supply of hydrogen ions for radiation-induced processes and forming Al-OH defects. Germanium impurities tend to trap electrons created during irradiation; the alkali metal cations then migrate towards the negatively charged center and form a stabilizing complex. Matrix defects can also be present; oxygen vacancies, silicon vacancies (usually compensated by 4 hydrogens or 3 hydrogens and a hole), peroxy groups, etc. Some of the defects produce localized levels in the forbidden band, serving as charge traps; Al(III) and B(III) typically serve as hole traps while <b>electron</b> <b>vacancies,</b> titanium, germanium, and phosphorus atoms serve as electron traps. The trapped charge carriers can be released by heating; their recombination is the cause of thermoluminescence.|$|R
