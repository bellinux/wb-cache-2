5|$|According to Pausanias {{he was the}} son of Diotimus. Ancient {{commentators}} mention {{an association}} between Milo and the philosopher Pythagoras, who lived at or near Croton for many years. Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, Pythagoras of Samos, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> the trainer and the philosopher were the same person.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{polynomial}} time algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known. For instance, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm {{can be used to}} list all maximal cliques in worst-case optimal time, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to list them in {{polynomial time}} per clique.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to fit the}} MILAN MBT turret.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to create}} {{libraries}} (e.g. using libtool) with different targeted object files.|$|R

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to check}} whether a given {{directed}} graph is a DAG in linear time, either {{by attempting to}} find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to explain}} why zero is even without {{referring}} to formal definitions. The following explanations {{make sense of the}} idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself—and its applicability to zero.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to walk or {{cycle to}} the arena from central Malmö via Kroksbäck and Kroksbäcksparken. An area {{reserved}} for the parking of up to 1,000 bicycles {{is located on the}} eastern side of the arena. There are areas for charter buses as well as taxis beside the arena's main and side entrances.|$|E

50|$|During the 2007 {{election}} {{campaigns in}} the German states of Rheinland-Pfalz, Baden-Württemberg, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Berlin, and Bremen, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to question the}} candidates.|$|R
5|$|Just {{as it is}} {{possible}} for a circle to be surrounded by six congruent circles that touch it, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the same size. This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, William {{continued}} his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited Rome, possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, {{the charge is}} unknown. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.|$|E
5|$|Their nearest analogies are {{the circles}} found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that the stone circles {{were linked to}} a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to change}} from one mode to another without a break, which was called [...] "admixture" [...] by Anonymous IV, writing around 1280 [...]|$|R

50|$|They also {{copied the}} ROM {{cartridge}} system from their Videopac G7000 game system. One of these cartridges contained Microsoft BASIC. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to use cassette tape floppies.|$|R
5|$|This {{building}} {{may have}} been a later or second hospital. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that these ruins {{may have been}} part of St Erchard's Church - a.k.a. St Marys' or the Auld Kirk.|$|E
5|$|A , or , is one {{of three}} senior members of the Yamayuri Council, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to generally speak of {{all the members of the}} Yamayuri Council as roses. A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student can run to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the en boutons, the Roses' petite sœurs.|$|E
5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, is easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E

50|$|This was a five-car DMU {{with two}} motorcars and three {{unpowered}} trailer cars. It used diesel-electric power system. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to couple and operate two connected DMUs driven from one cab.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} Rawlings Gold Glove Award, the prize is {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one right fielder. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> for outfield teammates to win the award in the same season, which has happened eight times since 1980.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
50|$|Officials at Ubisoft Shanghai said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> {{to control}} the game using only voice commands; Jeff Bakalar of CNET concurred, saying the {{demonstration}} he watched ran for twenty minutes without any perceptible faults.|$|R
50|$|Filterset.G was {{compatible}} with the native ad-blocking facility in KDE's Konqueror web browser from release 3.5 onwards. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> part of Epiphany-extensions' Ad Blocker extension for GNOME's Epiphany browser. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to use <b>it</b> with Safari via third-party plug-ins.|$|R

5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical {{readjustment}} between {{the model of the}} aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling latches.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive {{growth in the number of}} microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
50|$|Dancesport {{has held}} Half-Blue status for women since 1991 and for men since 1999. During this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to <b>be</b> awarded a {{discretionary}} full blue. In 2013, the women's blues committee upgraded Dancesport's status to Full Blue.|$|R
50|$|The {{possible}} {{answers were}} voor (For), tegen (Against). At some polling {{stations in the}} larger cities <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> to cast a blank ballot. The latter did not count for the result, but allowed voters to make an affirmative abstention.|$|R
