40|$|Author version made {{available}} here {{in accordance with}} publisher policy. Public policy strategies impact on population health by acting on the effectiveness, availability and distribution of the social determinants of health. Reducing obesity and promoting healthy weight is a key focus of governments, health promoters and researchers and can benefit from a systems approach with 'upstream' policy action beyond the health sector. Although the literature identifies many areas for hypothetical non-health policy action, and in particular relating to food and activity environments, few have identified practical, politically viable and relatively cost-free processes by which non-health sectors would want to commit to such action. This paper details how the Government of South Australia used the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach in the SA HiAP Healthy Weight Project. This mapped the core business and policy directions of 44 state departments against research on 'what works' to address obesity. Negotiations then developed high-level policy commitments to address factors promoting healthy weight which predominantly changed ways of working rather than requiring new expenditure, and also assisted departments in meeting their own goals; departmental chief executives endorsed the commitments. By starting from <b>departmental</b> <b>documents,</b> and not restricting the project to departments with more 'obvious' obesity prevention potential, we gained commitment to {{a broader range of}} policy actions than identified elsewhere; for example for prisons, environment and botanic gardens, housing and vocational education.

40|$|Articulation {{is defined}} by Byrnes as "the well {{motivated}} and well designed sequencing and coordination of instruction toward certain goals. " Factors concerning vertical articulation (the sequencing of language courses from the entry point to the end point of instruction) and horizontal articulation (coordination of multi-sectioned language courses) are the foci of this research. Student motivation relating to articulation efforts is also considered. The data for the study included <b>departmental</b> <b>documents,</b> course textbooks and course syllabi, questionnaires from 725 students and 99 instructors, follow-up interviews with eight students and six instructors, and a composition analysis of 66 student essays. While students' perceptions are favorable to the vertical flow of Spanish courses, data reveals that students experience a gap between Spanish 202 and Spanish 251 level courses. Furthermore, {{the data show that}} while certain policies and procedures implemented in the Spanish department dampen the concern of false beginners, students at the beginning and intermediate levels of instruction are placed below their proficiency levels. In regard to horizontal articulation, data indicate that standardized syllabi among individual multi-sectioned courses contribute to congruent instruction, whereas non-standardized syllabi created by individual instructors teaching the same course do not. In addition, rates of accurate usage of the verbs ser and estar in students' compositions indicate that students enrolled in Spanish 251 and 325 have reached similar levels of proficiency generally. Data also reveal a need for clearly and consistently stated instructional objectives in order to improve future articulation efforts. Other implications of the study include the need to investigate different methods for teacher training given the needs and constraints discussed by focus instructors...|$|R

Participants include over one hundred and forty teachers, seventy eight of whom have contributed formal interviews. Through analysis and triangulation of ethnographic interviews, participant observation data and school and <b>Departmental</b> <b>documents,</b> the study identifies cultural and institutional practices which, according to teacher perceptions, contribute to:. encouraging sexual harassment;. discouraging reports of sexual harassment; and. discouraging implementation of sexual harassment policy. Emerging cultural and institutional practices include blame attribution, silencing and gender construction which contribute to the marginalisation of some female teachers (in terms of their career); some female students (in terms of their education) and some male students who {{are perceived to be}} "gay" (in terms of their friendship groups). The usefulness, limitations and capacity to explain sexual harassment of a range of theoretical approaches are discussed. These approaches include Attribution, Role, Reproduction and Feminist theories. It is argued that, although accounting for the majority of sexual harassment, these theories are limited in their ability to fully account for: a) all kinds of sexual harassment practised in ACT high schools; b) the relationship between sexual harassment and other kinds of harassment in ACT high schools; and c) the extent to which some women teachers appear to support the practice of sexual harassment. Emerging Poststructuralist Feminism is proposed as a potentially useful theoretical framework for explaining and responding to sexual harassment in ACT high schools. It is hoped that this study will contribute to informing the decision making of those responsible for developing and/or implementing sexual harassment policy in ACT high schools, including teachers, school counsellors, principals, and administrators...|$|R
40|$|MEd (Learning and Teaching), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2013 Learning and {{assessment}} are inextricably intertwined, since assessment not only measures learning, but future learning is also dependent on assessment. The {{purpose of this}} two phase sequential mixed-methods {{study was to examine}} the interplay between informal and formal assessment in Grade 9 EFAL classrooms in order to gain a better understanding of teachers’ assessment practises. Argued from a constructivist point of view, the study endorses continuous assessment (CASS), which balances informal and formal assessment. In order to direct the study towards the stated purpose, the researcher embarked on a literature study to contextualise English as First Additional Language against the background of educational developments in South Africa since 1994 and to examine assessment of English First Additional Language in an OBE framework. The literature study was followed by an empirical study. By applying a sequential mixed-methods research design, 66 conveniently sampled EFAL teachers in the Johannesburg-North District of the Gauteng Department of Education participated in the quantitative phase of the empirical study. By means of a survey as strategy of inquiry, these teachers completed a questionnaire. Six randomly selected teachers from the initial sample participated in the qualitative phase of the empirical study which followed a case study strategy of inquiry and consisted of individual interviews and observations. The empirical research findings revealed that the sampled teachers experienced the official <b>Departmental</b> <b>documents</b> as regulatory, overwhelming and ambiguous and that they gave more attention to formal assessment than informal assessment. Due to this emphasis on formal assessment, the teachers felt uncertain about the purposes of informal assessment which, as a consequence, was considered as less important than formal assessment. A preference of conventional assessment methods was also disclosed which implied that the sampled teachers were not willing to experiment with alternative assessment methods. In conclusion, the researcher discovered that although CASS was implemented in the sampled teachers’ classrooms, learner-centred teaching founded on constructivism with the aim of encouraging scaffolding, was not high on the teachers’ teaching agendas.

This case study allowed for in-depth exploration of the faculty experience of the curriculum development process, of the project's leadership, and of the perceptions of change held by faculty. Faculty members were interviewed about the project, and minutes from committee meetings as well as other <b>departmental</b> <b>documents</b> were used to triangulate faculty feedback to paint a comprehensive picture of the experience of these faculty development projects. 	 First, the entire case study explores the range of responses faculty provided in their interviews.

Faculty reflected at length about the positive influence of the leaders and about their response to the amount of change required of them individually and of the department. 	 Next, analytic induction of the interview data resulted in a match between the leadership data and transformational leadership. The leaders of this project used delegation to direct the energy of the committee, invited inclusive participation, and promoted a shared vision for the department. As successful change leaders, they were able to build on the existing relationships in the department to achieve more than they had originally planned.

40|$|Within the {{international}} development community, global agreement around a poverty elimination target and the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) {{has led to}} renewed emphasis on partnership and cross-sectoral approaches. Similarly the UK Government aims to ensure policies are coherent in an increasingly complex global arena and has called for joined-up working. In response to both of these influences, the UK Government Department for International Development (DFID) stresses partnership, joining-up and cross-sectoral approaches within <b>departmental</b> <b>documents.</b> This research explores cross-sector policy and practice at DFID in the UK and Nepal and focuses particularly on cross-sectoral relationships between reproductive health and women's education. The research employs a social constructionist epistemology and utilises Critical Inquiry and Feminist theories, elements of grounded theory and narrative analysis methodologies, informing the use of numerous data collection methods. These methods include literature searches, document analysis, semi-structured interviews (incorporating Participatory Learning and Action techniques), informal meetings and critical reflection. Data was gathered in the UK and Nepal from DFID staff, Nepali Government staff, DFID-funded project staff, external development consultants and other stakeholders. A 'cross-sector continuum model' is presented to facilitate understanding of the different definitions and possible levels of cross-sectoral engagement. Examples of cross-sector policy and practice are presented and discussed. Key factors facilitation cross-sector policy and practice are also identified. The greatest levels of cross-sectoral engagement were found at project-level in Nepal, although the DFID offices had also made some significant efforts to improve cross-sectoral approaches. Poor knowledge and selective use of the reproductive health and women's education research, however, exposed a gap between research and policy. In addition, the reality of cross-sector policy and practice often did not match the rhetoric within DFID's documents. According to respondents, DFID faces some substantial challenges that contribute to these research-to-policy and policy-to-implementation gaps. Despite the increased calls for cross-sectorality, {{there is little evidence}} of the benefits of cross-sector policy and practice, suggesting the need for research clarifying the added value of cross-sectoral approaches. Finally, the lack of agreement over cross-sector definitions, the lack of operational guidance and DFID's strong emphasis on outcomes all suggest the need for a reorientation of focus towards cross-sectoral processes. Based on these findings and conclusions, recommendations are made for DFID and other organisations wishing to pursue cross-sectoral approaches.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in the numbers of students undertaking doctoral study over the last 20 - 30 years. This means that the PhD is no longer solely an elite degree designed to prepare graduates for an academic career. Instead, emphasis has increasingly been placed on the role of the PhD in producing 'advanced knowledge workers' who are expected to make a contribution to the production of knowledge in a knowledge-driven economy. This has led to an increased focus on the educational dimension of the PhD and the educational processes involved in developing students to become researchers in a range of contexts. However, the educational processes involved in the PhD are complex and differ across higher education systems, institutions and disciplines. They include formal and informal activities and involve a large number of actors with different expectations about the aims and outcomes. This study aims to gain an in-depth understanding of the educational processes of the PhD by exploring the complexity underlying these processes. The research was based on case studies in six departments. The case studies focused on the PhD processes of the six departments from three disciplines in four higher education institutions in England. Interviews with PhD Programme Directors, supervisors and students were complemented by analysis of institutional and <b>departmental</b> <b>documents.</b> The research was guided by a multi-level framework to examine the institutional, departmental, interpersonal and individual levels, and the inter-relatedness between levels. As such rich narratives provide insight into factors such as the PhD thesis and its influence on the supervisory relationship, formal initiatives such as assessment and coursework, and the Skills Training Programme and its underlying notion of employability. Three forms of complexity were identified. The first relates to the fact that the educational processes are individualistic in nature, and there is a need to understand the influences of the personal, social, educational and professional domains of the individual students and supervisors independently and collectively in shaping these complex processes. The second underlines the tensions and potential contradictions within and between actors as a result of the interpretation and implementation of these processes across the four levels. The third concerns a tension between the need for these processes to remain individualistic and the pressure for departments and institutions to provide standardised processes for all students. By identifying and gaining a greater understanding of these complexities, this research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the educational processes of the PhD based on grounded empirical evidence. This understanding is important in developments for enhancing the quality of PhD education, and in developing programmes which support students to become researchers in a range of different employment contexts. </p...|$|R
40|$|Occupational therapy (OT) {{pre-registration}} {{education in}} the United Kingdom (UK) stands {{at the intersection of}} the fields of higher education (HE) and professional practice. It is subject to various government agendas including an ongoing commitment to widening participation in HE and to diversifying the health and social care workforce to reflect modern cultural diversity. Both have contributed to a changing profile in the OT student population and in 2005, 67 percent of the intake was mature (College of Occupational Therapists, 2007 b), and increasing numbers are entering with ‘non-traditional’ academic backgrounds, an umbrella term which subsumes a variety of entry qualifications. The early weeks of study in HE can prove challenging to students as they settle into the new learning environment and begin to comprehend the expectations held of them (Yorke, 2005). It has been suggested that those from non-traditional academic backgrounds may find this transition, particularly the need to take a high level of responsibility for their own learning, difficult {{as a result of the}} skills, experiences and expectations accumulated throughout their pre-entry education (Sambell and Hubbard, 2004). While small-scale studies suggest that OT students from such backgrounds are as academically successful as traditional school-leavers at graduation (Howard and Jerosch-Herold, 2000), there is little evidence offering insight into how they actually experience and negotiate the demands of their programme. Recognising that learning and teaching are embedded within the milieu in which they occur, this longitudinal research adopted a case study methodology to capture complexity and understand the issue within its natural context (Yin, 2003). In an instrumental single-case design (Stake, 1995), a neither unique nor extreme undergraduate OT programme became a vehicle for exploring the educational experiences of students with non-traditional academic backgrounds. Thirteen volunteer participants were drawn from a single cohort in one of the UK’s research intensive universities. Data were collected via initial focus groups exploring pre-entry educational experiences and expectations of studying in HE, reflective diaries recording educational experiences that participants considered significant or meaningful, and one-to-one semi-structured interviews conducted towards the end of participants’ first and third years of study which focused on exploring their learning experiences. Supplementary and contextual data were provided by analysis of institutional, school and <b>departmental</b> <b>documents</b> to provide insight into the culture and practices of the learning context and a progression routes study which considered the entry qualifications, progression and exit awards of four cohorts of OT students from a range of educational backgrounds. The nature of students’ entry qualifications or academic background were found to have no statistically significant impact on whether they passed at Level 4, 5 or 6, or achieved a ‘good’ (upper second or first class) honours degree, although male students and those from amongst the lower socio-economic groups had significantly poorer academic outcomes at all levels of analysis. Theoretical thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) of qualitative data underpinned by Bourdieu’s (1990 b) theory of practice highlighted that students’ educational experiences were much less influenced by the nature of their academic backgrounds than by the congruence of individual dispositions or habitus, born out of social provenance, with the dominant culture of the particular field of HE they had entered. Emerging codes converged to represent themes suggesting clusters of shared experience amongst some participants, while examination of each individual dataset revealed varying positional tendencies and trajectories within the field. This research highlights the important roles played by academic, linguistic, social and practice-oriented capital in the way that students developed a feel for and learned to play ‘the game’ and present knowledge and understanding in the form ‘legitimated’ by the field. Juxtaposing the nature and expectations of the new field in relation to those previously occupied by individual participants and the established habitus each brought with them helped to illuminate the situation and adds a new dimension to understanding individual experiences of learning in HE...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 05 Online {{learning}} {{has brought about}} changes to nearly every sphere of the university from {{the definition of the}} student, to the curriculum, to the way we know and understand teaching and learning, to policies that govern our institutions. Because online learning is such a departure from the traditional 4 -year university experience and from traditional ways of teaching and learning, it has continually struggled {{to be seen as a}} legitimate way to approach educating students. This is evidenced by how college and university leaders have approached the policies and practices that have surrounded online learning. As online, hybrid, and web-enhanced instruction become more pervasive in higher education, college and university administrators are challenged with the task of strategically creating online courses and programs. This qualitative case study attempted to close that gap by using a sociocultural methodology to examine how institutional leaders of a newly formed online program negotiate both main and branch campus policies and more specifically, by studying the consequences this negotiation had for online program development.

40|$|Dissertation (Master of Education(Education)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008 The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} how teachers dealt with learners’ social problems. Another concern of the study was to investigate the extent to which pre-service and in-service teacher-training prepared teachers to deal with learners’ social problems. The research used qualitative methodology. The major advantage of using qualitative research was that it focused on researching teachers in their school setting, to determine how teachers dealt with learners’ social problems. The main instrument used was interviews as it yielded rich in-depth knowledge and allowed me to probe responses and investigate the teachers’ feelings and emotions. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the respondents. The study population was confined to four public high schools in Cape Town. It was composed of three newly qualified teachers and one experienced teacher. The results reflected that teachers dealt with learners’ social problems by trial and error and there was no evidence of deliberate planning in identifying learners with social problems. The preservice teacher training programmes did not equip teachers with the skills to deal with learners’ social problems. Although teachers received some form of training at schools, the training was not effective in assisting them. The thesis argues that social problems cannot be dealt with solely by the school or the teacher. It is recommended that the Department of Education, the community and the parents, as well as other social service organisations, should jointly create preventive and intervention strategies to assist learners with social problems. Such a holistic approach, the study asserts, could assist schools and teachers to deal with learners’ social problems more effectively. Teachers should receive pre-service training to deal with learners’ social problems, for example, by adding a module such as Sociology of Education. The teachertraining programmes and continuous in-service training programmes should ensure that teachers are exposed to current <b>Departmental</b> policies and <b>documents</b> that can assist them in dealing with learners’ social problems...|$|R

Instead it attempted to secure the country's rank in the international community by directing its imperial aspirations towards strengthening Britain's position in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. In the Potsdam Conference of 1945 a Council of Foreign Ministers was established to prepare the necessary post-war peace treaties. Britain along with the US, the USSR and France were responsible for the Italian peace treaty which included settling the fate of the former Italian colony of Libya. Libya consisted of three separate regions: Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan. From early on, Britain had its eyes set on acquiring a UN trusteeship of Cyrenaica where it had been the occupying power since 1943. The trusteeship would make Britain the formal administrative power there, and thus support its great-power ambitions in the Middle East. The Labour Cabinet decided to pursue this trusteeship but was met with more obstacles than it had expected. In the end, Britain was unable to obtain the trusteeship. This research study focuses on analysing what the Labour Cabinet's pursuit for a British trusteeship of Cyrenaica reveals about Britain's status as a great power during the immediate post-war years from 1945 to 1949. The issue is explored through three main themes: Cyrenaica's strategic meaning for Britain, Britain's relations with the US and the USSR, and Britain's imperialistic nature. The final assessment of Britain's great-power position is based on the four requirements for a great power set in this research study, and on evaluating what the failure to acquire the trusteeship meant for Britain's status. The aim of this research study is to offer a new perspective on Britain's post-war great-power position by examining it through this particular case of Britain trying to obtain the trusteeship of Cyrenaica, and to demonstrate that Cyrenaica deserves more attention in the research of British history. The main primary sources for this research study are selected Cabinet conclusions, Cabinet memoranda and the Cabinet Secretary's notes from July 1945 when Labour took Office, to November 1949 when the UN decided that Libya would become an independent state. The Cabinet papers were screened by using a wide keyword search on the online database of the National Archives. The keyword search was essential for finding the relevant documents for this research study from the vast amount of material. The focus in studying the material was on Libya, the Council of Foreign Ministers and its parties, British Middle Eastern policy especially in Egypt, British imperialism, and the most significant Cabinet members in this case: Prime Minister Clement Attlee and Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin. The two represented opposing views on whether a trusteeship of Cyrenaica would be beneficial for Britain. Attlee remained unenthusiastic but Bevin was determined to obtain the trusteeship. The Cabinet papers provide an overall picture of the main events, discussions and decisions, spiced with occasional intriguing details found in the Secretary's notes. The problem with the Cabinet papers as source material is that even if differing opinions are expressed in the memoranda, the conclusions are designed to portray unity, and can therefore be very vague. To be able to make good use of the Cabinet papers requires extensive knowledge of their historical context, as well as support from such research that has been able to access more detailed <b>departmental</b> <b>documents,</b> such as papers from the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff. The findings of this research study support the generally accepted view that Britain was no longer a considerable great power after the Second World War. In the case of trying to acquire a British trusteeship of Cyrenaica, Britain fails to meet three out of the four set requirements for a great power: its military resources were underwhelming, it was not equal to the undeniable great powers - the US and the USSR - in either military capacity or prestige, and it was not acknowledged as a great power by the international community. The one requirement that Britain does meet is that it kept on acting as if it still was a great power, and conducted its policies accordingly. The stubborn belief expressed especially by Bevin that Britain could and would obtain the trusteeship it so greatly desired by relying on its old imperial great-power strategies is evidence of this. This research study continues to argue, that not only does the case of the Cyrenaican trusteeship reveal Britain's lost great-power status, it does it better than the major imperial events of that time which are usually at the forefront of studies regarding this topic. The situation in both India and Palestine was such {{that it would have been}} impossible for any great power to keep them under control. Withdrawing help from Greece and Turkey for the US to take over, can be seen as a strategic move to cut overseas expenditure while making sure that the US was tied up in world affairs and thus unable to pull back into isolationism, which would have left Britain to face the USSR alone in Europe. Cyrenaica, on the other hand, was an underdeveloped area that mostly consisted of inhospitable desert. Its only value was its location by the Mediterranean and on the western border of Egypt - and it had paramount strategic value only to Britain. This issue has been deemed so insignificant that it is tragically underrepresented in research of history and barely mentioned in the history books - and no wonder since much bigger events were taking place at the same time as the Cold War realities began to set in. However, by failing to acquire the trusteeship of this small and next to unknown territory where it was already the occupying power, Britain truly fell flat on its face. It had been a dominant power in the Middle East for a long time and was one of the victorious Three Powers in Potsdam - this rather humble objective was something it should have easily accomplished. Yet it did not. Failing in small world affairs rather than in the major ones speaks volumes of a country's great-power status - or the lack of it...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of teachers' historical perspectives, their beliefs about instructional methods, {{and the impact of}} the contextual factors in shaping the enacted curriculum and the instructional methods utilized by three middle school teachers in teaching about the Civil War era. Data gathered included interviews with teacher-participants, administrators, non-participant teachers, field notes from classroom and school-wide observations, and curricular, <b>departmental,</b> and faculty <b>documents.</b> These data were analyzed to understand the factors that influenced teacher decision-making regarding their representations of actors and events in the antebellum period, the Civil War, and Reconstruction and their choice of instructional methods. Analysis of the enacted curriculum indicated significant differences in the three teachers' representations of the antebellum period, the Civil War, and Reconstruction {{as a result of their}} varied perspectives on these historical events. However, the importance of slavery as one cause of the Civil War was evident in all three teachers' accounts of the Civil War. Analysis of the teachers' decisions regarding instructional methods indicated that all three teachers viewed direct instruction as the most appropriate method for teaching history to their students, although this was also informed by the need to conform to the district's pacing guide for 8 th grade history and to convey historical content to their students as efficiently as possible. In this way the pacing guide, a subtle yet important influence on all three teachers' practice, demonstrated the significance of high stakes accountability as a context that shaped teachers' curricular and instructional decisions. Main findings include the significance of all three teachers' presentation of the complex nature of Reconstruction as the extension and then denial of rights to African Americans, which served to reinforce the idea that the Civil War was tragic and provided a context to better understand the Civil Rights Movement of the mid twentieth century. Additionally, all three teachers' use of direct instruction resulted in presenting history as factual and inevitable. The absence of contingency, the notion that historical events could have had alternative outcomes, represented the history of the Civil War era as part of a preordained narrative of progress...|$|R
