500|$|The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate {{breakfast and}} began {{preparations}} for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk. After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the [...] "porch" [...] of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag full of trash to dispose of on the surface. Young then lowered the <b>equipment</b> <b>transfer</b> bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human {{to walk on the}} Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: [...] "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image. I'm sure glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs." [...] Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon, at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: [...] "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!" [...] The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph (UVC), and other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the flag of the United States with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had burned up with the Lunar Module Aquarius on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a [...] crater on the rim of Flag crater, about [...] across. There, at a distance of [...] from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper regolith layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was there that Duke retrieved, at the request of Mission Control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a breccia nicknamed Big Muley after mission geology principal investigator William R. Muehlberger. The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about [...] from the LM. There, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a magnetic field experiment. At that point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a 16 mm movie camera. After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, they returned to the LM to close out the moonwalk. They reentered the LM 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in Mission Control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.|$|E

On 15 March, Kormoran met [...] to transfer torpedoes, provisions, and spare parts, but rough seas forced the two vessels to head south, where they met the German cruiser Admiral Scheer a day later. The raider's broken radar and a sailor with an eye injury were transferred to Scheer, but attempts to replenish the U-boat were again interrupted by bad weather, forcing the two vessels to relocate again. The <b>equipment</b> <b>transfer</b> and refueling took another three days, during which crewmen from U-124 enjoyed the relatively luxurious facilities aboard Kormoran, and a sick sailor from the submarine was traded for a healthy man from the raider.|$|E

50|$|Making Tracks is the {{cooperative}} program between the NWTF and state, federal and provincial wildlife agencies to restore wild turkeys to all suitable habitat in North America. The NWTF works with wildlife agencies coordinating the trap and transfer of wild turkeys. Wild turkey populations {{have more than}} doubled since 1990. In areas where they are abundant, wild turkeys are trapped via nets propelled or dropped over a feeding flock. Trapped birds are individually placed in specialized transport boxes, and then released in areas of suitable habitat with few or no wild turkeys. The NWTF routinely provides trapping <b>equipment,</b> <b>transfer</b> boxes and helps coordinate wild turkey transfers between states, provinces and nations. Since the 1950s, state and provincial wildlife agencies have moved more than 192,000 wild turkeys into suitable habitat across North America. The NWTF, founded in 1973, helped accelerate those efforts by providing trapping <b>equipment,</b> <b>transfer</b> boxes, funding and volunteers. Currently, there are more than 7 million wild turkeys throughout North America.|$|E

Projects involving two- to five-year-old technologies seem more likely to involve technology transfer than both younger and older technologies.

This may be achieved by including more stringent requirements with regard to international technology transfer in countries' CDM project approval processes. Based on our findings, such policies should focus particularly on energy supply and efficiency technologies. Likewise, it may be beneficial for host countries to condition project approval on the novelty and complexity of technologies and adjust these provisions over time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network dimensioning {{that deals with}} both {{the determination of the}} transmission facilities to be put in operation between routing sites and the determination of routing equipment that must be installed in each routing site. The dimensioning procedure aims to find the least cost physical network. The proposed approach considers two types of costs: O&M (operation and maintenance) costs and upgrade costs. The lifetime of an operator’s network is seen as being composed by consecutive cycles, where the network must be dimensioned for the traffic forecast of the next cycle. In each dimensioning step, the operator has two objectives. First, it wants to minimise the O&M cost of the required network and second, it wants to minimise the cost of the required node equipment upgrade. This approach results in two steps, each one given by an optimisation problem. The first problem determines the transmission facilities required between network nodes. The second problem determines the routing equipment that must be installed in each node. In the second step problem, upgrade costs include the acquisition costs of buying new <b>equipment,</b> <b>transfer</b> costs of moving existing equipment from one node to another, and storage costs when equipment that is in operation in the present cycle is not used in the next cycle. ...|$|E
