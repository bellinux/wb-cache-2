This curse of dimensionality results in a lager number of fuzzy rules which reduces the transparency of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore too many rules also reduce the generalization capability of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems.</b> Hierarchical <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> have emerged as an effective alternative to overcome this curse of dimensionality and have attracted much attention. However, research on learning methods for hierarchical <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> and applications is rare. In this paper, we propose a scheme to construct general hierarchical <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> based on the gradient-descent method. To show {{the advantages of the}} proposed method (in terms of accuracy, transparency, generalization capability and fewer rules), this method is applied to a function approximation problem and the result is compared with those obtained by standard (flat) <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Computing {{the output}} of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> usually passes through three stages i. e. fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification.

This permits computation offline, which in effect reduces the real-time computation time and therefore permits the use of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> in real-time applications.

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} few decades, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been widely used}} in several {{application}} fields, thanks to their ability to model complex systems. The design of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> has been successfully performed by applying evolutionary and, in particular, genetic algorithms, and recently, this approach has been extended by using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, which can consider multiple conflicting objectives, instead of a single one. The hybridization between multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> is currently known as multiobjective evolutionary <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper presents an overview of multiobjective evolutionary <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems,</b> describing the main contributions on this field and providing a two-level taxonomy of the existing proposals, in order to outline a well-established framework that could help researchers who work on significant further developments.

50|$|Traditional {{finite element}} method is a {{well-established}} method to solve various problems of science and engineering. Different authors have used various methods to solve governing differential equation of heat conduction problem. In this study, heat conduction in a circular rod has been considered which {{is made up of}} two different materials viz. aluminum and copper. In earlier studies parameters in the differential equation have been taken as fixed numbers which actually may not. Those parameters are found in general by some measurements or experiments. So the material properties are actually uncertain and may be considered to vary in an interval or as fuzzy and in that case complex interval arithmetic or fuzzy arithmetic has to be considered in the analysis.Hence interval/fuzzy arithmetic is applied in the {{finite element method}} to solve a steady state heat conduction problem. Application of fuzzy finite element method in the said problem gives <b>fuzzy</b> <b>system</b> of linear equations in general.

The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems,</b> implemented using different rule bases, fuzzy values, membership functions, fuzzyfication and defuzzification methods, may be classified based on these fuzzy methods used in their development. This paper proposes a unitary theory for describing Mamdani fuzzy controllers based on their characteristics. Fuzzy rules bases {{may be seen as}} fuzzy applications between fuzzy sets. These rule bases have algebraic properties as: commutative law, neutral element and symmetric elements. The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> may be analytical described with MISO, SISO and gain transfer characteristics, which may be calculated using computer programs. The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> have algebraic properties as: commutative law and symmetric elements. These algebraic properties may be noticed on their transfer characteristics. The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> have a variable gain with their inputs. Some gain characteristics values are presented. The rule bases and the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> have the sector property. The paper emphasizes, based on the transfer characteristics, planar and spatial sector properties useful in stability analysis with Lyapunov techniques. The transfer characteristics, system linear characteristic around the origin and the gain in origin are usefull in the design of fuzzy PID controllers.

Vir-tually all the TS <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> use linear rule consequent. At present, there exist no results (qualitative or quantitative) {{to answer the}} fundamentally important question that is especially critical to TS <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> as <b>fuzzy</b> controllers and models, “Are TS <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> with linear rule consequent universal approximators? ” If the answer is yes, then {{how can they be}} constructed to achieve prespecified approximation accuracy and what are the sufficient conditions on systems configuration? In this paper, we provide answers to these questions for a general class of single-input single-output (SISO) <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> that use any type of continuous input fuzzy sets, TS fuzzy rules with linear consequent and a generalized defuzzifier containing the widely used centroid defuzzifier as a special case. We first constructively prove that this general class of SISO TS <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> can uniformly approximate any polynomial arbitrarily well and then prove, by utilizing the Weierstrass approximation theorem, that the general TS <b>fuzzy</b> <b>systems</b> can uniformly approximate any continuous function with arbitrarily high precision. Furthermore, we have derived a formula as part of sufficient conditions for the fuzzy approximation that can compute the minimal upper bound on the number of input fuzzy sets and rules needed for any given continuous function and prespecified approximation error bound.
