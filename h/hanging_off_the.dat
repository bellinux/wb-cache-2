5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method of <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} regimental quartermaster, Grant yearned for a combat role; when finally allowed, {{he led a}} cavalry charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, demonstrating his equestrian ability at Monterrey by {{carrying}} a dispatch past snipers while <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> side of his horse, keeping the animal {{between him and the}} enemy. Before leaving the city he stopped at a house occupied by wounded Americans, giving them assurance he would send for help. Polk, wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his forces, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General Winfield Scott. Traveling by sea, Scott's army landed at Veracruz and advanced toward Mexico City. The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City. For his bravery at Molino del Rey, Grant was brevetted first lieutenant. At San Cosmé, men under Grant's direction dragged a disassembled howitzer into a church steeple, reassembled it, and bombarded nearby Mexican troops. His bravery and initiative earned him his second brevet promotion to captain. On September 14, 1847, Scott's army marched into the city; Mexico ceded the vast territory, including California, to the U.S. on February 2, 1848.|$|E

25|$|Production of {{agricultural}} machinery and implements had occurred since the 1930s, {{such as the}} 1933 number 22e Fordson farm tractor, and such offerings were maintained post-war. One interesting model was the odd Opperman 3-wheeled Motocart, a tilting flat-bed vehicle with engine <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> side of its large front wheel (Rixon 2005, pp.122–123).|$|R

25|$|On {{the shrine}} grounds, {{there are several}} {{important}} religious structures. The shrine's haiden, Yasukuni's main prayer hall where worshipers come to pray, was originally built in 1901 in styles of Irimoya-zukuri, Hirairi, and Doubanbuki (copper roofing) {{in order to allow}} patrons to pay their respects and make offerings. This building's roof was renovated in 1989. The white screens <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ceiling are changed to purple ones on ceremonial occasions.|$|E

Below the wing there’s more carbon fiber used in the new rear diffuser, {{taillight}} panel, and rocker panels with side-skirt aero blades {{just in front of}} the rear wheels. The composite is also in place for the mirror covers. Finally, there’s the requisite Super Snake racing stripes and external badging.|$|E
25|$|Bumper boats: This {{ride was}} {{supposedly}} safer, but the engines often leaked gasoline, {{at least once}} requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much on his skin. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, consequently resulting in them <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> sides of the boats and being fractured during collisions.|$|R

Their metamorphosis is complete within a few weeks, peaking in July-August. The toadlets attain a length of 12-15 mm. The eggs, laid in August, metamorphose only after the winter, with the toadlets attaining a length of 3-5 cm. These toadlets still have white bellies.|$|R
25|$|Plantar flexion: One of {{the most}} popular lower leg muscle {{stretches}} is the step standing heel raises, which mainly involves the gastrocnemius, soleus, and the Achilles tendon. Standing heel raises allow the individual to activate their calf muscles by standing on a step with toes and forefoot, leaving the heel <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> step, and plantar flexing the ankle joint by raising the heel. This exercise is easily modified by holding on to a nearby rail for balance and is generally repeated 5-10 times.|$|E
25|$|Alpha-carbon (α-carbon) {{is also a}} {{term that}} applies to {{proteins}} and amino acids. It is the backbone carbon before the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, reading along the backbone of a typical protein would give a sequence of –n– etc. (when reading in the N to C direction). The α-carbon is where the different substituents attach to each different amino acid. That is, the groups <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> chain at the α-carbon are what give amino acids their diversity. These groups give the α-carbon its stereogenic properties for every amino acid except for glycine. Therefore, the α-carbon is a stereocenter for every amino acid except glycine. Glycine also {{does not have a}} β-carbon, while every other amino acid does.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{starship}} flying towards an island after being summoned by its local tribesmen. The island locals slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The starship then beams a pink bikini-clad electric green-haired Minaj down onto the beach and she begins to sing. She is presumably being worshipped as a goddess as she is carried away through the jungle by the island locals wearing a pale pink bikini with strands <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bottom and short green hair, which is also worn during some kaleidoscope effects and in one scene of her on the beach singing. Minaj is then seen dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black bodysuit behind a glass box {{while some of the}} male islanders run up to her. The scene then shifts towards the volcano top at nighttime where Minaj is sitting on top of the box with some of the locals dancing around her. In the final scene, a blonde-haired Minaj, wearing a white fringed strapless bikini splattered with paint, is partying with the islanders. Intercut scenes show Minaj singing with kaleidoscope effects on her in the second outfit and some more kaleidoscope effects in the same outfit but under blacklights. It ends with her singing the last line while looking directly into the camera.|$|E
5000|$|Allena Hansen was mauled by a bear in Bakersfield {{and drove}} herself {{to seek help}} and was then airlifted to Ronald Reagan UCLA Hospital. Lee {{performed}} major surgical repair to Hansen's oral and facial wounds, which were described as <b>the</b> forehead <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> side with a visible indentation of the bear's claw in the bone. [...] Lee came to national media attention again when she operated on Victor Benavidez, a construction worker who sustained a nail gun injury in which a 3.25 inch nail penetrated {{the roof of his}} mouth {{to the back of his}} eye socket. Lee skillfully performed the delicate operation, leaving the patient without any complications.|$|R
5000|$|... “In {{contrast}} to the old-style Goth look, which was androgynous, the male 'Industrial look' was tough and military, with a sci-fi edge. The men wore … band T-shirts, black trousers or military cargo pants in black, military accessories, such as dog-tags, heavy boots … 'Industrial' women, who were fewer in number, tended to wear waist-cinching corsets, small tank tops or 'wife-beaters' t-shirts, trousers, and sometimes suspenders <b>hanging</b> down <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pants. They also … sometimes shaved their heads.”- Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of MFIT, New York.|$|R

500|$|Within {{a year of}} its completion, the House of Keys {{was heavily}} criticised {{in a letter to}} the Rising Sun newspaper. The {{external}} appearance of the building was described as bland and [...] "more like that of a small country villa, or village jail, than a Senate House." [...] The interior was similarly lambasted, with particular attention being paid to the small space provided for the Speaker's chair. During the Keys' time in the building, they underwent one of their most significant changes. Until 1866, the Keys were a self-elected body, but following pressure from the public, most notably Isle of Man Times editor James Brown, the House agreed to be elected by popular vote. During the 1860s, Douglas became more prominent; the Lieutenant Governor moved his residence there in 1861, the Law Courts moved the following year, and by 1869 Douglas had replaced Castletown as the capital of the island. The House of Keys building in Castletown was described as too small, and [...] "dilapidated with the wallpaper <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> wall." [...] In 1874, the House of Keys moved to the Court House in Douglas, and five years later, into their current home, the Old Bank of Mona building also in Douglas.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{in front of}} a live {{audience}} at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on August 10, 2012. SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora's widget designer and 5 Pandora's Dual Box servers. The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure. Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an engineering standpoint, it is [...] "extremely complex". It was custom-designed to mold {{to the inside of the}} General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection. Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 lumens, creating one continuous giant image. The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people. The whole structure, which was <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, [...] "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly." [...] Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: [...] "What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space, making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place." [...] Russ Rive, SuperUber’s director said, [...] "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place." ...|$|E

5000|$|Waterloo Road {{returned}} with Karen introducing a separate sex classes policy, {{which was very}} unpopular with the new Head of Pastoral Care, Adanna Lawal (Sharlene Whyte). Episode 12 saw Janeece become involved with a pupil Billie Taylor, who claimed her mother was trying to steal her baby, which introduces the second mental health storyline in series 6. The main story during the spring term was the relationship which developed between Cesca and Jonah. This was revealed in episode 19 and Cesca was arrested. In episode 20 she was released on bail, so she and Jonah drove to Gretna Green to get married; she was arrested after the ceremony. Adanna meanwhile tried to unite the sexes with the school production [...] "Cinderfeller" [...] which didn't go according to plan. Kyle and Denzil escape having destroyed the production, and in attempt to impress Kyle, Denzil climbs a railway bridge only to become stuck, <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> bridge in serious danger.
