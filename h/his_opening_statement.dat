5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecutors}} at Collins' trial, William Delhey and Booker Williams, {{opted to}} charge Collins {{only with the}} murder of Karen Sue Beineman, with the state contending that she had been murdered by Collins {{in the basement of the}} Leik household. In <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> to the jury on July 20, Delhey outlined the prosecution's contention that the evidence to be presented would form a clear pattern indicating that Collins had been in the company of Karen Sue Beineman at the time she was last seen alive by Mrs. Joan Goshe and her assistant; that he had taken her to the home of his own uncle, where he had tortured and beaten the girl before strangling her to death at this location; and that he had then discarded her body, before attempting to persuade his roommate to provide him with a false alibi. The two primary questions before the jury, Delhey stated, would be the accuracy of eyewitnesses who would be called to testify and, ultimately, whether the more than 500 hair samples found upon Beineman's panties matched the hair clippings later recovered from the basement of Collins' uncle. Delhey also stated the prosecution's intent to prove that Collins had had sole access to his uncle's home and basement on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance, and although he had made concerted efforts to remove physical evidence from the crime scene, blood samples recovered from this location were a match for the blood type of the victim. Delhey formally closed <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> to the jury by requesting they return a verdict of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.|$|E

50|$|A Saugus {{police officer}} found an empty 38 caliber {{cartridge}} {{in the ground}} below a small barn window. This along with Pinkham's findings led investigators to believe that Bailey was shot as he was seated in his democrat wagon as he drew rein {{in front of the}} barn door. Later, police discovered Bailey's overcoat hanging on a nail in his bedroom, which led them to change their theory to Bailey being shot as he was seated in his kitchen or sitting room. Young told police that after his day's work, Bailey would rest with his elbows on his knees and his head slumped way over due to his height. This would explain the trajectory of the bullets. However, by the time the case went to trial, the theory had changed again. During <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> <b>statements</b> District Attorney W.

Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams.

40|$|On 10 September 2013 the International Criminal Court (ICC) began {{hearing a}} case against William Ruto, Deputy President of the Republic of Kenya, and Joshua Sang.

Both cases are noteworthy since {{they are the first}} against sitting politicians. Unsurprisingly, they have not been without controversy.  These trials are challenging for the Court, not least because the Kenyan government recently passed a resolution withdrawing from the ICC and repealing its domestic legislation criminalizing international crimes, arguing that Kenya needed to restore it sovereignty and resist neo-colonialism. Although this withdrawal does not affect the current cases before the Court, it certainly makes cooperation with Kenya for the purpose of further investigations more difficult.  Karim A. A. Khan, QC, formerly the defense counsel of Muthaura and currently the lead defense counsel of Ruto, raised these issues in an interview taking place one week before <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> <b>statements</b> in the Kenya I case.

This put Bradley in a dilemma. If he refused to acknowledge blacks' influence on the party, he would lose their votes; if he acknowledged it, he would lose many white voters. Bradley attempted to ignore the racial question in Hopkinsville and during the next two debates, instead intensifying his criticism of Hardin on the money question and his association with Tate. In the sixth joint debate, held August 30 at Eminence, some members of the audience began to heckle Bradley, who was hoarse from previous debates. After attempting to restart <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> four times, Bradley left the platform, and the next day announced he would not participate in any further joint debates {{as a result of the}} incident. Many believed Bradley was looking for a reason to end the debates in order to dodge the racial question, and the incident at Eminence gave him the opportunity. Some black Republicans resented Bradley's attempt to dodge the racial question and encouraged fellow blacks not to support Bradley but vote for Populist Thomas S. Pettit instead.|$|E
