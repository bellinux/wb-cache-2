2500|$|One thing James {{did have}} in common with Kierkegaard was respect for the single individual, and their {{respective}} comments may be compared in direct sequence as follows: [...] "A crowd is indeed made up of single individuals; it must therefore be in everyone's power to become what he is, a single individual; no one <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a single individual, no one, unless he prevents himself by becoming many. To become a crowd, to gather a crowd around oneself, is on the contrary to distinguish life from life; even the most well-meaning one who talks about that, can easily offend a single individual." [...] In his book A Pluralistic Universe, James stated that, [...] "Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general label. As these heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life of philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing, and complaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up for which both Oxford and Harvard are partly to be thanked." ...|$|E
60|$|Under {{the general}} {{principle}} that the local slope of a river is the result and measure of the resistance of its bed, {{it is evident that}} a narrow and deep stream should have less slope, because it has less frictional surface in proportion to capacity; i.e., less perimeter in proportion to area of cross section. The ultimate effect of levees and revetments confining the floods and bringing all the stages of the river into register is to deepen the channel and let down the slope. The first effect of the levees is to raise the surface; but this, by inducing greater velocity of flow, inevitably causes an enlargement of section, and if this enlargement <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> made {{at the expense of the}} banks, the bottom must give way and the form of the waterway be so improved as to admit this flow with less rise. The actual experience with levees upon the Mississippi River, with no attempt to hold the banks, has been favorable, and no one can doubt, upon the evidence furnished in the reports of the commission, that if the earliest levees had been accompanied by revetment of banks, and made complete, we should have to-day a river navigable at low water, and an adjacent country safe from inundation.|$|E
50|$|Immobilization in {{soil science}} is the {{conversion}} of inorganic compounds to organic compounds by micro-organisms or plants, by which it <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> accessible to plants. Immobilization {{is the opposite of}} mineralization.|$|E

50|$|Zhou's thrillers {{received}} commercial success. Due {{to government}} censorship {{several of his}} films <b>were</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> released. Very few people not in China knew about Zhou before the 1994 release of Ermo.|$|R
50|$|The show <b>was</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> {{produced}} on Broadway {{due to a}} copyright disagreement with the estate of Rudolph Besier, author of The Barretts of Wimpole Street, on which the story was partly based.|$|R
50|$|If the {{processor}} supports the NX-bit, Windows Vista automatically enforces hardware-based Data Execution Prevention on all processes to mark some memory pages as non-executable data segments (like the heap and stack), and subsequently any data <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> interpreted and executed as code. This prevents exploit code from being injected as data and then executed.|$|E
50|$|For example, when {{a message}} is {{received}} by an e-mail server with a hash filter, {{the contents of}} the e-mail is converted into a hash sum. If this sum corresponds to the hash sum of another e-mail which has been categorized as spam, the received e-mail <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> delivered. Spammers attempt to evade this by adding random strings to the text content and random pixel changes ("confetti") to image content (see image spam).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cable tie {{consists}} of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated gear rack, and on one end a ratchet within a small open case. Once the pointed tip of the cable tie has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> pulled back; the resulting loop may only be pulled tighter. This allows several cables to be bound together into a cable bundle and/or to form a cable tree.|$|E

50|$|Press-in studs are {{installed}} {{from the back}} side of the disk or drum hub and may require removal of the hub from the vehicle for installation or removal. They consist of a threaded portion and a larger diameter section, called the knurl, that is splined to prevent rotation. The diameter of the knurl is larger than the hole in the hub requiring a press fit to seat the stud. The stud <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> pulled through the hub by a larger diameter stop on the end.|$|E
5000|$|Anteriorly, the {{reflection}} of the synovial membrane lies on the femur; located at some distance from the cartilage {{because of the presence of}} the suprapatellar bursa. Above, {{the reflection}} appears lifted from the bone by underlying periosteal connective tissue. [...] In a standing posture, the suprapatellar bursa is seemingly redundant. It is however also referred to as the suprapatellar synovial recess as it gradually unfolds as the knee is flexed; to open up completely when the knee is flexed 130 degrees. [...] The suprapatellar bursa <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> pinched during extension by the articularis genus muscle. [...] On the tibia, the anterior reflection and attachment of the synovial membrane is located near the cartilage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{articular}} capsule has a synovial and a fibrous membrane {{separated by}} fatty deposits. Anteriorly, the synovial membrane is attached {{on the margin}} of the cartilage both on the femur and the tibia, but on the femur, the suprapatellar bursa or recess extends the joint space proximally. [...] The suprapatellar bursa <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> pinched during extension by the articularis genus muscle. [...] Behind, the synovial membrane is attached to the margins of the two femoral condyles which produces two extensions similar to the anterior recess. Between these two extensions, the synovial membrane passes in front of the two cruciate ligaments {{at the center of the}} joint, thus forming a pocket direct inward.|$|E

5000|$|A bolt is an {{externally}} threaded fastener designed for insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally intended to be tightened or released by torquing a nut. A screw is an {{externally threaded}} fastener capable of being inserted into holes in assembled parts, of mating with a preformed internal thread or forming its own thread, and of being tightened or released by torquing the head. An {{externally threaded fastener}} which <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt. (Example: round head bolts, track bolts, plow bolts.) An externally threaded fastener that has thread form which prohibits assembly with a nut having a straight thread of multiple pitch length is a screw. (Example: wood screws, tapping screws.) ...|$|E
50|$|UV marker {{should not}} be used on {{surfaces}} that may already contain similar elements found in the UV marker ink, such as the high brightness copier papers. This is because the message will not be shown clearly as the surface will change colour or react along with the ink when under UV light. Therefore, we should always test on surface in an inconspicuous area to determine results.Similarly, when writing with a UV marker on very smooth and glossy surfaces, the ink will only show an unclear outline of what is written and may be rubbed off easily. This is because the ink <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> deeply absorbed into the surface like it would on a piece of normal paper. Moreover, messages can be easily visible when exposed under glancing light.|$|E
50|$|The Constitutional Court {{decision}} received heavy {{criticism from}} academic sectors and the Pheu Thai Party. Thammasat University public law lecturer Piyabutr Saengkanokkul commented that {{nothing in the}} royal decree was contrary to the constitution, as it did not fail {{to comply with the}} requirements of the constitution mentioned by the court. Chulalongkorn University constitutional law lecturer Kanin Boonsuwan questioned the logic of the decision, because the activity that the constitution required of the decree could not be completed due to hindrance from the anti-government protesters. Chulalongkorn University political science lecturer Pornson Liengboonlertchai added that a law is deemed unconstitutional when its contents are contrary to the constitution, not when it <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> implemented according to the constitution. Legal scholar Verapat Pariyawong noted that the court invalidated the election because it was not completed within one day, but the court refrained from considering why it could not be completed.|$|E

5000|$|A {{group of}} terrorists have stolen the World's Collisions satellite,CMF sends {{two of its}} agents,Howard Gibson,and Jean Clifford to investigate. They first {{infiltrate}} a museum, where they find out [...] "Agares" [...] is behind the plot of stealing the satellite. As soon as they grab the disc with the information,one of the Agares leaders prevent them from getting the disc. After they retrieve the disc, they are sent to a train traveling through the mountains. Irina Mikalova, Satellite programmer, has been kidnapped by Agares and forced to reprogram the satellite, Howard and Jean manage to rescue Irina but are stopped by the General, who is defeated by the two agents. With the help of Irina, CMF locates Agares Headquarters, where the satellite control is being transported to a submarine. Howard and Jean manage {{to make it through}} the base and find the Agares Leader, who plans to use the satellite to destroy the CMF Headquarters. After being defeated, the leader uses a self-destruct sequence to defeat the two agents and escaping with the satellite data. The two agents manage to use the satellite to destroy the submarine and the leader. The two agents escape, and CMF <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, line locks can be {{installed}} on the rear brake lines. When the line lock is activated, fluid pressure <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> transferred to the rear, allowing the rear wheels to spin freely while the front brakes can be controlled with the brake pedal. This allows one to creep at varying speeds while maintaining a burnout. Achieving such a burnout requires manipulation of both throttle and brake inputs. The burnout is initiated by manipulating the clutch with the left foot and both the brake and gas pedal with the right foot. The brakes must be held while revving up the engine, then the clutch is released while continuing to hold the brakes. Once the rear tires start spinning, the left foot is used to control the brakes while the right foot continues to control the throttle.The only advantage for such a setup {{is the ability to}} maintain a burnout at relatively low wheel low speeds, which reduces wear on the rear tires. This method can be used to increase tire temperature to provide better traction prior to a drag run, but it is also often used purely for show, such as in drifting exhibitions or simply for the personal enjoyment of the driver.Many modern sport-oriented cars now offer optional line locks for drag and show purposes, such as the so-called [...] "burnout mode" [...] found on the 2015 Ford Mustang.|$|E

30|$|However, {{temperatures}} at locations C 2 and C 3 of the preheated specimens {{are higher}} than those of non-preheated specimens. This is because heat <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> transferred from the fire toward the opposite surface due to moisture clog inside the walls when the specimens are not preheated. In other words, preheated walls have little or no moisture clog, which leads to a better heat transfer through the thickness of the walls.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the fluid dynamic forces of the U-bent tube with a circular section and avoid the occurrence of fluid-structure interaction problems, three-dimensional simulations of fluid flows around the tubes are carried out. In {{the case that the}} axis of the curved tube with the circular section <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> normal to the direction of the flows approaching the tube, the formation of the Karman vortex behind the tube is interrupted. As a result, the fluid dynamic forces acting on the curved tube can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{research}} on scheduling schemes <b>is</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> used in practice by the lack of implementations that provide the necessary abstractions. An example of this is the support of execution-time servers. Apart for a single mechanism (the sporadic server), which is defined in the POSIX standard, these important building blocks are not available to the system developer. Over the last few years, we have been developing the mechanisms necessary to construct execution-time servers from within an Ada context. Versions of these have now been incorporated in the Ada 2005 standard. In this paper, we show how the mechanisms can be used to construct the deferrable and sporadic server...|$|E
