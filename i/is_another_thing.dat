500|$|Chapter 27 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} films of the 2000s. In April 2006, an on-line petition group calling themselves Boycottchapter27.org campaigned to [...] "pressurise [...] movie theatres not to show the film, to stop the glorification of a murderer." [...] Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, expressed her thought saying, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> which will hurt me, I'm sure. I would rather not make a story out of Mr. Chapman at all, although I sympathize with the actors. They need to work. It's not just films, you're always talking about it [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In court, Martin {{argued that}} he was by nature not a violent person. [...] "I may have worked in the (prison) butchery, but cutting up a human body <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> When I saw the {{photographs}} (of Lowe's body parts), {{it made me feel}} sick." [...] He maintained that he had killed Lowe after the latter made homosexual advances that caused him to [...] "freak out"; he had previously fended off homosexual attacks twice while imprisoned: in Israel in 1978, and in England in 1994. When Deputy Public Prosecutors Jennifer Marie and Norul Rashid asked him what he did after killing Lowe, he said that he could not remember anything because he had drunk heavily and consumed Valium after Lowe's death until he was arrested. He repeated that he had not killed the Damudes, and that he had come back to Singapore from Phuket to clear his conscience about Lowe's death.|$|E
2500|$|Mashinini {{attended}} the 1955 Congress of the People in Kliptown, {{a major event}} for the African National Congress (ANC). She later wrote: [...] "I was not a card-carrying member, but at that meeting I was a member in body, spirit and soul... So I think that Congress was really an eye-opener for me. That, maybe, is when I started to be politicized. Although there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> which I have always felt, which is that I have always resented being dominated." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The {{language}} of course <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
60|$|For a {{few moments}} Stannard pondered. To baffle the young trooper had rather amused him, but to dispute with Bob <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now, this <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> altogether, and the captain's earnest {{acceptance}} {{would have}} been more coherent {{if it had not been}} for the impatience of his mare.|$|R
2500|$|The {{victory was}} not only seen as Cornell {{dominance}} in American college rowing, but the superiority of America and the American stroke over the English stroke. Newspapers across the nation proclaimed {{the superiority of the}} Courtney’s American stroke. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> in Cornell’s victory to rejoice over, and that is that hers was the distinctly American stroke. We feel sorry for Mr. Lehmann but must admit we did not look for his stroke to triumph." [...] The Minneapolis Tribune wrote that [...] "the splendid victory...was not more a tribute to the superior muscle and methods of the Ithacans than it was a rebuke to the all too prevalent practice of going abroad for our manners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deeply {{moved by}} {{encounters}} with Israeli and Arab soldiers, {{he left the}} country to write [...] "Lover Lover Lover". This song has been interpreted as a personal renunciation of armed conflict, and ends with the hope his song will serve a listener as [...] "a shield against the enemy". He would later remark, Lover, Lover, Lover' was born over there; the whole world has its eyes riveted on this tragic and complex conflict. Then again, I am faithful to certain ideas, inevitably. I hope that those of which I am in favour will gain." [...] Asked which side he supported in the Arab-Israeli conflict, Cohen responded, [...] "I don't want to speak of wars or sides … Personal process is one thing, it's blood, it's the identification one feels with their roots and their origins. The militarism I practice {{as a person and}} a writer <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing....</b> I don't wish to speak about war." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, De Casseres {{published}} his first book, {{a collection of}} poetry titled The Shadow-Eater, to mixed reviews. Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff called the volume [...] "a welcome tribute to individualism and defiance" [...] and the poems themselves [...] "metaphysical meteors, searching, cataclysmic and rich in satire." [...] A review in The New York Times favorably compared De Casseres to Walt Whitman, claiming [...] "if his alien, highly individual genius remains unrecognized, criticism will lie upon the public, not upon him." [...] Others, however, received it less favorably. Clement Wood, writing in the New York Call, mocked both De Casseres' book and Wagstaff's review, writing, [...] "It must be admitted that Mr. De Casseres often uses good rhythms; what they are about <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> They are mainly about Nothing, {{as far as we}} can gather." [...] By 1923, when the book was reissued by the American Library Service, a reviewer for Poetry wrote that De Casseres had lost [...] "the simple sincerity of utterance which is the birthright of the true prophet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Son {{of a great}} man? Ambassador, French!' The greatness seemed impressed, {{but whether}} {{ambassador}} <b>was</b> understood <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> though it <b>was</b> accepted as relating to the boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "The boyars did {{not like}} it very well to be obliged to build these ships," [...] {{continued}} Rollo. [...] "And there <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that they disliked still more." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was this}} that {{staggered}} Kirk. That Mrs. Bailey should indulge {{in this particular}} form of insanity was intelligible. But that Ruth should have descended to it <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> altogether.|$|R
60|$|ILL-FAV. And they said, We intend no hurt to your lives; it <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> {{we would}} have.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. I don't like it much." [...] (This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> they say, {{and then}} they wait for you to express incredulity.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to tell you, Roger," [...] {{put in the}} Widow Canby. [...] "Something I {{know you}} will be greatly pleased to hear." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{application}} of anaesthetics <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> fully explained by Gys, but {{this could not}} be demonstrated. Patsy, however, was taught {{the use of the}} hypodermic needle, which Maud and Beth quite understood.|$|R
60|$|She {{did know}} Kit was obstinate, but to allow Miss Brown {{to talk about}} it <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Besides, she <b>was</b> bothered about the other's object for stating Kit ought to go back.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. Come! If she's {{anything}} {{of a woman}} she'll see it for herself. She won't want to drag you down further. If there were a prospect of your being able to marry her--it might <b>be</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not worship her; I loved her, which <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> The priest Oros here worships thee, whom {{he calls}} Mother. I loved that immortal woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do, but it <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> {{to stand}} {{laughing}} here. I see {{one thing that}} I shall do--I shall take away your picture and hang it in my room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, and if {{you wish}} I will tell you; but there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> I must say first. Come a little way down the lane with me, Mr. Brattle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Major Ogilvy!' exclaimed the sergeant, {{in a more}} respectful voice. 'If you {{had said}} that your permit was from Major Ogilvy it would have <b>been</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> but you did rave of admirals and commodores, and God knows what other outlandish talk!' ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>was</b> quite <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> I said. We {{must all}} agree in that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your {{brother is}} very much occupied, you know. He has to work hard. One cannot but say that the less his {{attention}} is diverted from his work, the better for his future. When he shall have established himself, why then--it will <b>be</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] she said. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> I want to ask, Mr. Jordan. If you get {{any news}} of the Shasta, will you come and tell me?" ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{one thing}} to chase a horse; it <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to catch it. Little {{consideration}} and less sagacity is required to convince us of the truth of that fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "Men {{find that}} action <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> [...] Than what they in discoursing papers read; [...] The world's affairs require in {{managing}} [...] More arts than those wherein you clerks proceed." ...|$|E
60|$|Edith {{looked at}} the copybook. The copies had been set by herself, and such {{progress}} as the girl had made was {{in the way of}} grotesque facsimile of her mistress's hand. But even if Edith's flowing caligraphy were reproduced the inspiration would <b>be</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mary now was touched, {{for there}} was truth in what Lady Arabella said. But she had no power of going back; her troth was plighted, and nothing that any human being could say should shake her from it. If he, indeed, chose to repent, that would <b>be</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Jim {{imagined}} Lance felt Evelyn's charm, {{and although}} they were cousins, he understood cousins sometimes married, with their relatives' approval, when the marriage would advance {{the interests of the}} family. It was possible that he might hurt Lance worse than by robbing him of Langrigg.|$|R
60|$|The {{science of}} Humboldt is one thing, poetry <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> The poet to-day, {{notwithstanding}} all the discoveries of science, and the accumulated learning of mankind, enjoys no advantage over Homer.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then there}} <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> {{that is not}} a question, but {{something}} which I think I ought to tell you,--something which {{you have a right to}} know before we are married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I didn't {{think this}} new thing was coming up," [...] growled Jarvey. [...] "We were to share equal {{on what we}} {{happened}} {{to get out of}} the greasers. This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> entirely." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{needed the}} venison, {{but when he}} had got down a short {{distance}} {{he knew he was}} rash, for it looked as if the rocks {{on the other side of}} the waterfall were perpendicular. Then, although he might perhaps reach the shelf, to carry the deer back <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|What had jarred on {{him even}} more than the {{signature}} was a little sting he had been silent on--the phrase [...] "married relation"--What an idiot it made him seem as her lover! If Sue had written that in satire, he could hardly forgive her; if in suffering--ah, that <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|All the same, Peter set {{his mouth}} and pushed ahead. In the valley, he could hit up the pace for Deering, but he {{imagined}} to follow the big fellow on the rocks <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> When a bushman took the rocks he went to shoot big-horn and bear. The mountain clubmen studied climbing as one studies the ball-game.|$|R
