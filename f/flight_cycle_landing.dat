40|$|The Arrow 227 is a student-designed {{commercial}} transport {{for use in}} a overnight package delivery network. The {{major goal}} of the concept was to provide the delivery service with the greatest potential return on investment. The design objectives of the Arrow 227 were based on three parameters; production cost, payload weight, and aerodynamic efficiency. Low production cost helps to reduce initial investment. Increased payload weight allows for a decrease in <b>flight</b> <b>cycles</b> and, therefore, less fuel consumption than an aircraft carrying less payload weight and requiring more <b>flight</b> <b>cycles.</b> In addition, fewer <b>flight</b> <b>cycles</b> will allow a fleet to last longer.
