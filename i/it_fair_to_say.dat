Is <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Joe's total score of 20+10+10, or 40, represents his total ability? The answer is no, because Joe achieved the maximum possible score of 20 on the arithmetic test.

5000|$|First, {{we agree}} with the Court of Appeals that the {{concepts}} of contributory infringement and patent misuse [...] "rest on antithetical underpinnings." [...] [...] [...] And an inevitable concomitant {{of the right to}} enjoin another from contributory infringement is the capacity to suppress competition in an unpatented article of commerce. Proponents of contributory infringement defend this result {{on the grounds that it}} is necessary for the protection of the patent right, and that the market for the unpatented article flows from the patentee's invention[...] [...] [...] Yet suppression of competition in unpatented goods is precisely what the opponents of patent misuse decry. If both the patent misuse and contributory infringement doctrines are to coexist, then each must have some separate sphere of operation with which the other does not interfere. Second, we find that the majority of cases in which the patent misuse doctrine was developed involved undoing the damage thought to have been done by A.B. Dick. The desire to extend patent protection to control of staple articles of commerce died slowly, and the ghost of the expansive contributory infringement era continued to haunt the courts. As a result, among the historical precedents in this Court, only the Leeds & Catlin and Mercoid cases bear significant factual similarity to the present controversy. Those cases involved questions of control over unpatented articles that were essential to the patented inventions, and that were unsuited for any commercial noninfringing use. In this case, we face similar questions in connection with a chemical propanil, the herbicidal properties of which are essential to the advance on prior art disclosed by respondent's patented process. Like the record disc in Leeds & Catlin or the stoker switch in the Mercoid cases, and unlike the dry ice in Carbice or the bituminous emulsion in Leitch, propanil is a nonstaple commodity which has no use except through practice of the patented method. Accordingly, had the present case arisen prior to Mercoid, we believe <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it would have fallen close to the wavering line between legitimate protection against contributory infringement and illegitimate patent misuse.|$|E

[...] Duncombe acceded to the requisition and stood for Yorkshire, rather than Grimsby. On election day in June 1826 only four candidates (two Whig, two 'no Popery' Tories) were nominated, and therefore all (including Duncombe) were elected unopposed. [...] Catholic emancipation split the Tories, and the Ultras (including Duncombe) withdrew their support from the government. In 1830, when Duncombe stood again for Yorkshire, [...] Henry Brougham, a Whig-Radical standing in the same constituency said of him [...] Mr Duncombe is a man from whom I differ. I differed from him in respect of the Test acts and on the Catholic Bill. But we have sat in Parliament two years on the same benches, and I declare to you I never saw a man whose conduct did him more honour, or who was more perfectly independent.

Unlike the election of 1826 they were not immediately elected: this time a fifth candidate nominated himself and demanded a poll, The fifth candidate having received a mere handful of votes {{by the end of the}} first day of polling, the poll was closed on the second day , at which point Duncombe was third (behind the two Whig candidates). The four remaining candidates were therefore declared elected. In the 1831 general election, Duncombe was again requisitioned to stand: he accepted the invitation, but withdrew before the actual poll, it being clear that Reform candidates would take all four seats.|$|E

40|$|This puzzling problem, known most {{commonly}} as the Two-Envelope Paradox or the Exchange Paradox, has been occupying {{the minds of}} mathematicians and philosophers {{at least since the}} 1950 s, and is related to another tricky paradox, the St. Petersburg Paradox, that dates back to Daniel Bernoulli and the earliest days of probability theory (the 1700 s). You may have encountered the problem before. Martin Gardner, a famous popularizer of mathematics and longtime author of the “Mathematical Games ” column in Scientific American, presented the problem (without a solution!) in his 1982 book, Aha Gotcha: Paradoxes to Puzzle and Delight. Genius columnist Marilyn vos Savant presented the paradox (with an incorrect solution!) in a 1992 “Ask Marilyn ” column in Parade magazine. Philosophers and mathematicians are still writing papers about both the two-envelope and St. Petersburg paradoxes. I think <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that most mathematicians would consider the two-envelope paradox to be resolved for all practical purposes. But there are some loose ends that continue to trouble some thinkers (philosophers particularly). These concern versions of the problem that could never actually arise in practice, but that seem on the face of them to be well-posed mathematically, at least to some writers. Yet it is not obvious how to resolve these theoretical versions of the paradox...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of a narrative science It all started with the "talking cure". Let me remind you {{that more than a}} century has passed since a patient of the Viennese physician Josef Breuer in 1881 naively labeled her treatment as talking cure (Anna O). Today this is quite in tune with a shared view that the many psychotherapies are correct in attributing a pivotal position to the talk in psychotherapy; however is <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that "in comparison to the behavioral (i. e. proxemic or kinesic) or physiological constituents of psychotherapeutic interaction, the talk which transpires between therapist and client has consistently been in the critical limelight in psychotherapy research, theory and practice " (Russell, 1987, p. 1; 1993). For many years Freud’s rich clinical observations on his patients ’ talking supported the idea that only by telling these observations as stories one could do justice to what had transpired. Freud’s seemingly famous, yet somehow resignative statement in the "Studies on Hysteria" (1895) that his "case histories should read like short stories and that, they lack the serious stamp of science " (p. 160) may be made responsible for an unnecessary sharp divide between science and psychoanalysis.

The conference appears {{to focus on the}} education of practicing lawyers. Is it reasonable to assume that our students will practice law (when, in some jurisdictions at least, there is evidence that a great number of law students never do). Does this matter? 2. Some of the conference papers refer to the teaching of skills. Is there a consensus that skills should be taught and learned in the curriculum? Indeed, is there consensus on what we mean by the term “skills”? Does it make a difference? 3. What skills should be taught and learned in the curriculum to equip students for the challenges of transnational practice? 4. How should skills be taught? I do not mean by what methodology (for I think <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that there is broad agreement that skills are best taught and learned by experiential learning methods). The real question is how should skills teaching and learning be incorporated (or woven) into the curriculum? Is one way better (and more affordable) than another? 5.

40|$|Over 15 years ago, a {{fair amount}} of {{controversy}} was created in the attempts by some (Germanic) tribunals applying the CISG to introduce more predictability in to the difficult issues of determining what “reasonable time” should be for notice giving under Article 39 of the CISG. The notion of a “noble month” was introduced to English academic scholarship in 1997. That 1 term was originally transposed from Ingeborg Schwenzer’s “großzügigen Monat” from the Van Caemerer/Schlectriem commentary (in the days before we had the benefit of this important book in English), and was subsequently given a seal of approval by Professor Schwenzer. The notion became popular in case law from some regions of the CISG; but while a number of cases sprang up confirming the need for more predictability in this area, a number of commentators as well as the CISG Advisory Council distanced themselves from the notion of any benchmark for determining reasonable time. The scene for a battle between flexible uncertainty and more rigid predictability seemed set. I think <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a certain timidity has dominated the subject in recent years in academia, and that case law has fragmented itself into regional approaches which belie the uniform nature of the CISG as it was intended. This paper will analyse the benchmark of the “Noble Month” by charting its success, contextualising its difficulties, and analysing the Article 39 cases from the German courts whence it sprang, to ascertain whether it is still alive and kicking, if it has been laid to rest or—perhaps more controversially—whether it should have been laid to rest.

40|$|Illinois v. Gates 1 was {{the most}} eagerly awaited constitutional-criminal {{procedure}} case of the 1982 Term. I think <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> however, that it was awaited {{a good deal more}} eagerly by law enforcement officials and the Americans for Effective Law Enforcement than by defense lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union. As it turned out, of course, the Gates Court, to the disappointment of many, did not reach the question whether the exclusionary rule in search and seizure cases should be modified so as not to require the exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment when it is obtained in the 2 ̆ 2 good faith 2 ̆ 2 belief or 2 ̆ 2 reasonable belief 2 ̆ 2 that the challenged search or seizure was consistent with the fourth amendment. 2 Nevertheless, the Gates decision is important in its own right for it substantially dismantled the prevailing analytical structure for determining probable cause-the so-called 2 ̆ 2 two-pronged test. 2 ̆ 2 3 How much difference the Gates decision will make in the operation of the warrant procedure, and whether it signals the abandonment of the 2 ̆ 2 two-pronged test 2 ̆ 2 in warrantless as well as warrant cases, remains to be seen. How Gates 2 ̆ 7 soft standard for upholding search warrants (and perhaps warrantless searches and seizures as well) will affect the proposal to adopt a 2 ̆ 2 good faith 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 reasonable belief 2 ̆ 2 exception to the exclusionary rule also remains to be seen. I believe Gates has an important bearing on this issue. I think its emphasis on the practical, flexible, and fluid nature of the 2 ̆ 2 probable cause 2 ̆ 2 standard substantially weakens the case for a 2 ̆ 2 good faith 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 reasonable belief 2 ̆ 2 test generally. Moreover, I think the Gates case totally obviates the need for such a test, if there ever was one, in the warrant context. A 2 ̆ 2 good faith 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 reasonable belief 2 ̆ 2 test by any other name is still a 2 ̆ 2 good faith 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 reasonable belief 2 ̆ 2 test, and as I read Gates the Court essentially adopted such a test in the warrant context...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to rethink the {{relationship}} between the concepts of justification and wrongdoing, which play vital roles in the theory of criminal law. Reading George P. Fletcher’s new book, The Grammar of Criminal Law, in the context of his earlier scholarship has led me to one major disagreement with Fletcher as well as with the traditional criminal law doctrine: for Fletcher and many others, wrongdoing and justification mutually exclude each other; for me, they do not. Consider a hypothetical: a group of people are captured by criminals. The criminals are about to kill everyone but then they have a change of heart and offer their victims a deal: if Jack rapes Jill, the criminals will let everyone go. If not, no one’s life will be spared. Realizing that this is the only way to save several lives, including Jill’s own, Jack reluctantly agrees. Jill, on the other hand, vehemently protests that she would rather die than be violated. When Jack attempts to overpower her, Jill fights back and seriously injures Jack. At that moment, the police arrive and take everyone into custody. It appears that both Jack and Jill have valid defenses of justification – Jack can successfully claim necessity, and Jill can successfully claim self-defense. But is <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the two are equally right or that neither of them has committed any wrongdoing? Focusing on the problem of incompatible justifications, I suggest that we should revise our understanding of justifications in general. Specifically, I argue that, in certain circumstances, justifiable conduct may be wrongful; that in a conflict between two incompatible justifications, one side may be more right than the other; and that justifications should be viewed not as a homogenous group in which each defense has equal importance but as a hierarchical structure in which the place afforded to a defense is determined by its rationale and effect on the rights of others. The top priority belongs to justifications that do not violate rights of others and, in addition, compel others to behave in a cooperative way (the public duty defenses). The intermediate priority belongs to justifications that neither violate rights of others nor create in others a duty to cooperate (the “special relationship” and autonomy defenses). Finally, the lowest priority belongs to the defense of necessity, which, by design, may involve violation of rights of innocent, unoffending individuals...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{collection of}} ‘Anniversar y Essays’ {{is an odd}} mix. But yet, looking through it, I find its oddness perfectly appropriate, because isn’t geography – the discipline and the subject matter – precisely that? Space is, {{as many of these}} essays explicit ly or implicitly highlight, a crazy mixture of thrown together objects, forces and ideas. And it’s this fact of geography that gives me heart when I flick through the following essays and think of them as representing what scholars and researchers and teachers in Maynooth’s Department of Geography have done over the last four decades. Sure, we’ve done more than what this collection captures, and there’s no doubt we’ll continue to do amazing things, but at this juncture, in our 40 th year, I believe this collection is a wonderful transect through the department’s development and a unique testimony to its intellectual vibrancy. All along the transect, we are exposed to the wide variety of research questions addressed by geographers in Maynooth; questions about colonialism, health, climate, memory, place, migration, water, religion, identity, inward investment, and technology, and much more besides. An odd mix, yes, but a productive one, too. We also get to see developments and changes in the de partment as a place. In the first few chapters, for example, we see signs of the department’s early life as a centre for the study of Ireland’s historical geography, as well as a burgeoning location for the study of climate, medical and economic geography. Then, as the collection progresses, we discern a whole set of new issues tackled, including urban and technological change, adaptation to climate change, identity, planni ng, embodiment, and the politics and economics of Ireland’s changing circumstances. I think <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the collectio n also offers a unique opportunity to examine the breadth and richness of our discipline. The essays reflect many of the various ways of thinking about and doing geography. We see, for instance, that geography is about physical and social processes, about climate and class, say; and that geography is about using a range of methods, from remote sensing to ethnography. We also see examples of how scholars in the department ha ve engaged theoretically with the discipline by drawing from and seeking to contribute to what we know about physical geography, climate change studies, feminist theory, Marxism, post-structuralism, and the world of policy-makers. From their base in Maynooth, geographers in the Department have helped to develop broader understanding of key issues in the discipline, often by making significant key contributions to geographical knowledge. Long may that continue. The collection lying before you truly is a unique heritage document, which demonstrates what scholarship in one Irish academic department can achieve over a forty-year span. In this sense it has value. But I believe the collection has wider resonance. For students of the history and philosophy of science in general, and geography in particular, the collection is a landmark contribution. There is plenty of scope to imagine how it might be used to learn about the Irish geography community and how it has grown and changed in the last forty years. I also hope the collection might be used by under- and post-graduate students as an entry point into learning to understand this odd discipline, but also this fantastic department. For example, it is striking how, just as the last five years or so have seen huge changes in the department, we also see in the latter chapters of the collection a wide range of new patterns take shape, such as the internationalization of the department’s research foci and publishing venues; the expression of engaged scholarship regarding contemporary issues in Ireland and beyond; new publishing strategies, including the use of blogs; and new strengths in established areas of the department’s research activities such as climate change. There have been important developments in academic geography in the last few years, not just in Ireland; this sort of coll ection should help piece together explanations for what has happened and why. In sum, then, the collection effectively captures geography’s odd mix and some of Maynooth’s role in its creation. It is at once a celebration of Geography in Maynooth and an opportunity to glimpse the department’s richness, its diversity, and breadth. I hope you agree...|$|E
