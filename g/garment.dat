5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, <b>Garment</b> Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse <b>Garment</b> Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her <b>Garment</b> Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.|$|E
40|$|Seamless <b>garments,</b> {{also known}} as one-step-molding <b>garments,</b> are widely used for {{stretchable}} underwear, sportswear, fashion clothing, and medical <b>garments.</b> Seamless <b>garments</b> are {{a special kind of}} knitted product produced from sewing stitches along the neck, waist, or hip lines. As high-end knitted products, seamless <b>garments</b> have entered the mainstream knitwear market. Currently, special weft-and-warp knitting technologies have been developed to produce seamless <b>garments</b> to meet different consumer requirements. Seamless <b>garments</b> provide improved comfort to the wearer and give a sense of fitting, vigor, grace, fashion, and diversity. In this chapter an overview of seamless-knitted products, seamless knitting technology, and machines is provided...|$|R

5|$|Besides {{his work}} as a lawyer, Alexander Rutherford was {{involved}} in a number of business enterprises. He was President of the Edmonton Mortgage Corporation, and Vice President and solicitor of the Great Western <b>Garment</b> Company. This latter enterprise, which Rutherford co-founded, was a great success: established in 1911 with eight seamstresses, it had quadrupled in size within a year. During the Second World War, the Great Western <b>Garment</b> Company made military uniforms and was reputed to be the largest <b>garment</b> operation in the British Empire. It was acquired by Levi Strauss & Co. in 1961, but continued to manufacture garments in Edmonton until 2004.|$|E

5|$|In the 2nd century, {{emperors}} and men {{of status}} are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle (himation) folded tightly around the body. Women are also {{portrayed in the}} pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate <b>garment</b> both for Christians, {{in contrast to the}} toga, and for educated people, since it was associated with philosophers. By the 4th century, the toga had been more or less replaced by the pallium as a <b>garment</b> that embodied social unity.|$|E

5|$|The Orkneyinga saga relates how {{after the}} death of Earl Hákon Pálsson, his sons, Haraldr Hákonsson, and Páll Hákonsson, divided the earldom between themselves. However, the half-brothers soon began to {{disagree}} with one another, and their vassals divided into competing factions. The saga relates how one day Frakökk, and her sister Helga (mother of Earl Haraldr), were sewing a snow-white <b>garment</b> embroidered with gold. This <b>garment</b> was enchanted, and the two sisters had intended it for Earl Haraldr's half-brother, Earl Páll. Unfortunately for the sisters, Earl Haraldr noticed the beautiful <b>garment</b> and, despite their protestations, put the <b>garment</b> on and soon after died. The saga states that Earl Páll immediately took control of his deceased half-brother's possessions, and that he was highly suspicious of the two sisters. In consequence, Frakökk and Helga were no longer welcome in the earldom, and they left for Caithness, and from there move to Sutherland where Frakökk had an estate. In time, several of Frakökk's descendants were brought up in Sutherland—including her daughter, Steinnvör 'the Stout', and grandson, Ölvir.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the <b>Garment</b> Grid they are wearing. The <b>Garment</b> Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most <b>Garment</b> Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a state of}} the art in the cloth simulation methods and two case studies on how to simulate ancient and high fashion <b>garments</b> with our new Fashionizer platform. The first application concerns the simulation of <b>garments</b> in a cultural heritage project, the Lifeplus project, where we had to simulate in real-time ancient roman clothes. The second application is the simulation of high fashion complex <b>garments</b> from famous fashion designers and these virtual <b>garments</b> have been shown on a screen in a museum next to the real hanged ones. The specific problems to solve while designing ancient <b>garments</b> and high fashion <b>garments</b> are discussed and the making of these <b>garments</b> is explained. Finally, there is an analysis of avenues of research: what is missing, what would the fashion designers want to have, what is the next step to come...|$|R

5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the <b>garment</b> industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, <b>garment</b> workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project asks; {{what is the}} potential for <b>garments</b> to express an Indian/European cultural hybridisation? The research explores the development of an alternative aesthetic by hybridising the ethos of traditional Indian <b>garments</b> and the aesthetics of 'Western' <b>garments.</b> The <b>garments</b> have been designed and constructed after key design features were indentified, and the new <b>garments</b> reflect hybridisation. The aspect of hybridisation was further enhanced with the use of digitally-printed fabric imagery which features a mythologised and idealised European/Indian history. The research seeks to discover if such a joining-together could develop an aesthetic sensibility, informed by both a ‘Western’ enculturation and a traditional Indian heritage. The new <b>garments</b> will speak to the viewer about what it is to experience being situated within two cultures simultaneously...|$|R

Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a <b>garment</b> she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new <b>garment</b> for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others.

One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
