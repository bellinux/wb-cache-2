60|$|At last we {{see your}} advertisement. Viva 'Agnes Tremorne'![89] We {{find it in}} 'Orley Farm.' How admirably this last opens! We are both delighted with it. What a pity it is that so {{powerful}} and idiomatic a writer should be so incorrect grammatically and scholastically speaking! Robert insists on my putting down such phrases as these: 'The Cleeve was distant from Orley two miles, though {{it could not be}} driven under five.' 'One rises up the hill.' 'As good as him.' 'Possessing more acquirements than he would have learned at Harrow.' Learning acquirements! Yes, they are faults, and should be put away by a first-rate writer like Anthony Trollope. It's always worth while to be correct. But do understand through the pedantry of these remarks that we are full of admiration for the book. The movement is so excellent and straightforward--walking like a man, and 'rising up-hill,' and not going round and round, as Thackeray has taken to do lately. He's clever always, but he goes round and round till I'm dizzy, for one, and don't know where I am. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>somebody</b> has tied him up to a post, leaving a tether. Dearest Isa, the day before yesterday I had two letters from Madame M---- to ask us to take rooms. He is coming directly to Rome.

I am full of expectation, but will say no more.|$|E

5000|$|Firelight is a 1964 {{science fiction}} {{adventure}} film {{written and directed}} by Steven Spielberg at the age of 17. Made on a budget of $500, the film was, in a manner of speaking, Spielberg's first commercial success, as it was shown at a local cinema and generated a profit of $1. [...] "I counted the receipts that night", Spielberg has recalled, [...] "And we charged a dollar a ticket.

It was a matter of inches, and once it started, it collected everybody." [...] "Just a bunch of cars crashing -- pretty much that was it," [...] said Matt Kenseth. [...] "I was just trying to make my way back toward the front a little bit there. We had a bad pit-stop exchange and came out way, way behind everybody. Carl was up toward the front and we were running with him before the pit stop. I probably should have just hung in the back, hindsight, but who knows when they're going to wreck, you never know if they're going to wreck.

40|$|Obviously <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>somebody</b> {{has been}} hoodwinked! I {{will return to}} the {{question}} of who, later. But first let me digress from the topic of today and reflect on the concluding comments of an address on trawl fisheries assessments that I gave in 1991 to a conference in Canberra. In the foreword to his book, The log from the Sea of Cortez, the famous American author, John Steinbeck recounted the description his dear friend Doc, a fish biologist, gave of his father, who was also a biologist: Doc stated, ‘He is always wrong. If a man makes a million decisions and judgments at random, it is perhaps mathematically tenable to suppose that he will be right half the time and wrong half the time. But you take my father- he is wrong all the time about everything. That {{is not a matter of}} luck but of selection. That requires genius. ’(Steinbeck 1958). The degree to which Doc’s father’s powers are attributable to being a fish biologist is something we fish biologists might ponder.
