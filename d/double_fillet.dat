A thin <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> is blocked on the border. Within the rectangle it forms is a smaller <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> forming an inner border. The horizontal and vertical sides of the inner border run on into the outer border to form a central rectangle with two narrower oblong vertical panels at either side and oblong panels at the head and foot which intersect at the corners to form small squares. The central panel is blank except for a fillet which continuously follows {{the inside of the}} panel border in a pattern alternately urdy and nebuly. Within the nebulas is a repeated pattern of a blocked oval and within the 'pointed battlements' is a repeated pattern of three blocked dots. The border fillet of the central panel extends in all four directions into each of the adjoining side, upper and lower panels to create a narrower panel, each of which is decorated by a repeating pattern of blocked circles. From the upper and lower narrower panel, one at each end, two more double vertical fillets extend to the cover edge. The right hand narrower panel also has two double fillets extending to the cover edge. The left-hand narrower panel has four equidistant imitation spine-cover clasps which extend to the spine. In each of the four corner squares is a floral arabesque blocked in black. The spine is blocked {{in black and}} gold. At the head and tail thin double horizontal fillets are blocked in black. Above the tail fillets a second <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> creates a panel in which the word '| ILLUSTRATED |' is blocked in gold.

40|$|Low {{carbon steel}} {{material}} and T-joints are frequently used in ship building and steel constructions. Advantages {{such as high}} deposition rates, high quality and smooth weld metals and easy automation make cored wires preferable in these industries. In this study, low carbon steel materials with web and flange thicknesses of 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm were welded with conventional GMAW and double channel shielding {{gas metal arc welding}} (DMAG) method to form <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> T-joints using metal cored wire. The difference between these two methods were characterized by measurements of mean welding parameters, Vickers hardness profiles, weld bead and HAZ geometry of the joints and thermal camera temperature measurements. When weld bead and HAZ geometries are focused, it was seen filler metal molten area increased and base metal molten area decreased in DMAG of low carbon steel. When compared with traditional GMAW, finer and acicular structures in weld metal and more homogenous and smaller grains in HAZ are obtained with double channel shielding gas metal arc welding...|$|E

40|$|Innovation in {{materials}} and joining processes {{continues to play}} a key role in the evolution of the transport sector, in general, and in the aviation in particular. Important factors of innovation are the improvement in ntaterial and processes performances, coupled to the associated cost reduction. Titanium alloys, characterized by high mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, are particularly interesting for the aeronautical sector Their joining, from metal sheets with equal or different thicknesses, is mainly carried out by using laser or arc welding techniques. With the laser process, a high amount of energy is applied in a very limited area for a very short time, resulting in a reduced heat affected zone. With the arc welding, a large amount of heat is applied in a larger area for a longer time, obtaining a more extended heat affected zone. The combination of the process with high energy density (laser) with the high energy contribute (MIG) has been shown to enhance the beneficial effects of both processes (key-hole, ability to bridge sheet gap) while limiting their drawbacks (high thermal gradient, low mechanical resistance). In this paper, the hybrid Laser-MIG welding ofTi- 6 Al- 4 V was investigated. The welded joints were obtained from with 3 -mm thick sheets using the <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> welded Tjoint.

On the outermost borders of front cover are two continuous fillets blocked in black, the inner fillet being in a dogtooth pattern, the outer plain. Inside this there is a <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> rectangular border blocked in gold, crossed by two additional horizontal double fillets of identical pattern to create outer rectangular panels and a central square panel. Within the double fillets there is a repeating pattern of dots within circles blocked in gold. At corner intersections of these double fillets and at the centre-point between the intersections there are squares blocked in black. At {{each of the four}} corners is a quatrefoil consisting of a border blocked in gold and black surrounding a central onlay of blue paper. The quatrefoils contain Greek characters as follows: top left and bottom left:'|ΙΣ|'; top right and bottom right: '|ΧΣ|'. The upper rectangular panel contains the words: '| THE SERMON |' blocked in gold; the lower rectangular panel: '| ON THE MOUNT |'. The square central panel contains an elaborate cross formy the terminations of whose arms, head and foot are invected. Its centerpiece is an eight-petalled flower shape of pale blue paper onlay, surrounded by two fillets of the same shape blocked in gold, between which is a repeating pattern of dots blocked in gold on a red background. At the centre of the blue flower motif is a disc bordered by interpenetrating dentellated circles the outer blocked in gold, the inner in black, both bordered by a circle in red. The inner disc contains a representation of the paschal lamb nimbused and carrying a staff ending in a cross at the head of which is a white pennon charged with a red cross. On the each of the petals of the blue flower appears a Greek character blocked in gold in the following sequence clockwise from the topmost petal: '|Α|Χ|Ρ|Σ|Ω|Ι|Η|Σ|' The arms of the cross consist of an inner portion onlaid in red and an outer portion onlaid in blue. Along the length of each extends a heraldic red rose with leaves of green outlined in gold blocking and a stem blocked in gold. Between the arms of the cross and its upright extend diagonally towards each corner of the square panel four lilies each with four green onlay leaves outlined in gold blocking and with flower and stem blocked in gold. The base of each flower is surrounded by a nine-pointed eastern-style crown blocked in gold. At the foot of the spine are three plain horizontal fillets blocked in gold above which a fillet in a dentelle pattern is situated. Slightly higher there is another plain horizontal fillet.

Inside this, intersecting pairs of three fillets are blocked in gold on the borders. Between the pairs, a repeating pattern is blocked of stars in gold and five dots in relief. The heads of a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle are blocked on the four corners. Strapwork weaves around these heads. In the mandorla, a crowned angel is blocked at prayer, with an open book in front. The angel's wings rise to form {{the outer edge of}} a lyre, with the points of the angel's crown rising to become the strings of the lyre. The title: '| Lyra | Germanica |'is blocked in gold above and below the lyre. The border of the mandorla contains the quotes, blocked in gold: | 'SING UNTO THE LORD. BLESS HIS NAME. SHOW FORTH HIS SALVATION FROM DAY TO DAY. GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD FOR HE IS GOOD. FOR HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER. ' A small trefoil formed by a gold fillet, plus hatch gold within is blocked at the head, tail and sides of the mandorla. The trefoil at the head has the word: '| IHS |' in relief within the trefoil; at the tail, the trefoil has: '| INRI | L |' in relief. The trefoil on the left contains a serpent winding round a cross blocked within. The trefoil on the right has a heart blocked in gold which contains a Byzantine cross in relief. The spine has an upper panel consisting of two horizontal fillets blocked in gold enclosing strapwork of two thin outer fillets and a thick inner fillet. The central rectangular panel has a border fillet blocked in gold {{in which there is a}} repeating pattern of dots blocked in relief. Within the panel is strapwork consisting of intersecting semi-circles which form three consecutive mandorlas and, outside each at the head and tail, triangles blocked in gold. The triangles each contain a single trefoil blocked in relief. The mandorlas consist of a thin outer fillet blocked in gold, a thick inner fillet blocked in gold containing a repeating pattern of dots blocked in relief pattern. Within this are from outer to inner 1) another thin fillet, blocked in gold, a thin <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> containing a repeating pattern of dots blocked in gold; and 3) a thin fillet blocked in gold. In the topmost mandorla are in relief each on a separate solid panel blocked in gold, the words: '| Lyra | Germanica | WINKWORTH |'.
