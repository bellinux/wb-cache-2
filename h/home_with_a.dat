5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Indies in early 1942, Oerip {{was held in}} a mixed prisoner of war camp in Cimahi. Upon his release {{three and a half}} months later, Oerip refused an offer to form a new, Japanese-backed police force and returned to KEM, where he and his wife rented paddy fields to grow rice while continuing to operate their flower garden. To protect their land, they surrounded their property and <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high bamboo fence. Although no longer active in the military, Oerip occasionally received former KNIL members, including Abdul Haris Nasution and Sunarmo, who brought news of events outside the village. The couple continued their work, harassed and surveilled by the Japanese and pro-Japanese Indonesians, until the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 signified that Japan would soon withdraw. It was during this period that Oerip began having heart problems.|$|E

5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

According to the official PAVN history, by March the North Vietnamese had managed to amass three infantry divisions (2nd, 304th, 308th), the 64th Regiment of the 320th Division and two independent infantry regiments (27th and 28th), eight regiments of artillery, three engineer regiments, three tank battalions, six anti-aircraft battalions, and eight sapper battalions – approximately 35,000 troops, in the battle area.|$|E
5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped <b>home,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|Lois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's {{upcoming}} {{first birthday}} party and sends Peter, along with Chris, {{to drop off}} the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek {{the opportunity to play}} with all the machines, causing Peter to lose his watch in a claw machine. A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. The Manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they won't be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around Manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois doesn't have do any work.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{probably}} {{made his first}} public concert appearance {{at the age of}} nine, when he participated in a chamber music concert accompanying a horn duo. He was also a prolific composer from an early age. As an adolescent, his works were often performed at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> private orchestra for the associates of his wealthy parents amongst the intellectual elite of Berlin. Between the ages of 12 and 14, Mendelssohn wrote 12 string symphonies for such concerts, and a number of chamber works. He wrote his first published work, a piano quartet, {{by the time he was}} 13. It was probably Abraham Mendelssohn who procured the publication of Mendelssohn's early piano quartet by the house of Schlesinger. In 1824, the 15-year-old wrote his first symphony for full orchestra (in C minor, Op.11).|$|E

5|$|Pope made {{a number}} of saves as York held league leaders Rochdale to a 0–0 away draw, with a point being enough to lift the team back into seventh-place. York were {{prevented}} from equalling a club record of eight consecutive clean sheets when Accrington scored a stoppage time equaliser in a 1–1 home draw, in which York had taken earlier taken the lead with a Coulson penalty. A 1–0 win away win over Oxford, which was decided by a second half Coulson penalty, resulted in York moving one place above their opponents and back into seventh-place. York consolidated their place in a play-off position after beating Bury 1–0 at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fifth-minute goal scored by Lowe from a Hayhurst corner. The result meant York opened up a five-point lead over eighth-placed Oxford with two fixtures remaining. A place in the League Two play-offs was secured following a 1–0 win over Newport at home, in which Coulson scored the only goal in the 77th minute with a 25-yard free kick. Pope earned a nomination for League Two Player of the Month for April 2014, having conceded only one goal in five matches in that period.|$|E
5|$|The loyalists {{reached the}} home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese {{business}} district of Cholon. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who {{was reported to be}} Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders. Nhu's secret agents had fitted the <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Diệm and Nhu had escaped during the night.|$|E

As the video progresses, Trainor proceeds to fail at her attempt to bake pies, setting a pie on fire. Trainor is then shown scrubbing the kitchen floor. The entire video is interspersed with scenes of a singing and dancing barbershop quartet. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} video, Trainor tests potential suitors. The first date cooks her a meal consisting of a small portion of scallops, which fails to impress Trainor. The second potential suitor takes her to a carnival and tries to impress her with his strength, which also fails to impress Trainor. The third date takes her boating, with the boat nearly capsizing and Trainor getting seasick. This also fails to impress Trainor. Finally, Trainor meets Charlie Puth on the online dating service, PlentyofFish. Puth comes to Trainor's <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> carryout pizza, which succeeds in impressing Trainor. The video ends with Trainor smiling and inviting Puth into her home.|$|E

A story from Inaba Province, related by Inoue Enryō, tells of a girl with poor manual dexterity who is suddenly possessed by a tengu. The spirit wishes to rekindle the declining art of swordsmanship in the world. Soon a young samurai appears to whom the tengu has appeared in a dream, and the possessed girl instructs him as an expert swordsman. Some rumors surrounding the ninja indicate that they were also instructed by the tengu.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{received}} no {{support from the}} Lakers front office, aside from a single call {{the day after the}} fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son {{at the time of the}} punch. His wife recalls her and the children being treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to his <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, York player David Longhurst {{collapsed}} and died after suffering heart failure during a home match against Lincoln City. A few months later, a newly built, covered {{stand at the}} Shipton Street End of Bootham Crescent was named after him. York were the Fourth Division's second lowest scorers in 1990–91, as they finished 21st in the table. Douglas Craig, {{who had been on}} the board since 1978, succeeded Michael Sinclair as chairman in June 1991. York had won two of 11 matches by mid October 1991; Bird was dismissed and was replaced in November by Aston Villa assistant manager John Ward. York continued to be placed in lower midtable, and finished fourth from bottom for the second year running in 1991–92. They started 1992–93 with a club-record start of four wins, and led the table until late December 1992. Ward left for Bristol Rovers in March 1993, shortly after a midseason slump in which York won only one of 13 matches. Ward's assistant Alan Little took over and York finished the season in fourth place. They played Bury in the play-off semi-final, drawing the first leg 0–0 at Gigg Lane before winning the second leg 1–0 at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> goal from Gary Swann. In the final at Wembley Stadium, York beat Crewe Alexandra 5–3 on penalties, after the score had finished 1–1 after extra time. Wayne Hall scored the decisive penalty as York won promotion to the third tier, now named the Second Division after the formation of the Premier League in 1992.|$|E
