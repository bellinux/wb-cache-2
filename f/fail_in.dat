5|$|Past {{servicing}} missions have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually <b>fail.</b> <b>In</b> August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but {{the first set of}} electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E

Ščerbatihs <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> his third attempt, which would have forced Steiner to increase his last attempt to 258 kg in order to win gold. With a successful clean and jerk of 258 kg, and a total of 461 kg, Steiner became an Olympic gold medalist.|$|R
5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting. Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.|$|E
5|$|A 29-Cent Robbery is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features the debut of Marie Eline in the main role as Edna Robinson, a young girl who foils an attempt by a robbery to loot her family's home. All the thief manages to take is her toy bank, containing 29 cents. Edna ends up taking it upon herself to catch the thief after the police <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> the task. It was reviewed positively by critics and was viewed across the United States. The film was the first split-reel by Thanhouser, containing this short and The Old Shoe Came Back on a single reel.|$|E
5|$|Following William Beebe's {{death in}} 1962, his {{research}} station at Simla remained in operation under Jocelyn Crane's management, {{under the new}} name of the William Beebe Tropical Research Station. However, because Jocelyn's research required her to travel north for extended periods, by 1965 she had little time to keep the station running. By 1971, the station had fallen into disuse and was declared closed. Meanwhile, as Asa Wright's health began to <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> her old age, her friends began to fear that after her death her neighboring estate of Spring Hill might be lost to developers, and established a trust to buy the estate and convert it into the Asa Wright nature center. In 1974, Beebe's property was donated to the newly established Asa Wright Nature Center.|$|E

5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at all costs. Should he <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E
5|$|Perry is the pet platypus of the Flynn-Fletcher family, and is {{perceived}} as mindless and domesticated. In secret, however, he lives a double life {{as a member of}} an all-animal espionage organization referred to as O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). Many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house; such as the side of the house, most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard, and several other everyday objects that seem to elude the family's attention. Perry also has entrances in Hawaii and North Dakota.

5|$|Traveling across Filgaia, {{the heroes}} {{make their way}} to the long-abandoned Guardian Temple to gain the {{alliance}} of the mystical guardians who maintain the forces of nature across the planet. There they are tested individually. After each of them fails their personal tests of character, the Guardians reluctantly agree to aid them. The Guardians tell Rudy and his companions that the demons have already begun to revive their leader, and have only to lift the seal on her cocoon-like prison by destroying the three scattered statues that lie across Filgaia. Utilizing ancient Elw technology in the form of teleportation devices, the group travels the world to stop the Quarter Knights from destroying the statues, but they <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> each attempt. The consequent resurrection of Mother occurs, yet the demons are informed by their leader that it is her intention to eradicate Filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E
5|$|In May 1818 Heywood {{declined}} {{command of}} the Canadian Lakes with the rank of commodore. As he had become content with shore life, {{he said he would}} only accept another appointment in the event of war. In retirement Heywood published his dictionary of the Tahitian language, wrote papers relating to his profession, and corresponded widely. He enjoyed a circle of acquaintances which included the writer Charles Lamb, and was a particular friend of the hydrographer Francis Beaufort. He destroyed much of his writing shortly before his death, but a document from 1829 survives, in which he expresses his views on the unfitness for self-government of Greeks, Turks, Spaniards and Portuguese, the iniquities of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, and the doubtful benefits of Catholic emancipation in Ireland. Of strong religious convictions, Heywood was increasingly interested in spiritual matters during the last years of his life. His health began to <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> 1828, and he died after suffering a stroke, aged 58, in February 1831. He was interred in the vault of Highgate School chapel, where a memorial plaque was dedicated on 8 December 2008.|$|E

5|$|In {{the primary}} portion of Infinity Blade, the player {{character}} travels a largely linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The {{path through the}} castle {{is a series of}} discreet locations where the player can pan the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three-dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short cutscene as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons {{at the bottom of the}} screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number of uses during a single battle. Players may also parry incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with a swipe to the left. Each of these three counters can leave the enemy vulnerable to counterattack for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the health bar. When players <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked—such as a shield bash—that must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can swipe in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage.|$|E
5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E
5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, 2012, Volador Jr. {{formed the}} Los Depredadores del Aire ("The Predators of the Air") group {{alongside}} Black Warrior and Mr. Águila. Two days later, Los Depredadores del Aire defeated Los Reyes de la Atlantida (Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr.) {{to win the}} Mexican National Trios Championship. For July 29, Volador Jr. traveled to Tokyo, Japan, {{in an attempt to}} regain the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship from Prince Devitt, but would eventually <b>fail</b> <b>in</b> his title challenge. The following month, Volador Jr. started a rivalry with Mr. Niebla, for which he was positioned as a tecnico even though still being a part of rudo stable Los Invasores. On October 30, Los Depredadores del Aire lost the Mexican National Trios Championship back to Los Reyes de la Atlantida. On January 22, 2013, Volador Jr. survived a torneo cibernetico to advance to a final match for the vacant CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against the other survivor, Rey Escorpión. On January 29, Volador Jr. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Escorpión. Following their clash over the Reyes del Aire trophy, Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya, Jr. and Negro Casas, La Máscara and Averno and finally Shocker and Mr. Niebla to qualify for the finals of the tournament. On March 15, 2013, at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Altantis and Último Guerrero to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles. The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the next time the two rivals were in the same ring. On Sunday, February 17, 2013, La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and Místico La Nueva Era against Volador Jr., Euforia and Último Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Atlantis and Último Guerrero in a Relevos Suicidas match and thus advanced to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas against each other. In the end, Volador Jr. was defeated and forced to unmask and reveal his real name.|$|E
