Many early single individual trees also remain, among them Bottle trees, Bunya pines, Chinese elm, Cricket Bat willow, English oak, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>pine,</b> Jacaranda, Norfolk Island pine, Plane trees, Kauri pine, Silky oak, Silver maple and Swamp cypress.|$|E
5000|$|This tree {{is often}} known as Bhutan pine, (not to be {{confused}} with the recently described Bhutan white pine, Pinus bhutanica, a closely related species). Other names include blue pine, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>pine</b> and Himalayan white pine. In the past, it was also known by the invalid botanic names Pinus griffithii McClelland or [...] "Pinus excelsa" [...] Wall., Pinus chylla Lodd. when the tree became available through the European nursery trade in 1836, nine years after Nathaniel Wallich first introduced seeds to England.|$|E

50|$|New {{building}} of the Faculty of forestry was built in 1956, right above Careva Ćuprija, where the northwest section of the vast wood of Košutnjak begins {{at an altitude of}} 110-125 meters. Professors and students began developing a dendrology collection in 1957, which grew into the Arboretum of the Faculty of Forestry, a specific botanical garden which was protected by the state in July 2011 as the natural monument. It is used as an classroom in the open, for the practical studies of the students but also by the scientist for their work. The arboretum has its nursery garden and the greenhouse. On 6.7 hecaters, the arboretum holds 2,000 individual specimen of 300 trees and shrubs. They include 218 deciduous and 24 conifer species, out of which 80 are ornamental, and 40 species of the perennial plants. There are 77 domestic and 146 foreign species, including: narrow-leafed ash, Balkan maple, Balkan forsythia, laburnum, giant sequoia, cedar, cherry laurel (new variety developed in arboretum), <b>Himalayan</b> <b>pine</b> and the oldest metasequoia in Belgrade.|$|E
50|$|The {{garden is}} crossed by {{numerous}} small springs {{as well as}} the river Ninfa, which flows south of the garden. Restoration of the garden involved importing plant species from all over the world. There are over a thousand varieties of plants and trees, such as American walnuts, several ornamental apples, yuccas, Cotinus coggygria, catalpa, cedar trees and many rose bushes, including multicoloured Rosa x odorata 'Mutabilis', the early yellow Rosa hugonis, and the pale pink 'Complicata'. Cultivars grown include the white 'Iceberg', red 'Max Graf', and the following hybrid musk roses: the cream coloured 'Penelope', pink 'Ballerina' and buff coloured 'Buff Beauty'. Many climbing roses are also grown in the garden, including Rosa banksiae, Rosa bracteata, Rosa filipes 'Kiftsgate', known for its vigor and beautiful foliage, the white Rosa 'Mme. Alfred Carriére' and the apricot climbing rose 'Gloire de Dijon'. Along the main avenue are cypresses, weeping cherry trees, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>pine,</b> banana trees, Mexican pine and lavender. The rock garden contains Iberis, Eschscholzia, Veronica, golden alyssum (Alyssum saxatile), Aquilegia, Dianthus and pomegranates. Purple flowered Clematis armandii, climbing hydrangea (Hydrangea petiolaris), and poplars grow near the bridge; along the river there are groves of hazelnut trees, Acer saccharinum and Liriodendron tulipifera. Near the bridges are maples, poplars, Photinia serrulata, Gunnera manicata, papyrus, Casuarina tenuissima, jasmine, climbing hydrangea, purple flowered Clematis armandii, wisteria, Liriodendron tulipifera, cedars, wattle and a clump of bamboo from China. Magnolia stellata grows in front of the castle.|$|E
40|$|Pinus wallichiana A. B. Jacks is an {{important}} <b>Himalayan</b> <b>pine</b> species predominant in the Northern Himalayan range. We used in vitro embryogenic tissue of mature zygotic embryos as target material for genetic transformation. Regeneration of embryogenic tissue before particle bombardment and long selection period, combined with selective agent after bombardment, led {{to the production of}} transformed plantlets. Present results indicate that high levels of transient foreign gene expression can be achieved in pines. The procedure reported here is very simple, efficient and reproducible and is applicable across diverse genotypes of Himalayan blue pine. Expression of positive histochemical GUS activity (39 %) in the bombarded embryogenic tissue was observed. PCR analysis of bar transgenes (52 %) transformation efficiency indicated successful genetic modifications of P. wallichiana embryogenic tissue by the pAHC 25 plasmid, where 50 % of the selected plants showed gene integration and expression...|$|E

40|$|Current study {{deals with}} the {{production}} of cellulases and xylanases from the Rhizopus oryzae SN 5 isolated from composed soil of <b>Himalayan</b> <b>pine</b> forest, {{in order to meet}} the challenges of lignocellulosic biomass based biorefineries. Culture parameters for concomitant production of cellulase and xylanase were optimized through EVOP-factorial design technique under solid state fermentation. And maximum yield of cellulase and xylanase were obtained 437. 54 U/gds and 273. 83 U/gds, respectively at 30 °C and pH 6. 0 after 5 days of incubation. On applying these enzymes for the saccharification of the dilute acid pretreated Sorghum Stover (SS), 0. 407 g/g sugar was yielded. This hydrolysate on fermentation, yielded 0. 411 g/g ehanol with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCIM 3288), which could be considered a good conversion. Therefore, Rhizopus oryzae SN 5 was found as potent strain for the production of the cocktail of lignocellulosic biomasss hydrolytic enzymes and would be promising tool in the area of lignocellulose based bio-refineries...|$|E
