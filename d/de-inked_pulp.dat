40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study of the}} de-inking process of xerography wastepaper regeneration has been simulated using a method of toner adsorption on plastic films. The {{results of the study}} indicate that a range of proper combinations of solvent, surfactant and toner can form viscous liquids that can be adsorbed on plastic films at ambient temperature. The inks adsorbed on the film can be separated by a screen process. The optimal condition for the present de-inking process was carried out at 20 degrees C for 7 min with de-inking additives consisting of 0. 8 wt%NAISA 20 (a solvent mixture) as de-inking solvent and 0. 3 wt% LAUEO 3 (lauryl alcohol polyethylene glycol) as the surfactant. During toner's adsorption process in the presence of preferred PET films, the residual ink speck population in the regenerated paper could be reduced from 67, 900 ppm to about 12 ppm (99. 98 % improvement) after two-stage treatments. The brightness of the final <b>de-inked</b> <b>pulps</b> could then be improved to 85 % GE (unit of brightness), almost identical to 86 % GE of virgin unprinted paper. Furthermore, the regenerated paper meets the standard of high quality grade paper which are suitable for reuse as the printing paper. The adsorption method as described in the study is advantageous because of its low chemical dosages and energy consumption. Additionally, the wastewater and the plastic films used in the process could be recycled. The simple and practical laboratory method can be adapted to conventional process plants for the economy benefits from scaling up. (C) 2009 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} {{oxidative}} bleaching and mechanical dispersion in different conditions on the optical and mechanical properties of deinked recycled pulp was investigated. Industrial deinked pulp was treated in the different conditions, including dispersion, combined oxidative bleaching during dispersion, and separate dispersion and then oxidative bleaching. Handsheet papers were made from obtained pulps and then scanned and taken photos were analyzed by Digimizer software, version 4. 1. 1. 0 to analysis spot content. Optical and mechanical properties of obtained handsheets were determined and compared. Results indicated that mechanical dispersion decreased spot content and brightness and increased yellowing of the handsheets. Moreover, mechanical dispersion increased dry and wet tensile and burst strengths, water retention value (WRV), ash content and decreased tear strength of handsheet papers. This study revealed that combined dispersing and oxidative bleaching of <b>de-inked</b> <b>pulp</b> provided superior results in comparison to the separate dispersing and oxidative bleaching...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{laboratory}} refining on de-inking potential of inkjet printed handsheets was investigated. Pulp samples containing 80 % short fiber and 20 % long fiber were beaten in a PFI mill to reach four predetermined freeness levels of 650 (unrefined), 550, 430, and 340 mL CSF, and then handsheets were made. Handsheets were identically inkjet printed and then de-inked. Results revealed that, at lower freeness value, {{the brightness of}} de-inked pulps was higher, but the opacity decreased. The surface roughness of handsheets produced using different refined pulp before de-inking was reduced. Our results showed that refining will impart {{a positive effect on}} handsheets’ de-inking potential, and de-inking printed papers produced from pulps refined to lower freeness generated the highest brightness. The results revealed that both tensile and tear strength indices of <b>de-inked</b> <b>pulp</b> were lower. However, the tear strength index of unrefined sample and the tensile strength index of pulp refined to 430 ml CSF were higher than for undeinked samples...|$|E
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} volume of waste newspaper indicates {{the importance and}} availability of this paper for recycling. However, aging of the print, especially offset print, {{plays an important role}} in recycling, which requires additional consideration. The effects of aging and sodium hydroxide on de-inking of old newspaper is investigated. In all, 4 natural aging periods (0, 4, 8, and 12 months) and 5 concentrations of sodium hydroxide (0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 % on bone-dry (BD) weight of the paper) were employed to study the de-inking of offset printed newspaper. Optical properties of recycled paper, including brightness, yellowness, and absorption coefficient, were measured. The results indicate that the treatment of non-aged newspaper with 1. 5 % sodium hydroxide produced the best de-inking. Aging newspaper for 4 months and longer decreased the brightness of <b>de-inked</b> <b>pulp</b> and increased the absorption coefficient, whereas higher doses of sodium hydroxide increased brightness and decreased the absorption coefficient. No significant difference was observed between 1. 5 % and 2 % sodium hydroxide. Aging decreased yellowness and sodium hydroxide increased it...|$|E
40|$|The need {{to reduce}} the amount of waste {{generated}} from paper to paper recycling operations and the desire to secure an alternative to the existing raw material sources for microcrystalline cellulose production has led to this study. In it, three waste printer’s paper grades: book, ground-wood/newsprint and paperboard were shredded, cut and milled into particulate fines (150 → 900 μm). Pulped α-cellulose was obtained from the batch-wise digestion of these waste papers in <b>de-inking</b> and <b>pulping</b> processes which operated at 80 o C and 1 atm. The recovered pulped α-cellulose were further subjected to regeneration, hydrolysis/de-polymerization, drying and milling processes in order to obtain 10. 2 → 80. 5 % yields of microcrystalline cellulose powder (MCCP) samples (with dp < 250 μm). However, the book paper grade produced the maximum yield α-cellulose of 80. 5 %. The physico-chemical property analysis of the MCCP samples showed: porosity (76 → 80 %); moisture sorption capacity (3. 5 → 13. 5 %); loss on drying (4. 5 → 6. 0 %); crystallinity index (71 → 78 %) and degree of polymerization (186 → 207).

30|$|Flotation {{has been}} widely used in mineral separation, oil–water separation, paper <b>pulp</b> <b>de-inking,</b> and {{wastewater}} treatment (Cheng et al. 2016). Previous studies indicate that flotation is inexpensive, it reduces the amount of mineral ash, and it enriches the material in useful minerals (Tsai and Lumpkin 1984; Cheng et al. 2017). However, until now, only a few articles have concentrated on oil-shale flotation. Thyabat et al. (2014) thought that flotation could improve the grade of low-grade oil shale. Altun et al. (2009) used ultrasonically aided flotation to improve the floatability of oil shale {{and concluded that the}} particulates filling the pores/voids or attached to the surfaces of the larger particles were effectively removed after ultrasonic treatment. Li et al. (2012) studied the effect of the dosages of the oleic acid collector, the kerosene collector, and the frother on the floatability of Fushun oil shale. Their results indicate that oleic acid and kerosene collectors affect the enrichment of organic matter in the oil shale. Altun et al. (2006 a, b) investigated the effects of the conditioning time, flotation time, pulp density, particle size, and the frother dosage on the flotation performance of the Himmetoğlu oil shale. Their factorial experiments showed that pulp density was the most important parameter affecting flotation performance. The FTIR spectrum confirmed the organic-rich and highly humic character of oil shale. El-Mofty (2018) obtained a 20 % kerogen concentrate from a 10 % kerogen sample with 70 % recovery at a pH of 5 without a collector.|$|R
40|$|Combustion of an {{increasing}} amount of biofuel and waste woods {{has resulted in}} certain environmental advantages, including decreased emissions of fossil CO 2, SO 2 and metals. On the other hand, a number of chloride and alkali related operational problems have occurred which are related to combustion of these fuels. Alkali related operational problems have been studied in a project consisting of two parts. The overall scope has been to characterise the operational problems and to study measures to minimise them. The first part was reported in Värmeforsk report 997 where the results were summarised in a table of different measures. In part two, additional measures {{have been included in}} the test plan and initial corrosion has been studied linked to the different measures. The tests have also in part two been carried out at the 12 MW CFB boiler at Chalmers. The effect of the selected measures has been investigated concerning both deposit formation and bed agglomeration, {{and at the same time}} emissions and other operational conditions were characterised. The second part of the project has among other things focused on: • To investigate measures which decrease the content of alkali and chloride in the deposits, and consequently decrease the risk for corrosion (by investigating the initial corrosion). Focus was also on trying to explain favourable effects. • To investigate if it is possible to combine a rather low dosage of kaolin and injection of ammonium sulphate. This was done in order to reduce both bed agglomeration and problems from deposits during combustion of fuels rich in chlorine. • To investigate if co-combustion with sewage sludge, de-inking sludge or peat with high ash content, could give similar advantages as conventional additives. • Investigate if ash from PFBC is possible to use as an alternative bed material. By comparing the different measures in part two, it could be concluded that cocombustion of sewage sludge gave the best overall effect. The judgement was based on the effects concerning bed agglomeration, level of alkali chloride in the flue gas, deposits and initial corrosion. Simultaneous addition of kaolin and ammonia sulphate also had a favourable impact both in the bed and on the alkali chlorides in the gas phase. Dosage of kaolin did not reduce the effect of injected ammonium sulphate. Cocombustion of peat could also be a very attractive alternative, but it is critical to select a suitable peat type. It is of special concern to avoid peat with a high content of calcium, since it can increase the level of alkali chlorides by reacting with available sulphur. Change of bed material to ash from PFBC can decrease problems with bed agglomeration, but there is a risk of increased deposit formation and corrosion. A boiler operated with high steam data should consequently combine the change of bed material with injection of ammonium sulphate or another source of sulphur. Co-combustion of <b>de-inking</b> sludge from <b>pulp</b> and paper production can reduce problems with bed agglomeration. There is, however, an increased chance of corrosion due to the high content of calcium. Injection of sulphates may improve the situation concerning corrosion. The results also showed that low potassium chlorine content in the flue gas decreases the risk of corrosion. Increased amount of potassium chlorine content in the flue gas will not necessary give a high amount of chlorine content in the deposits if there is sulphur in the system.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of xerography wastepaper recycling by estimating the solubility parameter of toner {{to select a}} suitable de-inking agent has been accomplished in aqueous media. The major de-inking agents {{used in this study}} were composed of combinations of a suitable organic solvent and a surfactant. This research focused on the addition of water insoluble solvents, with their solubility parameters closely proximate to the polymeric binders in toner, to assist its initial dissolution. Subsequently, the addition of surfactant to the mixture promotes the formation of an emulsion. The ink could then be easily washed away from the pulp aqueous slurry. The most suitable de-inking agent has been identified to be the mixture of naphthalene (20 %), isoamyl acetate (80 %) and surfactant. At 20 degrees C, styrene-acrylate copolymer binder in the toner was emulsified in the pulp aqueous slurry to form a stable emulsion with a particle size of 527 nm. After repeated water washings of the pulp, the ink specks on the paper were washed away as a water emulsion and the speck of the recycled paper was lowered from 5760 ppm to less than 10 ppm. In the meantime, the brightness of the final <b>de-inked</b> <b>pulp</b> was improved from 80 % GE to 85 % GE, which is almost identical to the brightness of virgin unprinted paper (86 % GE).
