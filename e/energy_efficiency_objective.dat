40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks is a {{collection}} of various densely deployed sensor nodes which is implemented in a variety of applications such as Home, Medical, Military, Security Surveillance and Combat Field Reconnaissance etc. An event-driven wireless sensor networks (EWSNs) is a type of wireless sensor network in which the desired information is disseminated to the sink more reliably. Another important function of EWSN is the accurate event detection so that the probability of false alarm becomes low. Likewise WSN, sensor nodes in EWSNs are also energy constrained thereby designing energy-efficient algorithm becomes an important factor for extending the life span of the event-driven wireless sensor network. In EWSNs, clustering is used for efficient use of constrained resources for energy saving. This paper provides a novel Network Reliable Routing Protocol for EWSNs. This protocol provides better data aggregation by using clustering at initial and reliable data dissemination by using multipath routing method which makes the network fault tolerant. Network Reliable Routing Protocol setup a routing path from source to sink. It also minimizes unnecessary activation of nodes during data dissemination process.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an energy-efficient, faulttolerant {{approach}} for collaborative signal and information processing (CSIP) among multiple sensor nodes using a mobileagent -based computing model. In this model, instead of each sensor node sending local {{information to a}} processing center for integration, as is typical in a client/server-based computing, the integration code is moved to the sensor nodes through mobile agents. The <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>objective</b> and the fault tolerance objective always conflict {{with each other and}} present unique challenge to the design of CSIP algorithms. In general, energyefficient approaches try to limit the redundancy in the algorithm so that minimum amount of energy is required for fulfilling a certain task. On the other hand, redundancy is needed for providing fault tolerance since sensors might be faulty, malfunctioning, or even malicious. A balance has to be struck between these two objectives. We discuss the potential of mobile-agent-based collaborative processing in providing progressive accuracy while maintaining certain degree of fault tolerance. We evaluate its performance compared to the client/server-based collaboration from perspectives of energy consumption and execution time through both simulation and analytical study. Finally, we take collaborative target classification as an application example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} heterogeneous cognitive radio networks (CRNs) comprising primary channels (PCs) with heterogeneous characteristics and secondary users (SUs) with various sensing and reporting qualities for different PCs. We first define the opportunity as the achievable {{total data rate}} and its cost as the energy consumption caused from sensing, reporting, and channel switching operations and formulate a joint spectrum discovery and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>objective</b> to minimize the energy spent per unit of data rate. Then, a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated to determine: 1) the optimal subset of PCs to be scheduled for sensing; 2) the SU assignment set for each scheduled PC; and 3) sensing durations and detection thresholds of each SU on PCs it is assigned to sense. Thereafter, an equivalent convex framework is developed for specific instances of the above combinatorial problem. For comparison, optimal detection and sensing thresholds are also derived analytically under the homogeneity assumption. Based on these, a prioritized ordering heuristic is developed to order channels under the spectrum, energy, and spectrum-energy limited regimes. After that, a scheduling and assignment heuristic is proposed and is shown to perform {{very close to the}} exhaustive optimal solution. Finally, the behavior of the CRN is numerically analyzed under these regimes with respect to different numbers of SUs, PCs, and sensing qualities...|$|E

The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that the transmission data rate is mapped based on the proposed tunable cost function to optimize the energy requirements of a transmitter. The algorithm is adaptive in nature where parameters of the cost function {{can be adapted to}} match the transmission data rate based on network load conditions. In addition to that, to achieve the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>objective,</b> different threshold criteria are proposed for the adaptive data rate mapping. Performance analysis is carried out to study the effects of tunable parameters of the cost function to enhance energy efficiency and QoS. By using an OPNET based simulation model, we evaluate the performance improvement that can be achieved when the proposed mechanism is implemented in a WLAN. Performance of the proposed algorithm is also compared with two well established algorithms such as the First Rate CDRPA and the Miser.

40|$|Abstract — Energy {{consumption}} of communication networks is growing very fast {{due to the}} rapidly increasing traffic demand. Consequently, design of green communication networks gained a lot of attention. In this paper we focus on optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, able to support this growing traffic demand. Several energy-aware routing and wavelength assignment (EA-RWA) techniques have been proposed for WDM networks {{in order to minimize}} their operational cost. These techniques aim at minimizing the number of active links by packing the traffic as much as possible, thus avoiding the use of lightly loaded links. As a result, EA-RWA techniques may lead to longer routes and to a high utilization on some specific links. This has a detrimental effect on the signal quality of the optical connections, i. e., lightpaths. In this study we quantify the impact of power consumption minimization on the optical signal quality. and address this problem by proposing a combined impairment and energy-aware RWA (IEA-RWA) approach. Towards this goal we developed a complete mathematical model that incorporates both linear and non-linear physical impairments together with an <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>objective.</b> The IEA-RWA problem is formulized as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model where both energy efficiency and signal quality considerations are jointly optimized. By comparing the proposed IEA-RWA approach with existing RWA (IA-RWA and EA-RWA) schemes, we demonstrate that our solution allows for a reduction of energy consumption close to the one obtained by EA-RWA approaches, while still guaranteeing a sufficient level of the optical signal quality...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the problem}} of {{spectrum}} scarcity and large energy consumption in wireless communications, designing energy-efficient Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) becomes important and necessary. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal Cooperative Sensing Scheduling (CSS) and parameter design to achieve energy efficiency in CRNs using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). In particular, we consider the CSS problem for a CRN with M Secondary Users (SUs) and N primary channels to determine how many SUs should be assigned to sense each channel in order to maximize the objective function that is related to energy efficiency. By assigning more SUs to sense one channel, higher sensing accuracy can be gained; however, by spreading out the SUs to sense more channels, spectrum opportunities can be better exploited. The CSS problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. While such problem is generally hard and can only be solved by numerical methods with high computation complexity, in this paper we provide a detailed analysis and the analytical results provide useful and interesting insights. The optimality of the myopic CSS is proved for the case of two channels, and it is also conjectured for the general case. We also study the tradeoff between the sensing and transmission durations. In addition, the structure of the optimal sensing time that maximizes the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>objective</b> is also analyzed, the condition for the optimality of the myopic sensing time is obtained, and the performance upper bound of the myopic policy is derived.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the most critical aspects of today’s information society. Reducing energy consumption of electronic devices, circuits and systems, paired to improving energy generation, conversion, storage and management capabilities represent the biggest challenges that engineers and scientists operating in the electronics sector will have to face in the next decade. Solid-state devices, integrated circuits and systemsbased on these devices, have an increasingly pivotal role in all steps of the energy production and management pipeline. Advances in electronics have made it possible to increase the intelligence” of energy generation, conversion, distribution: we are now entering the era of smart power grids, smart energy consumption metering and monitoring, smart energy conversion ([1],[2],[3]). In these contexts, the term “smart” implies awareness of environmental conditions, coupled with the capability of suitably adapting system behaviour without direct andcontinuous human intervention. For instance, photovoltaic energy conversion can greatly benefit from adaptation to solar irradiation of the panel operating points, to maintain maximum power transfer from the PV panels to the electric plants under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Clearly, the cost of intelligence must be much lower than the advantages it brings in terms of increased efficiency, responsiveness, robustness. This implies non-trivial design choices and tradeoffs, which can be explored only with adequate design automation support. For instance, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) solutions are justified only when they produce an increase in the energy collected by a PV panel significantly greater than the energy theyconsume to monitor solar irradiation and to compute optimal panel operating point [4]. Quantitatively determining if an MPPT solution has a positive energy balance requires accurate modelling not only of the PV panel itself, but also of the energy conversion circuits and the mixed-signal circuits that monitor power transferand compute the optimal panel operating point. Robust and accurate modelling is only a facet of the problem: computer-aided design exploration/optimization is another, equally-important aspect, as the complexity of design solutions is such that manual exploration would be too slow, error-prone and expensive. The END project targets the development of innovative energy-aware design solutions and EDA technologies for next generations’ nanoelectronics circuits and systems, and the related energy generation, conversion and management systems. The ultimate objective of the END project is that of bringing such solutions andtechnologies into the product development processes of the industrial partners of the Consortium, thus enabling the design and manufacturing of the electronic circuits that will be at the basis of the green information society of the future. It is important to stress the fact that minimizing the power consumption of electronic devices and circuits themselves is only a partial objective, which may not coincide with the overreaching goal of increasingthe energy efficiency of systems and systems-of-systems where electronics plays the role of critical enablers. These complex systems generally include energy conversion and storage sub-systems where a marginal efficiency increase may be more than sufficient to justify a power budget to operate electronic devices that make it possible. In the past these sub-systems were designed in isolation and interfaced as commercial-off-theshelfcomponents, relying on human ingenuity and intuition to obtain efficient, if not optimal solutions. The END project will pursue the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>objective</b> through an innovative holistic approach, which combines research work in modelling, design and EDA technologies with strategic application drivers, whichwill serve both for requirement setting and concept demonstration. Distinguishing feature of the technology R&D approach followed within END is that it unifies under a common design platform the development of modelling, simulation, design and EDA techniques for devices and systems of different nature and purpose (digital blocks, analog/RF blocks, discrete components), as well as the conception and experimentation of new power supply systems, with particular emphasis on energy management aspects. This enables a synergic approach to energy-aware design, thus offering a comprehensive set of solutions covering the many different facets of the complex problem of accounting for energy effects during the design of heterogeneous circuits and systems, such as those that will be hosted by the electronic products of the future. Regarding the strategic application drivers, they will address domains in which energy {{efficiency is}} essential: Solar energy systems and wireless systems.

Finally, the simulation results figure out that we can achieve 30 % better <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> by trading the throughput by about 20 %. QC 20170410 </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} radio {{resource}} management is {{to satisfy the}} data rates that are requested by the users of a cellular network. The main resources are time intervals, frequency blocks, and transmit powers. Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> These <b>objectives</b> are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus {{there is a need}} for tight spatial frequency reuse which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. Multi-user MIMO techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive precoding. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.|$|R
40|$|Purpose :The study aims to {{quantify}} the possible interactions between the three European objectives in the horizon of 2020 : (i) the reduction of 20 % of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) (2) the saving of 20 % of the European energy consumption and (3) a share of 20 % of renewable energies in the overall energy consumption. Particular focus is, however, placed {{on the influence of}} the CO 2 emission reduction targets and on their consequences on the carbon price in 2020. Design/methodology/approach :In order to explore the interactions among the three European objectives and their induced effects, a number of scenarios are tested within a combination of two modeling tools : the POLES world energy model and ASPEN, an auxiliary model dedicated to the analysis of quota trading systems. With reasonable assumptions for the burden sharing among the Member States, the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>objectives</b> and the renewable energy targets are achieved using national quota systems in each European country (white and green certificate systems and their implicit prices), while the CO 2 emission reduction is carried out within the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in line with the objective of 20 % emission reduction. Findings :The paper shows, in particular, that the two quota policies (WC and GC) decrease significantly the European marginal emission reduction cost and consequently, the compliance costs for ETS participants. The high renewable target compliance cost could be reduced significantly if carbon price signal and energy saving policies are in place. The paper also shows that the sole carbon price signal has a limited influence for stimulating renewable energies and energy savings and thus concludes on the need for specific policies targeting these two areas.
