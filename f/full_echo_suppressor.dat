Because each <b>echo</b> <b>suppressor</b> will then detect voice energy coming from the far-end of the circuit, the effect would ordinarily be for loss to be inserted in both directions at once, effectively blocking both parties. To prevent this, <b>echo</b> <b>suppressors</b> can be set to detect voice activity from the near-end speaker and to fail to insert loss (or insert a smaller loss) when both the near-end speaker and far-end speaker are talking.

According to company founder Michael Birck, a group of six men with backgrounds in electrical engineering and sales drank coffee and brainstormed ideas for a new telecom company. They aimed to build a company that offered customers products and services that met their specific needs. After raising $110,000 in capital, they incorporated as Tellabs {{in the spring of}} 1975; the name combined the idea of telephones and laboratories. The start-up only had a one-man research department, a second-hand soldering iron picked up for $25, and an outdated oscilloscope. In a matter of months, Tellabs began making <b>echo</b> <b>suppressors,</b> which suppress annoying echoes on phone calls. During this time, the founding partners drew no salaries. The company went public in July 1980, ending the year with sales of $43.7 million. In September 1981, Tellabs introduced the industry's first echo canceller, an advance over the original <b>echo</b> <b>suppressors</b> that synthesized an echo and electronically subtracted it. By 1990, Tellabs had grown to 2,000 employees at 25 locations globally and sales of $211 million.|$|R

This system was in service throughout the 1980s. The voice ports used digitally implemented 24 kbit/s delta modulation with Voice Activity Compression (VAC) and <b>echo</b> <b>suppressors</b> to control the half second echo path through the satellite. They performed formal listening tests to verify the 24 kbit/s delta modulator achieved full voice quality with no discernible degradation as compared to a high quality phone line or the standard 64 kbit/s Âµ-law companded PCM. This provided an eight to three improvement in satellite channel capacity. IBM developed the Satellite Communications Controller and the voice port functions.|$|R

As an alternate of such hardware-based solutions, adaptive filter algorithms are widely being applied where apart from the input channel, a separate echo-free reference channel is required [3 â 13]. Among different adaptive filter algorithms, the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm and its different variants are very popular for their satisfactory performances and less computational burden [4, 10, 12 â 14]. Besides these algorithms, the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm is well-known for its fast convergence at the expense of computational complexity [13]. The adaptive filter algorithms have also been used for acoustic noise cancellation (ANC) [15].|$|R

40|$|The {{acoustic}} echo problem arises whenever there is acoustic coupling between a loudspeaker and a microphone, {{such as in}} a teleconference system. This problem is traditionally solved by using an {{acoustic echo}} canceler (AEC), which models the echo path with adaptive filters. Long adaptive filters are necessary for satisfactory echo cancellation, which makes AEC highly computationally complex. Recently, a low-complexity echo suppression scheme was presented, the perceptual acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>suppressor</b> (PAES). Spectral modification is used to suppress the echoes, and the complexity is reduced by incorporating perceptual theories. However, under ideal conditions AEC performs better than PAES. This thesis considers a hybrid system, which combines AEC and PAES. AEC is used to cancel low-frequency echo components, while PAES suppresses high-frequency echo components. The hybrid system is simulated and assessed, both through subjective listening tests and objective evaluations. The hybrid scheme is shown to have virtually the same perceived quality as a full-band AEC, while having a significantly lower complexity and {{a higher degree of}} robustness...|$|R
40|$|Telephone calls routed via {{satellite}} involve long transmission paths which in rurn require significant trans-mission times {{even at the}} speed of light.

The advent of satellite telephoning has brought with it some interesting and challenging questions about the measurement of telephone transmission quality. The traditional measures of voice circuit quality of signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, dis-tortion, etc., are not adequate to fully evaluate this new type of circuit.

By temporally segmenting the frequency bins {{of the residual}} signal spectrum into blocks and modelling the data in each block and each frequency bin as realizations of a random variable, we can compute the probability of presence of residual echo and derive an appropriate ML suppression rule based on this probability.

The proposed method shows better performance as compared to state of the art methods for residual echo suppression while producing no audible degradation in the near end signal and no musical noise.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{technology}} in recent decades has changed the whole dimension of communications. Today people {{are more interested in}} hands-free communication. In such a situation, the use a regular loudspeaker and a high-gain microphone, in place of a telephone receiver, might seem more appropriate. This would allow more than one person to participate in a conversation at the same time such as a teleconference environment. Another advantage is that it would allow the person to have both hands free and to move freely in the room. However, the presence of a large acoustic coupling between the loudspeaker and microphone would produce a loud echo that would make conversation difficult. Furthermore, the acoustic system could become instable, which would produce a loud howling noise to occur. The solution to these problems is the elimination of the echo with an echo suppression or echo cancellation algorithm. The <b>echo</b> <b>suppressor</b> offers a simple but effective method to counter the echo problem. However, the <b>echo</b> <b>suppressor</b> possesses a main disadvantage since it supports only half-duplex communication. Half-duplex communication permits only one speaker to talk at a time. This drawback led to the invention of echo cancellers. An important aspect of echo cancellers is that full-duplex communication can be maintained, which allows both speakers to talk at the same time. This objective of this research was to produce an improved echo cancellation algorithm, which is capable of providing convincing results. The three basic components of an echo canceller are an adaptive filter, a doubletalk detector and a nonlinear processor. The adaptive filter creates a replica of the echo and subtracts it from the combination of the actual echo and the near-end signal. The doubletalk detector senses the doubletalk. Doubletalk occurs when both ends are talking, which stops the adaptive filter in order to avoid divergence. Finally, the nonlinear processor removes the residual echo from the error signal. Usually, a certain amount of speech is clipped in the final stage of nonlinear processing. In order to avoid clipping, a noise gate was used as a nonlinear processor in this research. The noise gate allowed a threshold value to be set and all signals below the threshold were removed. This action ensured that only residual echoes were removed in the final stage. To date, the real time implementation of echo an cancellation algorithm was performed by utilizing both a VLSI processor and a DSP processor. Since there has been a revolution in the field of personal computers, in recent years, this research attempted to implement the acoustic echo canceller algorithm on a natively running PC {{with the help of the}} MATLAB software...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic echoes arise {{whenever}} there is acoustic coupling between a loudspeaker and a microphone. A traditional solution for eliminating the undesired echo signal is an acoustic echo canceler (AEC), which identifies the echo path between a loudspeaker and a microphone {{by means of}} an adaptive filter. The echo signal can be canceled successfully when the modeling filter approaches the true echo path. Another way to mitigate the echo effect is through echo suppression. Unlike an AEC, an acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>suppressor</b> (AES) achieves <b>echo</b> attenuation by means of spectral modification. In this paper, we propose an AES without a need for the computationally complex task of acoustic echo path estimation. Instead of identifying the echo path impulse response, the proposed method estimates only the properties of the echo path which are needed for effective echo suppression. These are a delay parameter and a filter mimicking the coloration effect of the echo path on the loudspeaker signal. The gain filter for the AES is computed using the estimated delay and coloration effect filter. Simulations and experiments using a real-time telecommunication system indicate that the proposed scheme is effective for suppressing echo, supports duplex communication, and is less sensitive to echo path changes than a conventional AEC. 1...|$|R
