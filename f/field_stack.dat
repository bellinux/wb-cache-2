50|$|In Britain (if small square bales {{are still}} to be used), they are usually {{collected}} as they {{fall out of the}} baler in a bale sledge dragged behind the baler. This has four channels, controlled by automatic mechanical balances, catches and springs, which sort each bale into its place in a square eight. When the sledge is full, a catch is tripped automatically, and a door at the rear opens to leave the eight lying neatly together on the ground. These may be picked up individually and loaded by hand, or they may be picked up all eight together by a bale grab on a tractor, a special front loader consisting of many hydraulically powered downward-pointing curved spikes. The square eight will then be stacked, either on a trailer for transport, or in a roughly cubic <b>field</b> <b>stack</b> eight or ten layers high. This cube may then be transported by a large machine attached to the three-point hitch behind a tractor, which clamps the sides of the cube and lifts it bodily.|$|E
5000|$|In North America, a stook {{may also}} {{refer to a}} <b>field</b> <b>stack</b> of six, ten or fifteen small (70 - 90 lb), {{rectangular}} bales of hay or straw. These bales may be stacked and deposited by a [...] "stooking machine" [...] or [...] "stooker" [...] that is dragged, sled-like, behind the baler. The stooking sled has four, five, or six fingers that hold the bales until the stook is complete. When the stook is complete the [...] "stacker" [...] steps on a lever to release the stook. The fingers drop {{to the ground and}} the finished stook slides off the fingers. The sled resets itself and is ready to be filled again. The bales are stacked on the diagonal to shed the rain and to minimise acquiring moisture from the ground before being picked up. An automatic bale stooker was eventually designed to eliminate the need for a person to manually stack and trip the stook-release. The automatic stooker is positioned behind the baler and collects released bales and sends them up an inclined shute. The bale falls through a series of bars into the [...] "3-2-1" [...] configuration. Once all six bales are in position the platform trips, drops the stook in the field, and automatically returns to the loading position. [...] Allied produced a model of stooked in the 1980s that can still be found across the countryside in Canada today.|$|E

40|$|Extract] The Australian Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) intiative awarded AuScope ([URL] 42. 8 {{million to}} support geoscience. AuScope will {{establish}} world-class infrastructure to characterise {{the structure and}} evolution of the Australian continent in a global context, from surface to core in space and time; and provide {{better understanding of the}} implications for natural resources, hazards and environment. The Earth Imagine and Structure (ANSIR) component of AuScope is focused on providing 3 D databases of geologically important regions, which will be achieved through the collection of GeoTransects. AuScope will collaborate with, and use the services of ANSIR to achieve this. In August 2007, the Far North Queensland (FNQ) Tasman Line project became the first AuScope Tranverse to be acquired. This survey links with the Ga/GSQ Isa-Georgetown-Charters Towers survey and together, provide an exceptional opportunity to image this important region of Australia crust in three-dimensions. FNQ best preserves the Tasman Line, which is the boundary between the Precambrian craton of Australia, and the Phanerozoic Tasmanides to the east. The correlation between the lithospheric-scale structures evident in the seismic tomography images with mapped surface structures from observed geology suggests that this region is ideal for investigating the relationship between major upper crustal province boundaries and major features observed in geophysical images. The FNQ AuScope Reflection Traverse will address important questions regarding the nature of continental growth in eastern Australia. The raw <b>field</b> <b>stack</b> indicates a significant change in Moho depth {{on either side of the}} Tasman Line, considerable coherent reflectivity within the middle crust and evidence of shallow mid-crustal structures. However, the seismic imaging does not indicate teh presence of a single major structure that corresponds with the Tasman Line.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{vortex structure}} and melting transition in very anisotropic layered superconductors at fields tilted {{with respect to}} the c-axis. We show that even a small in-plane field does not homogeneously tilt the vortex lattice but, instead, penetrates inside the superconductor in the form of Josephson vortices (JVs) similar to the Meissner state. At high c-axis magnetic field the phase field of the JV is built up from the phase perturbations created by displacements of pancake vortices. The crossing-lattices ground state leads to linear dependencies of the melting field and melting temperature on the in-plane field, in agreement with recent experimental observations. At small <b>fields</b> <b>stacks</b> of JVs accumulate additional pancake strings creating vortex rows with enhanced density. This mechanism explains the mixed chains-lattice state observed by Bitter decorations. Comment: 4 Pages, 2 Postscript figure...|$|R

40|$|So far {{extending}} light {{field rendering}} to dynamic scenes has been trivially treated as the rendering of static light <b>fields</b> <b>stacked</b> in time.

In this {{paper we propose a}} novel framework, space-time light field rendering, which allows continuous exploration of a dynamic scene in both spatial and temporal domain with unsynchronized input video sequences. In order to synthesize novel views from any viewpoint at any time instant, we develop a two-stage rendering algorithm. We first interpolate in the temporal domain to generate globally synchronized images using a robust spatial-temporal image registration algorithm followed by edge-preserving image morphing. We then interpolate those software-synchronized images in the spatial domain to synthesize the final view. Our experimental results show that our approach is robust and capable of maintaining photo-realistic results...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose to}} model complex visual scenes using a {{non-parametric}} Bayesian model learned from weakly labelled images abundant on media sharing {{sites such as}} Flickr. Given weak image-level annotations of objects and attributes without locations or associations between them, our model aims to learn the appearance of object and attribute classes {{as well as their}} association on each object instance. Once learned, given an image, our model can be deployed to tackle a number of vision problems in a joint and coherent manner, including recognising objects in the scene (automatic object annotation), describing objects using their attributes (attribute prediction and association), and localising and delineating the objects (object detection and semantic segmentation). This is achieved by developing a novel Weakly Supervised Markov Random <b>Field</b> <b>Stacked</b> Indian Buffet Process (WS-MRF-SIBP) that models objects and attributes as latent factors and explicitly captures their correlations within and across superpixels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our weakly supervised model significantly outperforms weakly supervised alternatives and is often comparable with existing strongly supervised models on a variety of tasks including semantic segmentation, automatic image annotation and retrieval based on object-attribute associations.

40|$|Differential magneto-optics {{are used}} to study the effect of dc {{in-plane}} magnetic field on hysteretic behavior due to geometrical barriers in Bi_ 2 Sr_ 2 CaCu_ 2 O_ 8 +δ crystals. In absence of in-plane field a vortex dome is visualized in the sample center surrounded by barrier-dominated flux-free regions. With in-plane <b>field,</b> <b>stacks</b> of Josephson vortices form vortex chains which are surprisingly found to protrude out of the dome into the vortex-free regions. The chains are imaged to extend up to the sample edges, thus providing easy channels for vortex entry and for drain of the dome through geometrical barrier, suppressing the magnetic hysteresis. Reduction of the vortex energy due to crossing with Josephson vortices is evaluated to be about two orders of magnitude too small {{to account for the}} formation of the protruding chains. We present a model and numerical calculations that qualitatively describe the observed phenomena by taking into account the demagnetization effects in which flux expulsion from the pristine regions results in vortex focusing and in the chain protrusion. Comparative measurements on a sample with narrow etched grooves provide further support to the proposed model. Comment: 12 figures (low res.)

Linear spin-wave theory fails because fluctuations have particularly large effects in the IC phase. An innovative phenomenological treatment of quantum fluctuations yields a plateau at approximately the observed value and the observed fields; it predicts a transition to the commensurate phase so far not observed.
