40|$|Object {{segmentation}} is {{an essential}} task in computer vision and object recognitions. In this paper, we present an image segmentation technique that extract edge information from wavelet coefficients and uses mathematical morphology to segment the image. We threshold the image to get its binary version and get a <b>high-pass</b> <b>image</b> by the inverse DWT of its high frequency subbands from the wavelet domain. This is followed by an adaptive morphological closing operation that dynamically adjusts the structuring element according to the local orientation of edges. The ensued holes are, subse-quently, filled by a morphological fill operation. For compar-ison, we are relying on the well-established Canny’s method and show that in special cases???, our method perform better. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of multiscale processing in digital chest radiography on automated detection of lung nodule with a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. The study involved 58 small-nodule patient cases and 58 normal cases. The 58 patient cases included a total of 64 noncalcified lung nodules up to 15  mm in diameter. Each case underwent an examination with a digital radiography system (Digital Diagnost, Philips Medical Systems), and the acquired image was processed by the following three types of multiscale processing (Unique Image Processing Package, Philips Medical Systems) respectively: (1) standard image from the default processing parameter (structure preference, 0. 0), (2) <b>high-pass</b> <b>image</b> with structure preference of 0. 4, (3) low-pass image with structure preference of − 0. 4. The CAD output images were produced with a real-time computer assistance system (IQQA™-Chest, EDDA Technology). Two experienced chest radiologists established the nodule gold standard by consensus reading according to computed tomography results, and analyzed and recorded the detection of lung nodules and false-positive detections of these CAD output images. For the entire cases involved (each case with three types of different processing), a total of 348 observations were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean area under the ROC curve (Az) value was 0. 700 for the standard images, 0. 587 for the high-pass images, and 0. 783 for the low-pass images. There were statistically significant Az values among these three types of processed images (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Multiscale processing in digital chest radiography can affect the automated detection of lung nodule by CAD, which is consistent with effects from visual inspection...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to take LANDSAT- 1 multispectral scanner digital data and use digital image processing techniques to highlight linears. Two computer processing techniques were used on the data: (1) two dimensional high-pass filtering of MSS bands 5, 6, and 7 and (2) the horizontal derivative of MSS band 6. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate structural reconnaissance of an arid area in southwestern Jordan. Interpretive analyses indicate that the structural pattern appears to be much more detailed and complex than indicated by presently available maps. The types of lines that were identifiable as lineaments include faults, joints, fractures, topographic crests, lithologic contacts, bedding traces and flexures. A noticeable difference between published maps and maps from the <b>high-pass</b> filtered <b>images</b> is the number of long lineaments that have never been mapped as faults. <b>High-pass</b> filtered <b>images</b> displayed the largest linears in various lithologies.

40|$|Abstract: An image {{classification}} method {{based on the}} lifting wavelet and PCA is proposed. First, several training images chosen from given classes are decomposed into low-pass and <b>high-pass</b> <b>images</b> by using wavelet transform. Applying PCA to all the low-pass images, principal component vectors are computed. The feature vectors of low-pass images are constructed by expanding the low-pass images {{with respect to the}} principal component vectors. The average of the obtained feature vectors in each class is calculated, and lifting parameters are learned so that the lifting feature vectors in each class approach to the average in the same class. Lifting low-pass images for training images are computed exploiting the learned parameters. PCA is applied again to these images for improving the feature vectors of training images. This process is repeated until the classes are separated sufficiently. Classification of a query image is accomplished by comparing its lifting feature vector with the feature vectors for training images. The validity of our method is checked using a benchmark data and object images captured by a robot camera. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Digital high-pass {{filtering}} is used {{frequently to}} enhance details in scientific, industrial, and military <b>images.</b> <b>High-pass</b> filtered (HPF) <b>images</b> also are used both to illustrate and test models of visual perception. The visual system appears to interpret HPF {{images in the}} context of a multiplicative model of high-frequency reflectance and low-frequency illumination whenever possible. HPF images can be treated as a form of two-dimensional amplitude modulation signals. The low-frequency information, which is coded in the modulation envelope, disappears with the carrier if low-pass filtered. The envelope may be retrieved (demodulated) using one of many possible nonlinear operations followed by a low-pass filter. The compressive nonlinearity ofthe visual system is shown to suffice for demodulating such images. Simulations show that HPF images cannot be used to reject the hypothesis that illusions and grouping phenomena are due to low-frequency channels.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine {{the influence of the}} spatial frequency content of natural images on saccadic size and fixation duration. In the first experiment 10 pictures of natural textures were low-pass filtered (0. 04 - 0. 76 cycles/deg) and high-pass filtered (1. 91 - 19. 56 cycles/deg) and presented with the unfiltered originals in random order, each for 10 s, to 18 participants, with the instruction to inspect them in order to find a suitable name. The participants' eye movements were recorded. It was found that low-pass filtered images resulted in larger saccadic amplitudes compared with <b>high-pass</b> filtered <b>images.</b> A second experiment was conducted with natural stimuli selected for different power spectra which supported the results outlined above. In general, low-spatial frequencies elicit larger saccades associated with shorter fixation durations whereas high-spatial frequencies elicit smaller saccades with longer fixation durations. ...|$|R

40|$|Recognizing {{objects that}} have {{undergone}} certain viewing transformations {{is an important}} problem {{in the field of}} computer vision. Most current research has focused almost exclusively on single aspects of the problem, concentrating on a few geometric transformations and distortions. Probably, the most important one is the affine transformation which may be considered as an approximation to perspective transformation. Many algorithms were developed for this purpose. Most popular ones are Fourier descriptors and moment based methods. Another powerful tool to recognize affine transformed objects, is the invariants of implicit polynomials. These three methods are usually called as traditional methods. Wavelet-based affine invariant functions are recent contributions to the solution of the problem. This method is better at recognition and more robust to noise compared to other methods. These functions mostly rely on the object contour and undecimated wavelet transform. In this thesis, a technique is developed to recognize objects undergoing a general affine transformation. Affine invariant functions are used, based on on <b>image</b> projections and <b>high-pass</b> filtered <b>images</b> of objects at projection angles. Decimated Wavelet Transform is used instead of undecimated Wavelet Transform.

40|$|The {{perception}} of the Müller-Lyer illusion has previously been explained {{as a result of}} visual low band-pass spatial filtering, although, in fact, the illusion persists in band-pass and <b>high-pass</b> filtered <b>images</b> without visible low-spatial frequencies. A new theoretical framework suggests that our perceptual experience about the global spatial structure of an image corresponds to the amplitude modulation (AM) component (or its magnitude, also called envelope) of its AM-FM (alternatively, AM-PM) decomposition. Because demodulation is an ill-posed problem with a non-unique solution, two different AM-FM demodulation algorithms were applied here to estimate the envelope of images of Müller-Lyer illusion: the global and exact Daugman and Downing (1995) AMPM algorithm and the local and quasi-invertible Maragos and Bovik (1995) DESA. The images used in our analysis include the classic configuration of illusion in a variety of spatial and spatial frequency content conditions. In all cases, including those of images for which visual low-pass spatial filtering would be ineffective, the envelope estimated by single-band amplitude demodulation has physical distortions in the direction of perceived illusion. It is not plausible that either algorithm could be implemented by the human visual system. It is shown that the proposed second order visual model of pre-attentive segregation of textures (or "back-pocket" model) could recover the image envelope and, thus, explain the {{perception of}} this illusion even in Müller-Lyer images lacking low spatial frequencies...|$|R
40|$|The Problem: The goal of {{this project}} is to detect {{passenger}} cars {{based on the results}} of several different component classifiers, each of which is trained only to recognize a small piece of a vehicle. We also hope to develop a component extraction process which can be generalized to other classes of objects. Motivation: Heisele [3, 4] was able to classify faces very accurately using a component-based approach and an SVM classifier. We want to extend that technique first to recognize cars, and then other objects. Cars were selected because intuitively, they would seem to have strong characteristic components. Recent work in Agarwal & Roth [1] suggests that a component-based approach is suitable for cars. Previous Work: In Papageorgiou and Poggio [7], cars were detected using overcomplete Haar wavelet features and a support vector machine classifier. Perona et. al. [9] applied a framework for unsupervised feature extraction, based on the use of an ”interest operator ” from [2] to select potentially useful feature regions from <b>high-pass</b> filtered <b>images.</b> After correlating and clustering potential features in the positive data set, features of sufficient cluster size were validated in terms of how well they predict the object within a statistical model. Schneiderman and Kanade [8] used features that were probability distributions on one or more levels of wavelet coefficients. Histograms of these single- or multi-level wavelet features were used in a statistical model to detect cars. In addition, separate detectors were trained to recognize eight different car orientations, so that by combining their results the syste...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-There are neurons in {{the cortex}} in the {{anterior}} {{part of the}} superior temporal sulcus of the macaque monkey with visual responses which would be useful for face recognition (Rolls, 1984; Baylis et al., 1985). To analyze further the information which leads them to respond, their responses were measured to parametrically filtered stimuli. The responses of 48 such single neurons were measured to faces which were digitized and were bandpass spatial frequency filtered. The octave width bands were 2 - 4. 4 - 88 - 16, 16 - 32, 32 - 64 and 64 - 128 cycles per image. It {{was found that the}} neurons could respond well to single octaves of the spatial frequencies normally present in faces, that the most effective bands were 4 - 8, 8 - 16 and 16 - 32 cycles per face (cpf), and that the bands 24 and 32 - 64 cpf were partly effective. In investigations of whether the responses of the neurons to an unfiltered face, and to low-pass and <b>high-pass</b> filtered <b>images</b> could be predicted by linear addition of their responses to each of the octave bands shown separately, {{it was found that the}} majority of the neurons were non-linear, and responded much less than predicted. It was also shown that this occurred even when the contrast was reduced to 0. 25 of that normally present in a face, so that the result was not due just to a ceiling effect of the maximum firing rate. These results help to define parametrically the aspects of the information normally present in a face which are sufficient to produce responses of these neurons to them, and show that linear operations cannot account for information processing in this part of the visual system.

40|$|International audienceThe visual {{perception}} of human faces by man is fast and efficient {{compared to that}} of other categories of objects. Using a saccadic choice task, recent studies showed that participants were able to initiate fast reliable saccades in just 100 - 110 ms toward an image of a human face, when this was presented alongside another image without a face. This extremely fast saccadic reaction time is barely predicted using classical models of {{visual perception}}. Thus, the present research investigates whether this result might be explained by the low spatial frequency content of images. Using the same paradigm, with two images simultaneously presented to the left or right visual fields, participants were asked to make a saccade towards a target image. The target was defined as an image belonging to one category: human face, animal or vehicle. The other image corresponded to the distractor and belongs to the other categories. We compared performance to saccade toward one category of target. The two images were displayed either in color, gray-level, low-pass filtered or high-pass filtered. As previous studies, we found that the shortest SRT was observed for saccades towards faces rather than towards animals or vehicles. Analysis of saccadic reaction time distributions showed that, in 130 - 140 ms, participants were able to make more correct than incorrect saccades towards faces for unfiltered (color and gray-level) and low-pass filtered images whereas they needed more time for <b>high-pass</b> filtered <b>images.</b> In contrast, the minimum time participants needed to correctly saccade towards animals and vehicles was longer for low-pass and high-pass filtered than for unfiltered images. The analysis of the image statistics in the Fourier domain revealed that the amplitude spectrum of faces was mainly contained in the low spatial frequencies. Consistent with a coarse-to-fine processing of visual information, our results suggest that extremely fast saccades towards faces could be initiated by low spatial frequencies...|$|R

Remote sensing from optical and radar sensors is essential {{in this type of}} application. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} compare the mapping of structural lineaments using Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) image and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data. The Landsat TM image was processed using IHS (Intensity, Hue, Saturation) transformation, principal component analysis (PCA) and directional <b>high-pass</b> filters. An <b>image</b> with slope direction was derived from the SRTM data. The structural lineaments were visually identified and mapped through the edit vector.

The results revealed that the SRTM data provide the best visualization of the linear features. In addition, these features were more efficiently mapped using Landsat TM images processed with IHS and PCA analyses than filtering, which is mostly due to the intense change in soil cover. A limitation of Landsat TM images for mapping of linear structures was the influence of the sunlight azimuth in the shadow directions. This limitation provides a map that might contain incomplete information about the ground. Pages: 3151 - 315...|$|R

The fast rotators in the outer parts of the Virgo Cluster rotate significantly faster than fast rotators in the inner parts of the cluster. Moreover, 10 out of the 11 slow rotators {{are located in the}} inner 3 degrees (D 1 Mpc) of the cluster.

40|$|Background and purpose: To {{determine}} whether iron deposition in deep brain nuclei assessed using high-pass filtered phase imaging {{plays a role}} in motor disease severity in Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Seventy patients with mild to moderate PD and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) underwent susceptibility-weighted imaging on a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Phase shifts (radians) in deep brain nuclei were derived from <b>high-pass</b> filtered phase <b>images</b> and compared between groups. Analysis of clinical laterality and correlations with motor severity (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III, UPDRS-III) were performed. Phase shifts (in radians) were compared between HVs and three PD subgroups divided according to UPDRS-III scores using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age and regional area. Results: Parkinson's disease patients had significantly (P < 0. 001) higher radians than HVs bilaterally in the putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra (SN). The SN contralateral to the most affected side showed higher radians (P < 0. 001) compared to the less affected side. SN radians positively correlated with UPDRS-III and bradykinesia-rigidity subscores, but not with tremor subscores. ancova followed by post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons revealed that SN radians were significantly greater in the PD subgroup with higher UPDRS-III scores compared to both lowest UPDRS-III PD and HV groups (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Increased nigral iron accumulation in PD appears to be stratified according to disease motor severity and correlates with symptoms related to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This semi-quantitative in vivo iron assessment could prove useful for objectively monitoring PD progression, especially in clinical trials concerning iron chelation therapies...|$|R
40|$|Waves can be {{observed}} in the transition region and upper chromosphere of sunspots. Two particular phenomena, running waves and umbral flashes, {{can be seen in the}} 1400 Å and 2796 Å bandpasses, respectively, on slit-jaw images from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). How running waves propagate through the solar atmosphere is still a topic of debate revolving around two theories. The trans-sunspot theory explains that these waves propagate radially across the sunspot from its center just as they appear visually. The upward propagating theory illustrates that these waves are tied to the magnetic field lines and are therefore slow magnetoacoustic waves, indicating that the observed apparent motion of the waves is not real. Previous studies focused on individual observations at a fixed viewing angle, leaving the results susceptible to line-of-sight bias. To test for this bias, we observed the leading sunspots of AR 11836 and AR 12546 as they traveled from the disk center to the western limb. To assess the two theories, we applied global wavelet analysis to our <b>high-pass</b> filtered slit-jaw <b>images</b> and were able to find the spatial distribution of dominate wave periods for both phenomena. We then compared the period distribution to magnetic field line inclinations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). From this, we find a clear correlation between magnetic field line inclination and wave period as both increase outward from the sunspot center. The period increases from 180 s from the sunspot center to 240 s near the edge of the penumbra for all of our viewing angles, nullifying the existence of a line-of-sight bias and lending credence to the upward propagating theory. The importance of discovering how these waves are moving through the solar atmosphere could provide a mechanism for transporting local seismic energy from the photosphere to the corona...|$|R

This sample {{is representative of the}} early-type population in the absolute magnitude range - 19. 0 <M_r <- 16. 0. For each dE, we measure the rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile and fit an analytic function to the rotation curve. We study the significance of the departure of the rotation curve from the best fit analytic function (poorly fit) and of the difference between the approaching and receding sides of the rotation curve (asymmetry). We find that 62 +/- 8 % (23 out of the 39) of the dEs have a significant anomaly in their rotation curve. Analysis of the images reveals photometric anomalies for most galaxies. However, there is no clear correlation between the significance of the photometric and kinematic anomalies.
