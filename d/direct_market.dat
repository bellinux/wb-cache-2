40|$|There {{appear to}} be some {{problems}} in defining <b>direct</b> <b>marketing.</b> Bauer and Miglautsch (1992) present <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> as a relational marketing process. According to Schofield (1995 : 36), "Such a definition excludes much marketing work which employs individual <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> techniques on a pragmatic and eclectic basis, alongside nondirect marketing elements, and in which {{the use of such}} techniques is normally seen as direct marketing". He suggests that two definitions may be needed: a general, inclusive definition of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing,</b> e. g. the DMA-definition, which allows any use of any <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> technique to be recognized as an instance of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing,</b> and a definition of a <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> system, e. g. Bauer and Miglautsch's definition, covering cases where a product or service is <b>marketed</b> exclusively by <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> methods (Schofield 1995 : 37). This distinction suggests that several levels of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> can be distinguished. The definition of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> as proposed by Raaijmaakers et al. (1992) allows for distinguishing several levels of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> without the need for more than one definition. They stress the importance of direct relationships and the specific use of marketing instruments. Based on their definition, four levels of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> can be distinguished (Hoekstra 1994). Three of them concern strategic decisions and one is at the operational level (see table 1). These types cover the ever broadening field of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing,</b> including the <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> system as well as the use of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> methods. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{defection}} is unobserved, latent attrition models {{provide useful}} insights about customer behavior and accurate forecasts of customer value. Yet extant models ignore <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> efforts. Response models incorporate {{the effects of}} <b>direct</b> <b>marketing,</b> but because they ignore latent attrition, they may lead firms to waste resources on inactive customers. We propose a parsimonious model that allows <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> to impact three relevant behaviors in latent attrition models—the frequency with which customers conduct transactions, {{the size of the}} transactions, and the duration for which customers remain active. Our model also accounts for how the organization targets its <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> across individuals and over time. Using donation data from a nonprofit organization, we find that <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> increases donation incidence for active donors. However, our analysis also shows that <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> has the potential to shorten the length of a donor's relationship. We find that our proposed model offers superior predictive performance compared with models that ignore the impact of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> activity or latent attrition. We demonstrate the managerial applicability of our modeling approach by estimating the impact of <b>direct</b> <b>marketing</b> on donation behavior and identifying those donors most likely to conduct transactions in the future...|$|R

These variants were commissioned directly by the retailers. Unlike most comics sold in the <b>direct</b> <b>market,</b> unsold copies of this issue could {{be returned to the}} publisher. This tactic allowed retailers to place higher orders without taking a financial risk. Estimated sales were just under 35,000 copies, making it the 61st best-selling comic book for the month. Due to re-orders, the issue sold out at the distributor level on the day of release. A second printing was announced the next day and was released on September 24, 2014, the same day as issue two. Including sales for the second printing, the first issue sold approximately 41,000 copies. In addition to the standard print version, a larger [...] "magazine" [...] version with eight additional pages of art was available for an extra cost. This version, which was not returnable, was estimated to have sold an additional 8300 copies. All told, The Fade Out #1 had better sales than anything Brubaker and Phillips had previously done together. Brubaker suspects the numbers were higher partly because they had developed a following, and partly because retailers had become more supportive of Image books in general.|$|E
