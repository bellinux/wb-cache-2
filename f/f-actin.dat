25|$|Cellular actin has two forms: monomeric {{globules}} called G-actin and polymeric filaments called <b>F-actin</b> (that is, as filaments {{made up of}} many G-actin monomers). <b>F-actin</b> {{can also}} {{be described as a}} microfilament.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} cytoskeleton {{may not be}} {{as complex}} as that found in eukaryotes; however, it contains proteins that are highly similar to actin monomers and polymers. The bacterial protein MreB polymerizes into thin non-helical filaments and occasionally into helical structures similar to <b>F-actin.</b> Furthermore, its crystalline structure is very similar to that of G-actin (in terms of its three-dimensional conformation), there are even similarities between the MreB protofilaments and <b>F-actin.</b> The bacterial cytoskeleton also contains the FtsZ proteins, which are similar to tubulin.|$|E
25|$|Phalloidin, is a toxin {{that has}} been {{isolated}} from the death cap mushroom Amanita phalloides. It binds to the interface between adjacent actin monomers in the <b>F-actin</b> polymer, preventing its depolymerization.|$|E
25|$|Other {{proteins}} that bind with actin cover {{the ends of}} <b>F-actin</b> in order to stabilize them, but {{they are unable to}} break them. Examples of this type of protein are CapZ (that binds the (+) ends depending on a cell’s levels of Ca2+/calmodulin. These levels depend on the cell’s internal and external signals and are involved in the regulation of its biological functions). Another example is tropomodulin (that binds to the (-) end). Tropomodulin basically acts to stabilize the <b>F-actin</b> present in the myofibrils present in muscle sarcomeres, which are structures characterized by their great stability.|$|E
25|$|Cytocalasin D, is an {{alkaloid}} {{produced by}} fungi, that binds to the (+) end of <b>F-actin</b> preventing {{the addition of}} new monomers. Cytocalasin D {{has been found to}} disrupt actin’s dynamics, activating protein p53 in animals.|$|E
25|$|A S1 {{fragment}} {{is composed}} {{of the head and}} neck domains of myosin II. Under physiological conditions, G-actin (the monomer form) is transformed to <b>F-actin</b> (the polymer form) by ATP, where the role of ATP is essential.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} actin {{filaments}} can be regulated by thymosin and profilin. Thymosin binds to G-actin to buffer the polymerizing process, while profilin binds to G-actin to exchange ADP for ATP, promoting the monomeric {{addition to the}} barbed, plus end of <b>F-actin</b> filaments.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{focusing}} on the accumulation and loss of subunits by microfilaments are carried out in vitro (that is, in the laboratory and not on cellular systems) as the polymerization of the resulting actin {{gives rise to the}} same <b>F-actin</b> as produced in vivo. The in vivo process is controlled by a multitude of proteins {{in order to make it}} responsive to cellular demands, this makes it difficult to observe its basic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Barrier Disruption: In {{isolates}} from Blastocystis sp. subtype 4, {{study has}} demonstrated that Blastocystis {{has the ability to}} alter the arrangement of <b>F-actin</b> in intestinal epithelial cells. Actin filaments are important in stabilizing tight junctions; they in turn stabilize the barrier, which is a layer of cells, between the intestinal epithelial cells and the intestinal content. The parasite causes the actin filaments to rearrange, and so compromising barrier function. This has been suggested to contribute to the diarrheal symptoms sometimes observed in Blastocystis patients.|$|E
25|$|Long-lasting {{changes in}} the {{efficacy}} of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, or LTP) between two neurons can involve the making and breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as activin ß-A, which encodes a subunit of activin A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The activin molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the <b>F-actin</b> cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spines are lengthened and the chance that they make synaptic contacts with the axonal terminals of the presynaptic cell is increased. The end result is long-term maintenance of LTP.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} of dendritic spines {{is particularly}} important in their synaptic plasticity; without a dynamic cytoskeleton, spines {{would be unable to}} rapidly change their volumes or shapes in responses to stimuli. These changes in shape might affect the electrical properties of the spine. The cytoskeleton of dendritic spines is primarily made of filamentous actin (<b>F-actin).</b> tubulin Monomers and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are present, and organized microtubules are present. Because spines have a cytoskeleton of primarily actin, this allows them to be highly dynamic in shape and size. The actin cytoskeleton directly determines the morphology of the spine, and actin regulators, small GTPases such as Rac, RhoA, and CDC42, rapidly modify this cytoskeleton. Overactive Rac1 results in consistently smaller dendritic spines.|$|E
25|$|Six autosomal-dominant point {{mutations}} {{in the sequence}} {{have been found to}} cause various types of hearing loss, particularly sensorineural hearing loss linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus. It seems that they affect the stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear’s Organ of Corti. β-actin is the most abundant protein found in human tissue, but it is not very abundant in ciliated cells, which explains the location of the pathology. On the other hand, it appears that the majority of these mutations affect the areas involved in linking with other proteins, particularly actomyosin. Some experiments have suggested that the pathological mechanism for this type of hearing loss relates to the <b>F-actin</b> in the mutations being more sensitive to cofilin than normal.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{proteins}} {{associated with the}} actin cytoskeleton in plants include: villin, which belongs to the same family as gelsolin/severin {{and is able to}} cut microfilaments and bind actin monomers in the presence of calcium cations; fimbrin, which is able to recognize and unite actin monomers and which is involved in the formation of networks (by a different regulation process from that of animals and yeasts); formins, which are able to act as an <b>F-actin</b> polymerization nucleating agent; myosin, a typical molecular motor that is specific to eukaryotes and which in Arabidopsis thaliana is coded for by 17 genes in two distinct classes; CHUP1, which can bind actin and is implicated in the spatial distribution of chloroplasts in the cell; KAM1/MUR3 that define the morphology of the Golgi apparatus as well as the composition of xyloglucans in the cell wall; NtWLIM1, which facilitates the emergence of actin cell structures; and ERD10, which is involved in the association of organelles within membranes and microfilaments and which seems to play a role that is involved in an organism’s reaction to stress.|$|E
25|$|Amastigotes of L. donovani enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and {{are found}} in {{phagocytic}} vacuoles that interact with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire lysosomal features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of <b>F-actin</b> and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the cell signalling pathway of the macrophages, such as down-regulating of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also by blocking the NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses.|$|E
500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the centrosome, and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient cytokinesis resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the basal body of cilia as cells resorb cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate site of action for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in tumor invasion. NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6–dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to <b>F-actin.</b> Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and tubastatin A in xenograft models of breast cancer leads to a {{decrease in the number of}} pulmonary metastases.|$|E
2500|$|The helical <b>F-actin</b> {{filament}} {{found in}} muscles {{also contains a}} tropomyosin molecule, which is a 40 nanometre long protein that is wrapped around the <b>F-actin</b> helix. During the resting phase the tropomyosin covers the actin’s active sites so that the actin-myosin interaction cannot take place and produce muscular contraction. [...] There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these are the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T and troponin C.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequencing}} of actin {{was completed by}} M. Elzinga and co-workers in 1973. The crystal structure of G-actin was solved in 1990 by Kabsch and colleagues. [...] In the same year, a model for <b>F-actin</b> was proposed by Holmes and colleagues following experiments using co-crystallization with different proteins. The procedure of co-crystallization with different proteins was used repeatedly during the following years, until in 2001 the isolated protein was crystallized along with ADP. However, {{there is still no}} high-resolution X-ray structure of <b>F-actin.</b> The crystallization of <b>F-actin</b> was possible due to the use of a rhodamine conjugate that impedes polymerization by blocking the amino acid cys-374. Christine Oriol-Audit died in the same year that actin was first crystallized but she was the researcher that in 1977 first crystallized actin in the absence of Actin Binding Proteins (ABPs). However, the resulting crystals were too small for the available technology of the time.|$|E
2500|$|The helical <b>F-actin</b> {{filament}} {{found in}} muscles {{also contains a}} tropomyosin molecule, a 40-nanometre protein that is wrapped around the <b>F-actin</b> helix. During the resting phase the tropomyosin covers the actin’s active sites so that the actin-myosin interaction cannot take place and produce muscular contraction (the interaction {{gives rise to a}} movement between the two proteins that, because it is repeated many times, produces a contraction). [...] There are other protein molecules bound to the tropomyosin thread, these include the troponins that have three polymers: troponin I, troponin T, and troponin C. Tropomyosin’s regulatory function depends on its interaction with troponin in the presence of Ca2+ ions.|$|E
2500|$|In between filopodia—much {{like the}} webbing of the hands—are the [...] "lamellipodia". These are flat regions of dense actin {{meshwork}} instead of bundled <b>F-actin</b> as in filopodia. [...] They often appear {{adjacent to the}} leading edge of the growth cone and are positioned between two filopodia, giving them a [...] "veil-like" [...] appearance. In growth cones, new filopodia usually emerge from these inter-filopodial veils.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{parallel}} <b>F-actin</b> strands must rotate 166 {{degrees to}} lie correctly {{on top of}} each other. This creates the double helix structure of the microfilaments found in the cytoskeleton. Microfilaments measure approximately 7 nm in diameter with the helix repeating every 37nm. [...] Each molecule of actin is bound to a molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) that is associated with a Mg2+ cation. The most commonly found forms of actin, compared to all the possible combinations, are ATP-G-Actin and ADP-F-actin.|$|E
2500|$|In vitro {{production}} {{takes place}} in a sequential manner: [...] first, there is the [...] "activation phase", when the bonding and exchange of divalent cations occurs in specific places on the G-actin, which is bound to ATP. This produces a conformational change, sometimes called G*-actin or <b>F-actin</b> monomer as it is very similar to the units that are located on the filament. This prepares it for the [...] "nucleation phase", in which the G-actin gives rise to small unstable fragments of <b>F-actin</b> that are able to polymerize. Unstable dimers and trimers are initially formed. The [...] "elongation phase" [...] begins when there are a sufficiently large number of these short polymers. In this phase the filament forms and rapidly grows through the reversible addition of new monomers at both extremes. Finally, a [...] "stationary equilibrium" [...] is achieved where the G-actin monomers are exchanged {{at both ends of the}} microfilament without any change to its total length. In this last phase the [...] "critical concentration Cc" [...] is defined as the ratio between the assembly constant and the dissociation constant for G-actin, where the dynamic for the addition and elimination of dimers and trimers does not produce a change in the microfilament's length. Under normal “in vitro” conditions Cc is 0.1 μM, which means that at higher values polymerization occurs and at lower values depolymerization occurs.|$|E
2500|$|The growth {{capacity}} of the axons lies in the microtubules which are located just beyond the actin filaments. Microtubules can rapidly polymerize into and thus “probe” the actin-rich peripheral region of the growth cone. [...] When this happens, the polymerizing ends of microtubules {{come into contact with}} <b>F-actin</b> adhesion sites, where microtubule tip-associated proteins act as [...] "ligands". Laminins of the basal membrane interact with the integrins of the growth cone to promote the forward movement of the growth cone. Additionally, axon outgrowth is also supported by the stabilization of the proximal ends of microtubules, which provide the structural support for the axon.|$|E
2500|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} widely {{found in all}} {{eukaryotic}} organisms. It is composed of seven subunits, some of which possess a topology that is clearly related to their biological function: two of the subunits, [...] "ARP2» and [...] "ARP3», have a structure {{similar to that of}} actin monomers. This homology allows both units to act as nucleation agents in the polymerization of G-actin and <b>F-actin.</b> This complex is also required in more complicated processes such as in establishing dendritic structures and also in anastomosis (the reconnection of two branching structures that had previously been joined, such as in blood vessels).|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of mammals possess six different actin genes. Of these, two code for the cytoskeleton (ACTB and ACTG1) {{while the other}} four are involved in skeletal striated muscle (ACTA1), smooth muscle tissue (ACTA2), intestinal muscles (ACTG2) and cardiac muscle (ACTC1). [...] The actin in the cytoskeleton {{is involved in the}} pathogenic mechanisms of many infectious agents, including HIV. The vast {{majority of}} the mutations that affect actin are point mutations that have a dominant effect, with the exception of six mutations involved in nemaline myopathy. This is because in many cases the mutant of the actin monomer acts as a “cap” by preventing the elongation of <b>F-actin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the growth}} cone can be easily described by using the hand as an analogy. The fine extensions {{of the growth}} cone are known as [...] "filopodia" [...] or microspikes. The filopodia are like the [...] "fingers" [...] of the growth cone; they contain bundles of actin filaments (<b>F-actin)</b> that give them shape and support. Filopodia are the dominant structures in growth cones, and they appear as narrow cylindrical extensions which can extend several micrometres beyond {{the edge of the}} growth cone. The filopodia are bound by membrane which contains receptors and cell adhesion molecules that are important for axon growth and guidance.|$|E
2500|$|<b>F-actin</b> is both {{strong and}} dynamic. Unlike other polymers, such as DNA, whose {{constituent}} elements are bound together with covalent bonds, the monomers of actin filaments are assembled by weaker bonds. The lateral bonds with neighbouring monomers resolve this anomaly, which in theory should weaken the structure {{as they can}} be broken by thermal agitation. In addition, the weak bonds give the advantage that the filament ends can easily release or incorporate monomers. This means that the filaments can be rapidly remodelled and can change cellular structure in response to an environmental stimulus. [...] Which, along with the biochemical mechanism by which it is brought about is known as the [...] "assembly dynamic".|$|E
2500|$|Microfilaments are {{involved}} in the movement of all mobile cells, including non-muscular types, and drugs that disrupt <b>F-actin</b> organization (such as the cytochalasins) affect the activity of these cells. Actin comprises 2% of the total amount of proteins in hepatocytes, 10% in fibroblasts, 15% in amoebas and up to 50-80% in activated platelets. There are a number of different types of actin with slightly different structures and functions. This means that α-actin is found exclusively in muscle fibres, while types β and γ are found in other cells. In addition, as the latter types have a high turnover rate the majority of them are found outside permanent structures. This means that the microfilaments found in cells other than muscle cells are present in two forms: ...|$|E
2500|$|Actin is {{a family}} of {{globular}} multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments. It is found in essentially all eukaryotic cells (the only known exception being nematode sperm), where it may be present at a concentration of over 100 μM. [...] An actin protein's mass is roughly 42-kDa, with a diameter of 4 to 7nm, {{and it is the}} monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells. It can be present as either a free monomer called G-actin (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called <b>F-actin</b> (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division.|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{expression}} modulation. Actin’s {{state of}} polymerization affects {{the pattern of}} gene expression. [...] In 1997, {{it was discovered that}} cytocalasin D-mediated depolymerization in Schwann cells causes a specific pattern of expression for the genes involved in the myelinization of this type of nerve cell. <b>F-actin</b> has been shown to modify the transcriptome in some of the life stages of unicellular organisms, such as the fungus Candida albicans. In addition, proteins that are similar to actin play a regulatory role during spermatogenesis in mice and, in yeasts, actin-like proteins are thought {{to play a role in}} the regulation of gene expression. In fact, actin is capable of acting as a transcription initiator when it reacts with a type of nuclear myosin that interacts with RNA polymerases and other enzymes involved in the transcription process.|$|E
2500|$|The growth cones are {{continually}} being built up through {{construction of the}} actin microfilaments and extension of the plasma membrane via vesicle fusion. The actin filaments depolymerize and disassemble on the proximal end to allow free monomers to migrate to the leading edge (distal end) of the actin filament where it can polymerize and thus reattach. Actin filaments are also constantly being transported away from the leading edge by a myosin-motor driven process known as retrograde <b>F-actin</b> flow. [...] The actin filaments are polymerized in the peripheral region and then transported backward to the transitional region, where the filaments are depolymerized; thus freeing the monomers to repeat the cycle. [...] This is different from actin treadmilling since the entire protein moves. [...] If the protein were to simply treadmill, the monomers would depolymerize from one end and polymerize onto the other while the protein itself does not move.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>F-actin</b> polymer is {{considered}} to have structural polarity {{due to the fact}} that all the microfilament’s subunits point towards the same end. This gives rise to a naming convention: the end that possesses an actin subunit that has its ATP binding site exposed is called the [...] "(-) end", while the opposite end where the cleft is directed at a different adjacent monomer is called the [...] "(+) end". [...] The terms [...] "pointed" [...] and [...] "barbed" [...] referring to the two ends of the microfilaments derive from their appearance under transmission electron microscopy when samples are examined following a preparation technique called [...] "decoration". This method consists of the addition of myosin S1 fragments to tissue that has been fixed with tannic acid. This myosin forms polar bonds with actin monomers, giving rise to a configuration that looks like arrows with feather fletchings along its shaft, where the shaft is the actin and the fletchings are the myosin. [...] Following this logic, the end of the microfilament that does not have any protruding myosin is called the point of the arrow (- end) and the other end is called the barbed end (+ end).|$|E
2500|$|The {{classical}} {{description of}} <b>F-actin</b> {{states that it}} has a filamentous structure that can be considered to be a single stranded levorotatory helix with a rotation of 166° around the helical axis and an axial translation of 27.5 Å, or a single stranded dextrorotatory helix with a cross over spacing of 350-380 Å, with each actin surrounded by four more. The symmetry of the actin polymer at 2.17 subunits per turn of a helix is incompatible with the formation of crystals, which is only possible with a symmetry of exactly 2, 3, 4 or 6 subunits per turn. Therefore, models have to be constructed that explain these anomalies using data from electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, crystallization of dimers in different positions and diffraction of X-rays. It {{should be pointed out that}} it is not correct to talk of a “structure” for a molecule as dynamic as the actin filament. In reality we talk of distinct structural states, in these the measurement of axial translation remains constant at 27.5 Å while the subunit rotation data shows considerable variability, with displacements of up to 10% from its optimum position commonly seen. Some proteins, such as cofilin appear to increase the angle of turn, but again this could be interpreted as the establishment of different [...] "structural states". These could be important in the polymerization process.|$|E
2500|$|The highly dynamic {{nature of}} growth cones {{allows them to}} respond to the {{surrounding}} environment by rapidly changing direction and branching in response to various stimuli. There are three stages of axon outgrowth, which are termed: protrusion, engorgement, and consolidation. [...] During protrusion, there is a rapid extension of filopodia and lamellar extensions along {{the leading edge of the}} growth cone. [...] Engorgement follows when the filopodia move to the lateral edges of the growth cone, and microtubules invade further into the growth cone, bringing vesicles and organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Finally, consolidation occurs when the <b>F-actin</b> at the neck of the growth cone depolymerizes and the filopodia retract. [...] The membrane then shrinks to form a cylindrical axon shaft around the bundle of microtubules. [...] One form of axon branching also occurs via the same process, except that the growth cone “splits” during the engorgement phase. This results in the bifurcation of the main axon. An additional form of axon branching is termed collateral (or interstitial) branching;.Collateral branching, unlike axon bifurcations, involves the formation of a new branch from the established axon shaft and is independent of the growth cone at the tip of the growing axon. In this mechanism, the axon initially generates a filopodium or lamellipodium which following invasion by axonal microtubules can then develop further into a branch extending perpendicular from the axon shaft. Established collateral branches, like the main axon, exhibit a growth cone and develop independently of the main axon tip.|$|E
50|$|Although coronin {{is present}} in almost all {{eukaryotic}} organisms and has different functions, these proteins have all been shown to bind <b>F-actin</b> and localize in the dynamic <b>F-actin</b> rich area of cells. Recent study shows that coronin prefers ATP/ADP-Pi containing <b>F-actin</b> over ADP containing <b>F-actin,</b> which might explain their unique cellular localization.|$|E
50|$|PtdIns(4,5)P2 {{regulates the}} organization, polymerization, and {{branching}} of filamentous actin (<b>F-actin)</b> via direct binding to <b>F-actin</b> regulatory proteins.|$|E
50|$|Anillin {{specifically}} binds <b>F-actin,</b> {{rather than}} G-actin. Binding of <b>F-actin</b> by anillin only occurs during cell division. Anillin is also bundles actin filaments together. Amino acids 258-340 are sufficient and necessary for <b>F-actin</b> binding in Drosophila, but amino acids 246-371 {{are necessary to}} bundle actin filaments. The ability of anillin to bind to and bundle actin together is conversed through many species. It is hypothesized that by regulating actin bundling, anillin increases the efficiency of actomyosin contractility during cell division. Both anillin and <b>F-actin</b> are found in contractile structures. They are recruited independently to the contractile ring, but <b>F-actin</b> increases the efficiency of anillin targeting. Anillin may also be involved in promoting the polymerization of <b>F-actin</b> by stabilizing formin mDia2 in an active form.|$|E
