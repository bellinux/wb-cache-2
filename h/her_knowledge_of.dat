5|$|In the {{interests}} of accuracy, Heyer once purchased a letter written by the Duke of Wellington {{so that she could}} precisely employ his style of writing. She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken or written by him in real life. <b>Her</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide <b>her</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about <b>her</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E

5|$|Although Stowe {{describes}} Minnah and Judy {{with some}} tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave {{owned by the}} captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues {{to work for him}} following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. <b>Her</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the ship and its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere her opinion in all matters.|$|E

5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that <b>her</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Barrucand {{dispatched}} Eberhardt {{to report}} on the aftereffects of the 2September 1903 Battle of El-Moungar. She stayed with French Foreign Legion soldiers and met Hubert Lyautey, the French officer in charge of Oran, at their headquarters. Eberhardt and Lyautey became friends and, due to <b>her</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Islam and Arabic, she became a liaison between him and the local Arab people. While Eberhardt never ceased protesting against any repressive actions undertaken by the French administration, she believed that Lyautey's approach, which focused on diplomacy rather than military force, would bring peace to the region. Although details are unclear, it is generally accepted that Eberhardt also engaged in espionage for Lyautey. Concerned about a powerful marabout in the Atlas Mountains, Lyautey sent her to meet with him in 1904.|$|E

5|$|When President Lincoln finally {{issued the}} Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, Tubman {{considered}} it {{an important step}} toward the goal of liberating all black men, women, and children from slavery. She renewed her support for a defeat of the Confederacy, and before long she was leading a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. The marshes and rivers in South Carolina {{were similar to those}} of the Eastern Shore of Maryland; thus <b>her</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> covert travel and subterfuge among potential enemies were put to good use. Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants. She later worked alongside Colonel James Montgomery, and provided him with key intelligence that aided the capture of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
