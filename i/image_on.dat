5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire.

40|$|In this article, a {{new method}} for {{segmentation}} and restoration of <b>images</b> <b>on</b> two-dimensional surfaces is given. Active contour models for image segmentation are extended to <b>images</b> <b>on</b> surfaces. The evolving curves on the surfaces are mathematically described using a parametric approach. For image restoration, a diffusion equation with Neumann boundary conditions is solved in a postprocessing {{step in the}} individual regions. Numerical schemes are presented which allow to efficiently compute segmentations and denoised versions of <b>images</b> <b>on</b> surfaces. Also topology changes of the evolving curves are detected and performed using a fast sub-routine. Finally, several experiments are presented where the developed methods are applied on different artificial and real <b>images</b> defined <b>on</b> different surfaces...|$|R

5|$|Ecgbert {{was named}} to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the {{appointment}} to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to deal with problems that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government.
