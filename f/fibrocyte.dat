The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether alveolar <b>fibrocytes</b> are detected in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL), to identify their prognostic value, and their potential association with culture of fibroblasts from BAL. METHODS: We quantified <b>fibrocytes</b> in BAL from 26 patients with IPF, 9 patients with Systemic Sclerosis(SSc) -interstitial lung disease (ILD), and 11 controls. BAL cells were cultured to isolate alveolar fibroblasts. RESULTS: <b>Fibrocytes</b> were detected in BAL in 14 / 26 IPF (54 %) and 5 / 9 SSc patients (55 %), and never in controls. <b>Fibrocytes</b> were in median 2. 5 % [0. 4 - 19. 7] and 3. 0 % [2. 7 - 3. 7] of BAL cells in IPF and SSc-ILD patients respectively. In IPF patients, the number of alveolar <b>fibrocytes</b> was correlated with the number of alveolar macrophages and was associated with a less severe disease but not with a better outcome. Fibroblasts were cultured from BAL in 12 / 26 IPF (46 %), 5 / 9 SSc-ILD (65 %) and never in controls. The detection of BAL <b>fibrocytes</b> did not predict a positive culture of fibroblasts.

In this study, the {{presence of}} <b>fibrocytes</b> was investigated immunohistochemically in kidney biopsy specimens from 100 patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, 6 patients with thin basement membrane disease were studied as a disease control. In patients with chronic kidney disease, the infiltration of <b>fibrocytes</b> was observed mainly in the interstitium. The number of interstitial <b>fibrocytes</b> in patients with chronic kidney disease was higher than that in patients with thin basement membrane disease. The number of infiltrated <b>fibrocytes</b> in the interstitium correlated well with the severity of tubulointerstitial lesions, such as interstitial fibrosis, in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, there were significant correlations between the number of interstitial <b>fibrocytes</b> and the number of CD 68 -positive macrophages in the interstitium as well as urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 /CCL 2 levels. In particular, there was an inverse correlation between the number of interstitial <b>fibrocytes</b> and kidney function at the time of biopsy. Finally, the numbers of interstitial <b>fibrocytes</b> and macrophages as well as urinary CCL 2 levels were significantly decreased during convalescence induced by glucocorticoid therapy.

50|$|Connective {{tissue cells}} are {{typically}} {{divided into two}} types, fixed cells and wandering cells. Fibrocytes, or fibroblasts and fat cells(adipocytes) are fixed cells, where as macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and mast cells are wandering cells.Fibrocytes {{are the most common}} cell type in connective tissues. If fibrocytes are stimulated by damage to the surrounding tissue, the <b>fibrocyte</b> is altered into a fibroblast. The fibroblasts contain organelles that are necessary for the synthesis and excretion of proteins needed to repair the tissue damage. Fibrocytes usually do not leave the connective tissue. Reticular cells are usually larger than fibrocytes. Reticular cells are the fibrocytes of reticular connective tissue and form a network of reticular fibers. Adipocytes are fat cells that are fixed cells in loose connective tissue. Their main function is the storage of lipid. Macrophages arise from monocytes. Monocytes originate in the bone marrow upon which they are released into the blood stream. They are mobile and leave the blood stream to enter connective tissues where they differentiate into marcophages.The fibroblasts are the most important in the connective tissue. Fibroblasts manufacture and maintain the extracellular material. They migrate throughout the extracellular matrix to wherever they are needed. Adipocytes are cells that are very efficient at storing energy in the form of triglycerides.|$|E

We previously puri-fied the factor in serum, which inhibits <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation, and identified it as serum amyloid P (SAP). As SAP binds to Fc receptors for immuno-globulin G (IgG; FcRs), FcR activation may be an inhibitory signal for <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. FcR are activated by aggregated IgG, and we find aggregated but not monomeric, human IgG inhibits human <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. Monoclonal anti-bodies that bind to FcRI (CD 64) or FcRII (CD 32) also inhibit <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation.

The ability to discriminate between monocytes, macrophages, <b>fibrocytes,</b> and fibroblasts in fibrotic lesions could be beneficial in identifying therapies that target either stromal fibroblasts or <b>fibrocytes.</b> We have identified markers that discriminate between human peripheral blood monocytes, tissue macrophages, <b>fibrocytes,</b> and fibroblasts. Amongst these four cell types, only peripheral blood monocytes express the combination of CD 45 RO, CD 93, and S 100 A 8 /A 9; only macrophages express the combination of CD 45 RO, 25 F 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, and PM- 2 K; only <b>fibrocytes</b> express the combination of CD 45 RO, 25 F 9, and S 100 A 8 /A 9, but not PM- 2 K; and only fibroblasts express the combination of CD 90, cellular fibronectin, hyaluronan, and TE- 7. These markers are effective both in vitro and in sections from human lung. We found that markers such as CD 34, CD 68, and collagen do not effectively discriminate between the four cell types. In addition, IL- 4, IL- 12, IL- 13, IFN-gamma, and SAP differentially regulate the expression of CD 32, CD 163, CD 172 a, and CD 206 on both macrophages and <b>fibrocytes.</b> Finally, CD 49 c (alpha 3 integrin) expression identifies a subset of <b>fibrocytes,</b> and this subset increases with time in culture.

40|$|Abstract Background In healing wounds, some monocytes {{enter the}} wound and {{differentiate}} into fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes. Since Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are present on monocytes, and pathogens that can infect a wound have and/or release TLR agonists, we examined whether TLR agonists affect <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. Results When human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) were cultured with TLR 3, TLR 4, TLR 5, TLR 7, TLR 8 or TLR 9 agonists, {{there was no}} significant effect on <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation, even though enhanced extracellular tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α accumulation and/or increased cell surface CD 86 or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II levels were observed. However, all TLR 2 agonists tested inhibited <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation without any significant effect on cell survival. Adding TLR 2 agonists to purified monocytes had no effect on <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. However, some TLR 2 agonists caused PBMCs to secrete a factor that inhibits the differentiation of purified monocytes into fibrocytes. This factor is not interferon (IFN) -α, IFN-γ, interleukin (IL) - 12, aggregated immunoglobulin G (IgG) or serum amyloid P (SAP), factors known to inhibit <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. TLR 2 agonist-treated PBMCs secrete low levels of IL- 6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and tumor growth factor β 1, but combinations of these factors had no effect on <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation from purified monocytes. Conclusions Our results indicate that TLR 2 agonists indirectly inhibit <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation and that, for some TLR 2 agonists, this inhibition involves other cell types in the PBMC population secreting an unknown factor that inhibits <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation.

To do so, we isolated <b>fibrocytes</b> expressing CD 45, CD 11 b, CD 13, and Col 1 a 1 from the lungs of wild type (WT) and Ccr 52 / 2 mice.

40|$|Excessive NaCl intake is {{associated}} with a variety of fibrosing diseases such as renal and cardiac fibrosis. This association has been attributed to increased blood pressure as the result of high NaCl intake. However, studies in patients with high NaCl intake and fibrosis reveal a connection between NaCl intake and fibrosis that is independent of blood pressure. We find that increasing the extracellular concentration of NaCl to levels that may occur in human blood after high-salt intake can potentiate, in serum-free culture conditions, the differentiation of freshly-isolated human monocytes into fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes. NaCl affects the monocytes directly during their adhesion. Potassium chloride and sodium nitrate also potentiate <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. The plasma protein Serum Amyloid P (SAP) inhibits <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. High levels of extracellular NaCl change the SAP Hill coefficient from 1. 7 to 0. 8, and cause a four-fold increase in the concentration of SAP needed to inhibit <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation by 95 %.

40|$|Immune cells such as {{neutrophils}} and monocytes enter tissues after {{tissue damage}} and clear cell debris to allow repair cells such as fibroblasts {{to close the}} wound. Monocytes also differentiate into fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes to mediate wound healing, similar to fibroblasts. However, in abnormal wound healing such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fibrosing diseases, the accumulation of immune cells such as neutrophils or fibrocytes become detrimental to health. In ARDS, neutrophils accumulate in the lungs and causes additional damage by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). In fibrosing diseases, increased <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation {{is one of the}} causes that increase extracellular matrix deposition, which leads to severe scar tissue build up. Since there are no effective treatments for ARDS or fibrosing diseases, understanding the regulation of neutrophil activation or <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation could be helpful to develop new effective therapies. 	The Gomer lab has found several factors that either promote or inhibit <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. The pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL- 4 and IL- 13 potentiate <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation while the plasma protein serum amyloid P (SAP), crosslinked IgG, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL- 12 inhibit <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation.

40|$|Previous {{reports have}} {{identified}} a circulating pool of CD 45 (+) collagen I+ CXCR 4 (+) (CD 45 (+) Col I(+) CXCR 4 (+)) cells, termed <b>fibrocytes,</b> that traffic to areas of fibrosis. No {{studies have demonstrated that}} these cells actually contribute to fibrosis, however. Pulmonary fibrosis was originally thought to be mediated solely by resident lung fibroblasts. Here we show that a population of human CD 45 (+) Col I(+) CXCR 4 (+) circulating <b>fibrocytes</b> migrates in response to CXCL 12 and traffics to the lungs in a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Next, we demonstrated that murine CD 45 (+) Col I(+) CXCR 4 (+) <b>fibrocytes</b> also traffic to the lungs in response to a bleomycin challenge. Maximal intrapulmonary recruitment of CD 45 (+) Col I(+) CXCR 4 (+) <b>fibrocytes</b> directly correlated with increased collagen deposition in the lungs. Treatment of bleomycin-exposed animals with specific neutralizing anti-CXCL 12 Ab's inhibited intrapulmonary recruitment of CD 45 (+) Col I(+) CXCR 4 (+) circulating <b>fibrocytes</b> and attenuated lung fibrosis. Thus, our results demonstrate, we believe for the first time, that circulating <b>fibrocytes</b> contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Scleroderma (SSc) is an {{autoimmune}} {{connective tissue}} disease of unknown aetiology. Pulmonary involvement including {{the development of}} pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterised by vascular remodelling, collagen deposition and expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). CD 14 + monocytes can differentiate into spindle shaped cells termed ‘fibrocytes’. Fibrocytes express haematopoietic and mesenchymal markers including collagen, and amplify inflammatory/immune responses via antigen presentation and chemokine secretion. <b>Fibrocyte</b> differentiation is enhanced by fibrogenic cytokines including PDGF. The role fibrocytes play in promoting PAH in SSc is unknown. Methods CD 14 + PBMCs were isolated from SSc and healthy donor blood. <b>Fibrocyte</b> differentiation {{in the presence of}} MCSF and/or ET- 1 was assessed after 14 days. The effect of endothelin receptor (ETR) antagonists (selective/dual) on <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation (n = 6) was investigated. SSc and control <b>fibrocyte</b> secretomes were assessed by ELISA (n = 6), and the effects on fibroblast-mediated gel contraction determined. Results MCSF and ET- 1 alone and in combination induced <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation (P < 0. 05). SSc fibrocytes exhibited enhanced differentiation from CD 14 + PBMCs than healthy control donors in response to MCSF (P < 0. 05), ET- 1 (P < 0. 05) and in combination (P < 0. 01). ETR antagonists BQ 123 (ETRA), BQ 788 (ETRB) and Bosentan (ETRA/B) inhibited MCSF induced <b>fibrocyte</b> differentiation. CTGF secretion was elevated in SSc compared to control fibrocytes (P < 0. 05) cultured with MCSF. Conditioned media from SSc fibrocytes promoted gel contraction by control pulmonary fibroblasts (P < 0. 05). Discussion CD 14 + SSc PBMCs readily differentiate into fibrocytes in response to ET- 1 and MCSF via ETRA and ETRB. Our data suggests fibrocytes {{contribute to the development of}} PAH in SSc via a paracrine mechanism modulating the functional activities of resident tissue fibroblasts...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{processes}} that drive fibrotic diseases {{are complex and}} include an influx of peripheral blood monocytes that can differentiate into fibroblast-like cells called <b>fibrocytes.</b> Monocytes can also differentiate into other cell types, such as tissue macrophages. The ability to discriminate between monocytes, macrophages, <b>fibrocytes,</b> and fibroblasts in fibrotic lesions could be beneficial in identifying therapies that target either stromal fibroblasts or <b>fibrocytes.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: We have identified markers that discriminate between human peripheral blood monocytes, tissue macrophages, <b>fibrocytes,</b> and fibroblasts. Amongst these four cell types, only peripheral blood monocytes express the combination of CD 45 RO, CD 93, and S 100 A 8 /A 9; only macrophages express the combination of CD 45 RO, 25 F 9, S 100 A 8 /A 9, and PM- 2 K; only <b>fibrocytes</b> express the combination of CD 45 RO, 25 F 9, and S 100 A 8 /A 9, but not PM- 2 K; and only fibroblasts express the combination of CD 90, cellular fibronectin, hyaluronan, and TE- 7. These markers are effective both in vitro and in sections from human lung. We found that markers such as CD 34, CD 68, and collagen do not effectively discriminate between the four cell types. In addition, IL- 4, IL- 12, IL- 13, IFN-c, and SAP differentially regulate the expression of CD 32, CD 163, CD 172 a, and CD 206 on both macrophages and <b>fibrocytes.</b> Finally, CD 49 c (a 3 integrin) expression identifies a subset of <b>fibrocytes,</b> and this subset increases with time in culture. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that discrimination of monocytes, macrophages, <b>fibrocytes,</b> and fibroblast...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increased {{numbers of}} bone marrow?derived {{progenitor}} cells, known as <b>fibrocytes,</b> populate the peripheral circulation, orbit, and thyroid {{of patients with}} Graves' disease (GD). These cells have been implicated {{in the development of}} thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. They can differentiate into myofibroblasts or adipocytes, produce inflammatory cytokines, and remodel tissue. This study sought to determine whether thyrotropin (TSH) and CD 40 ligand (CD 40 L), implicated in the pathogenesis of GD, induce interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) in human <b>fibrocytes.</b> Materials and Methods: IL- 12 protein concentrations and mRNA levels were measured by Luminex and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Flow cytometry assessed intracellular IL- 12 concentrations. Vector containing IL- 12 p 40 promoter was transfected into cultured <b>fibrocytes,</b> and promoter activity was monitored using luciferase assay. Results: TSH and CD 40 L stimulated intracellular IL- 12 protein accumulation in peripheral blood <b>fibrocytes.</b> Inhibiting Akt and nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) activity diminished IL- 12 expression in <b>fibrocytes,</b> while TSH did not induce promoter activity. TSH-mediated IL- 12 production required de novo synthesized proteins and augmented IL- 12 mRNA stability. IL- 12 production mediated by CD 40 L required tumor necrosis factor receptor?associated factor 6. Conclusion: TSH and CD 40 L induce IL- 12 expression in <b>fibrocytes,</b> and Akt and NF-?B mediate this activity. Given the importance of IL- 12 in immune function, its production by <b>fibrocytes</b> may promote an inflammatory immune response and tissue remodeling in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy...|$|R
