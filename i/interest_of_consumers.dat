Examples of utility types regulated by the ICC include electric, natural gas, telecommunications, water, and sewer. The ICC also regulates certain transportation activities, including railroad safety, towing, trucking, and household goods moving.|$|E
5000|$|Antel {{enjoys a}} state-enforced {{monopoly}} forcing consumers who require non-wireless Internet access (i.e. ADSL or fiber - cable Internet is outlawed) to purchase it directly from Antel. Its practices {{provide insight into}} the probable behavior of ISPs in markets that have little or no competition and/or lack balancing regulations in the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers.</b> All of Antel's Internet access plans for consumers are either capped or throttled. Capped plans are typically marketed under the brand [...] "Flexible". On such plans once a user reaches a data tier (e.g. 5 GB) additional data usage is billed at a rate of approximately 5 $US/GB. Once a second tier is reached (e.g., 15 GB), Internet services are suspended until the start of the next billing cycle. Throttled plans are typically marketed under the brand [...] "Flat Rate" [...] (for ADSL) and [...] "Vera" [...] (for fiber.) Such plans allow full bandwidth on the connection (e.g. 20 Mbit/s down on the Vera fiber plan) {{from the beginning of the}} billing month but are restricted to a percentage of the contracted transmission rate (e.g., to 2Mbit/s down, or 10% of the advertised speed) once a data tier (e.g. 150 GB) is reached. Full bandwidth capability is restored at the beginning of the next billing month.|$|E
5000|$|In Case E-2/97 Mag Instruments a {{parallel}} importer purchased Maglite flashlights in California, {{where they were}} manufactured, and imported them into Norway without the manufacturer’s and trade mark owner’s consent. According to established Norwegian law, international exhaustion applied to trade marks. The EFTA Court held that under the First Trade Mark Directive 89/104/EEC, the EFTA States were entitled to opt for the international exhaustion of trade mark rights. The Court emphasized that they retained their sovereignty in foreign trade matters. Unlike the EC Treaty, the EEA Agreement did not establish a customs union, but an enhanced free trade area. The purpose and {{the scope of the}} EC Treaty and the EEA Agreement are therefore different. According to Article 8 EEA, the principle of free movement of goods as laid down in Articles 11 to 13 EEA applies only to goods originating in the EEA, while in the Community a product is in free circulation once it has been lawfully placed on the market in a Member State. In general, the latter applies {{in the context of the}} EEA only with respect to products originating in the EEA. In the case at hand, the product was manufactured in the United States and imported into Norway. Accordingly, it was not subject to the principle of the free movement of goods within the EEA. Based on this, the EFTA Court rejected the argument put forward by the governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom as well as by the European Commission that giving the EEA/EFTA States the right to opt for international exhaustion would lead to disparities in the EEA market. Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was interpreted so that it was for the EEA/EFTA States’ legislatures and courts to decide whether they wanted to introduce or to maintain the principle of international exhaustion of trade mark rights with regard to goods originating from outside the EEA. The EFTA Court found that international exhaustion was in the interest of free trade and competition and thus in the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers.</b> Furthermore, the principle of international exhaustion was in line with the main function of a trade mark, to allow the consumer to identify with certainty the origin of the products. This interpretation of Article 7(1) of the Trade Mark Directive was also consistent with the TRIPs Agreement, which left the issue open for the Member States to regulate.|$|E
