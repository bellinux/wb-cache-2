5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.|$|E

Clint Eastwood expressed interest in {{taking part in the}} film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively.

500|$|Goffman {{explains}} that the way a conversation is keyed is critical to understanding the intent behind many utterances in everyday speech. Key is probably best understood as {{the tone of the}} dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. Signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, “special brackets will have to be introduced should <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to say something in a relatively serious way: [...] "Kidding aside," [...] "Now, I'm really serious about this," [...] and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words.” ...|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to start}} of {{production}} on the show, Hillenburg decided early that he wanted SpongeBob SquarePants to be a storyboard-driven show, rather than script-driven.

[...] Hillenburg originally wanted [...] "a team of young and hungry people" [...] to work on the show. The group, who worked with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life before, consisted of Alan Smart, Nick Jennings, and Derek Drymon.

500|$|The first {{crisis to}} occur on Conant's watch was the {{uprising}} of 1953 in East Germany. This brought the reunification {{issue to the}} fore. Konrad Adenauer's deft handling of the issue enabled him to handily win re-election as [...] Chancellor of West Germany in September, but this also strengthened his hand in negotiations with Conant. Adenauer did not want his country to become a bargaining chip between the United States and the Soviet Union, nor did <b>he</b> <b>want</b> it to become a nuclear battlefield, a prospect raised {{by the arrival of}} American tactical nuclear weapons in 1953 as part of the Eisenhower administration's New Look policy. Conant lobbied for the European Defense Community, which would have established a pan-European military. This seemed to be the only way that German rearmament would be accepted, but opposition from France killed the plan. In what Conant considered a minor miracle, France's actions cleared the way for West Germany to become part of NATO with its own army.|$|E

[...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers.

500|$|In 1998, {{the project}} {{was taken over by}} Franchise Pictures, a {{recently}} established company whose head, Elie Samaha, a former dry cleaning mogul turned nightclub owner, specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha's approach made waves in Hollywood, earning him a reputation of being able to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were [...] "often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads". As Samaha put it, [...] "I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to get paid?' … Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.'" [...] He learned of Battlefield Earth from Cassian Elwes, an agent at the theatrical agency William Morris, and approached Travolta. A deal was soon struck and financing was arranged; Travolta significantly reduced his normal fee of $20million, lowering the film's cost from the $100million that had previously been forecast, and costs were reduced further by using Canadian locations and facilities.|$|E

He explained, [...] "I would hate to think our imagination is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about." [...] The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be}} a greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E

What does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> with chanting these liturgies all the time?" [...] On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: [...] "unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm." [...] On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for [...] "steel", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward: ...|$|E
