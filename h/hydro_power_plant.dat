5|$|Power {{supply in}} Romblon is {{generated}} by the National Power Corporation (NPC) and serviced by two electric cooperatives. Tablas Island Electric Cooperatives (TIELCO) serves the power needs of Tablas Island including San Jose. It operates a 5.070 MW diesel power plant in Odiongan and 1.740 MW power barge in San Agustin. The electric cooperative serves a total of 21,097 house connections. Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) supplies the capital town of Romblon through a 1.720 MW diesel power plant and a 1.30 MW power barge. It also serves Sibuyan Island using a 3.006 MW diesel power plant in San Fernando. ROMELCO has 5,288 house connections in Romblon and 5,150 house connections in the three municipalities located in Sibuyan Island or a total of 10,438 house connections in their franchise area. Additionally, ROMELCO installed in 2010 a mini <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in Cantigas, San Fernando, producing 900kW of power. Meanwhile, Banton, Concepcion and Corcuera are attended to by the National Power Corporation (NPC) thru their municipal governments.|$|E
