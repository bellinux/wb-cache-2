[...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels. It is legitimately great storytelling that is not only highly entertaining, but incredibly thought provoking as well.

Freda continued to boom after 1918, but its limited market prevented any other growth away from the copper industry.|$|R
500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground {{received}} positive reviews from country and bluegrass music critics. [...] Allmusic called it [...] "fantastic", and JamBase described {{it to be}} [...] "a tasteful string dinner" [...] and stated that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of great things to come". However, some critics found particular tracks to {{pale in comparison to}} the rest of the material. The Arizona Republic stated that the album was [...] "amazing", except for [...] "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" [...] because [...] "Thile [...] quite match Jack White's musical hysteria". Music Box also said that tracks like [...] "Stay Away" [...] and [...] "I’m Yours If You Want Me" [...] "completely fell flat". Regardless, the review still stated that [...] "the bulk of How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is remarkably engaging". Bullz-Eye criticized Thile's vocal quality, saying that [...] "his voice often lacks the strength and/or character to carry the song". On the contrary, the previously mentioned JamBase article complimented Thile's vocal strength, saying [...] "it's the soul in Thile's voice and the heart and intensity of the musicianship that give the album its power." ...|$|E

Emptiness is undisturbed by any subjective element". According to Hakuin, this rank <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of Zen insight, but it can become a trapping for people who take the absolute to be the end-station: [...] "Although inside and out may be perfectly clear {{as long as you}} are hidden away in an unfrequented place where there is absolute quiet and nothing to do, yet you are powerless as soon as perception touches upon different worldly situations, with all their clamor and emotion, and you are beset by a plethora of miseries".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2001, Tarkan {{became the}} first Pepsi {{spokesperson}} in Turkey. This preceded the release of his album Karma {{and for the first}} time two singles in his domestic market in the same year: [...] "Kuzu Kuzu" [...] ("Like A Lamb") and [...] "Hüp" [...] ("Whoop"). Although Karma was not released worldwide, it was distributed in large shipments to Russia, where he had become the largest-selling non-Russian pop star. A million copies shipped to other areas of Europe, including Denmark. His so-called Karma-era style projected an image totally different from his earlier persona in respect to both music and looks. His appearance – tight trousers, loose, unbuttoned shirts or tight T-shirts – and his new hairdo set a trend among young Turkish men, who started to copy his looks. According to hairdressers, his Kuzu Kuzu hairstyle is still the most frequently requested style in the salons of Turkey. During this time he met Michael Lang, co-organiser of the Woodstock Festival, who became his international manager. According to Lang: [...] "Tarkan is a great singer and his performance is great. His current success <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> in my opinion. He'll be a star in five-year's time and he will not fade away. Know this, he is here to stay.
