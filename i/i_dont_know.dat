The writing in the diaries is very personal and informal, and was never intended for publication. Clark was extremely homesick, and longed to see {{his wife and}} son, writing as early as {{the second day of the}} voyage: [...] "Oh my God all my hoppes [...] are over of seeing my beloved wife and son". Like many of his fellow officers, he was aggrieved at the level of comfort and support offered to the convicts, noting [...] "I believe few Marines or Soldiers going out on a foreign Service under Government were ever better, if so well provided for as these Convicts are". On arrival in Botany Bay, Clark was dismayed at the unsuitable conditions, which were far from what had been promised in England: [...] "if we are obliged to settle here there will not a soul be alive in the course of a year". With the site for settlement subsequently moved to Sydney Cove, Clark remained distressed by the living conditions experienced by himself and his fellow officers, expressing in a letter to his family in England: [...] "I never slept worse, my dear wife, than I did last night, what with the hard cold ground, spiders, ants and every vermin you can think of was crawling over me". During the colony's early years, little food was produced, and the rations brought from England were soon consumed, leaving the colony in near starvation. Clark wrote [...] "God help us. If some ships dont [...] arrive, <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>know</b> what will". Supplies finally arrived in June 1790, on Lady Juliana.|$|E

6000|$|For {{a moment}} she stared at him, and then, [...] "I did know," [...] she said, {{suddenly}} beginning to cry. [...] "How can I tell you? It is a lie. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> all the time." ...|$|R

60|$|Answ. Truly this doth {{seem very}} strange, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> full well, {{to the natural}} man, to him that is yet in his unbelief, because he goeth by beguiled reason; but for my part, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> it is so, and shall labour also to {{convince}} thee of {{the truth of the}} same.|$|R

"Ben-Ahmed, I {{told you}} the truth at first. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> where she is hiding. <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> indeed, <b>know</b> some time ago, but the place of her abode has been changed, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> now. <b>I</b> may as well however say at once that, if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know,</b> nothing {{that you can do}} would induce me to tell you where she hides.

5000|$|Bishop Walsh {{said he was}} [...] "quite {{uncomfortable with}} this kind of public trial. I’d have to ask, is it about healing for {{survivors}} or is it about the desire that we need to get a head on a plate?" [...] He admitted in a radio interview, that he hadn’t had time to examine the report in detail [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> for a fact, some of the interpretation put on that and being placed against Bishop Murray is a misreading of the report. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> that from somebody who has read in detail the report and I am satisfied with that." ...|$|R

60|$|Perhaps it was {{the mystery}} which hung about her that kept her in my mind. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> where she was. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> how she fared. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> what sort of a man it was whom she had {{preferred}} to me. That, it struck me, was {{the crux of the}} matter. She had vanished absolutely with another man whom I had never seen and whose very name <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> had been beaten by an unseen foe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Conolly, relaxing. [...] "Come now, I {{can tell}} you that easily enough. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>know</b> what it is, but I know what it does, and I can lay traps to catch it. Here now, for instance----" ...|$|E
