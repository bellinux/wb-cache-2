40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prices of}} fossil fuels during the last decades have sparked increasing interest and investments in wind power plants to expand their share of electricity production and improve windmill technology with new and more economical inventions and sustainable solutions. A RFCS (research fund for coal and steel) research project called HISTWIN has the aim to improve the competitiveness of the windmill towers made of steel. The towers for high power wind generators often consist of several cylindrical slightly tapered steel segments connected by bolted flanges. This is a traditional and well established solution. One {{part of the project}} is to examine if a friction connection can be used instead of the traditional flange connection, because the friction connection will introduce two mprovements: it is expected to have higher fatigue class, leading to less steel consumption and the tower will be faster to assemble. The proposed friction connection is a lap connection bolted with tension control bolts, TC-bolts. One plate of the connection has normal sized holes while the other plate has long open slots. This solution is expected to reduce the total cost of the tower with at least 10 %. The main objective of this report is to establish structural characteristics of static behavior and the <b>ks</b> <b>factor</b> for this type of connection according to Eurocode and to investigate the performance of TC-bolts in the connection. The <b>ks</b> <b>factor</b> is a factor that reduces the slip resistance for friction connections in EN 1993 - Part 1 - 8 regarding size of holes used in the connection. There are no specific rules for long open slots in EN 1993 - Part 1 - 8 which are used in the proposed connection. Another aim of this report is to evaluate different ways to control the preload. The objective is to evaluate properties of TC-bolts and its competitiveness. The <b>ks</b> <b>factor</b> is evaluated from four groups of specimens. The tested specimens have two types of surfaces and have three different configurations of bolt placement in the specimens. Design of the tower connections are done with the experimentally obtained <b>ks</b> <b>factor</b> for a lap connection and comparison is made with an ordinary flange connection. The results in this report shows that the use of TC-bolts is a very competitive method to control the preload with respect to speed of installation, and that the bolts perform well under various conditions and treatments. The experiments done in this report shows that the proposed connection has a <b>ks</b> <b>factor</b> equal to 0, 75 as the connections are prevented from in-plane rotation, this can be compared with the <b>ks</b> <b>factor</b> for long slotted holes which is equal to 0, 63. Economical calculations show that if a lap connection with long open slots is used instead of an ordinary flange connection, the cost will be reduced by more than 85 % per connection in a wind tower. These calculations are done with respect to price of flanges and bolts provided by HISTWIN partners. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

5000|$|In {{transportation}} engineering, the <b>K</b> <b>factor</b> {{is defined}} as the proportion of annual average daily traffic occurring in an hour.This factor is used for designing and analyzing the flow of traffic on highways.

In the two-phase units, gas is separated from the liquid with the gas and liquid being discharged separately. Oil and gas separators are mechanically designed such that the liquid and gas components are separated from the hydrocarbon steam at specific temperature and pressure according to Arnold et al (2008). In three-phase separators, well fluid is separated into gas, oil, and water with the three fluids being discharged separately. The gas-liquid separation section of the separator {{is determined by the}} maximum removal droplet size using the Souders-Brown equation with an appropriate <b>K</b> <b>factor.</b> The oil-water separation section is held for a retention time that is provided by laboratory test data, pilot plant operating procedure, or operating experience.

The sizing methods by <b>K</b> <b>factor</b> and retention time give proper separator sizes.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} plane-parallel ion chambers in high-energy photon beams through measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. Methods: Ten plane-parallel ion chamber types {{were obtained from the}} major ion chamber manufacturers. Absorbed dose-to-water calibration coefficients are measured for these chambers and <b>k</b> Q <b>factors</b> are determined. In the process, the behaviors of the chambers are characterized through measurements of leakage currents, chamber settling in cobalt- 60, polarity and ion recombination behavior, and long-term stability. Monte Carlo calculations of the absorbed dose to the air in the ion chamber and absorbed dose to water are obtained to calculate <b>k</b> Q <b>factors.</b> Systematic uncertainties in Monte Carlo calculated <b>k</b> Q <b>factors</b> are investigated by varying material properties and chamber dimensions. Results: Chamber behavior was variable in MV photon beams, especially with regard to chamber leakage and ion recombination. The plane-parallel chambers did not perform as well as cylindrical chambers. Significant differences up to 1. 5 were observed in calibration coefficients after a period of eight months although <b>k</b> Q <b>factors</b> were consistent on average within 0. 17. Chamber-to-chamber variations in <b>k</b> Q <b>factors</b> for chambers of the same type were at the 0. 2 level. Systematic uncertainties in Monte Carlo calculated <b>k</b> Q <b>factors</b> ranged between 0. 34 and 0. 50 depending on the chamber type. Average percent differences between measured and calculated <b>k</b> Q <b>factors</b> were - 0. 02, 0. 18, and - 0. 16 for 6, 10, and 25 MV beams, respectively. Conclusions: Excellent agreement is observed on average at the 0. 2 level between measured and Monte Carlo calculated <b>k</b> Q <b>factors.</b> Measurements indicate that the behavior of these chambers is not adequate for their use for reference dosimetry of high-energy photon beams without a more extensive QA program than currently used for cylindrical reference-class ion chambers. 9 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.
