We used 16 emus, 12 adults, six of them were males and six females. Only four of emus analyzed were young. Were collected randomly, two wings and two feathers of the base of the neck of each animal, which were placed in plastic bags. Later, lice were counted, preserved in jars with alcohol 70 ºGL and sent to the Laboratory of Animal Health of Federal University of Piauí for identification. In samples obtained from adult emus, met a total of 77 lice, and the incidence of the wing feathers collected, 84. 4 % (65), significantly higher than in the feathers of the lower neck, 15. 6 % (12). No lice were found in young animals born in brooder.

Wherefore, <b>Darwin</b> <b>s</b> reticence about efficient cause does not disturb us. He considers only the scientific questions.

We wonder that any thoughtful observer of the course of investigation and of speculation in science should not have foreseen it, and have learned at length to take its inevitable coming patiently; the more so, as in Darwins treatise it comes in a purely scientific form, addressed only to scientific men.

60|$|So long as {{universal}} cataclysms were in vogue, and {{all life}} {{upon the earth}} was {{thought to have been}} suddenly destroyed and renewed many times in succession, such a view could not be thought of. So the equivalent view maintained by Agassiz, and formerly, we believe, by DOrbigny, that irrespectively of general and sudden catastrophes, or any known adequate physical cause, there has been a total depopulation at the close of each geological period or formation, say forty or fifty times or more, followed by as many independent great acts of creation, at which alone have species been originated, and at each of which a vegetable and an animal kingdom were produced entire and complete, full-fledged, as flourishing, as wide-spread, and populous, as varied and mutually adapted from the beginning as ever afterward--such a view, of course, supersedes all material connection between successive species, and removes even the association and geographical range of species entirely out of the domain of physical causes and of natural science. This is the extreme opposite of Wallaces and <b>Darwin</b> <b>s</b> view, and is quite as hypothetical. The nearly universal opinion, if we rightly gather it, manifestly is, that the replacement of the species of successive formations was not complete and simultaneous, but partial and successive; and that along the course of each epoch some species probably were introduced, and some, doubtless, became extinct. If all since the tertiary belongs to our present epoch, this is certainly true of it: if to two or more epochs, then the hypothesis of a total change is not true of them.|$|R

New genetic combinations {{can arise}} from hybridization, leading to offspring sometimes {{able to adapt}} to different niches than their parental species. I wanted to study beak morphology in Italian sparrow and house sparrow in a contact zone in the Alps, where they interbreed. This contact zone is situated in an ecotone, so I also investigated if climatic factors could affect beak size or beak shape. I used a geometric morphometrics approach, with landmarks from photos, to investigate if {{there are differences between}} the two species and their hybrids in this zone. The results revealed a pattern of intermediacy for the hybrids in beak size and in one dimension of beak shape. Another dimension of beak shape is transgressive in hybrids, that is outside the range of their parents. I show that there is a significant association between genetic admixture and beak size and also the first dimension of beak shape. Moreover, beak size variation is also significantly associated with environmental variation. The transgressive dimension of beak shape was also affected by environment, but not by genetic admixture. This may indicate that different factors and selection pressures affect beak morphology, including environment and genetic admixture. Cline analysis was used to infer selection on the beak. Steep clines were found for beak size and the intermediate dimension of beak shape; beak size having the steepest cline. Generation time estimates, assuming neutral diffusion, based on the widths of the cline analysis, were much lower than the likely age of the hybrid zone, indicating strong selection on beak size and shape in the hybrid zone. Selection coefficients indicate low fitness for intermediates. Overall, my results imply strong selection on beak size and shape.

These individuals formed a monophyletic clade with high bootstrap support basal to S. mollis and S. belli.

40|$|Noncoding {{regulatory}} variants play {{a central}} role in the genetics of human diseases and in evolution. Here we measure allele-specific transcription factor binding occupancy of three liver-specific transcription factors between crosses of two inbred mouse strains to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying transcription factor binding variations in mammals. Our results highlight the pre-eminence of cis-acting variants on transcription factor occupancy divergence. Transcription factor binding differences linked to cis-acting variants generally exhibit additive inheritance, while those linked to trans-acting variants are most often dominantly inherited. Cis-acting variants lead to local coordination of transcription factor occupancies that decay with distance; distal coordination is also observed and may be modulated by long-range chromatin contacts. Our results reveal the regulatory mechanisms that interplay to drive transcription factor occupancy, chromatin state, and gene expression in complex mammalian cell states.
