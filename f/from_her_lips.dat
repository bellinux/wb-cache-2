[...] Let her seek her associates at the North, and with them commingle, but let us put a check to such mischievous views as fell <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> last November, sentiments unworthy of {{a resident of the}} State, and in direct rebellion against our Constitution." [...] he wrote.|$|E
60|$|The smile {{died away}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> Her tone became very earnest.|$|E
60|$|This {{time the}} laugh which broke <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> was {{scarcely}} natural.|$|E
6000|$|... "What ails you, child?" [...] she asked. For {{a moment}} the girl {{suffered}} the caress; almost she seemed to nestle closer to the Dowager's shoulder. Then, as if understanding {{had come to her}} suddenly, she drew back and quietly disengaged herself from the other's arms. Her tears ceased; the quiver passed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R
60|$|Angela {{had already}} {{acquired}} a very slight amount of broken English, which tumbled neatly <b>from</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|The gaiety {{suddenly}} faded <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face. <b>Her</b> <b>lips,</b> {{which had}} been curved in laughter, quivered.|$|R
6000|$|... "You had it <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> that I had NOT ill-treated her; and at {{the same}} time another had it <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> that I HAD ill-treated her? My mother was no {{impulsive}} woman who changed her opinion every hour without reason. How can it be, Venn, that she should have told such different stories in close succession?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} {{cigarette}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{and her voice}} trembled a little.|$|E
60|$|A little cry of pain broke <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> She {{recovered}} herself almost immediately.|$|E
60|$|At {{that the}} {{laughter}} leapt <b>from</b> <b>her</b> young <b>lips,</b> and turned him {{hot and cold}} as he stood awkwardly before her.|$|R
60|$|The same nervous staccato laugh broke <b>from</b> <b>her</b> thin <b>lips,</b> and <b>her</b> fingers {{began to}} play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.|$|R
6000|$|Woman. Oh, listen, listen! What sweet sounds <b>from</b> <b>her</b> fast-closed <b>lips</b> are welling, As {{from the}} caverned shaft, deep miners' songs? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her steadfastly, and somehow the laugh died away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{the smile}} faded <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and {{the anxiety of}} a sudden thought possessed her.|$|E
60|$|The {{words had}} barely fallen <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> before Herbert returned. He was {{followed}} by Sydney Westerfield.|$|E
60|$|The lioness was {{overhauling}} us rapidly. She {{was swimming}} silently, her chin just touching the water, but blood was streaming <b>from</b> between <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> It {{was evident that}} her lungs were pierced.|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped and}} sank {{back into a}} chair, her breath coming heavily <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{twitching}} <b>lips,</b> the unnoticed tears falling <b>from</b> <b>her</b> staring, pitiful, wild, appealing eyes, her hands nervously twisting her gloves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, thank God," [...] {{answered}} Mrs Frog, {{returning to}} the meal as though she feared that some one might still snatch it <b>from</b> <b>her</b> thin <b>lips</b> before she got it all down.|$|R
60|$|Swanhild thought. Twice {{her breath}} went <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> in great sighs. Then she stood, pale and silent.|$|E
60|$|While {{she spoke}} {{a torrent of}} blood burst <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> Eleanor disappeared, and almost {{immediately}} Godfrey awoke.|$|E
60|$|A little moan {{of despair}} crept out <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> She {{covered her face}} with her hands and sobbed.|$|E
60|$|Eunice {{tried to}} speak, but only an indistinct murmur came <b>from</b> <b>her</b> bloodless <b>lips.</b> The sound made Christopher look up. Something {{in her face}} irritated him. He pushed back his chair impatiently.|$|R
60|$|Instinctively {{the girl}} held back, {{and then the}} mucker, true to his training, true to himself, gave her arm a sudden twist that {{wrenched}} a scream of agony <b>from</b> <b>her</b> white <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|As Mrs Laker was robed in her night-gown, {{and stood}} erect, {{with her arms}} {{extended}} and her hair dishevelled, she looked dreadfully tragic and awful, while these fearful words flowed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> pale <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before I {{could answer}} there came <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> such {{a torrent of}} indignation as I had never heard before.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not look}} at me, but the smile faded <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> Her eyes were still fixed {{steadily}} ahead.|$|E
60|$|Elisabeth {{followed}} her mother. At the last moment, Maraton caught a little whisper which only just floated <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|He turned {{round and}} walked back towards the door. James {{followed}} hurriedly, edging himself in front. He saw Irene take <b>her</b> finger <b>from</b> before <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> heard <b>her</b> say something in her ordinary voice, and began to speak before he reached them.|$|R
60|$|At that {{scarcely}} covert avowal of {{his passion}} she recoiled a step as she might before a thing unclean. The little colour faded <b>from</b> <b>her</b> cheek, the scorn departed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> and a sickly, deadly fear overspread her lovely face. God! that I should {{stand there and}} witness this insult to the woman I adored and worshipped with a fervour that the Church seeks to instil into us for those about the throne of Heaven. It might not be. A blind access of fury took me. Of the consequences I thought nothing. Reason left me utterly, and the slight hope that might lie in temporising was disregarded.|$|R
60|$|It {{was miserable}} {{to hear this}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> poor mad <b>lips,</b> though it was no surprise.|$|R
60|$|As {{the last}} words fell <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> the cottage door was thrust open. My father--followed by the bailiff--entered the room.|$|E
60|$|She stammered, and {{her eyes}} were piteous and pleading, but his will {{dominated}} her and wrung <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> the reluctant speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "Francesco," [...] said Valentina, and {{the name}} came <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{as if it were}} an endearment, [...] "why that frowning, careÂ­worn look?" ...|$|E
50|$|In 1999, a 41-year-old female {{resident}} of New York City {{went in to}} her doctor complaining of the sensation of something moving in her mouth. She said she had had the feeling {{for the duration of}} one year. Supposedly, she had removed worms <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mouth on two separate occasions- one <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> and one <b>from</b> <b>her</b> gums. She submitted one of the specimens for microscopic identification, and it was found to be an adult female G. pulchrum worm. She traveled frequently to visit relatives in Mississippi, so it is unknown whether she contracted the worm in New York or in the south. This was the first reported case of Gongylonema in the United States since 1963.|$|R
60|$|She smiled, and <b>her</b> teeth shone <b>from</b> <b>her</b> scarlet <b>lips</b> {{with a more}} {{familiar}} expression than he had seen on her face before. Some wall of reserve had melted away, and they chatted on with growing freedom.|$|R
60|$|For {{a single}} wild moment Tavernake hesitated. She {{was so close}} to him that her hair touched his forehead, the breath <b>from</b> <b>her</b> upturned <b>lips</b> fell upon his cheeks. Her blue eyes were half pleading, half inviting.|$|R
