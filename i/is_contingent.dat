5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists <b>is</b> <b>contingent.</b> Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

Bars and clubs are prohibited from having a 'ladies' night' or any pricing which is regarded as discriminatory. Police officers are prohibited from working for licensed businesses in the same town where they are employed, and some municipalities require fingerprinting for all liquor store and bar employees.|$|E

25|$|Nietzsche {{claimed the}} death of God would {{eventually}} lead {{to the loss of}} any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of objective truth. Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge <b>is</b> <b>contingent</b> and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests. This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives. This view has acquired the name perspectivism.|$|E

One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E

25|$|Contrastingly, Rabinow {{defines the}} {{contemporary}} as a (re)assemblage of both {{old and new}} elements and their interactions and interfaces. This means, among other things, that contemporary problems and objects are emergent and consequently, by definition, contingent. Emergence refers to “a state in which multiple elements combine to produce an assemblage, whose significance cannot be reduced to prior elements and relations.” It follows that the History of the Present, while often helpful, is not fully adequate {{to work on the}} contemporary because by definition the contemporary <b>is</b> <b>contingent.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since the {{religious}} {{status of a}} kohen <b>is</b> <b>contingent</b> upon being the male biological descendant of Aaron in conjunction with numerous other variables that {{are not subject to}} genetic testing (the wife of a kohen cannot have had relations with a non-Jew, be a divorcee etc.) the possession of a common haplotype does not provide sufficient evidence to confer or maintain {{the religious}} status of a kohen, which depends on more than simple heredity. This loss of priestly status over time may account for the 1.5% of non-kohen Jews who very closely match the Y chromosome sequence that is most common amongst kohanim.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Debates between contingentists and inevitabilists contest {{whether the}} results of {{successful}} science <b>are</b> <b>contingent</b> or inevitable. This paper addresses lingering ambiguity in the way contingency is defined in these debates. I argue that contingency in science {{can be understood as}} a collection of distinct concepts, distinguished by how they hold science contingent, by what elements of science they hold contingent, and by what those elements <b>are</b> <b>contingent</b> upon. I present a preliminary taxonomy designed to characterize the full range positions available and illustrate that these constitute a diverse array, rather than a spectrum. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Kant sorted {{statements}} {{into two}} types: the analytic and the synthetic. The analytic are true by their terms' arrangement and meanings—thus are tautologies, merely logical truths, true by necessity—whereas the synthetic arrange meanings {{to refer to}} factual states, which <b>are</b> <b>contingent.</b> Yet a class of synthetic statements <b>was</b> <b>contingent</b> but, through the mind, true by necessity. [...] Thus discovering the synthetic a priori, Kant precariously saved both physics—at the time Newtonian—and metaphysics, but incidentally discarded scientific realism and developed transcendental idealism, which triggered German idealism, including G F W Hegel's absolute idealism.|$|R
