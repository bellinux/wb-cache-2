The morphology of diamond nanostructures is a close function of the initial phase composition of diamond. Cone-shaped and tip-shaped diamond nanostructures result for microcrystalline diamond (MCD) and nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films, whereas pillarlike and grasslike diamond nanostructures are obtained for Ar-plasma-based and N 2 -plasma-based ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films, respectively.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in the previous paper that UV-Photon irradiation significantly enhances the oxidation of tritium gas (HT) in an oxygen atmosphere. To understand the mechanisms of this effect, we studied the pressure dependence of this reaction. The oxidation rate was determined by measuring the amount of tritiated water formed as a function of irradiation time by use of a conventional liquid scintillation counter. It was found that the oxidation rate increased linearly with oxygen pressure in the range 0 ～ 160 Torr under a constant hydrogen pressure of 0. 7 Torr: namely, the reaction obeys the first order kinetics with respect to oxygen. This indicates that <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms,</b> O(3 P), formed with UV-photon irradiation play an important role for the enhancement of the oxidation. Hydrogen pressure dependence was examined with varying hydrogen pressure in the range from 0 ～ 5. 5 Torr under a constant pressure of 160 Torr.

We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms, and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals OH· with ozone. OH is formed by the reaction of electronically <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms</b> produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapor is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of methane (CH4).

In addition, solar proton events can significantly effect ozone levels via Radiolysis with the subsequent formation of OH [...] Laughing gas or Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, chlorofluorocarbon molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O2. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole. Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F.

The possibility of burning very lean fuel mixtures is studied. To initiate the ignition and combustion stabilization the discharge generated by the quasi-optical microwave is used. Main Results. Initiating ignition by streamer microwave discharge increases the rate of combustion and combustion efficiency about four times as compared with the conventional spark ignition. Streamer discharge ignition by very lean fuel-air mixture is demonstrated with the factor of oxiding agent excess greater than the limit of explosive range under normal conditions. According to indirect indicators, ignition by microwave discharge created by quasi-optical radiation is of non-thermal nature. Microwave discharge <b>excites</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms,</b> and intense ultra-violet radiation is generated as a result that causes formation of cold nonequilibrium plasma with avalanche growth of free electrons. Streamer discharge propagates at a speed of 5 km /s, so the initiation of the ignition occurs immediately throughout. The temperature of the fuel mixture at the point of ignition initiation does not exceed 400 К. There is no area with a temperature sufficient to initiate thermal Zeldovich mechanism of emission of nitrogen oxides. Combustion rate is high. As a result the Fenimore mechanism of "fast nitrogen oxides" has no chance to be progressing, and NOx emissions in appreciable quantities are excluded. Energy costs are comparable with spark ignition. Practical Relevance.

The SAR arc emission at 6300 Å is driven by field-aligned magnetospheric energy transport from ring current/plasmapause locations into the ionosphere-thermosphere system. The first SAR arc was observed {{at the dawn of}} the space age (1956), and the typical brightness levels and occurrence patterns obtained from subsequent decades of observations appear to be consistent with the downward heat conduction theory, i. e., heated ambient F-layer electrons <b>excite</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms</b> to produce a spectrally pure emission. On very rare occasions, a SAR arc has been reported to be at brightness levels visible to the naked eye. Here we report on the first case of a very bright SAR arc (~ 13 kilo-Rayleighs) observed by four diagnostic systems that sampled various aspects of the sub-auroral domain near Millstone Hill, MA, on the night of 29 October 1991 : an imaging spectrograph, an all-sky camera, an incoherent scatter radar (ISR), and a DMSP satellite. Simulations of emission using the ISR and DMSP data with the MSIS neutral atmosphere succeed in reproducing the brightness levels observed. This provides a robust confirmation of M-I coupling theory in its most extreme aeronomic form within the innermost magnetosphere (L ~ 2) during a rare superstorm event. The unusually high brightness value appears to be due to the rare occurrence of the heating of dense ionospheric plasma just equatorward of the trough/plasmapause location, in {{contrast to}} the more typical heating of the less dense F-layer within the trough...|$|R
40|$|The Monte Carlo {{method was}} applied to {{investigate}} electron auroras observed by the sounding rocket S- 310 JA- 8,which was launched on April 4, 1984 from Syowa Station in Antarctica of the invariant latitude 66. 14 °S and the geomagnetic longitude 70. 98 °. The number density of the atmosphere, in which constituent elements were assumed to be N_ 2,O and O_ 2,and temperatures were estimated by the MSIS- 86 model for the aurora observed there. A downward electron differential number flux was measured at the altitude of 200 km, from which electrons were injected downward into the upper atmosphere. An initial electron energy E_ 0 is investigated {{in the range from}} 100 eV to 18 keV. An initial pitch angle was assumed to be uniformly distributed in the range of [0,π/ 2]. Ionization rates of N_ 2,O and O_ 2 were calculated as a function of an altitude, the initial pitch angle, and the initial electron energy. The total ionization rate obtained by summing up individual ionization rate was considered to be a production rate of thermal electrons. A loss rate of thermal electrons was estimated by using an electron density and an effective recombination rate. Under the assumption of local equilibrium of ionization and recombination, the height profile of electron density was deduced and compared with the observed one. The height profile of an emission rate was also investigated for the oxygen green line. The emission rate calculated as contribution from the electron impact was compared with the one produced by the collision process N_ 2 (A^ 3 Σ_u^+) +O(^ 3 P), and it was made clear that the latter collision process was more efficient to <b>excite</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms</b> from O(^ 3 P) to O(^ 1 S) than the electron impact in the wide range of electron energy observed by the sounding rocket...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{observations}} of electron temperature and the topside electron density structure {{are used to}} calculate the red arc according to the thermal conduction model. In this model, energy from the magnetosphere flows in the electron gas along geomagnetic field lines into the ionosphere. This energy heats the ambient F-region electrons sufficiently to <b>excite</b> the <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms</b> to the O I(1 D) level by collisional impact giving rise to the 6300 A emission characteristic of the arc. For the 31 October/ 1 November 1968 red arc, the calculated emission rate, geographical position, and horizontal extent of the red arc are in agreement with the photometric data obtained by airglow observatories. Almost all of the energy conducted into the red arc is ultimately transferred to the neutral gas through elastic and inelastic collisions. This energy drives a large thermal cell and the circulation extends the influence of the arc thousands of kilometers beyond the region of direct heat input. The calculated neutral gas temperature response to electron heating within the arc is small...|$|R
40|$|The Tropospheric ORganic CHemistry {{experiment}} (TORCH) {{took place}} during the heatwave of summer 2003 at Writtle College, a site 2 miles west of Chelmsford in Essex and 25 miles north east of London. The experiment {{was one of the most}} highly instrumented to date. A combination of a large number of days of simultaneous, collocated measurements, a consequent wealth of model constraints and a highly detailed chemical mechanism, allowed the atmospheric chemistry of this site to be studied in detail. Between 25 July and 31 August, the concentrations of the hydroxyl radical and the hydroperoxy radical were measured using laser-induced fluorescence at low pressure and the sum of peroxy radicals was measured using the peroxy radical chemical amplifier technique. The concentrations of the radical species were predicted using a zero-dimensional box model based on the Master Chemical Mechanism version 3. 1, which was constrained with the observed concentrations of relatively long-lived species. The model included a detailed parameterisation to account for heterogeneous loss of hydroperoxy radicals onto aerosol particles. Quantile-quantile plots were used to assess the model performance in respect of the measured radical concentrations. On average, measured hydroxyl radical concentrations were over-predicted by 24 %. Modelled and measured hydroperoxy radical concentrations agreed very well, with the model over-predicting on average by only 7 %. The sum of peroxy radicals was under-predicted when compared with the respective measurements by 22 %. Initiation via OH was dominated by the reactions of <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms</b> with water, nitrous acid photolysis and the ozone reaction with alkene species. Photolysis of aldehyde species was the main route for initiation via HO 2 and RO 2. Termination, under all conditions, primarily involved reactions with NO x for OH and heterogeneous chemistry on aerosol surfaces for HO 2. The OH chain length varied between 2 and 8 cycles, the longer chain lengths occurring before and after the most polluted part of the campaign. Peak local ozone production of 17 ppb hr − 1 occurred on 3 and 5 August, signifying the importance of local chemical processes to ozone production on these days. On the whole, agreement between model and measured radicals is good, giving confidence that our understanding of atmospheres influenced by nearby urban sources is adequate...|$|R
