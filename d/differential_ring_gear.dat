40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to provide a preliminary step into developing a complete forging die life model. The research involved analyzing the initial effects of (1) friction, (2) work-piece temperature, (3) die temperature, and (4) forging press stroke speed on effective die stresses, die surface temperatures, die/work-piece sliding velocities, die/work-piece contact pressures, and die surface temperatures were examined. To obtain the results the forging process was modeled (SolidEdge 3 D Solid Modeling Software), simulated (MSC. Superforge Software), and statistically setup and examined using two-level full factorial design of experiments (Analyzed with Minitab & MS. Excel).

For instance, if the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Extending this case from the one above: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains.

40|$|The {{strain of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> can reflect the dynamic {{characteristics}} of planetary gearboxes directly, which makes it an ideal signal to monitor the health condition of the gearbox.

50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring.

50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R

50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> that they mesh with and roll between.

5000|$|Some designs use [...] "stepped-planet" [...] {{which have}} two differently-sized gears on {{either end of}} a common casting. The large end engages the sun, while the small end engages the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> This may be {{necessary}} to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have [...] "timing marks" [...] (or [...] "relative gear mesh phase" [...] in technical term). The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> would give the same effect as a 100T <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> but with half the actual diameter.|$|R

50|$|Epicyclic gearing is also {{available}} which consists of a sun, a carrier, and two planets which mesh with each other. One planet meshes with the sun gear, while the second planet meshes with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> For this case, when the carrier is fixed, the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> rotates {{in the same direction}} as the sun gear, thus providing a reversal in direction compared to standard epicyclic gearing.|$|R
50|$|All modern {{starters}} {{rely on the}} solenoid {{to engage}} the starter drive with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of the flywheel. When the solenoid is energized, it operates a plunger or lever which forces the pinion into mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The pinion incorporates a one way clutch {{so that when the}} engine starts and runs it will not attempt to drive the starter motor at excessive RPM.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{drawback}} to the Bendix drive {{is that it}} relies on {{a certain amount of}} [...] "clash" [...] between the teeth of the pinion and the <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> before they slip into place and mate completely; the teeth of the pinion are already spinning when they come into contact with the static <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> and unless they happen to align perfectly at the moment they engage, the pinion teeth will strike the teeth of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> side-to-side rather than face-to-face, and continue to rotate until both align. This increases wear on both sets of teeth. For this reason the Bendix drive has been largely superseded in starter motor design by the pre-engagement system using a solenoid.|$|R
