He initially played as a defensive end, but converted to the tight <b>end</b> <b>position</b> where he played {{for most of his}} high school career. As a senior in 1996, he was nominated to be the Burlington Spectator Athlete of the Week for his contributions to the football team.

5|$|Youngblood {{was drafted}} by the Los Angeles Rams {{in the first round}} of the 1971 NFL Draft. He was the 20th overall pick in that draft and signed a 3-year $105,000 {{contract}} including a $30,000 signing bonus. That season, he backed up Deacon Jones at left defensive end and started four games when Jones was sidelined with a severely sprained arch. He was named All-Rookie by Football Digest and after the season Jones was traded to the San Diego Chargers. In 1972, the left defensive <b>end</b> <b>position</b> was Youngblood's as he led the Rams defensive linemen in tackles with 70, and started 11 of the 14 games he played, recording six sacks.|$|E

25|$|Tuck's {{rookie season}} in the NFL found him behind Pro Bowl {{defensive}} ends Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora on the New York Giants depth chart, reducing his role to special teams and the first backup at each defensive <b>end</b> <b>position.</b> In total, Tuck played in 14 regular season games with one start and the NFC Wild Card Game. His first career sack came against the Giants' NFC East rival, the Dallas Cowboys.|$|E
25|$|He {{played in}} Super Bowl XIV when the Rams met the Pittsburgh Steelers after the 1979 season. That season, he was honorable mention All-NFC after {{recording}} 49 tackles (31 solo) 10 sacks and three forced fumbles and recovered one. Against the New York Giants on October 28, 1979, Dryer recorded a career-high 5 sacks. In 1980 Dryer split {{the time at}} his right defensive <b>end</b> <b>position</b> with third-year player Reggie Doss. They combined for 67 tackles (Dryer 31, 20 solo) and 12 sacks (Dryer 5½, Doss 6½).|$|E
5000|$|Kadane's {{algorithm}} {{begins with}} a simple inductive question: if we know the maximum subarray sum <b>ending</b> at <b>position</b> , what is the maximum subarray sum <b>ending</b> at <b>position</b> ? The answer {{turns out to be}} relatively straightforward: either the maximum subarray sum <b>ending</b> at <b>position</b> [...] includes the maximum subarray sum <b>ending</b> at <b>position</b> [...] as a prefix, or it doesn't. Thus, we can compute the maximum subarray sum <b>ending</b> at <b>position</b> [...] for all positions [...] by iterating once over the array. As we go, we simply keep track of the maximum sum we've ever seen. Thus, the problem can be solved with the following code, expressed here in Python: ...|$|R

25|$|Up front, the Patriots' {{defensive}} line was anchored by Pro Bowler Richard Seymour, who recorded 5 sacks and 1 fumble recovery. New England also still had their trio of impact veteran linebackers: Pro Bowler Tedy Bruschi (122 tackles, 3.5 sacks, 3 interceptions, and 70 return yards), Willie McGinest (9.5 sacks, 1 fumble recovery, and 1 interception), and Mike Vrabel (71 tackles and 5.5 sacks), along with Ted Johnson. Vrabel also frequently {{played at the}} tight <b>end</b> <b>position</b> during offensive plays near the opponent's goal line, recording 2 touchdown receptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{central part}} of the Coniston range can be likened to an {{inverted}} 'Y' with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. The main spine of the ridge runs north over Swirl How and Great Carrs and south west to Dow Crag and the lower hills beyond. The third arm is a truncated spur, running only half a mile to the summit of the Old Man before tumbling away south eastward to the valley floor. This ridge <b>end</b> <b>position</b> gives the fell a sense of isolation and increased stature, with steep faces on three sides.|$|E
25|$|However, New England retook {{the lead}} on their next drive, {{advancing}} 68 yards {{with the aid of}} a pair of completions from Brady to Givens for gains of 18 and 25 yards. Once again the Patriots were faced with third down and goal, but this time they scored with Brady's 1-yard pass to Vrabel, who had lined up in an eligible tight <b>end</b> <b>position.</b> Then on a two-point conversion attempt, running back Kevin Faulk took a direct snap and ran into the end zone to make the score 29–22. Despite amassing over 1,000 combined yards, Faulk's two-point conversion constituted the only points he scored all season.|$|E

Over {{the course of the}} 1949 season, Hirsch tallied 326 receiving yards, 287 rushing yards, and 55 return yards on two interceptions. During the 1949 season, Hirsch also {{became one of the first}} NFL players to wear a plastic helmet. After Hirsch sustained a second head injury (having previously suffered a skull fracture in 1948), Rams coach Shaughnessy had a special, 11-ounce helmet designed for Hirsch, using a strong, light plastic that had been used previously in the construction of fighter planes.|$|E
25|$|The team {{used their}} 31st overall {{selection}} to draft Greg Olsen to solidify their tight <b>end</b> <b>position.</b> They later traded their second round, 37th overall selection to the San Diego Chargers, {{in exchange for}} the team's second (62), third (93), fifth (167) and next year's third selection. Next, Dan Bazuin was selected to further bolster the Bears' defensive line, while Chicago native Garrett Wolfe was selected in the third round following Thomas Jones' departure. The team spent their other third-round pick to acquire linebacker Michael Okwo. The bears drafted Offensive guard Josh Beekman in the fourth round, and then selected two defensive backs, Kevin Payne and Corey Graham in the fourth round. Lastly, the team drafted offensive tackle Aaron Brant and cornerback Trumaine McBride in the seventh round.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Brownwood {{lost their}} season opener to Abilene Cooper, but went undefeated {{the rest of}} the season to claim the {{district}} championship. They won two playoff games before tying Gainesville at 20. Gainesville advanced to the finals on first downs, and the Lions turned in their equipment. In 1975, Coach Wood suited out his son, Jim Wood, at the <b>end</b> <b>position.</b> That year, Brownwood lost their opening game to Abilene Cooper, and a loss to Perryton in district play cost the Lions the district title. The 1977 season fared better. After an undefeated season, the Lions clinched the district title and advanced through the state playoffs only to lose the state championship game to Dickinson, 40 to 28. In 1978, Brownwood lost the opening game to Abilene Cooper, but that game was later forfeited and Brownwood went undefeated {{the rest of the}} season to reclaim the district title.

[...] With Ford and Mann at the <b>end</b> <b>position,</b> the 1946 Michigan team finished with a 6–2–1 record. [...] During the 1946 season, Ford {{established himself as a}} tenacious tackler on defense and was also a receiving threat as an end on offense.
