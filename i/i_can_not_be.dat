6000|$|We {{descended from}} Mount Tabor, crossed a deep ravine, {{followed}} a hilly, rocky road to Nazareth--distant two hours. All distances in the East are measured by hours, not miles. A good horse will walk three {{miles an hour}} over nearly {{any kind of a}} road; therefore, an hour, here, always stands for three miles. This method of computation is bothersome and annoying; and until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it, it carries no intelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the pagan hours into Christian miles, just as people do with the spoken words of a foreign language they are acquainted with, but not familiarly enough to catch the meaning in a moment. Distances traveled by human feet are also estimated by hours and minutes, though I do not know what the base of the calculation is. In Constantinople you ask, [...] "How far is it to the Consulate?" [...] and they answer, [...] "About ten minutes." [...] "How far is it to the Lloyds' Agency?" [...] "Quarter of an hour." [...] "How far is it to the lower bridge?" [...] "Four minutes."

60|$|To these arguments, which I trust <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{accused of}} understating, a {{satisfactory}} answer will, I conceive, be found, if we advert {{to one of}} the characteristic properties of geometrical forms—their capacity of being painted in the imagination with a distinctness equal to reality: in other words, the exact resemblance of our ideas of form to the sensations which suggest them. This, in the first place, enables us to make (at least with a little practice) mental pictures of all possible combinations of lines and angles, which resemble the realities quite as well as any which we could make on paper; and in the next place, make those pictures just as fit subjects of geometrical experimentation as the realities themselves; inasmuch as pictures, if sufficiently accurate, exhibit of course all the properties which would be manifested by the realities at one given instant, and on simple inspection: and in geometry we are concerned only with such properties, and not with that which pictures could not exhibit, the mutual action of bodies one upon another. The foundations of geometry would therefore be laid in direct experience, even if the experiments (which in this case consist merely in attentive contemplation) were practiced solely upon what we call our ideas, that is, upon the diagrams in our minds, and not upon outward objects. For in all systems of experimentation we take some objects to serve as representatives of all which resemble them; and in the present case the conditions which qualify a real object to be the representative of its class, are completely fulfilled by an object existing only in our fancy. Without denying, therefore, the possibility of satisfying ourselves that two straight lines can not inclose a space, by merely thinking of straight lines without actually looking at them; I contend, that we do not believe this truth on the ground of the imaginary intuition simply, but because we know that the imaginary lines exactly resemble real ones, and that we may conclude from them to real ones with quite as much certainty as we could conclude from one real line to another. The conclusion, therefore, is still an induction from observation. And we should not be authorized to substitute observation of the image in our mind, for observation of the reality, if we had not learned by long-continued experience that the properties of the reality are faithfully represented in the image; just as we should be scientifically warranted in describing an animal which we have never seen, from a picture made of it with a daguerreotype; but not until we had learned by ample experience, that observation of such a picture is precisely equivalent to observation of the original.|$|E

Well mayest thou trust me, Isabel; and {{whatever}} strangest thing I may yet propose to thee, thy confidence,--will it not bear me out? Surely thou will {{not hesitate to}} plunge, when I plunge first;--already have I plunged! now thou canst not stay upon the bank. Hearken, hearken to me.--I seek not now to gain thy prior assent to a thing as yet undone; but I call to thee now, Isabel, from the depth of a foregone act, to ratify it, backward, by thy consent. Look not so hard upon me. Listen. I will tell all. Isabel, though thou art all fearfulness to injure any living thing, least of all, thy brother; still thy true heart foreknoweth not the myriad alliances and criss-crossings among mankind, the infinite entanglements of all social things, which forbids that one thread should fly the general fabric, on some new line of duty, without tearing itself and tearing others. Listen. All that has happened up to this moment, and all that may be yet to happen, some sudden inspiration now assures me, inevitably proceeded from the first hour I saw thee. Not possibly could it, or can it, be otherwise. Therefore feel I, that I have some patience. Listen. Whatever outer things might possibly be mine; whatever seeming brightest blessings; yet now to live uncomforting and unloving to thee, Isabel; now to dwell domestically away from thee; so that only by stealth, and base connivances of the night, I could come to thee as thy related brother; this would be, and is, unutterably impossible. In my bosom a secret adder of self-reproach and self-infamy would never leave off its sting. Listen. But without gratuitous dishonor to a memory which--for right cause or wrong--is ever sacred and inviolate to me, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> an open brother to thee, Isabel. But thou wantest not the openness; for thou dost not pine for empty nominalness, but for vital realness; what thou wantest, is not the occasional openness of my brotherly love; but its continual domestic confidence. Do I not speak thine own hidden heart to thee? say, Isabel? Well, then, still listen to me. One only way presents to this; a most strange way, Isabel; to the world, that never throbbed for thee in love, a most deceitful way; but to all a harmless way; so harmless in its essence, Isabel, that, seems to me, Pierre hath consulted heaven itself upon it, and heaven itself did not say Nay. Still, listen to me; mark me. As thou knowest that thou wouldst now droop and die without me; so would I without thee. We are equal there; mark that, too, Isabel. I do not stoop to thee, nor thou to me; but we both reach up alike to a glorious ideal! Now the continualness, the secretness, yet the always present domesticness of our love; how may we best compass that, without jeopardizing the ever-sacred memory I hinted of? One way--one way--only one! A strange way, but most pure. Listen. Brace thyself: here, let me hold thee now; and then whisper it to thee, Isabel. Come, I holding thee, thou canst not fall." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} seven {{peculiar}} faint blue stars {{found in the}} course of the Hamburg/ESO survey (HES) which appear to be magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) with non-hydrogen spectra. We show in particular that four of them (HE 0338 – 3853, HE 0107 – 0158, HE 0026 – 2150, and HE 0003 – 5701) have He I lines split by magnetic fields of roughly 20 MG, since the π components of He I 5876 ˚A and He I 4929 ˚A can be identified unambiguously in their spectra, and the σ +, σ − components can be identified in the spectra of two of these stars (HE 0338 – 3853 and HE 0003 – 5701).

40|$|UVES {{spectra of}} the very young (~ 10 ^ 7 years) {{peculiar}} B-type star HR 6000 were analyzed in the near-UV and visual spectral regions (3050 - 9460 A) with the aim to extend to other spectral ranges the study made previously in the UV using IUE spectra. Stellar parameters Teff= 12850 K, logg= 4. 10, and xi= 0 km/s, as determined from H_beta, H_gamma, H_delta Balmer profiles and from the Fe I, Fe II ionization equilibrium, were used to compute an individual abundances ATLAS 12 model. We identified spectral peculiarities and obtained final stellar abundances by comparing observed and computed equivalent widths and line profiles. The adopted model fails to reproduce the (b-y) and c color indices. The spectral analysis has revealed: the presence of emission lines for Mn II, Cr II, and Fe II; isotopic anomalies for Hg, Ca; the presence of interstellar lines of Na I at lambda lambda 3302. 3, 3302. 9, 5890, 5896 A, and of K I at 7665, 7699 A; {{the presence of a}} huge quantity of unidentified lines, which we presume to be mostly due to Fe II transitions owing to the large Fe overabundance amounting to [+ 0. 7]. The main chemical peculiarities are an extreme overabundance of Xe, followed by those of Hg, P, Y, Mn, Fe, Be, and Ti. The most underabundant element is Si, followed by C, N, Al, S, Mg, V, Sr, Co, Cl, Sc, and Ni. The silicon underabundance [- 2. 9] is the lowest value for Si ever observed in any HgMn star. The observed lines of He <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> reproduced by a single value of the He abundance, but they require values ranging from [- 0. 8] to [- 1. 6]. Furthermore, when the observed and computed wings of He I lines are fitted, the observed line cores are much weaker than the computed ones. From the present analysis we infer the presence of vertical abundance stratification for He, Mn, and possibly also P. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
