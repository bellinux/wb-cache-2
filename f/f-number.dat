25|$|By 1920, {{the term}} <b>f-number</b> {{appeared}} in books both as F number and f/number. In modern publications, the forms <b>f-number</b> and f number are more common, though the earlier forms, {{as well as}} <b>F-number</b> are still found in a few books; not uncommonly, the initial lower-case f in <b>f-number</b> or f/number {{is set in a}} hooked italic form: f, or f.|$|E
25|$|DOF is {{determined}} by subject magnification at the film / sensor plane and the selected lens aperture or <b>f-number.</b> For a given <b>f-number,</b> increasing the magnification, either by moving closer to the subject or using a lens of greater focal length, decreases the DOF; decreasing magnification increases DOF. For a given subject magnification, increasing the <b>f-number</b> (decreasing the aperture diameter) increases the DOF; decreasing <b>f-number</b> decreases DOF.|$|E
25|$|In photography, {{the working}} <b>f-number</b> is {{described}} as the <b>f-number</b> corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor. This is of particular importance in macro photography.|$|E
50|$|Function {{keys are}} the <b>F-numbered</b> keys. Their use varies by program; F1 is often Help.|$|R

25|$|The {{system of}} <b>f-numbers</b> for specifying {{relative}} apertures {{evolved in the}} late nineteenth century, in competition with several other systems of aperture notation.|$|R
25|$|On a view camera, {{the focus}} and <b>f-number</b> can be {{obtained}} by measuring the focus spread and performing simple calculations. The procedure is described in more detail in the section Focus and <b>f-number</b> from DOF limits. Some view cameras include DOF calculators that indicate focus and <b>f-number</b> without the need for any calculations by the photographer (Tillmanns 1997, 67–68; Ray 2002, 230–31).|$|E
25|$|Optically, as a lens {{is stopped}} down, the defocus blur at the Depth of Field (DOF) limits {{decreases}} but diffraction blur increases. The {{presence of these}} two opposing factors implies {{a point at which}} the combined blur spot is minimized (Gibson 1975, 64); at that point, the <b>f-number</b> is optimal for image sharpness, for this given depth of field– a wider aperture (lower <b>f-number)</b> causes more defocus, while a narrower aperture (higher <b>f-number)</b> causes more diffraction.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{rotating}} the POF {{can better}} fit the DOF to the scene, and achieve the required sharpness at a smaller <b>f-number.</b> Alternatively, rotating the POF, {{in combination with}} a small <b>f-number,</b> can minimize the part of an image that is within the DOF.|$|E

2500|$|Lens transmittances of 60%–90% are typical, so T-stops are {{sometimes}} {{used instead of}} <b>f-numbers</b> to more accurately determine exposure, particularly when using external light meters. [...] T-stops are often used in cinematography, where many images are seen in rapid succession and even small changes in exposure will be noticeable. Cinema camera lenses are typically calibrated in T-stops instead of <b>f-numbers.</b> In still photography, {{without the need for}} rigorous consistency of all lenses and cameras used, slight differences in exposure are less important, however, T-stops are still used in some kinds of special-purpose lenses such as Smooth Trans Focus lenses by Minolta and Sony.|$|R
50|$|Since light propagates as waves, the {{patterns}} it produces {{on the film}} {{are subject to the}} wave phenomenon known as diffraction, which limits the image resolution to features on the order of several times the wavelength of light. Diffraction is the main effect limiting the sharpness of optical images from lenses that are stopped down to small apertures (high <b>f-numbers),</b> while aberrations are the limiting effect at large apertures (low <b>f-numbers).</b> Since diffraction cannot be eliminated, the best possible lens for a given operating condition (aperture setting) is one that produces an image whose quality is limited only by diffraction. Such a lens is said to be diffraction limited.|$|R
25|$|A T-stop is an <b>f-number</b> {{adjusted}} {{to account for}} light transmission efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Hansma (1996) and Peterson (1996) have {{discussed}} determining the combined effects of defocus and diffraction using a root-square {{combination of the}} individual blur spots. Hansma's approach determines the <b>f-number</b> that will give the maximum possible sharpness; Peterson's approach determines the minimum <b>f-number</b> that will give the desired sharpness in the final image, and yields a maximum focus spread for which the desired sharpness can be achieved.-number, though such an expression obtains from simple algebraic manipulation of his Equation3. In combination, the two methods {{can be regarded as}} giving a maximum and minimum <b>f-number</b> for a given situation, with the photographer free to choose any value within the range, as conditions (e.g., potential motion blur) permit. Gibson (1975), 64) gives a similar discussion, additionally considering blurring effects of camera lens aberrations, enlarging lens diffraction and aberrations, the negative emulsion, and the printing paper. Couzin (1982) gave a formula essentially the same as Hansma's for optimal <b>f-number,</b> but did not discuss its derivation.|$|E
25|$|For any of these, {{doubling}} the <b>f-number</b> will approximately double {{the depth of}} field.|$|E
50|$|The {{depth of}} field is identical, if angle of view and {{absolute}} aperture width are identical. Also the relative diameters of the Airy disks representing the limitation by diffraction are identical. Therefore, the equivalent <b>f-numbers</b> are varying.|$|R
25|$|Notations for <b>f-numbers</b> {{were also}} quite {{variable}} {{in the early part}} of the twentieth century. They were sometimes written with a capital F, sometimes with a dot (period) instead of a slash, and sometimes set as a vertical fraction.|$|R

25|$|The <b>f-number</b> of {{the human}} eye varies from about 8.3 in a very brightly lit place to about 2.1 in the dark. Note that {{computing}} the focal length requires that the light-refracting properties of the liquids in the eye are taken into account. Treating the eye as an ordinary air-filled camera and lens results in a different focal length, thus yielding an incorrect <b>f-number.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since real lenses have transmittances of {{less than}} 100%, a lens's T-stop is always greater than its <b>f-number.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{close-up}} photography, the magnification {{cannot be}} ignored, and the <b>f-number</b> should be determined using the first approximate formula.|$|E
50|$|FontShop International also {{publishes the}} image library ƒStop, named as a {{reference}} to the <b>f-numbers</b> of photography. At present, 22,000 royalty-free photos by 150 photographers are offered (December 2008). The images are distributed directly as well as via some of the FontShops and Getty Images.|$|R
50|$|For the 'same picture' conditions, same {{angle of}} view, subject {{distance}} {{and depth of}} field, then the <b>F-numbers</b> are in the ratio , so the scale factor for the diffraction MTF is 1, leading {{to the conclusion that}} the diffraction MTF at a given depth of field is independent of sensor size.|$|R
50|$|The Face Floor Profile Numbering System ("F-Numbers") {{has been}} adopted by the American Concrete Institute, the American Society for Testing and Materials, the Canadian Standards Association, the World Bank and is more widely used with each passing year.

25|$|On manual-focus small- and medium-format lenses, {{the focus}} and <b>f-number</b> usually are {{determined}} using the lens DOF scales, which often {{are based on}} the approximate equations above.|$|E
25|$|When {{focus is}} set to the hyperfocal {{distance}}, the DOF extends from half the hyperfocal distance to infinity, and the DOF is the largest possible for a given <b>f-number.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{secondary}} telescopes {{are called}} East and West. They are completely {{independent of the}} main telescope. These two auxiliary telescopes each have a 0.91-meter heliostat located beside the main heliostat. These auxiliary telescopes have a slightly shorter focal length and <b>f-numbers</b> of 50 and 44. The resolution of the auxiliary telescopes is 5.11 arcsec/mm and 5.75 arcsec/mm.|$|R
40|$|Let M be {{a closed}} triangulable manifold, and let ∆ be a {{triangulation}} of M. What {{is the smallest}} number of vertices that ∆ can have?

In other words...|$|R
25|$|Professional lenses {{for some}} movie cameras have <b>f-numbers</b> {{as small as}} 0.75. Stanley Kubrick's film Barry Lyndon has scenes shot by candlelight with a NASA/Zeiss 50mm f/0.7, the fastest lens in film history. Beyond the expense, these lenses have limited {{application}} due to the correspondingly shallower depth of field– the scene must either be shallow, shot from a distance, or will be significantly defocused, though {{this may be the}} desired effect.|$|R
25|$|If {{the same}} DOF is {{required}} for each format, an analysis similar to that above shows that the required <b>f-number</b> is {{in direct proportion to}} the format size.|$|E
25|$|The focus so {{determined}} {{would be about}} 1.3m, the approximate harmonic mean of the near and far distances. See the section Focus and <b>f-number</b> from DOF limits for additional discussion.|$|E
25|$|Depth {{of field}} {{increases}} with <b>f-number,</b> {{as illustrated in}} the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low <b>f-number</b> (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, {{with the rest of}} the image (nearer and farther elements) out of focus. This is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur (the aesthetic quality of which is known as 'bokeh') can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewer's focus on the main subject in the foreground. The depth of field of an image produced at a given <b>f-number</b> is dependent on other parameters as well, including the focal length, the subject distance, and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view, subject distance, and entrance pupil diameter (as in von Rohr's method). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same <b>f-number</b> for the same distance of focus and same angle of view since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same angle of view, and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.|$|E
2500|$|In {{exceptional}} circumstances lenses can have even wider apertures with <b>f-numbers</b> smaller than 1.0; see [...] {{for a detailed}} list. For instance, both the current Leica Noctilux-M 50mm ASPH and a 1960s-era Canon 50mm rangefinder lens have a maximum aperture of 0.95. Cheaper alternatives have appeared in recent years, such as the Cosina Voigtländer 17.5mm 0.95, 25mm 0.95 and 42.5mm 0.95 manual focus lenses for the Micro Four Thirds System.|$|R

50|$|The Waterhouse stop or Waterhouse {{diaphragm}} is an interchangeable diaphragm with an aperture (hole) {{for controlling}} {{the entry of}} light into a camera. A thin piece of metal (the diaphragm) is drilled with a hole (the aperture); a set of these with varying hole sizes makes up a set of Waterhouse stops, corresponding to what today we call f-stops or <b>f-numbers.</b> Photographic lens makers provided slots in lens barrels for the insertion of the chosen stop.|$|R
