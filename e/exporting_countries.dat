5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without government subsidies {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s.

In another scenario the study considers that if new carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum <b>Exporting</b> <b>Countries</b> (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery electric cars and fuel cell cars will remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid electric cars is projected to grow from 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 ’s {{there has been}} a {{proliferation}} of agricultural export programs using a wide variety of phytosanitary measures to mitigate pest risk. Increasingly, importing countries have required oversight by official representatives of their NPPO of the phytosanitary measures imposed in the <b>exporting</b> <b>country.</b> In certain cases, such as the pest free areas in Northern Mexico and apple export program in the Pacific Northwestern United States, the importing country agreed to turn over oversight to the NPPO of the <b>exporting</b> <b>country.</b> But in many export programs, oversight of the export program by the importing country’s NPPO remains. These oversight programs are costly and present a significant barrier to trade, especially in small developing export programs with limited financial resources. Oversight programs could easily be performed by the NPPOs of the <b>exporting</b> <b>country.</b> All three NPPOs of the NAPPO countries are fully developed and staffed with outstanding plant health professionals, capable of enforcing any pest risk mitigation program.

Such oversight is possible for all export programs, whether new or pre-existing; whether based on treatments, systems approaches, or just regulatory inspections. Such a transition in oversight simply needs a clear definition of success, clear expectations, and a mutually agreed system of quality assurance...|$|R
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum <b>Exporting</b> <b>Countries</b> (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E

We show that under bilateral management, the resource <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> gains from trade, whereas trade causes the steady state utility to fall in the resource importing country because the resource <b>exporting</b> <b>country</b> implements non-cooperative resource management when demand for a harvest is not so high.
