5|$|The {{advent of}} railroads {{in the late}} 19th century led to further {{development}} in the watershed of Darby Creek. Stops along the Pennsylvania Railroad such as Darby, Prospect Park, and Ridley Park increased in population greatly. Concern {{for the health of}} the creek led Lansdowne residents to raise funds to preserve a stretch of the creek in 1910. In the early 1900s, the major industries in the watershed of Darby Creek included agriculture. However, in modern times, agriculture is only done in a few small areas in the watershed's upper reaches. During this time period, railroads such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the watershed. A <b>gauging</b> <b>station</b> was established on the creek at Landsowne in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Muncy Creek {{begins in}} southeastern Laporte Township, Sullivan County, near its border with Davidson Township, Sullivan County. The creek flows {{southwest}} and then west {{for a short}} distance before reaching the border between Laporte Township and Davidson Township. It then turns southwest as it begins to follow this border. Shortly afterwards it turns northwest and begins to flow into a valley, then turns west and begins receiving very short tributaries from both sides. Examples of these include Rock Run and Lopez Pond Branch. After picking up Peters Creek, one such tributary, Muncy Creek turns southwest and passes the community of Nordmont, where the tributary Elklick Run flows into it. The creek then turns southwest and later west. Deep Hollow Run then enters the creek, which heads south away from the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border. Upon leaving behind the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border, the creek enters Davidson Township and heads west-southwest, passing a <b>gauging</b> <b>station.</b> After several miles, it reaches the community of Sonestown, where the tributary Big Run flows into it from the north. Muncy Creek then makes a sharp bend south and begins flowing parallel to U.S. Route 220. After a few miles, it passes the community of Muncy Valley and makes a sharp turn south, exiting Davidson Township.|$|E
25|$|The fitting and {{calibration}} of gauging plates {{was done}} at a <b>gauging</b> <b>station</b> or indexing station. On the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) Main Line the Smethwick <b>Gauging</b> <b>Station</b> near the Engine Arm Aqueduct was on an island, with a covered gantry in a centre channel where boats were loaded with weights, plated and calibrated. The channels either side allowed two-way traffic and possibly the collection of tolls. The buildings and equipment were demolished in the 1940s. Another BCN indexing station at Tipton survives. Here iron weights were loaded, four tons at a time. Other canal companies had stations at Etruria on the Trent and Mersey Canal and Northwich on the Weaver.|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis on}} "A Proposal to Optimize the Distribution Network of Water Level <b>Gauging</b> <b>Stations</b> in South Bohemian Region? {{deals with the}} {{distribution}} network of <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> of a category ?A?, ?B? and ?C? in the catchment area in South Bohemia. The thesis has been designed as {{an overview of the}} current situation of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> in South Bohemian Region; it is focused on the distribution network of these stations not only in the areas hit with floods. It examines whether these critical places across which the stations have been distributed since 2002 correspond to the requirements of the current flood protection, whether it would not be advisable either to increase or, on contrary, {{to reduce the number of}} stations in the exposed river areas. The data processed by Povodí Vltavy, Horní Vltava s. p. Plant, and documents by the ČHMÚ were used for the purposes of this examination. The result of the thesis is the fact that the number of the distributed <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> is sufficient as for the needs of flood protection, which has been found out by means of structured interviews with the respective experts. Position of these stations has been incorporated in the flood prevention plans and most of these plans have been designed just on the basis of the distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations.</b> The critical locations have been sufficiently mapped and recorded and the flood forecasting and warning service uses the gained, very precious information from these <b>gauging</b> <b>stations.</b> The goal of the thesis was to assess the current distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> on the rivers in South Bohemian Region. The current distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> on the rivers in South Bohemian Region was studied on the basis of an analysis of the ascertained data and documents. The first goal of the examination was the issue whether the current distribution network and the number of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> correspond to the needs of protection of citizens, cultural heritage, and property, and whether it would not be advisable to increase the number of these stations. The other goal of the thesis was to optimize the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> with respect to the usefulness and their distribution network, whether the distribution network corresponds to the flood protection. The current distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> was analysed by means of a partial method of field research, consulting the expert books, legal regulations and a field research. By analysing these data, I tried to find out in the thesis whether optimisation of the number and the distribution network of the water level <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> correspond to the current requirements of the gained data from the respective subject-matter authorities. Upon the results of the analysis of the documents, it was found out that the distribution network and optimization of all <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> of all categories - ?A, B, C" - meet the needs of the catchment and requirements to their distribution. Upon the gained information, it was found out that Povodí Vltavy and the operators of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> have created a very clearly organised network. The hypothesis whether the water level <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> are distributed on all of the important rivers in South Bohemian Region was disapproved. The gained information suggests that the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> are distributed on all rivers in South Bohemian Region. The research results have revealed that there is a number of locations in danger of big flooding, however, overflowing at such areas does not put in danger people?s lives, health or property. To conclude, it can be said no matter a society is prepared for flooding as best as possible, the nature, namely water, is an element that is to be respected a lot. This is very important in terms of protection of health, life, cultural heritage and property. The thesis will be offered to the water-management authorities and administrators of the location for further use...|$|R

25|$|The {{water supply}} for the canal {{originates}} {{to the south}} of Wendover in surface springs and artesian wells near Wellhead Farm and the grade II* listed church of St Mary, which is constructed of flint rubble and blocks of stone. Much of it dates from the fourteenth century, although it was heavily restored in 1839 and 1869. The water flows northwards through the town, past a former water mill, which was operational until 1923, but was converted into a house between 1929 and 1931. It enters Wendover Basin, the start of the canal, where the flow is monitored by a <b>gauging</b> <b>station.</b> Records of the flows exist for the period between 1841 and 1897, and from 1963 onwards, making it the earliest known set of such records in the United Kingdom.

Until the merger of the two railways, the metre gauge part of this station was owned by the FO, and the BVZ therefore had to pay a fee for using it.

40|$|AbstractFlow {{discharge}} from the river basin into the sea has severe impacts on the immediate vicinity of river channels, estuaries, and coastal areas. This paper analyzes the features and temporal trends of flow discharge at Pearl River's three main gauge stations: the Wuzhou, Shijiao, and Boluo <b>gauge</b> <b>stations</b> on the West River, North River, and East River, respectively. The results show no significant trend in annual mean discharge into the sea at the three <b>gauge</b> <b>stations.</b> Changes of monthly mean discharge at the Boluo <b>Gauge</b> <b>Station</b> are evident, {{and a majority of}} monthly discharge in the dry season displays significant increasing trends. Furthermore, changes of the extreme discharge are quite evident, with a significant decreasing trend in the annual maximum discharge and a significant increasing trend in the minimum one. The significantly decreasing ratio of the flood discharge to annual discharge at the Boluo <b>Gauge</b> <b>Station</b> indicates that the flow {{discharge from}} the East River has increased in the dry season and decreased in the flood season since the construction of dams and reservoirs. At the other two <b>gauge</b> <b>stations,</b> the Wuzhou and Shijiao <b>gauge</b> <b>stations,</b> the seasonal discharge generally does not change perceptibly. Human impacts, especially those pertaining to reservoir and dam construction, appear to be responsible for the seasonal variation of flow discharge. The results indicate that the construction and operation of dams and reservoirs in the East River have a greater influence on flow discharge, which can well explain why the seasonal variation of flow {{discharge from the}} East River is more evident...|$|R
