40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a rise in the {{frequency}} and severity <b>of</b> natural <b>disasters.</b> The economic costs associated with these extreme events exceeded $ 110 billion in the year 2012 alone. While the causes for these events are many and the subject of current controversy {{there is little doubt that}} man’s role in rapid urbanization is amplifying the impacts of such occurrences and adds a layer of complexity to efforts aimed at mitigation. While there are systems in place there is a need for a national overhaul of the methods currently active for the mitigation and protection of vulnerable critical infrastructure and the communities devastated by natural disasters. This thesis presents a framework and research approach to provide a means to reducing physical and economic damages associated with natural disasters. A case study is presented illustrating the devastation that would be caused by 100, 500 and 1000 -year flood events in the Hamilton County, TN area. It was found that the damages resulting from each storm would cause federal <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>disaster.</b> Mitigation, recovery and resilience efforts are discussed in the aftermath...|$|R

The campus is projected to be opened in September 2010. [...] Prior to the colonial period, the Lerma River here was an interconnected series of lagoons and wetlands that covered much of the river valley. Drainage and other modifications have dried the marshes and left floodplains. Parts of the city and municipality of Lerma is prone to sudden and fierce flooding during the rainy season. [...] These floods can affect thousands of people, prompting the need for rescue and at times displacing them for as much as a week. [...] The floods spread the dirty and contaminated water of the river through homes and wild animals such as scorpions and snakes invade neighborhoods. This can prompt local <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>disaster</b> areas. The river has dikes and other water containment systems but they are insufficient, especially when garbage clogs drainage canals. The growing population of the municipality is pushing development onto what is left of the undeveloped floodplain, leading to more flooding problems.|$|R

40|$|Recent federal {{agricultural}} {{programs have}} accelerated the devolution of enterprise risk management responsibility {{from the state}} to individual producers. Using a biophysical simulation model, the risk management benefits of federal crop insurance and supplemental irrigation are derived and compared to uninsured rainfed crop production in an expected utility framework. Federal crop insurance programs are inefficient at reducing producer exposure to weather-related production risk in humid regions, and the risk management benefits from supplemental irrigation {{are found to be}} scale and technology dependent. Environmental policies that regulate resource development will increase the investment cost of irrigation alternatives and reduce economic feasibility. Key Words: insurance, risk, supplemental irrigation Recent federal agricultural programs have acceler-ated the devolution of enterprise risk management responsibility from the state to individual producers. This devolution was initiated over 20 years ago after long-standing periods of crop relief in the 1970 s where payments were made to producers without <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disaster</b> area. Multiple-peril crop insurance was established in the 1930 s, but was used only on a limited basis through the 1970 s. Major reforms in the 1990 s have dramatically increased participation.
