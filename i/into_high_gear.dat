50|$|In {{standard}} mass-production automobiles today, {{the gear}} lever appears similar to manual shifts, {{except that the}} gear stick only moves forward and backward to shift <b>into</b> <b>higher</b> and lower <b>gears,</b> instead of the traditional H-pattern. The Bugatti Veyron uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In Formula One, the system is adapted to fit onto the steering wheel {{in the form of}} two paddles; depressing the right paddle shifts <b>into</b> a <b>higher</b> <b>gear,</b> while depressing the left paddle shifts into a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.|$|R
50|$|As the {{military}} industry changed <b>into</b> <b>higher</b> <b>gear</b> before World War II several workers camps {{were set up}} in Schönkirchen for the various defence companies such as Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Feinmechanische Werke and other military suppliers. At the beginning these camps were inhabited by Reichsarbeitsdienst members but {{after the start of}} World War II increasingly foreign workers (Fremdarbeiter) were placed in there. To defend nearby Kiel and its military industry some anti-aircraft units were installed on the municipal territory. Nonetheless several airstrikes caused heavy civilian collateral damage in Schönkirchen, too.|$|R
25|$|Salvage efforts began immediately, and divers {{were sent}} {{down from a}} salvage tug that arrived from Coco Solo. By 10:00am, {{they were on the}} bottom {{examining}} the wreck. To search for trapped personnel, they hammered on the hull near the aft end of the ship and worked forward. Upon reaching the torpedo room, they heard answering hammer blows from inside the boat. In 1923 the only way the salvage crew could get the men out of the submarine was to lift it physically from the mud using cranes or pontoons. One of the largest crane barges in the world, Ajax, built specifically for handling the gates of the canal locks, was in the Canal Zone. However, there had been a landslide at the famous Gaillard Cut and Ajax {{was on the other side}} of the slide, assisting in clearing the Canal. The excavation shifted <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear</b> and by 2:00pm on the afternoon of the sinking, the crane barge Ajax squeezed through and was on its way to the O-5 site.|$|E

[...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, and wrote that [...] "the biggest {{problems}} here are the lack of focus and the chaotic pacing. The episode rumbles along in first gear for about three-quarters of its running time and then abruptly shifts <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear</b> at the end, moving toward an apocalyptic finish that doesn't feel wholly earned.

During the 2000-01 split in the continent's top club competition, local Balkan basketball administrators from the ULEB-affiliated clubs Cibona, Olimpija, and Budućnost (that already competed in this new 'breakaway' Euroleague competition) shifted the discussions of creating a regional Balkan-wide basketball league <b>into</b> <b>higher</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Players {{can spend}} money earned {{in a race}} to upgrade their cars. Upgrading the engine makes the car {{accelerate}} faster, helps the top speed of the car by a small amount, and {{makes it easier for}} the car to reach <b>higher</b> <b>gears.</b> Upgrading the nitro makes nitro boosts accelerate more strongly and reach higher top speeds. Upgrading the transmission greatly improves the car's top speed and fuel economy, but this requires an engine that is strong enough to allow shifting <b>into</b> <b>higher</b> <b>gears</b> in order to be effective. Upgrading the armor allows cars to take more damage before the armor is destroyed in the area that is being upgraded. The paint shop allows the color of the car to be changed.|$|R

The nuclear arms race shifted <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear.</b> [...] The Air Force retired nearly all of its propeller-driven B-29/B-50s and they were replaced by new Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft. By 1955 the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress would be entering the inventory in substantial numbers, as the prop-driven B-36s were phased out of heavy bombardment units rapidly.|$|E

2500|$|Early in World War II, Rowell {{was sent}} to London as an Air Attaché for duty in Cairo, Egypt. It was in the desert and in the skies over Great Britain {{that he was able}} to see the advent of fighters {{equipped}} to operate at night. He also traveled and learned all he could about RAF Coastal Command in Scotland and RAF Bomber Command in Buckinghamshire, England. [...] Upon his return in November 1941, Rowell made a recommendation for the Marine Corps to acquire a medium-sized, long range, high-speed bomber to be used for night harassing missions. This coupled with the work of other Marines grew into the Marine PBJ night bomber program. [...] Following these tours, Rowell served as Commanding General, Marine Aircraft Wings, Pacific (MAWP), from the opening of the Guadalcanal Campaign in August 1942 until Japanese air power was driven from the Bismarck-Solomons in 1944. MAWP was based at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii and its mission was to organize, administrate and distribute personnel and supplies for Marine Air Wings in the Pacific. [...] On December 27, 1942, Rowell read a dispatch from Admiral Halsey on Guadalcanal speaking to the negative effects that night time raids from Japanese bombers were having on the ground troops. Based on his earlier travels and observations, Rowell immediately recommended that a night fighter unit be made [...] "available immediately for overseas duty". This message to Marine Headquarters in Washington would be the catalyst for kicking the development of Marine Night Fighters <b>into</b> <b>high</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

Some of it sounds like folk music, some like new age contemplation, there are convincing neo-baroque musings, and a few of these untitled though numbered selections kick <b>into</b> a <b>higher</b> <b>gear.</b> Sometimes this music is charming; a lot of the time, it gets wearisome".|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} {{have been introduced}} into new automobiles {{with the aim of}} reducing CO 2 emissions. One method of improving fuel consumption is to improve driver behaviour, since eco-driving techniques can help save 10 - 15 % of fuel. A retro-fittable driver behaviour improvement device has been developed and tested in real world conditions. The device provides real-time audio and visual feedback to the driver to improve his/her driving style. It was tested on 15 vans belonging to various companies in the UK and over 39, 000 km of data was collected. It was observed that use of the device saved an average 7. 6 % of fuel. Further analysis showed that the savings were obtained as a result of improvement in driving behaviour through reduction in harsh accelerations and early <b>gear</b> shifting <b>into</b> <b>higher</b> <b>gears.</b> There was also a reduction in the pedal busyness of drivers with the system fitted.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{long held}} that the human immune system {{was no match for}} cancer. Born of na-tive cells, the logic went, cancer fooled the immune system into {{concluding}} it was harmless. Thus protected from attack, cancer easily thrived until its host died. A deeper understanding of our bio-logical defenses has changed that. The human immune system does battle cancer. But we could better optimize our defenses to fend off malignant dis-ease. That’s clear from cancer treat-ments attempted in New York City and Germany as early as the 19 th century. Those experiments and other undervalued evidence from the medi-cal literature suggest that acute infec-tion—in contrast to chronic infection, which sometimes causes cancer—can help a body fight tumors. It’s not the pathogens that do the good work. But the way our bodies respond to the pathogens is key. Infec-tion events, especially those that pro-duce fever, appear to shift the innate human immune system <b>into</b> <b>higher</b> <b>gear.</b> That ultimately improves the per-formance of crucial biological machin-ery in the adaptive immune system. This lesson comes, partly, from doctors who risked making patients sicker to try to make them better...|$|R
