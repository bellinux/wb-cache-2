In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant <b>James</b> <b>Carville.</b> Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state.

25|$|Dean's {{strategy}} arguably {{paid off}} in a historic victory as the Democrats took {{over control of the}} House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2006 mid-term elections. While it is likely this is also attributable to the shortcomings of the Republican Party in their dealings with the Iraq War and the scandals that occurred shortly before the election, Dean's emphasis on connecting with socially conservative, economic moderates in Republican-dominated states appears to have made some impact. Indeed, Democratic candidates won elections in such red states as Kansas, Indiana, and Montana. And while former Clinton strategist <b>James</b> <b>Carville</b> criticized Dean's efforts, saying more seats could have been won with the traditional plan of piling money solely into close races, the results and the strategy were met with tremendous approval by the party's executive committee in its December 2006 meeting. While he was chairman of the DCCC, Rahm Emanuel was known to have had disagreements over election strategy with Dean; Emanuel believed a more tactical approach, focusing attention on key districts, was necessary to ensure victory.

Ward stripped Jim Stark of his immediate responsibilities for Louisiana's FEMA district, leaving him as FEMA assistant administrator for Gulf Coast recovery. Cao had also been critical of John Connolly, FEMA chief for Gulf Coast public assistance, whom Stark cited as his source of information on [...] "how much public-assistance money FEMA should approve for local projects" [...] (in a congressional hearing with Cao on February 25, 2009). Connolly was previously with FEMA's Philadelphia office, and Cao asked rhetorically, [...] "How many times has Philadelphia been hit by a hurricane?"

40|$|Matthew Martyn-Jones {{joins the}} debate about Labor’s {{directions}} Recently Sydney’s Daily Telegraph ran a front-page cartoon showing Simon Crean and Natasha Stott Despoja both gazing anxiously at their exposed belly-buttons. This graphic was juxtaposed with a story detailing a federal government trade coup, a deal to supply something {{in the vicinity of}} $ 20 billion worth of gas to China. The announcement came at roughly the same time the Democrats’ saga over Senator Andrew Murray was reaching an anti-climactic ending, and the pending release of the Hawke-Wran Report on modernising the ALP. It was a stark reminder of just how completely the federal government now commands the political battlefield. Much has been written and said about Crean’s “modernisation” process. Almost without exception the focus has been on the relationship the ALP has with the union movement. Doubtless, coalition strategists are overjoyed by this, since while the conservatives were being pummelled once again in a state election, the media spotlight stayed firmly focussed on the “crisis in the ALP”. Simon Crean and his coterie of supporters and advisers have fallen for the Howard, Abbott and Costello sucker punches on the ALP’s relationship with trade unions. They’re sucker punches because unions are not the main issue - policy development is. Labor’s strategic muddle brings to mind <b>James</b> <b>Carville’s</b> mantra in Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 campaign against incumbent Republican President George Bush: “It’s the economy, stupid!” Inspired by Carville this simple piece of advice is on offer to Simon Crean, for free: “It’s the policies, stupid!” A visit to the website of the ALP is rather dispiriting for a policy enthusiast. The party’s “modernisation” process is well underway - indeed, a special rules conference has been organised for October in Canberra. Yet the policy review is lagging a long way behind. On the current schedule the review is not even going to close its doors until 1 December this year. Deputy Leader Jenny Macklin is coordinating the review, but Crean’s office is giving the riding instructions. One has to question why the horse is being put before the cart. Policies that can be sold to the electorate are crucial in defining what Labor stands for. Is it really more important {{to reduce the size of}} union delegations at conferences from 60 per cent to 50 per cent than it is to get in place solid policy alternatives? Macklin’s office was contacted in the preparation of this article and it has confirmed that “the review I am conducting into Labor’s policies has a considerable way to run”. So it seems we can’t expect Labor will be releasing any detailed policies until well into next year. The review itself can only be described as laborious. One insider has described it as a “reading group”. Macklin says, “In the past three months I have conducted a series of very well-attended policy forums around Australia and the range of issues raised has been extremely broad. ” When I requested access to some of the submissions, however, the reply from Macklin’s office was: “No policies have been finalised except those outlined. ” This is a shame because, as Shaun Carney observed recently in the Age, Labor is leaving a policy vacuum which John Howard is only too happy to fill with feel-good values rhetoric about balancing the competing demands of families and work. The NSW premier Bob Carr recently appeared on the Nine Network’s Sunday program to list a number of key areas where he thought the ALP should set the agenda. The Carr list included public health, higher education, border protection and the personal indemnity and insurance crisis. Let’s take the issue of public health first, because it’s something that affects all of us. There is a crisis in public health and it is manifest in the problem of dwindling access to GPs. More and more doctors no longer bulk-bill and many are closing their books. This puts great strain on accident and emergency departments, as people visit their public hospital when a GP could easily handle their concern. In some cases people are presenting to A&E departments to have prescriptions renewed. This is a completely unacceptable situation and federal Labor ought to be making public health more of an issue, then responding with policy initiatives. The coalition has been itching to deregulate the higher education sector for years. In 1999 then Education Minister Dr David Kemp and his senior adviser Andrew Norton prepared a cabinet submission recommending the total deregulation of universities, full fees for undergraduates and student loans charged at real rates of interest. Now, Howard’s new education minister, the slick Dr Brendan Nelson, is flirting with similar proposals. Back in 1999 Labor successfully scuttled the Kemp/Norton plan by leaking it in question time and to the media before the government could capture the policy initiative. Higher education in Australia is headed for a crisis, and it is of John Howard’s making. He’s starved the universities of the funds needed to keep the sector vital. He’s kept academic salaries low and in the life of this parliament he will try to completely deregulate the system. Labor needs to capture the battlefield on universities now. Let’s hope the policy review is overwhelmed with submissions on higher education. But back to the issue Simon Crean thinks is the most important one for Labor - its trade union links. Most Australians would not have even known trade unions get 60 per cent of delegates at some state branch conferences. That is, until Crean made it an issue by allowing federal front-benchers like Carmen Lawrence, Robert McClelland, Joel Fitzgibbon and Mark Latham to highlight it immediately following the election loss. This rash of adverse commentary created the wrong impression that Labor’s biggest electoral liability is its trade union links. In reality Simon Crean’s biggest electoral liability is that he believes his trade union past is a weakness. His “modernisation” process says more about him personally than it does about genuine structural reform. “Modernisation” is code for Crean trying to shed his trade union skin because he’s uncomfortable in it. Unfortunately his poor judgement has risked the creation of a fissure in the ALP, which may in the end be an even bigger electoral problem. For the record, Jenny Macklin’s office offered opposition to the further sale of Telstra, national paid maternity leave, a scheme to protect workers’ entitlements and ratification of Kyoto as “major policy commitments”. All but maternity leave are leftovers from the 2001 campaign.
