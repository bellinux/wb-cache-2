Ichiro reached the {{milestone}} in the fourth-fewest games in major league history, after Al Simmons, Ty Cobb, and George Sisler. In a 13-inning road loss to the Oakland A's on July 8, Ichiro was placed second in the batting order and responded by going 2 for 6 to bring his season batting average to [...]261 heading into the All-Star break. In the previous night's game, Ichiro recorded two hits to break a career-worst 0 for 23 hitless streak. Ichiro had also been tried at the three-spot in the batting order during a season for which he earned $18 million. Former teammate Jay Buhner stated he felt Ichiro was the recipient of too much blame for the Mariners' difficulties but [...] "at the same time, they need help desperately." [...] Buhner stated that if Ichiro were awarded a three-year contract extension for somewhere between $35 million and $40 million, [...] "I'd vomit. I mean, really, no offense.

5000|$|... "Fresh Out the Oven" [...] is a mid-tempo electro-R&B song, with {{a length}} of three minutes and thirty-five seconds (3:35). The song was co-written by Lopez, along with Amanda Ghost, Pitbull and Pharrell Williams, who {{produced}} the song with his production team The Neptunes. Lopez opens the first verse of the song by the lines: [...] "Now don't {{tell me that you}} love me to get with this / You say you stay forever / But it don't make sense". According to Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy, the song is a throwback [...] "to her dancehall / dance-chart days" [...] and a reminder that [...] "she'll always be that Fly Girl". An editor from website Código Venezuela named the song [...] "a theme that blends hip hop with electronic sounds, leaving a sensual interpretation by Lopez while her partner makes its peculiar mixture of Spanish with English". In an interview in March 2010, Lopez said about the song: [...] "The head of my record company, Amanda, really loved this record. She said, 'This record is for Jennifer Lopez. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> record to Jennifer Lopez'. She let me hear it and I said, 'You know what? I love the record, but it doesn't fit in with the album I'm making.

5000|$|Shia LaBeouf, {{who worked}} with Spielberg {{on a number of}} films {{including}} Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and various DreamWorks productions (notably the Transformers film series), described his experiences working with the director in a wide-ranging interview with Variety in 2016. He stated, [...] "I grew up with this idea, that if you got to Spielberg, that’s where it is - I’m not talking about fame, and I’m not talking about money. You get there, and you realize you’re not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. You’re meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. He’s less a director than he is a fucking company." [...] He went on to discuss his on-set actor/director relationship with Spielberg, as well as the films they made together, [...] "Spielberg’s sets are very different - everything has been so meticulously planned. You <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what you’re doing for a living." [...] He concluded his point by stating: [...] "I don’t like the movies that I made with Spielberg. The only movie that I liked that we made together was first Transformers film." [...] Later in the interview, LaBeouf recited and criticised the advice given to him by Spielberg following the mixed reaction to both Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and LaBeouf's performance in the film. He claims Spielberg told him not to read about himself in the media, but LaBeouf felt irritated by what he perceived to be non-advice and a lack of understanding, saying [...] "There’s no way to not do that. For me to not read that means I need to not take part in society. The generation previous to mine didn’t have the immediate response the internet.

40|$|For our case, we'll explore partial-order {{planning}} in a classical planning environment. Such an environment is fully observable (as opposed to only partially so) and deterministic (as opposed to having randomness, or being stochastic). Further, {{the space is}} finite and static in nature- it does not change {{in the middle of}} deliberation. Finally, the environment is &quot;discrete (in time, action, objects, and effects), &quot; as opposed to continuous along any of these axes (Russell, 375. For further reading on the characteristics of environments, see Russell pages 41 - 42). To understand what partial-order planning entails, it might be helpful to know what planning is, and then describe totally ordered planning. To that end, planning is &quot;the task of coming up with a sequence of actions that will achieve a goal &quot; (Russell, 375). That is a fairly straightforward-exactly as we would expect if we weren't speaking of computers and programs. An example is simple: given a set of actions I can perform, which ones do I choose (and in what order should I apply them) in order to reach my goal? I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> work <b>this</b> morning- what should I do <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there?

40|$|The current {{physical}} test has become {{some sort of}} “necessary evil” among firefighters, {{and most of them}} are opposed to it even more strongly than members of the military, the police or the border guards. This rejection can be traced back to the general opinion that the exercises during these tests (2000 -meter running, 4 x 10 -meter “pendulum running”, etc.) are regarded unnecessary for the firefighting profession. The question often arises:” When do we have to run 2000 meters while putting out a fire?” This negative attitude towards regular exercise and healthy lifestyle causes a lack of information, deeply affects the level of physical fitness, and it is also responsible for thoughts like ”We’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over with <b>this</b> somehow!” Based on the feedback received from the staff, our firefighters would rather be tested on performing professional tasks that would clearly show their physical fitness for the job...|$|R

That has always been the fascinating part; I still don’t think we got it right my version. I’ve always been in awe of J.J.’s technique... He was a rhythm guitar player and a great lead guitar player, too. But when he played rhythm, it was very difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it and know what he was doing.When we recorded it, me and Delaney both did guitar part it at same time, and it was a really difficult claw-hammer picking thing. I thought: [...] "This is too hard," [...] so we made a meal out of it. What got me is that it appeared to be a very complex track and I was just intrigued, and thought: [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> try and <b>get</b> <b>this</b> right."

5000|$|The song {{is written}} and {{recorded}} in the keys A minor and C major. In 1998, Clapton talked about the composition and writing process on [...] "Pilgrim" [...] a song like [...] "Inside of Me" [...] that was deliberately borrowed from Curtis Mayfield {{as a way for}} Clapton to say thanks for the inspiration: [...] "I was playing guitar and Simon Climie was playing keyboards and we just created an atmosphere and instantly the words were coming into my head because the mood evoked all of the circumstances that had been happening for the past few years... not judgmental... it states what had had been happening in a very gentle loving way. This was an actual event in my life where people were saying to me 'Look you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of <b>this.</b> You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> let go. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> move on.' There was an endless vicious circle of make-ups, break-ups, make-ups, and it went on for years and it was going nowhere. It was very painful but I was obsessed with the notion that it would come to fruition if I just stayed there long enough. I'm sure we've all been there - but this time for me it was different. That's another one of the things where I can say that if I just stay there it will come good and it didn’t." [...] Clapton continued, [...] "We used drum loops... turned to technology when we ran out of things to do and needed a place to start. We would say something like 'uh, well, um, have you heard the new Usher single?' And from there we'd just copy the drum program, dicker with it and play along with it. That's how the song [...] "Pilgrim" [...] was born. We came up with a drum program that was derived from a hit - I can't remember which one - we changed it a little and then wrote the words".|$|R
