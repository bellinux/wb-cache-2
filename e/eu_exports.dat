40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} the impact of European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>export</b> subsidy reductions on the U. S. dairy trade. We assume reductions of 36 % similar to the 1995 World Trade Organization agreement. The price substitutability between U. S. and EU dairy products is estimated using a Rotterdam-type production model. Past analyses have suggested that <b>EU</b> <b>export</b> subsidy reductions will increase U. S. dairy exports because the removal of EU subsidies will raise <b>EU</b> <b>export</b> dairy prices, rendering U. S. dairy products more competitive on world markets. This is partially true for nonfat dry milk, where our projections indicate an increase of 4. 6 % in U. S. exports. U. S. cheese, butter, and whey exports, on the other hand, rise by only 0. 2, 0. 1, and 0. 2 %, respectively. The main reason for the relatively modest gains is that the U.

40|$|This paper compares European and Chinese exports in the {{clothing}} sector {{since the end}} of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005. Using detailed product-level data from UN Comtrade, we document the pattern of export prices and quantities observed for both countries, considering both exports to the rest of the world and to a particular destination market. We find that within narrowly defined product categories, European varieties typically sell for a higher price than Chinese varieties. But this price gap is narrowing. Despite rising prices, Chinese varieties are increasingly selling more than European varieties, suggesting that quality differences are narrowing. While European “core” products in clothing are stable over time, Chinese exports show strong product dynamics with exit and entry of new “core” products every year and “core” products changing rapidly. Both China and the <b>EU</b> <b>export</b> in every product category, resulting in a perfect product overlap with no products being exported by only one of the two. To make sure that our findings are not driven by a different product mix or a different destination country mix of <b>EU</b> versus Chinese <b>exports,</b> we compare <b>EU</b> and Chinese <b>exports</b> of clothing to the US and limit the comparison to HS 6 product categories that are exported by both countries to the US. Again we obtain similar results as those obtained by comparing <b>EU</b> and Chinese <b>exports</b> to the rest of the world. Also, our evidence is suggestive of China exporting its high quality goods, while the <b>EU</b> <b>exporting</b> its most efficiently produced goods. ...|$|R

There are two different points of view: On the one hand, the European Union's (<b>EU)</b> <b>export</b> policy reduces the prices on these markets and relieves high burdens on local producers; on the other hand are claims that refunds do not influence local prices significantly. Hence, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has no effect on markets of third countries, besides depressing world market prices.

40|$|Another USDA paper {{identifies}} {{three important}} effects of <b>EU</b> <b>export</b> subsidies: they lower {{prices in the}} importing country resulting in a 'decrease in local production, meaning the artificially low price pushes domestic producers out of the market, leaving them unemployed'; they reduce the income of those who continue to produce 'which can be devastating to their livelihoods'; they can 'inhibit market development of infant industries, particularly in developing countries'. The paper reviews {{the situation in the}} dairy sector and notes that skimmed-milk powder is the <b>EU's</b> largest <b>export</b> product to developing and least developed countries. Some 95 % of subsidised skimmed milk powder <b>exports</b> from the <b>EU</b> went to developing countries and some 11 % to LDCs. The paper notes that 'many developing and least developed countries have become dependent on low-priced SMP and other dairy imports from the EU as a primary protein source'. The low cost of imports has displaced local dairy farmers in countries as diverse as South Africa and Sri Lanka. In the rice sector, some 50 % of <b>EU</b> milled-rice <b>exports</b> goes to developing countries, with around 14 % going to LDCs. The report also briefly looks at the impact of export subsidies in the cereals and sugar sectors. Comment: While criticising the export subsidies paid by the EU this USDA paper makes no reference to the impact that CAP reform is having on the need for export subsidies. In the cereals sector, where reform is most advanced, the need for export subsidies had been reduced by around 95 % until the recent increase {{in the value of the}} euro against the US dollar (which saw a fivefold increase in cereals-sector export refunds in the 2004 EU budget). It is this long-term trend which is of growing importance in EU trade flows with developing countries, rather than the provision of export refunds.
