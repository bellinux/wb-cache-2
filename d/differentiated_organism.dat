In multicellular organisms, cheaters may arise from mutations in somatic cells that no longer contribute to the common good, or ignore controls on their reproduction. Another possibility may arise from somatic fusion: there are multicellular life-styles where there are few if any physical barriers to the intermingling of cells (for example: sponges, fungal mycelia) and even among organisms that have evolved physical integuments representing a first line of defense against invasion, opportunities for cellular exchange occur.

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{reason to believe that}} the {{bacterial}} cell contains a special genetic substance or structure, differentiated to perform genetic functions, for it can be imagined that each part of the bacterium reproduces itself in fission, and is thus itself responsible for its own genetic continuity.

For example, there are the plastids of plants and the centrosomes of animal ceils. The genetic autonomy of these structures is apparently compatible with the perpetuation of the cell in constant form. In view of the fact that even in highly <b>differentiated</b> <b>organisms,</b> non-nuclear genetic elements possessing genetic continuity are found, a number of hypotheses can be proposed to explain the constant properties of bacterial clones.

40|$|Multicellular <b>differentiated</b> <b>organisms</b> are {{composed}} of cells that begin by developing from a single pluripotent germ cell. In many organisms, a proportion of cells differentiate into specialized somatic cells. Whether these cells lose their pluripotency or are able to reverse their differentiated state has important consequences. Reversibly differentiated cells can potentially regenerate parts of an organism and allow reproduction through fragmentation. In many organisms, however, somatic differentiation is terminal, thereby restricting the developmental paths to reproduction. The reason why terminal differentiation is a common developmental strategy remains unexplored. To understand the conditions that affect the evolution of terminal versus reversible differentiation, we developed a computational model inspired by differentiating cyanobacteria. We simulated {{the evolution of a}} population of two cell types –nitrogen fixing or photosynthetic – that exchange resources. The traits that control differentiation rates between cell types are allowed to evolve in the model. Although the topology of cell interactions and differentiation costs {{play a role in the}} evolution of terminal and reversible differentiation, the most important factor is the difference in division rates between cell types. Faster dividing cells always evolve to become the germ line. Our results explain why most multicellular differentiated cyanobacteria have terminally differentiated cells, while some have reversibly differentiated cells. We further observed that symbioses involving two cooperating lineages can evolve under conditions where aggregate size, connectivity, and differentiation costs are high...|$|R
