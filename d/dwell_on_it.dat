My main concern at the moment is Vietnam's {{position}} on the world map.” Kỳ said that he only wanted to help build up Vietnam and promote national harmony, and assailed critics of his return, saying that “those who bear grudges only care about themselves.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} {{was very difficult}} for Foster, and she has rarely commented on it publicly. In the aftermath of the events, she wrote an essay titled Why Me?, which was published by Esquire in 1982 on the condition that [...] "there be no cover lines, no publicity and no photos". In 1991, she cancelled an interview with NBC's Today Show when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction, and the producers were unwilling to change it. She discussed Hinckley with Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes II in 1999, explaining that she does not [...] "like to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> too much [...] I never wanted to be the actress who was remembered for that event. Because it didn't {{have anything to do with}} me. I was kind of a hapless bystander. But [...] what a scarring, strange moment in history for me, to be 17 years old, 18 years old, and to be caught up in a drama like that." [...] She stated that the incident had a major impact on career choices she made but acknowledged that as difficult as the ordeal was for her, it was minimal compared to the suffering of Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was permanently disabled in the shooting and died as a result of his injuries 33 years later, and his loved ones: [...] "whatever bad moments that I had certainly could never compare to that family".|$|E
5000|$|In Hawaiian ideology, {{one does}} not [...] "own" [...] the land, but merely <b>dwells</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> The belief was that both {{the land and the}} gods were immortal. This then {{informed}} the belief that land was also godly, and therefore above mortal and ungodly humans, and humans therefore could not own land. The Hawaiians thought that all land belonged to the gods (akua).|$|R

6000|$|... "The bestowal {{of money}} is not always an act of charity," [...] {{observed}} Mrs. Wilson, gravely, and the subject was dropped: though neither ceased to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in her thoughts, until sleep closed the eyes of both.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should have}} desired him never {{to think of}} it again,' said Mr. Kendal, decidedly. 'Mere {{nonsense}} to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Their names were always in Edmund's mouth, and it was nothing but accident. You should have told him so, Albinia.' ...|$|E
5000|$|And later, [...] "Machiavelli’s famous {{advice to}} the Prince seems to cover many topics, and its {{ostensible}} theme is prowess, but its gist is loyalty: its indispensability to a successful prince. He <b>dwells</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> from every angle. How to deserve loyalty. How to win it, buy it, inculcate it, cultivate it, terrorize people into it. How to subvert loyalty to rival princes or states. How to sniff out disloyalty and deal with it. All his digressions lead back to loyalty.” ...|$|R
50|$|In the Jewish Kabbalah, Chokhmah (wisdom and intuition) is {{the force}} in the {{creative}} process that God used to create the heavens and the earth. Binah (understanding and perception) is the great mother, the feminine receiver of energy and giver of form. Binah receives the intuitive insight from Chokhmah and <b>dwells</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> {{in the same way}} that a mother receives the seed from the father, and keeps it within her until it's time to give birth. The intuition, once received and contemplated with perception, leads to the Creation of the Universe.|$|R

60|$|There are two {{distinct}} classes of Dyaks--those who inhabit {{the hills and}} those who <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> the sea-coast. <b>It</b> is the latter who recruit {{the ranks of the}} pirates of those eastern seas, and it was to the camp of a band of such villains that our adventurers were, as already said, unwittingly drawing near.|$|R
60|$|Paula {{observed}} it, thoroughly took it in; but {{the effect}} upon her {{was by no means}} clear.

6000|$|... 'Yes; I don't {{enter into}} {{it enough to}} be haunted. Ah! you have never learnt {{what it is to}} feel heavy with trouble. I believe I shall not <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> till I know more. There may be much excuse; she may have been artful, and at least Owen dealt fairly by her in one respect. I can better suppose her unworthy than him cruelly neglectful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Sophy, gravely as an elder, [...] "she {{is such a}} child. She {{was very}} much pleased and entertained, and went on chattering, till I begged her to let us say our prayers in peace. We never talk after that, {{and she went to}} sleep directly, and was smiling when she woke, but I do not fancy she will <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> or fancy there is more to come, unless some one puts it into her head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "as I pointed out, you're {{addicted}} to taking the hardest way.

5000|$|You focus {{so much on}} your {{failures}} and your weaknesses, it has a ... paralyzing effect, where you're dwelling on stuff. For example, having goals: sometimes I have lofty goals, my friends do—we all do, we all have goals. But, if you fix yourself to that goal, and you don't see anything else on the horizon—which is natural, 'cos that what it takes, we all have that in our personality ... but, sometimes, if you attach that to a goal {{that is out of}} your reach, and you continue to fail, it will just grind you into nothing.

6000|$|HUGO'S ROMANCES. - This is an {{instance}} of the [...] "point of view." [...] The five romances studied with a different purpose might have given different results, even with a critic so warmly interested in their favour. The great contemporary master of wordmanship, and indeed of all literary arts and technicalities, had not unnaturally dazzled a beginner.

60|$|She had {{but short}} time to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> and kiss it, for little Philip was upon her, waving his letter, which {{he already knew}} by heart; and {{galloping}} {{all over the house}} to proclaim the good news to the old servants, who came crowding into the hall, trembling with joy, to ask if there were indeed tidings of Mr. Archfield's return, whereupon the glad father caused his grandson to carry each a full glass of wine to drink {{to the health of the}} young master.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dost thou think thus, Jacopo? To me, {{they have}} ever seemed more prone to vent their seditious discontent. But 'tis the nature of man to be niggardly of praise and lavish of censure. This decree of the {{tribunal}} must not be suffered to die, with the mere justice of the case. Our friends should <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> openly, in the cafés, and at the Lido. They will have no cause to fear, should they give their tongues a little latitude. A just government hath no jealousy of comment." ...|$|E
60|$|That is {{a trivial}} schoolboy text; why do I <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it?</b> It has little {{reference}} to me, for I shall leave no works behind me {{for men to}} honour. I have no near relatives who will make up, by weeping over my grave, for the wounds they inflicted on me when I was among them. It is only {{the story of my}} life that will perhaps win a little more sympathy from strangers when I am dead, than I ever believed it would obtain from my friends while I was living.|$|E
60|$|A {{carriage}} {{had been}} sent for him, and he could only hurry home to tell Rosamond to send on the pony to Sirenwood, {{to take him to}} Wil'sbro', unless he were first wanted at home.

60|$|There {{is no need}} to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> the proceedings. <b>It</b> was to Phoebe on {{a larger}} scale what she had {{previously}} gone through. She was too much occupied with the act before God and her neighbour to be self-conscious, or to think of the multitudes eagerly watching her young simple face, or listening to her grave clear tones. A dim perception crossed Lady Bannerman's mind that there really might be something in little Phoebe when she found the sheriff's wife, the grande dame of the hunting field, actually shedding tears of emotion.|$|R
50|$|The Lord hath ordained that {{in every}} city a House of Justice be {{established}} wherein shall gather counsellors {{to the number of}} Baha, and should it exceed this number it doth not matter.

60|$|Ethel {{overcame the}} {{difficulty}} of giving {{the account of the}} newspaper alarm with tolerable success, by putting the story of Meta's conversation foremost. Margaret did not take it to heart as much as she had feared, nor did she appear to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> afterwards. The truth was perhaps that Dr. Spencer's visit was to every one more of an excitement and amusement than it was to Ethel. Not that she did not like him extremely, but after such a week as she had been spending, the home-world seemed rather stale and unprofitable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try to feel compassionately towards me, my kind-hearted boy. For so many long years, {{my heart}} has {{had nothing to}} feed on but the one hope that is now being {{realized}} at last. No sympathy between my husband and me (on the contrary, a horrid unacknowledged enmity, which has always kept us apart); my father and mother, in their time both wretched about my marriage, and with good reason; my only sister dying in poverty--what a life for a childless woman! don't let us <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> any longer.|$|E
6000|$|... "After I {{wrote to}} you last year, I {{succeeded in getting}} my husband away from the detestable University. But he persisted in hanging about Germany, and conferring with moldy old doctors (whom he calls [...] "Princes of Science"!) instead of {{returning}} to Paris, taking a handsome house, and making {{his way to the}} top of the tree with my help.

50|$|In Hungarian myth, {{the world}} {{is divided into three}} spheres: the first is the Upper World (Felső világ), the home of the gods; the second is the Middle World (Középső világ) or world we know, and finally the underworld (Alsó világ). In {{the center of the world}} stands a tall tree: the World Tree / Tree of Life (Világfa/Életfa). Its foliage is the Upper World, and the Turul bird <b>dwells</b> <b>on</b> top of <b>it.</b> The Middle World is located at its trunk and the underworld is around its roots. In some stories, the tree has fruit: the golden apples.|$|R
5000|$|Antonioni's spare {{style and}} purposeless characters, however, have not {{received}} universal acclaim. Ingmar Bergman stated in 2002 that he considered some of Antonioni's films, including Blowup and La notte, masterpieces for their detached and dreamlike quality, but found the other films boring and noted {{that he had never}} understood why Antonioni was held in such esteem. Orson Welles regretted the Italian director's use of the long take: [...] "I don't like to <b>dwell</b> <b>on</b> things. <b>It's</b> one of the reasons I'm so bored with Antonioni - the belief that, because a shot is good, it's going to get better if you keep looking at it. He gives you a full shot of somebody walking down a road. And you think, 'Well, he's not going to carry that woman all the way up that road.' But he does. And then she leaves and you go on looking at the road after she's gone." ...|$|R
