In the present study, fourteen different kinds of edible oils (rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, argan, groundnut, grape seed, sesame, sunflower, walnut and organic walnut, avocado, wheat germ, and two combined oils) were analysed for FA determination using a BPX- 70 60 m highly polar GC column. Oils were classified according to the classification of Dubois et al. (2007, 2008). Monounsaturated FA (MUFA) group oils, including rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, and avocado oils, contained mainly oleic acid (OA).

50|$|The germ of a cereal is the {{reproductive}} part that germinates {{to grow into}} a plant; it is the embryo of the seed.

Non-whole grain methods of milling are intended to isolate the endosperm, which is ground into flour, with removal of both the husk (bran) and the germ. Removal of bran is aimed at producing a flour with a white rather than a brown color, and eliminating fiber, which reduces nutrition. The germ is rich in polyunsaturated fats (which have a tendency to oxidize and become rancid on storage) and so germ removal improves the storage qualities of flour.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin E {{refers to}} a group of {{compounds}} that include both tocopherols and tocotrienols. Of the many different forms of vitamin E, γ-tocopherol is the most common form found in the North American diet. γ-Tocopherol can be found in corn oil, soybean oil, margarine, and dressings. α-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, is the second-most common form of vitamin E in the diet. This variant can be found most abundantly in wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil,</b> sunflower, and safflower oils. As a fat-soluble antioxidant, it interrupts the propagation of reactive oxygen species that spread through biological membranes or through a fat when its lipid content undergoes oxidation by reacting with more-reactive lipid radicals to form more stable products.

There was noted an increase in volumes of corn and wheat processing, however the share of processed potato is still low (below 4 %). It was established that Russian starch products and starch sweeteners {{are on the same}} level on quality as best European samples and they are very competitive. Market demand in crystalline glucose for food and medical purposes (over 30 thous. tons) is fully covered by import. The volume of import of modified starches exceeds 80 % of total consumption. The biggest volume of import among native starches belongs to potato starch – over 60 %. The article provides suggestions on import substitution of mentioned starch products. The growth of starch production in Russia was accompanied by concentration of production at large enterprises. So, in 2013 over 90 % of glucose syrup was produced at six enterprises, over 80 % of dry starch – at five enterprises. Efficiency of corn and wheat processing into starch and starch products is achieved by production and selling of co-products (dry gluten, gluten, corn <b>germ</b> or corn <b>oil,</b> corn extract, feed products).

40|$|Critical {{factors that}} {{determine}} whether a plant can weather the current volatile economic climate and be profitable {{in the long run}} are strategic location based on acquiring low-cost inputs and marketing high value outputs and the choice of technology that impacts operating cost and mix of byproducts produced. The overall objective of this research was to provide information regarding the profitability of alternative location and technology choices for ethanol plants, which will depend upon the economic value of the resulting byproducts. ^ The research considers four alternative technologies including conventional corn refining with DDGS byproduct, upfront fractionation with alternative byproducts, and back-end separation of the corn oil. The fractionation and separation technologies are more expensive than the conventional technology but produce byproducts of greater value. ^ The research also considers plant location decisions near corn markets, near cattle feed markets for the byproducts, and near ethanol product markets (east and west coasts) called destination markets. This research also considered feeding the byproduct wet instead of dried to save processing energy. Plant locations in Iowa, Texas, New York, and California were evaluated with the different byproduct and technology options. ^ Results from feed ration models that were set up to impute the value of byproducts as feed ingredients in swine diets showed that fractionated byproducts can be utilized in swine diets at very low inclusion levels compared to conventional byproducts due to their poor amino acid balance. At low inclusion levels, FracDDGS can be priced higher than the competitive feed ingredients without increasing total diet cost. This is primarily due to its ability to be a better potential replacement for SBM, a more expensive feed ingredient in swine diets. ^ The results from the ethanol plant models revealed that as long as increased revenue from higher priced byproducts offsets the higher production cost, the new technology should increase net revenue for the ethanol plant producers. Depending on locations, the NPVs from finance-based analysis after tax improved by $ 0. 96 to $ 1. 31 per gallon if the plant utilizes the fractionation technology that produces germ for food-grade corn oil versus the conventional technology. Across locations, the price of corn <b>germ</b> for <b>oil</b> would have to drop by around 40 % to 47 % for the second best technology, back-end corn oil extraction technology, and the fractionation technology to generate identical NPVs. ^ Profitability ranking across locations shows that New York plant is the most profitable followed by Texas and then Iowa, due to higher priced byproducts in the region. California is the least profitable location because of the high corn cost in the region. Depending on locations, the NPVs from finance-based analysis after tax improved by 28 - 32 cents per gallon if plant produces 100 % wet versus 100 % dry distillers grains. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is the study of}} the extraction of olive husk oil (vegetable oil) using the supercritical carbon dioxide as solvent. Two apparatuses were constructed with 0. 1 e 0. 5 dm" 3 of capacity where extraction data was obtained under pressures of 12 and 18 MPa and in temperature intervals of 308 and 318 K. Two olive husks from different years were used. The effects of pressure, temperature, superficial velocity of solvent, bed height in extraction velocity and the extracted oil composition were determined. The fluid phase oil concentration rises with pressure and falls with the rise in temperature. It was verified for every condition that the oil concentration in the solvent at extractors exit its maximum {{in the beginning of the}} extraction, diminishing monotonously as the extraction proceeds. This behaviour is different from those normally described for the extraction of other vegetable oils, in which the concentration curves, as a function of time, present a normal platform which it diminishes briskly. The mass transfer coefficients determination was made applying a model in transient state. In the model the following simplifications were considered: non porous particle; negligible axial dispersion; and loading of oil saturation in the solvent as a oil loading function in bed. It was verified that mass transfer coefficients obtained with this work were inferior to estimated values by correlation to forced convention obtained by dimensional analysis. The values are in the same range as those published for rape seed oil. The model limitations and the probable causes for discrepancies observed were discussed. The model is valid for these two installations and for these two types of oil husk. A qualitative analysis was made of the water extracted simultaneously with the oil.

After treatment the blood samples were obtained and LH, FSH, testosterone, progesterone and estrogen, transaminases, phosphatases, LDH, triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL-cholestrol and protein analysis were carried out. Para-nonylphenol caused a significant increase in LH level where other hormones remained unchanged. In addition a significant reduction was found in AST, ALT and LDH level while alkaline phosphatase increased significantly following treatment with para-nonylphenol. There was no change in the level of lipids and proteins in this study with respect to para-nonylphenol treatment.

The recommendations to consume more oily {{fish and the}} use of UVB treated yeast are already applied strategies to address vitamin D insufficiency. This study aimed to elucidate the suitability of plant oils as an alternative vitamin D source. Therefore, plant oils that are commonly used in human nutrition were firstly analyzed for their content of vitamin D precursors and metabolites. Secondly, selected oils were exposed to a short-term UVB irradiation to stimulate the synthesis of vitamin D. Finally, to elucidate the efficacy of plant-derived vitamin D to improve the vitamin D status, we fed UVB-exposed wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> for 4 weeks to mice and compared them with mice that received non-exposed or vitamin D 3 supplemented wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil.</b> Sterol analysis revealed that the selected plant oils contained high amounts of ergosterol, but also 7 -dehydrocholesterol (7 -DHC), with the highest concentrations found in wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil.</b> Exposure to UVB irradiation resulted in a partial conversion of ergosterol and 7 -DHC to vitamin D 2 and D 3 in these oils. Mice fed the UVB-exposed wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> were able to improve their vitamin D status as shown by the rise in the plasma concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) and the liver content of vitamin D compared to mice fed the non-exposed oil.

As a result of researches the technology buns bakery products with the addition of oil and meal of wheat germ, pumpkin seed oil cake. Wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> cake is a source of complete protein and biologically active substances, is rich in essential amino acids, unsaturated ω- 3, ω- 6 fatty acids, vitamin E, D, B 1, B 2, B 6, PP, pantothenic and folic acid, carotenoids. The composition of pumpkin seed oil cake include essential oils, phytosterols, resinous substances, organic acids, vitamins C and B, carotenoids, carbohydrate melen. In the composition of wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> contains: all essential, not synthesized by the human amino acid (tryptophan, methionine, leucine, valine, isoleucine), polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω- 3, ω- 6 and ω- 9 acid), a large amount of vitamins, micro - and macronutrients. In the development of the experimental basis for the formulation chosen butter bakery products, in which part of the wheat flour (20 %) was replaced by wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> cake (10 %) and pumpkin seed oil cake (10 %). Margarine in the classical formulation was replaced by wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil,</b> sugar - on natural honey. Insertion additives significantly improve the properties of biotech pastry. The proposed method of production of buns bakery products can reduce the duration of the production process, to intensify the process of gas formation in the test to increase gas-retaining capacity and lift test...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the possible ameliorating effect of combined treatment of rats with wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> [a rich source of vitamin E, octacosanol, policosanol and the essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic) ] and the antioxidant properties of panax quinquefolium ginseng on radiation-induced oxidative body damage. Materials and Methods: Animals received wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> by gavage at a dose of 80 mg/kg body wt and panax ginseng was intraperitioneally injected with 100 mg/kg body wt for 10 successive days pre as well as during irradiation and supplementation was extended during the period of radiation exposure of rats to fractionated doses 8 Gy (4 x 2 Gy). Results: Experimental investigations were performed at 7 th and 10 th days after the last dose of irradiation revealed that whole body -irradiation of rats produced a significant rise in the activities of serum markers for liver damage as aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alaninetransaminase (ALAT), ammonia and buytryl cholinestase associated with decrease in the serum content of total protein, albumin (A), golublin (G) and A/G ratio indicating acute hepato-toxicity, at the 7 th and 10 th days post-irradiation. Also, radiation-induced biochemical disorders manifested by significant elvation in serum creatinine and urea levels. Serum lipid profile as total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein-cholestrol (LDL-C) levels were significantly higher than normal control rats associated with significant decrease in HDL/LDL ratio. Radiation induced an elevation of lipid peroxidation measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TARS) in plasma and liver. The rats that received combined treatment with wheat <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> and panax ginseng supplement showed significantly less severe damage and remarkable improvement in all of the measured parameters when compared to irradiated rats. According to the results obtained it could be concluded that combined treatment with whole <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> and panax ginseng might be a useful candidate against radiation-induced oxidative stress and metabolic disorders without any toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{commercial}} {{edible oils}} including soybean oil, corn <b>germ</b> <b>oil,</b> sunflower oil, peanut oil, blend peanut oil, calola oil and lard were investigated for their {{physical and chemical}} properties {{as well as for the}} mutagenicity of oil fumes by applying the Ames test. The smoking points of those oils were 118, 119, 95, 98, 107, 138 and 137 degrees C, respectively. Lard had the best oxidative stability among those seven oils as determined by the Rancimat method. Peanut oil produced the largest amount of fumes while corn <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> and sunflower oil produced the least amounts. The oil fumes (0 similar to 10 mu g/plate) of these edible oils showed various degrees of mutagenicity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 (p < 0. 05). Results also provided information for developing edible cooking oils with higher smoke points, lower fume quantity and less mutagenicity...|$|E
