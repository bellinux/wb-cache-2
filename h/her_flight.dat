5|$|Jessica Whitney Dubroff (May 5, 1988 – April 11, 1996) was {{a seven-year-old}} girl who died while {{attempting}} to become the youngest person to fly a light utility aircraft across the United States. On day-two of her quest, the Cessna 177B Cardinal single engine propeller aircraft, piloted by <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> instructor, crashed during a rainstorm immediately after takeoff from Cheyenne Regional Airport in Cheyenne, Wyoming, killing Dubroff, her 57-year-old father, and <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> instructor.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. <b>Her</b> <b>flight</b> deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E

5|$|From 6 January to 15 August 1941, Saratoga {{underwent}} a long-deferred modernization at the Bremerton Navy Yard {{that included the}} widening of <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck at her bow and the installation of additional antiaircraft guns and a CXAM-1 radar.

In September 2014, Landrieu revealed that the internal investigation into <b>her</b> <b>flights</b> had concluded that since she had entered the Senate she had improperly charged her Senate office $33,700 for private flights to campaign events. Landrieu originally said the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her re-election campaign.|$|R

In the event finals, however, Liukin rallied and regained her world champion title on the balance beam with a score of 16.025. She also earned a silver on the uneven bars behind Russia's Ksenia Semenova, scoring a 16.300 after taking a step on her dismount.|$|E

5|$|Right {{before the}} Japanese attack, Saratoga {{launched}} a small airstrike of two Dauntlesses and five Avengers to clear <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck and these planes found and damaged the seaplane tender Chitose with near misses that also destroyed three Mitsubishi F1M reconnaissance floatplanes. Two Avengers {{were forced to}} make emergency landings, but they shot down one Zero from Shōkaku. After recovering their returning aircraft, the two American carriers withdrew, Enterprise for repairs and Saratoga to refuel the next day. Before the former departed for Tongatapu for temporary repairs, she transferred 17 Wildcats and six Avengers to Saratoga as replacements for the latter's losses.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} torpedo planes attacked Enterprise, South Dakota, and cruiser , but all {{of their}} torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; nine of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 Enterprise reopened <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before {{the next wave of}} Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of landing operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{stricken}} from the Navy List on 30 November and salvage work began on 5 December. The {{holes in the}} ship's hull had to be sealed to pump the water out and decrease her draft. The remains of <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward. The job was completed by 12 December 1947.|$|E

5|$|After a {{farewell}} {{visit from the}} Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943, Illustrious sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|At 08:50, {{the lead}} U.S. attack {{formation}} from Hornet spotted four ships from Abe's Vanguard force. Pressing on, the U.S. aircraft sighted the Japanese carriers {{and prepared to}} attack. Three Zeros from Zuihō attacked the formation's Wildcats, drawing {{them away from the}} bombers they were assigned to protect. Thus, the dive bombers in the first group initiated their attacks without fighter escort. Twenty Zeros from the Japanese carrier CAP attacked the SBD formation and shot down four of them. The remaining 11 SBDs commenced their attack dives on Shōkaku at 09:27, hitting her with three to six bombs, wrecking <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck and causing serious damage to the interior of the ship. The final SBD of the 11 lost track of Shōkaku and instead dropped its bomb near the Japanese destroyer , causing minor damage. The six TBFs in the first strike force, having become separated from their strike group, did not find the Japanese carriers and eventually turned back towards Hornet. On the way back, they attacked the Japanese heavy cruiser , missing with all their torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Heather awakens at a shopping mall, having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint; she had been dreaming of being trapped in a demented amusement park, forced to follow roller coaster tracks in <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster. Before she can leave the mall, a private detective called Douglas Cartland confronts her, claiming to have information about her birth. Heather evades him and discovers that the mall is mostly abandoned except for monsters. She encounters Claudia, who hints about Heather's fate. Heather finds herself in the Otherworld version of the mall — monster-filled and decaying — and is eventually restored back to the original shopping mall where she encounters Douglas, who confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her. Heather leaves the mall and resolves to take the subway home. Having arrived at her residence, Heather discovers that her father has been killed by a monster under the orders of Claudia, who tells her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill and leaves.|$|E
5|$|During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Saratoga and Lexington {{were able}} to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932, without being detected. The two {{carriers}} were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Blue Fleet and Saratoga were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by Lexington and the Black Fleet. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out <b>her</b> <b>flight</b> deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers. Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932. While en route from San Diego to San Pedro, the ship briefly ran aground off Sunset Beach, California on 17 August. Captain Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr. (son of the famous illustrator) relieved Steele, who was ordered to immediately retire, on 1 January 1933.|$|E
