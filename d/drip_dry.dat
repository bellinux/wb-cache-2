30|$|Measuring and {{weighing}} of test specimens were done according to EN 325 [37]. Thickness {{and length of}} specimens were measured using digital calipers accurate to 0.01  mm. Weight measurements were made using a balance accurate to 0.01  g. Fifteen water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (TS) specimens of a nominal 50  ×  50  ×  10  mm were cut from each experimental board for use in determining WA and TS after 2 and 24  h submersions in accordance with EN 317 [38] standard. The average thickness was determined by taking several measurements at specific locations on the specimen. The specimens were then submerged in a horizontal position under 25  mm of distilled water maintained at room temperature (20  °C). After 2 and 24  h of submersions, the specimens were <b>drip</b> <b>dried</b> for 10  min, wiped of any surface water, and the thickness was determined as before.

40|$|Background: Total nasal symptom {{score is}} widely used to {{evaluate}} the severity of allergic rhinitis, but the clinical significance of extranasal symptoms is largely unknown. We wished to analyze the presenting symptoms in allergic rhinitis, as well as their relationship with quality of life (QoL) and therapeutic outcomes. Methods: Presenting symptoms and QoL were assessed using the OptumTM SF- 12 v 2 ® Health Survey in 260 patients with allergic rhinitis. Clinical response at 3 months after treatment was measured. Results: Ten most common symptoms presenting with at least moderate severity in allergic rhinitis were: blocked nose (82. 7 %), rhinorrhea (75. 0 %), sneeze (70. 9 %), itchy nose (68. 5 %), fatigue (63. 6 %), mouth breathing (61. 1 %), daytime somnolence (52. 7 %), postnasal drip (49. 1 %), itchy eyes (47. 3 %), and dry mouth (46. 3 %). Severity of sneeze was correlated with physical component summary (PCS) whereas postnasal drip and daytime somnolence were correlated with mental component summary (MCS). Severity of dry mouth was correlated with PCS and MCS. The symptoms with the highest severity scores after treatment were blocked nose, postnasal <b>drip,</b> fatigue, and <b>dry</b> mouth, respectively. Conclusions: Extranasal symptom scores correlated well with physical health and mental health in allergic rhinitis patients. Assessment of extranasal symptoms should be included to evaluate disease severity and assess therapeutic outcomes. Clinical trial NCT 02000648, [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Objetivos: Comparar o efeito broncodilatador do {{salbutamol}} inalado através de aerossol dosimetrado acoplado a espaçadores com e sem tratamento antiestático prévio. Pacientes e métodos: Estudo prospectivo, aleatório, aberto e cruzado, no Ambulatório de Pneumologia do Hospital Júlia Kubitschek-FHEMIG, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Onze pacientes com asma estável leve a moderada foram submetidos a quatro testes de inalação com 100 mig de salbutamol: A) boca aberta, B) espaçador de pequeno volume (50 ml) sem tratamento antiestático prévio, C) espaçador de pequeno volume (50 ml) com tratamento antiestático prévio e D) espaçador de grande volume (750 ml) Fisonair Ò com tratamento antiestático prévio. O tratamento antiestático consistiu em mergulhar o espaçador em uma solução de água e detergente por dez minutos e deixá-lo secar livremente, sem enxágüe. O principal parâmetro de avaliação foi a variação do pico de fluxo expiratório (PFE), 15 minutos após cada teste, em valores absolutos, % do previsto e % do basal. Resultados: A mediana (mín. -máx.) de variação absoluta do PFE foi de 25 (5 - 85), 40 (0 - 70), 70 (25 - 83) e 60 (15 - 90) l/min para os testes A, B, C e D, respectivamente. A mediana de variação do PFE % do basal foi de 7, 6, 11, 0, 15, 0 e 13, 3, e a mediana de variação do PFE % do previsto foi de 6, 0, 8, 7, 12, 7 e 10, 7 para os testes A, B, C e D, respectivamente. Os resultados dos testes C e D foram significativamente superiores aos dos testes A e B (p Objective: To {{compare the}} bronchodilatory effect of salbutamol delivered by metered-dose inhaler connected to spacers {{with and without}} previous antistatic treatment. Design: Prospective, randomized, open, crossover study. Setting: Outpatients from The Pulmonary Clinic of Hospital Júlia Kubitschek-FHEMIG, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Patients and methods: Eleven patients, with stable mild to moderate asthma were randomized to four inhalation tests of 100 mug of salbutamol: (A) open mouth, (B) non antistatic small volume spacer (50 ml), (C) antistatic small volume spacer (50 ml) and (D) antistatic Fisonair Ò (750 ml). The antistatic treatment consisted in soaking the spacer in a solution of water and detergent for ten minutes and letting it to <b>drip</b> <b>dry</b> without rinsing. Main outcome measure: The peak expiratory flow (PEF) variation 15 minutes after each test in absolute, % of predicted and % of baseline values. Results: The median (Min-Max) PEF absolute variation was 25 (5 - 85), 40 (0 - 70), 70 (25 - 83) and 60 (15 - 90) l/min for tests A, B, C and D, respectively. The median PEF % baseline variation was 7. 6, 11. 0, 15. 0, 13. 3, and median PFE % predicted variation was 6. 0, 8. 7, 12. 7 and 10. 7 for tests A, B, C and D, respectively. The results of tests C and D were significantly superior to those of tests A and B (p < 0. 01) based on the three methods evaluated. There {{was no significant difference}} between the results of tests C and D. Conclusion: The antistatic treatment of a small volume spacer device using a solution of water and detergent can improve the antiasthmatic effect of inhaled drugs delivered by metered-dose inhaler, as occurred with the salbutamol in this study. This fact can be more relevant concerning the treatment with inhaled steroids for asthma...|$|E
6000|$|Various Hamlets lie {{sprinkled}} about: very sleepy, rusty, irregular little places; huts and cattle-stalls huddled down, as if shaken from a bag; much straw, thick thatch and crumbly mud-brick; {{but looking}} warm and peaceable, for the Four-footed and the Two-footed; which latter, if {{you speak to}} them, are solid reasonable people, with energetic German eyes and hearts, though so ill-lodged. These Hamlets, needing shelter and spring-water, stand generally in some slight hollow, if well up the Height, as Rorschach is; sometimes, if near the bottom, they are nestled in a sudden dell or gash,--work of the primeval rains, accumulating from above, and ploughing out their way. The rains, we can see, have been busy; but there is seldom the least stream visible, bottom being too sandy and porous. On the western slope, there is in our time a kind of coal, or coal-dust, dug up; {{in the way of}} quarrying, not of mining; and one or two big chasms of this sort are confusedly busy: the natives mix this valuable coal-dust with water, mould it into bricks, and so use as fuel: one of the features of these hamlets is the strange black bricks, standing on edge about the cottage-doors, to <b>drip,</b> and <b>dry</b> in the sun. For this or for other reasons, the westward slope appears to be the best; and has a major share of hamlets on it: Rossbach is high up, and looks over upon Mucheln, and its dim belfry and appurtenances, which lie safe across the hollow, perhaps two miles off,--safe from Friedrich, if there were eatables and lodging to be had in such a place. Friedrich's left wing is in Rossbach. Bedra where Friedrich's right wing is; Branderode where the Soubise right is; then Grost; Schevenroda, Zeuchfeld, Pettstadt, Lunstadt,--especially Reichartswerben, where Soubise's right will come to be: these the reader may take note of in his Map. Several of them lie in ashes just then; plundered, replundered, and at last set fire to; so busy have Soubise's hungry people been, of late, in the Country they came to [...] "deliver." [...] The Freiburg road, the Naumburg road, both towards Merseburg, cross this Height; straight like the string, Saale by Weissenfels being the bow.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Flowing water quickly {{saturates}} {{dry surface}} soil as water advances in irrigation furrows. Conversely, rain wets surface soil before runoff occurs. Rapid wetting destroys soil aggregates as water quickly displaces trapped air. Slowly increasing soil water content prior to saturation increases aggregate stability. We hypothesized that instantaneous wetting of dry surface soil during furrow irrigation results in greater soil erosion than if furrow soil was pre—wet immediately before irrigation. We conducted ten irrigation trials on 27 —m long furrows {{in three different}} fields. Soil was pre—wet by surface drip irrigation (12 to 14 nun) or by lightly spraying with water (1. 3 mm). Pre—wetting with drip irrigation significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced soil loss for 5 of the first 7 irrigations compared to dry soil. The pre—wetting effect on soil loss was not always dramatic, but cumulative soil loss for the first seven irrigations was significantly different among the three treatments: 16, 30, and 56 Mg ha- 1 for <b>drip,</b> spray, and <b>dry</b> treatments, respectively. The dry treatment never had less soil loss than either pre—wetting treatment. Pre—wetting furrow soil by spraying apparently did not add enough water to stabilize soil aggregates and decrease soil erosion for most irrigations. This study demonstrated that erosion was greater when water flowed over initially dry soil, which is typical with furrow irrigation, compared to water flowing over initially wet soil, which occurs during rain...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{monitoring}} of subterranean microclimatic and hydrological conditions can delineate factors influencing speleothem-based climate proxy data and helps in their interpretation. Multi-annual {{monitoring of}} water stable isotopes, air temperature, relative humidity, drip rates and PCO 2 in surface, soil and cave air gives detailed insight into dripwater isotopes, temperature and ventilation dynamics in Mawmluh Cave, NE India. Water isotopes vary seasonally {{in response to}} monsoonal rainfall. Most negative values are observed during late Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), with a less than one-month lag between ISM rainfall and <b>drip</b> response. Two <b>dry</b> season and two less-well distinguishable wet season dynamic ventilation regimes are identified in Mawmluh Cave. Cave air temperatures higher than surface air result in chimney ventilation during dry season nights. Dry season days show reduced ventilation due to cool cave air relative to surface air and cold-air lake development. Both, high water flow and cooler-than-surface cave air temperatures result in air inflow during wet season nights. Wet season daytime ventilation is governed by river flow, but is prone to stagnation and development of cold air lakes. CO 2 monitoring indicates that PCO 2 levels vary at diurnal to annual scale. Mawmluh Cave seems to act as CO 2 sink during part of the dry season. While very likely, additional data is needed to establish whether wet season cave air CO 2 levels rise above atmospheric values. Drip behavior is highly nonlinear, related to effective recharge dynamics, and further complicated by human influence on the epikarst aquifer...|$|R

40|$|Background. Intradialytic blood {{pressure}} (BP) profiles {{have been associated}} with all-cause mortality, but its path-ophysiology remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that intradialytic changes in BP reflect excess volume. Methods. The dry weight reduction in hypertensive hae-modialysis patients (<b>DRIP)</b> trial probed <b>dry</b> weight in 100 prevalent haemodialysis patients; 50 patients who did not have their dry weight probed served as time controls. In this post hoc analysis, intradialytic BP was recorded at each of the 30 dialysis treatments during the trial. The slope of intradialytic BP over dialysis was calculated by the log of BP regressed over time. Using a linear mixed model, we compared these slopes between control and ul-trafiltration groups at baseline and over time, tested the effect of dry weight reduction on these slopes and finally tested the ability of change in intradialytic slopes to pre-dict change in interdialytic systolic BP. Results. At baseline, intradialytic systolic and diastolic BP dropped at a rate of ∼ 3 %/h (P < 0. 0001). Over the course of the trial, compared to the control group, the slopes steepened in the ultrafiltration group for systolic but not diastolic BP. Those who lost the most post-dialysis weight from baseline to 4 weeks and baseline to 8 weeks also ex-perienced the greatest steepening of slopes. Each percent per hour steepening of the intradialytic systolic BP slope was associated with 0. 71 mmHg [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01 – 1. 42, P = 0. 048] reduction in interdialytic am-bulatory systolic pressure. Conclusions. Intradialytic BP changes appear to be asso-ciated with change in dry weight among haemodialysis pa-tients. Among long-term haemodialysis patients, intradialytic hypertension may, thus, be a sign of volume overload...|$|R
