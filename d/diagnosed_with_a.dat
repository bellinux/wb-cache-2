5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} of selected demographic, socioeconomic status (SES), and psychological characteristics was examined {{in interviews with}} 176 Northern Plains American Indian mothers whose children were referred to diagnostic clinics for evaluation of developmental disabilities, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Thirty-nine mothers had children <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> FASD (Group 1), 107 had children who were not <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> FASD or other major disability (Group 2), and 30 additional mothers with normally performing children, matched by age, sex, and reservation <b>with</b> those <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> FASD, were recruited as a comparison group (Group 3). Analysis revealed statistically signifi cant differences (p <. 001) in alcohol consumption among all three groups, and a statistically signifi cant difference in the mean Total Distress score among the three groups of mothers, F(2, 176) = 9. 60, p <. 001, with Group 3 having a lower mean score than Groups 1 and 2. Sequential regression analysis revealed that the quantity of alcohol consumed prior to knowledge of pregnancy, when combined with SES and Total Distress, was more highly associated <b>with</b> having <b>a</b> child <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> FASD (R 2 =. 206) than was quantity of alcohol consumed alone...|$|R

5|$|During the 2007 season, Harris was <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> torn labrum in {{her right}} hip which {{occurred}} during a goal kick. Harris did not miss any games following the injury and instead switched to mainly using her left leg and dealt with the pain. Dorrance again employed the two-goalkeeper method, as Harris split time with junior goalkeeper, Anna Rodenbough. The two goalkeepers alternated starts and played for half of each game. Harris played in 19 games and made 9 starts, playing a total of 1120 minutes. She allowed nine goals and recorded 29 saves, giving a 0.763 save percentage. UNC lost their match against Notre Dame {{in the third round}} of the 2007 NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament on November 24, 2007.|$|E
