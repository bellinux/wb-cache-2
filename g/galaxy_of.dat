5|$|Corona Australis' {{location}} {{near the}} Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen. NGC 6768 is a magnitude 11.2 object 35′ south of IC 1297. It {{is made up}} of two galaxies merging, one of which is an elongated elliptical <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> classification E4 and the other a lenticular <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> classification S0. IC 4808 is a <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of Beta Sagittarii. However, amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes. The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.|$|E
5|$|Antlia {{contains}} many faint galaxies, the brightest {{of which is}} NGC 2997 at magnitude 10.6. It is a loosely wound face-on spiral <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> type Sc. Though nondescript in most amateur telescopes, it presents bright clusters of young stars and many dark dust lanes in photographs. Discovered in 1997, the Antlia Dwarf is a 14.8m dwarf spheroidal galaxy that belongs to the Local Group of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-step process}} <b>of</b> <b>galaxy</b> {{formation}} is presented. As objects generated first, we consider quasars (QSOs) formed at the cosmological redshift z= 4 - 10. The cooled shells at the shock fronts generated by QSO explosions are split into <b>galaxies</b> <b>of</b> the mass 1010 - 11 Msun. Clusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> are formed at {{the collision of}} the cold shells, suggesting the large-scale shell-like or chain-like distributions <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We can explain the masses, sizes, and space densities <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> and clusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{studies on the}} {{correlation}} functions <b>of</b> <b>galaxies,</b> <b>of</b> clusters <b>of</b> <b>galaxies,</b> even <b>of</b> superclusters (e. g., Groth and Peebles 1977; Davies and Peebles 1983; Kalinkov and Kuneva 1985, 1986; Bahcall 1988 and references therein) but not so many on pairs and groups <b>of</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Results <b>of</b> the calculations of two-point correlation fuctions for some catalogs of pairs and groups <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> are given. It is assumed that the distances to pairs and groups <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> are given by their mean redshifts according to R = sigma (sup n, sub i- 1) V sub i/nH (sub 0), where n is the number <b>of</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{in the system and}} H sub 0 = 100 km s(exp - 1) Mpc(exp - 1) ...|$|R
5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Every <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} Local Group has {{an associated}} group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.|$|E
5|$|Herschel also {{observed}} three faint galaxies, {{two of which}} are interacting with each other. NGC 2508 is a lenticular <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> thirteenth-magnitude, estimated at 205 million light-years (63 million parsecs) distance with a diameter of 80 thousand light-years (25 thousand parsecs). Named as a single object by Herschel, NGC 2402 is actually a pair of near-adjacent galaxies that appear to be interacting with each other. Only of fourteenth- and fifteenth-magnitudes respectively, the elliptical and spiral galaxy are thought to be approximately 245 million light-years distant, and each measure 55,000 light-years in diameter.|$|E

5|$|NGC 2613 is {{a spiral}} <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> {{magnitude}} 10.5 which appears spindle-shaped {{as it is}} almost edge-on to observers on Earth. Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy which lies some 30 million light-years away. It is notable for having a black hole around a million solar masses at its centre. Known as a starburst galaxy due to very high rates of star formation, it has a bluish colour due to the huge numbers of young stars within it.|$|E
5|$|NGC 821 is an E6 {{elliptical}} galaxy. It {{is unusual}} {{because it has}} hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away. Another unusual galaxy in Aries is Segue 2. Segue 2 is a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> the Milky Way, recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization.|$|E
5|$|The closest analogs {{within the}} Milky Way <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> the stars {{producing}} long gamma-ray bursts are likely the Wolf–Rayet stars, extremely hot and massive stars, which have shed {{most or all}} of their hydrogen to radiation pressure. Eta Carinae and WR 104 have been cited as possible future gamma-ray burst progenitors. It is unclear if any star in the Milky Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma-ray burst.|$|E

5|$|The {{constellation}} {{does not}} lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, {{and there are no}} prominent star clusters. NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of active star formation. NGC 37 is a lenticular <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. Robert's Quartet (composed of the irregular galaxy NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which {{are in the process of}} colliding and merging. They are within a circle of radius of 1.6 arcmin, corresponding to about 75,000 light-years. Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole—the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E

In 2007, he completed 174 of 254 passes for 2,201 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions with a 104.8 passer rating. He led the league in passer rating and passing yards while also tying Casey Bramlet for the league lead in touchdown passes. O'Sullivan recorded the league's only two 300 passing yards games of the 2007 season and threw for 374 yards in Week 9 against the Hamburg Sea Devils. On June 21, 2007, O'Sullivan and Cologne Centurions running back Derrick Ross were named the 2007 NFL Europa Co-Offensive MVPs. They both earned All-NFL Europa honors as well. O'Sullivan started all ten of the team's games, leading them to a 7–3 record and a berth in World Bowl XV, which the Galaxy lost to the Hamburg Sea Devils by a score of 37–28. He completed 23 of 39 passes for 299 yards and two touchdowns with one interception in World Bowl XV.|$|E

Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great <b>Galaxy</b> <b>of</b> Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|E

5|$|Shaktism {{is known}} for its various sub-traditions of Tantra, as well as a <b>galaxy</b> <b>of</b> goddesses with {{respective}} systems. It consists of the Vidyapitha and Kulamārga. The pantheon of goddesses in Shaktism grew after the decline of Buddhism in India, wherein Hindu and Buddhist goddesses were combined to form the Mahavidya, a list of ten goddesses. The most common aspects of Devi found in Shaktism include Durga, Kali, Amba, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Parvati and Tripurasundari. The goddess-focussed tradition is particularly popular in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Tripura, Mithila (North Bihar) and Nepal and the neighboring regions, which it celebrates through festivals such as the Durga puja. Shaktism's ideas have influenced Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions, with the goddess considered the Shakti of Vishnu and Shiva respectively, and revered prominently in numerous Hindu temples and festivals.|$|E
