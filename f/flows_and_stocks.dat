50|$|Material flow {{analysis}} (MFA) (also {{referred to as}} substance {{flow analysis}} (SFA)) is an analytical method to quantify <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> of materials or substances in a well-defined system. MFA is an important tool to study the bio-physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of industrial ecology or anthropogenic, urban, social and industrial metabolism. MFA is used to study material, substance, or product flows across different industrial sectors or within ecosystems. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation, for example, for tracking nutrient flows through a waste water treatment plant. When combined with {{an assessment of the}} costs associated with material flows this business-oriented application of MFA is called Material Flow Cost Accounting. MFA is an important tool to study the circular economy and to devise material flow management. Since the 1990s, the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer-reviewed journals that publish MFA-related work include the Journal of Industrial Ecology, Ecological Economics, Environmental Science and Technology, and Resources, Conservation, and Recycling.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} carbon subsidies and taxes {{in the form of}} carbon credit allocations on forest owners' land use and harvest decisions.

Using a real options model with uncertain future timber prices we examine the effect on the timing of harvest the replanting-abandonment decision and the value of a forest. We show that forests {{are less likely to be}} converted to alternative land uses under all three regimes relative to the situation without any carbon credit allocation. We also show that the <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> schemes lengthen optimal rotations while lump sum allocations shorten them.

40|$|International audienceEnd-of-life {{products}} contain valuable {{materials that}} should be efficiently recovered {{to contribute to the}} sustainable use of resources. Materialflowanalysis is known as an efficient tool to map material <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> across the economy. This tool is increasingly applied to waste recovery, although its application to specific products is rather limited. In this paper, a comprehensive step by step method to build an end-oflife product-specific material flow analysis is proposed. Its main originality is to mix a top-down approach based on the analysis of databases with a bottom-up approach resorting to the contribution of experts involved in the product and material life cycles. Another contribution of the paper is to present results of the method when applied to aluminum coming from end-of-life commercial vehicles. The method shows useful results concerning the product and material: identification and quantification of relevant processes and flows; identification of material sinks in a region; graphical presentation of material <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>stocks.</b> For example, it was shown that most of the 129, 000 tons of aluminum contained in commercial vehicles leaving use in Europe in 2003 was recovered locally.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} conserve the non-renewable resource phosphorus (P), <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> of P must be known at national, regional and global scales. P {{is a key}} non-renewable resource because its use as fertilizer cannot be substituted posing a constraint on the global food production in the long-term. This paper presents a methodology to establish country-wide P balances that emphasises resource use. We develop a material flow analysis (MFA) model that comprises all relevant <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> <b>stocks</b> of P in five subsystems, seven processes and 36 material flows. For quantification, statistical data from economic and agricultural sources as well as available information about P partitioning in natural and anthropogenic processes are used. Special {{attention is paid to}} data gaps and uncertainties. The model was tested in two case studies on P management in Turkey and Austria. MFA appears to be a tool well suited for establishing country-wide P balances, provided that national statistics are well-structured and accessible. If a common approach is used for modelling P-flows and stocks, regional and national balances can be compared and linked towards larger scale P balances for an improved management of the resource...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} discounting, stochasticity, {{non-linearities}} and maximum decay upon an optimal corrective tax are analyzed using stochastic dynamic optimization. Optimal corrective taxes are derived as explicit feedback control {{laws in the}} presence of both <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> externalities when the decay of aggregated pollution is subject to a general stochastic process. This represents an adaptive approach to regulation of the environment. The problem has been solved using a non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The model applied is quite general in the state variable, accumulated pollution, and in the control variable, production. The objective function is to maximize expected social welfare defined as the sum of consumers‚Äô and producers‚Äô surplus adjusted for externalities. Social welfare is not assumed to be separable in production and accumulated pollution. The main result is that the optimal tax is more sensitive to discounting and non-linearities than to stochasticity.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature in}} international and comparative political economy {{has focused on}} the how the mobility of capital affects the ability of governments to tax and regulate firms. The conventional wisdom holds that governments are in competition with each other to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Nation-states observe the fiscal and regulatory decisions of competitor governments, and are forced to either respond with policy changes or risk losing foreign direct investment, along with the politically salient jobs that come with these investments. The political economy of FDI suggests a network of investments with complicated dependencies. We propose an empirical strategy for modeling investment patterns in 24 advanced industrialized countries from 1985 - 2000. Using bilateral FDI <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> data, we examine the nature of the networks in relation to a set of covariates - in particular differences in tax rates between pairs of nations. Our statistical model is based on the methodology developed by Hoff (2005), Westveld (2007), Westveld and Hoff (2009 b). The model allows the temporal examination of each nation 2 ÃÜ 7 s activity level in investing and attractiveness to investors. Additionally, the model considers the temporal examination of reciprocity between pairs of nations, as well as the notion of clusterability. For both the <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> data, there exist a data set based on reports from senders (out-reported-data) and a data set based on reports from receivers (in-reported-data). We extend the model by treating these two data sets as independent replicates (for the <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stock</b> data separately), conditional on a mean parameter representing an underlying value of FDI, along with random effects within the variance portion of the distribution of the response that allows for discrepancy between the two data points (in and out data).
