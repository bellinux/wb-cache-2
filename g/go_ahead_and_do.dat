In mid-1990, Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske as CEO of Sega of America. Kalinske developed a four-point plan for sales of the Genesis: cut the console's price, develop games for the American market with a new American team, continue aggressive advertising campaigns, and ship Sonic the Hedgehog with the Genesis as a pack-in game. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, [...] "I hired you {{to make the decisions}} for Europe and the Americas, so <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it."

[...] Magazines praised Sonic {{as one of the greatest}} games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) decided to purchase a Genesis instead. However, the release of a CD-based add-on for the Genesis, the Sega CD (known as Mega-CD outside of North America), had been commercially disappointing.|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's {{one of the reasons}} I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli {{to direct the}} song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par {{in comparison to the}} quality of the music. They scrapped the first video and re-filmed it with director Andy Morahan, changing the plot, scenery and imagery. After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how [...] "the special treatment really upset" [...] him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, [...] "they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal." [...] Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000. After the reports were made, Don Ienner, the president of Sony, refuted the claims, calling them [...] "total bullshit" [...] although admitting, [...] "If we're going to take the time and effort that we did with Mariah, on every level, then we're going to image her the right way. If it costs a few extra dollars to make a splash in terms of the right imaging, you <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-1990, Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske {{to replace}} Katz as CEO of Sega of America. [...] Although Kalinske {{initially}} {{knew little about}} the video game market, he surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the razor and blades business model, he developed a four-point plan: cut {{the price of the}} console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with a new title, Sonic the Hedgehog. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, [...] "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Magazines praised Sonic {{as one of the greatest}} games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the release of the international version of Nintendo's Super Famicom— the Super Nintendo Entertainment System or SNES—decided to purchase a Genesis instead. [...] Nintendo's console debuted against an established competitor, while NEC's TurboGrafx-16 failed to gain traction, and NEC soon pulled out of the market. [...] In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog, the Sega Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the 16-bit console market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Dees (and {{his record}} company) made a request of Marvin Fisher, {{the owner of}} the {{copyright}} in the music of the song [...] "When Sunny Gets Blue", for permission to use the song in a parody of the performance by Johnny Mathis. Fisher refused to grant permission for the use. Dees decided to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> a parody even without the permission of the copyright holder, using about 29 seconds of the song in a parody album titled Put It Where the Moon Don't Shine.|$|E

50|$|Joe Dante {{says the}} {{financing}} of the movie was difficult.Matinee got made through a fluke. The company that was paying for us {{went out of business}} and didn't have any money. Universal, which was the distributor, had put in a little money, and we went to them and begged them to buy into the whole movie, and to their everlasting sorrow they <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it.

2500|$|There was {{speculation}} that Gable's physically demanding role in The Misfits {{contributed to his}} sudden death soon after filming was completed. In an interview with Louella Parsons, published soon after Gable's death, Kay Gable said, [...] "It wasn't the physical exertion that killed him. It was the horrible tension, the eternal waiting, waiting, waiting. He waited around forever, for everybody. He'd get so angry that he'd just <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> anything to keep occupied." [...] Monroe said that she and Kay had become close during the filming and would refer to Clark as [...] "Our Man", while Arthur Miller, observing Gable on location, noted, [...] "no hint of affront ever showed on his face".|$|E

2500|$|In the {{documentary}} Last of the Gladiators, Knievel discussed {{the crash of}} a 1970 Pepsi-Cola sponsored jump in Yakima, Washington. Knievel knew the jump was very questionable, but stated, [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it anyway. When you give your word to somebody that you're going to do something, you've gotta do it." [...] In the 1971 biopic, George Hamilton (as Evel) emphasizes in the opening monologue that a man does not go back on his word.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the video, Curiel stated, [...] "The {{funny thing}} is, people take us really seriously. We are a serious band, {{but we know}} that, at times, we don't have to take {{ourselves}} so seriously. We have fun. That's why we <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> a video like 'Boom.'

5000|$|Inappropriate Joe: Joe has a {{tendency}} to respond to other people's comments and actions the exact opposite to what society expects.

5000|$|From 1975 through 1982, {{then again}} in 1987 and 1989 through 1991, Lee made various one/off {{appearances}} as Love with mostly pick up bands but was inactive {{for much of}} the 80s. On July 7, 1986 at Summerfest - Return of the 60's at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino County, California, {{one of the highlights of}} the first day was supposed to be a Love reunion with Lee and Bryan MacLean.

Lyman called a halt; and there, in the deep gloom of the overhanging branches, he began to whisper a plan of assault upon that house, which made the gloom more depressing than it was before. It was a crucial moment; we realised, with a cold suddenness, that here was no jest--we were standing {{face to face with}} actual war. We were equal to the occasion. In our response there was no hesitation, no indecision: we said that if Lyman wanted to meddle with those soldiers, he could <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it; but if he waited for us to follow him, he would wait a long time.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was known}} for his essays, most {{particularly}} The Power of the Powerless, in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to [...] "live within a lie" [...] under the communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: [...] "...we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how.

He set there and took his own time to unscrew his heelplates and cut out his plugs and stick in the di'monds and screw on his plates again. He allowed we would steal the bogus swag and wait all night for him to come up and get drownded, and by George it's just what we done! I think it was powerful smart." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{musical score}} for Mad Max was {{composed}} and conducted by Australian composer Brian May (not {{to be confused}} with the guitarist of the English rock band Queen).
