40|$|Resource-exchange-based {{incentive}} {{mechanisms are}} investigated for both selection cooperation (SC) and selection relaying (SR) networks using the cooperative bargaining game approach. Consider a user node that {{can act as}} a source as well as a potential relay for other nodes, and it is selfish to share an own resource with others only if the data rate achieved through cooperative relaying is not lower than that achieved without the cooperation by consuming the same amount of the resource. In the SC scenario, only one relay is allotted to a source. Then, a two-person SC game (SCG) is formulated to address the joint bandwidth and power allocation problem for two cooperative nodes. In the SR scenario, a set of relays is allotted to a source. Hence, we propose a one-to-many SR game (SRG) to address the multinode cooperation case. For both SCG and SRG, specific <b>data</b> <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> are designed to accommodate both the bandwidth resource (in the form of transmission time) and the energy resource (in the form of transmission power) for a cooperative node. To achieve the system efficiency and per-node fairness objectives simultaneously, the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) method is used to solve both SCG and SRG. The existence and uniqueness of the NBS are proved. Moreover, theoretical analysis and simulations are provided to testify as to the effectiveness of the proposed SCG and SRG for efficient and fair resource allocation in the SC and SR scenarios, respectively. © 1967 - 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Developments in {{the wind}} power {{industry}} have enabled {{a new generation of}} wind turbines with longer blades, taller towers, higher efficiency, and lower maintenance costs due to the maturity of related technologies. Nevertheless, wind turbines are still blind machines because the control center is responsible for managing and controlling individual wind turbines that are turned on or off according to demand for electricity. In this paper, we propose a communication network architecture for smart-wind power farms (Smart-WPFs). The proposed architecture is designed for wind turbines to communicate directly and share sensing data in order to maximize power generation, WPF availability, and turbine efficiency. We also designed a sensor <b>data</b> <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> to carry sensing data from different wind turbine parts such as the rotor, transformer, nacelle, etc. The data frame includes a logical node ID (LNID), sensor node ID (SNID), sensor type (ST), and sensor data based on the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400 - 25 standard.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modulation scheme {{in the time}} domain based on On-Off-Keying and proposes various compatible supports for different types of image sensors. The content {{of this article is}} a sub-proposal to the IEEE 802. 15. 7 r 1 Task Group (TG 7 r 1) aimed at Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) using an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is indispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter image sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds, sampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional communications (i. e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous communication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical limitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying frame rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed performance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of camera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested along with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms. A significant feature of our novel <b>data</b> <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is that it can support both typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low frame rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate is lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i. e., no less than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority voting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i. e., when the frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by an error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in decoding and later corrected by external code. Numerical results and valuable analysis are also included to indicate the capability of the proposed schemes. Comment: 24 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables, Sensors Journa...|$|E

40|$|In this study, damage {{localization}} of <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> from seismic acceleration responses is explored {{using the}} DLV technique and ARX model for system identification. The {{concept of the}} DLV method is to identify the members with zero stress under some specific loading patterns derived by interrogating the changes in flexibility matrix of the structure {{before and after the}} damage state. Success of the DLV method for damage localization lies on the ability to identify the flexibility matrix. The ARX model, a discrete-time non-parametric auto-regressive system identification technique is adopted to identify the modal parameters (natural frequencies, transfer functions and mode shapes) from which the flexibility matrices of the intact and damaged structures are constructed. To explore the effectiveness of the DLV method, a five-storey steel model frame with diagonal bracings was considered for seismic shaking table tests. The damage conditions of the structure were simulated by partially removing some of the diagonals. With the flexibility matrices of both the intact and damaged structures synthesized on a truncated modal basis, the damage locations have been successfully identified by the DLV method for either single or multiple damage conditions, regardless of the damage locations.

IEEE 802. 16 network provides broadband wireless access to connect the Legacy LAN to Internet. Furthermore, the Mesh mode of IEEE 802. 16 can support to construct a large area via BS and SSs.

40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a {{means of}} {{identifying}} damage from the structural response to environmental loads. Real-time SHM offers rapid assessment of structural safety by owners and civil defense authorities enabling more optimal response to major events. This research presents an real-time, convex, integral-based SHM methods for seismic events that use only acceleration measurements and infrequently measured displacements, and a non-linear baseline model including hysteretic dynamics and permanent deformation. The method thus identifies time-varying pre-yield and post-yield stiffness, elastic and plastic components of displacement and final residual displacement. For a linear baseline model it identifies only timevarying stiffness. Thus, the algorithm identifies all key measures of structural damage affecting the immediate safety or use of the structure, and the long-term cost of repair and retrofit. The algorithm is tested with simulated and measured El Centro earthquake response data from a four storey non-linear steel <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> and simulated <b>data</b> from a two storey non-linear hybrid rocking <b>structure.</b> The steel <b>frame</b> and rocking <b>structures</b> exhibit contrasting dynamic response and are thus used to highlight the impact of baseline model selection in SHM.
