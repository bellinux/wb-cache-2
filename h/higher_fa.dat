50|$|Some {{studies suggest}} {{a link between}} FA and aggression, but the {{evidence}} is mixed. In humans, criminal offenders show greater FA than nonoffenders. However, other studies report that human males with <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> show less physical aggression and less anger. Females show no association between FA and physical aggression, but some {{research has suggested that}} older female adolescents with higher facial FA are less hostile. The type of aggression being studied may account for the mixed evidence that is seen here. For example, one study found that females with <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> demonstrated higher levels of reactive aggression in response to high levels of provocation, whereas high FA males showed more reactive aggression under low levels of provocation.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{speculation}} that inbreeding contributes towards FA. One study on young Turkish males demonstrated that, although inbred individuals show more asymmetry in observed bilateral traits, {{the differences were}} not significant. Furthermore, ant colonies created by an inbreeding queen do not show significantly <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> than those produced by a non-inbreeding queen.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between FA, health and susceptibility to disease {{has also been}} studied in non-human animals.

50|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that poverty and lack of food during development may contribute to greater levels of FA. Infectious diseases {{can also lead to}} FA, as studies have repeatedly shown that those with <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> report more infections. Alternatively, this association between levels of FA and infections may be {{due to a lack of}} immunity to diseases, as mentioned earlier (see 'Genetic factors'). Fluctuating asymmetry in human males is also seen to positively correlate with levels of oxidative stress. This process occurs when an organism creates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to ROS-neutralising antioxidants. Oxidative stress may mediate the association seen between high FA and infection amounts during development.|$|E
50|$|FA {{may also}} {{result from a}} lack of genetic {{immunity}} to diseases, as those with <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> show less effective immune responses. This is further supported by evidence showing an association between FA and the number of respiratory infections experienced by an individual, such that those with higher levels of FA experience more infections. Increased prevalence of parasites and diseases in an organism is also seen more in individuals with greater levels of FA. However, the research in this field is predominantly correlational, so caution must be taken when inferring causation. For example, rather than a lack of immunity causing FA, FA may weaken the immune responses of an organism, or there may be another factor involved.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that individuals with lower levels of FA may engage in more biologically costly behaviours such as recreational drug use and risky body modifications such as piercings and tattoos. These ideas have been proposed in the context of Zahavi's handicap principle, which argues that highly costly behaviours or traits serve as signals of an organism's genetic quality. The relationship between FA and behaviours with high health risks has received mixed support. Individuals with body piercings and tattoos (which increase risk of blood-borne infections) have been shown to have lower levels of FA, but individuals with lower FA do not engage in any more recreational drug use than those with <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{link between}} FA and health {{has also been}} {{investigated}} in non-primates. In three gazelle species (Gazella cuvieri; Gazella dama; Gazella dorcas), for instance, FA {{has been linked to}} a range of blood parameters associated with health in mammals, although the specific relevance of these blood parameters for these gazelle species was not examined. It has also been found that, among Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus), <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> was slightly negatively related to both antler size and overall body mass (traits thought to indicate overall condition). Antlers more involved in fighting were found to be more symmetrical than those not involved, and antler asymmetry at reproductive age was lower than in development or at post-reproductive age.|$|E
50|$|Charles Darwin {{suggested}} that dance is a signal for natural selection in courtship. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) measures quality of dancing, where higher scores indicate lower quality. <b>Higher</b> <b>FA</b> individuals are less attractive. They {{are more likely}} to engage with other FA individuals. A motion capture study of videos of Jamaican dancers, altered to make the dancers unrecognizable used FA ratings to categorize the dancers. Male and female subjects assessed dancing ability and identified the dancer's sex. Symmetrical dancers were rated as significantly better than others, but female symmetry accounted for less than it did in males. Female evaluators more strongly preferred symmetrical male dancers than male evaluators, while there was no gender difference in ratings of female dancers. Lower FA male evaluators were less likely to prefer dances performed by symmetrical females.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{conspicuity}} and detection rate of hypointense lesions on T 1 -weighted (T 1 w) gradient echo (GRE) sequences {{with low}} and <b>high</b> flip angles (<b>FA)</b> in hepatocyte phase {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) using gadoxetate disodium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) -compliant study was Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved. The study population consisted of patients with hypointense liver lesions undergoing MRI with gadoxetate disodium, with hepatocyte-phase fat suppressed 3 D T 1 w GRE sequences at both low (10 - 12 °) and high (30 - 35 °) FA. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for liver parenchyma vs. large lesions and common bile duct (CBD) vs. liver. Three radiologists each assigned a conspicuity score (CS) for each lesion detected at low or <b>high</b> <b>FA.</b> Paired Student's t-tests compared the lesion detection (LD) rate using only the hepatocyte phase data set compared with the entire MRI examination, and CS for low and <b>high</b> <b>FA.</b> RESULTS: In all, 57 large and 70 small lesions were identified in 18 patients. Average LD and CS were significantly greater at <b>high</b> <b>FA</b> versus low FA overall (LD 89. 0 % vs. 79. 5 %; CS 2. 8 vs. 2. 2; P < 0. 05) and for small lesions (81. 4 % vs. 65. 7 %; 2. 5 vs. 1. 8; P < 0. 05). Average liver-to-lesion CNR for large lesions and CBD-to-liver CNR was significantly greater at <b>high</b> <b>FA</b> (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Increasing the FA in hepatocyte phase MRI with gadoxetate disodium improves hypointense lesion detection and conspicuity, particularly for small lesions. J. Magn. Reson.

50|$|Toxins and poisons are {{considered}} to increase FA. Pregnancy sickness is argued to be an adaptation for avoiding toxins during foetal development. Research has reported that when a mother has no sickness or a sickness that extends beyond week 12 of gestation, the offspring shows <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> (as demonstrated by measuring thigh circumferences). This suggests that when a mother fails to expel environmental toxins, this creates stress and developmental instability for the foetus, later leading to increased asymmetry in that individual. Greater exposure to pollution {{may also be a}} fundamental cause of FA. Research on skull characteristics of Baltic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) demonstrated that those born after 1960 (marking an increase in environmental pollution) had increased levels of asymmetry. Also, shrews (Crocidura russula) from more polluted areas show higher levels of asymmetry. Radioactive contamination may also increase FA levels, as mice (Apodemus flavicollis) living closer to the failed Chernobyl reactor show greater asymmetry.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{levels of}} FA {{have been linked}} to higher levels of some mental health difficulties. For instance, it has been shown that, among {{university}} students, <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> is associated with higher levels of schizotypy. Depression scores {{have been found to be}} higher in men, but not women, with higher levels of FA. One study by Shackelford and Larsen found that men and women with higher facial asymmetry reported more physiological complaints than those with lower facial asymmetry, and that both men and women with higher asymmetry experienced higher levels of psychological distress overall. For example, men with higher facial asymmetry experienced higher levels of depression compared to men with lower facial asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry has also been studied in relation to psychopathy. One study looking at offenders and non-offenders found that, although offenders had higher levels of FA overall, psychopathic offenders had lower levels of FA compared to offenders who did not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Additionally, offenders with the highest levels of psychopathy were found to have similar levels of FA to non-offenders.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that the female {{partners}} of men with lower levels of FA experience a higher number of copulatory orgasms, compared to the female partners of males with higher levels of FA. Other studies have also found that the voices of men and women with low fluctuating asymmetry are rated as more attractive, suggesting that voice may be indicative of developmental stability. Research has shown attractiveness ratings of men's scent are negatively correlated with FA, but FA is unrelated to attractiveness ratings for women's scent, and women's preferences for the scent of more symmetric men appears to limited to the most fertile phases of the menstrual cycle However, other research has failed to find changes in women's preferences for low FA across the menstrual cycle. Facial symmetry has been positively correlated with higher occurrences of mating. Also, one study used 3-D scans of male and female bodies, and showed videos of these scans to a group of individuals who rated the bodies on attractiveness. It was found that, for both males and females, lower levels of FA were associated with higher attractiveness ratings. It was also found that sex-typical joint configurations were rated as more attractive and linked to lower FA in men, but not women. Men with <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of attractiveness. Research has also provided evidence that FA is linked to extra-pair copulation, as women have been shown to prefer men with lower levels of FA as extra-pair partners. However, the literature is mixed regarding the relationship between attractiveness and FA. For example, in one study, altering images of faces to in a way that reduced asymmetry led to observers rating such faces as less, rather than more, attractive. Research by Van Dongen also found FA to be unrelated to attractiveness, physical strength and level of masculinity in both men and women.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to use diffusion tensor imaging to detect possible differences in white matter integrity between cognitively normal elderly apoE 2 carriers and apoE 3 / 3 controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine cognitively normal elderly individuals (19 heterozygous carriers of the apoE 2 allele, 20 apoE 3 / 3 subjects as controls) underwent diffusion tensor MR imaging on a 4 T scanner. Fractional anisotropy, MD, and axial and radial diffusivity were compared using a ROI approach. In addition, an exploratory whole-brain analysis of fractional anisotropy between the 2 groups was undertaken using TBSS. RESULTS: apoE 2 carriers had <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> in the posterior cingulate white matter (P. 01) and anterior corpus callosum (P. 005) than apoE 3 / 3 controls, secondary to lower radial diffusivity. No significant differences in the FA of the posterior corpus callosum, anterior cingulate white matter, or parahippocampal white matter were seen. Whole-brain TBSS analysis detected regions of <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> in the apoE 2 group in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, right thalamus, and the bilateral anterior limbs of the internal capsule, in addition to the posterior cingulum and corpus callosum (P. 005).

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between regional connectivity in the brain white matter {{and the presence of}} psychotic personality traits, in healthy subjects with psychotic traits. Thirteen healthy controls were administered the MMPI- 2, to assess psychotic traits and, according to MMPI results, a dichotomization into a group of "high-psychotic" and "low-psychotic" was performed. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used as a non-invasive measure, in order to obtain information about the fractional anisotropy (FA), an intravoxel index of local connectivity and, by means of a voxelwise approach, the between-group differences of the FA values were calculated. The "high-psychotic" group showed <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> in the left arcuate fasciculus. Subjects with low scores for psychotic traits had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> in the corpus callosum, right arcuate fasciculus, and fronto-parietal fibers.

5000|$|Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA) is the {{deviation}} from perfect bilateral symmetry in an organism. The more symmetrical an organism is, the better {{they are at}} handling developmental stress arising from environmental stress, genetic problems and developmental instability. Along with developmental stability, FA indicates the genetic fitness of an individual and will therefore affect sexual selection. Men with high facial symmetry are rated as more attractive, dominant, sexy, and healthy than their counterparts. Low FA males report more sexual partners across a lifetime, an earlier age of first sexual intercourse, and have more offspring than <b>high</b> <b>FA</b> men.

40|$|Horizontally {{transmitted}} parasites are broadly {{predicted to}} be more virulent, or costly to host fitness, than those with vertical transmission. This is mainly because vertical transmission, from host parent to offspring, explicitly links the reproductive interests of both parties. Underlying this prediction is a general assumption that parasite transmission success is positively correlated with its virulence. We report results where infection of larval yellow fever mosquitoes Aedes aeg�pti with the microsporidian Edha�ardia aedis was experimentally manipulated. The parasite’s complex life cycle allowed comparisons between estimates of horizontal and vertical transmission on host fitness.

Within sexes, a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>FA</b> was found only in females for wing width FA between the control and the lower concentration of lead.

40|$|Background: Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{in human}} brain structure is well recognised, but {{little is known}} about gender differences in white matter microstructure. We used diffusion tensor imaging to explore differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of microstructural integrity. Methods: A whole brain analysis of 135 matched subjects (90 men and 45 women) using a 1. 5 T scanner. A region of interest (ROI) analysis was used to confirm those results where proximity to CSF raised the possibility of partial-volume artefact.

Discussion: The size of the differences was substantial- of the same order as that attributed to some pathology – suggesting gender may be a potentially significant confound in unbalanced clinical studies. There are several previous reports of difference in the corpus callosum, though they disagree on the direction of difference; our findings in the cerebellum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus have not previously been noted.
