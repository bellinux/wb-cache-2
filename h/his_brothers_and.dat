5|$|Helmut Lent {{was born}} on 13 June 1918 in Pyrehne, {{district}} of Landsberg an der Warthe, Province of Brandenburg, Germany (now western Poland). He was the fifth child of Johannes Lent, a Lutheran minister and Marie Lent. Helmut Lent had two older brothers and two older sisters. His family was deeply religious; {{in addition to his}} father, both of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> both grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{relations}} between Edward and Llywelyn rapidly collapsed, leading to Edward invading North Wales in 1276 {{in an attempt}} to break Llywelyn's hold on power. During the war Edward built several major castles in order to better control the region and act as bases for campaigning. Edward was successful, and the Treaty of Aberconwy in 1277 reaffirmed English dominance, dividing up most of Llwelyn's lands amongst <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> Edward.|$|E

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} <b>his</b> <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E

5|$|Henry Ward Beecher {{was the son}} of Lyman Beecher, a Calvinist {{minister}} who became one of the best-known evangelists of his age. Several of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sisters became well-known educators and activists, most notably Harriet Beecher Stowe, who achieved worldwide fame with her abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Henry Ward Beecher graduated from Amherst College in 1834 and Lane Theological Seminary in 1837 before serving as a minister in Indianapolis and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Edward was tutored {{at home by}} Helen Bricka. When {{his parents}} {{travelled}} the British Empire for almost nine months {{following the death of}} Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sister for their remaining nursery years.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{was born}} in Hampshire County, Virginia (present-day West Virginia) in 1817. At the age of 18, he and his {{siblings}} were orphaned and he became a schoolteacher {{to provide for the}} education of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sisters. He later became a county surveyor, and studied jurisprudence. Monroe was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates (1850–1851), during which time he participated in the 1851 reform of the Constitution of Virginia. He was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1858 and in 1861, he purchased the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser newspaper, which he operated until the onset of the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Other {{families}} claiming {{descent from}} his nephews are spread through Stara Raška and Šumadija in Serbia. There was a tale that Pivljanin put a curse {{on his family}} after seven of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> cousins declined {{to join him in}} the hajduks. The Markovići brotherhood in Ljuljaci, Serbia, with the slava of St. John, settled {{in the first half of}} the 18th century, descending from one of Pivljanin's children. The Bajić brotherhood in Takovo, with the slava of St. George, numbering 30 households in 1960, also claim descent from him.|$|E
5|$|Simon Keynes saw Æthelstan's law-making as his {{greatest}} achievement. His reign predates the sophisticated {{state of the}} later Anglo-Saxon period, but his creation of the most centralised government England had yet seen, with the king and his council working strategically to ensure acceptance of his authority and laws, laid the foundations on which <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> nephews would create {{one of the wealthiest}} and most advanced systems of government in Europe. Æthelstan's reign built upon his grandfather's ecclesiastical programme, consolidating the local ecclesiastical revival and laying the foundation for the monastic reform movement later in the century.|$|E
5|$|After Barrington {{suffered}} a paralytic stroke in early 1919, {{he was unable}} to perform. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in poverty, although his fellow actors held benefits and made other efforts to help him, and <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> his neighbors in East Hagbourne, Berkshire, helped him as he became increasingly disabled and eventually unable even to speak. He died in 1922 while living at the St. James's Infirmary, Balham, in South London, at the age of 69 and is buried in Lower Morden Lane at the Morden Cemetery, also known as Battersea New Cemetery, in Surrey. On the 75th anniversary of Barrington's death, a granite monument with a photoplaque of Barrington as Pooh-Bah was dedicated to him at the Morden Cemetery, by members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society and others.|$|E

He was a consensus All-American and team MVP in 1942. He played in the 1943 East–West Shrine Game. He is well remembered, among other things, for his exploits in a 1942 game against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team, and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968, one year after his brother Francis. In 1981, he was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fourth class of inductees alongside his brothers. Only five Michigan football players earned this honor before him.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} at Morley Memorial Junior School he was taught by Roger Waters' mother, Mary. Later, in 1957, he {{attended}} Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (with Waters). His father {{died of cancer}} on 11 December 1961, {{less than a month}} before Barrett's 16th birthday. Also on this day, Barrett had left the entry in his diary blank. By this time, <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers. Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and The Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, to perform in their front room. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. At one point, Waters even organised a gig, a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.|$|E
5|$|Following the meeting, al-Bakri conferred with al-Shahbandar, {{who agreed}} to bring Damascus into the revolt, {{although}} this initial attempt did not materialize. As al-Atrash's men headed towards Damascus to launch their attack against French forces there, al-Bakri assembled some 260 armed volunteers from various neighborhoods and villages in and around Damascus, including al-Shaghour, Bab Musalla, al-Midan, and Jaramana. Al-Bakri maintained particularly close ties to Hasan al-Kharrat, the local boss (qabaday) of al-Shaghur {{and a friend of}} the al-Bakri family. In early August, upon al-Bakri's urging, al-Kharrat formed a militia, which would {{become one of the most}} effective rebel bands in the country. When the French authorities were informed of nationalist rebel plans, they began a wide-scale arrest campaign in the city on 27 August, detaining nearly all of Damascus's nationalist leaders and spokesmen, although al-Bakri, <b>his</b> <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> al-Shahbandar managed to evade arrest.|$|E

5|$|In September 1767, {{conflict}} between Zahir {{and his son}} Ali al-Zahir of Safad commenced over the former's refusal to cede to the latter control of the strategic fortress of Deir Hanna or the village of Deir al-Qassi. Prior to the dispute, Ali had been loyal to Zahir and proven himself effective in helping his father suppress dissent among <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> in battles against external enemies. Zahir's forces intimidated Ali into surrendering later that month, and Zahir pardoned and ultimately ceded to him Deir al-Qassi. However, conflict was renewed weeks later with Ali and his brother Sa'id, backed by Sheikh Nasif, Emir Yusuf and Uthman Pasha poised against Zahir, Uthman, Sheikh Qublan and Muhammad Pasha al-Azm, governor of Sidon. With mediation from Ibrahim Sabbagh, Zahir's financial adviser, Zahir settled his dispute with Sa'id, granting the latter control over Tur'an and Hittin.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 July, McCudden had handed his sister an {{envelope}} over breakfast, which was subsequently found to contain all of his medals. Today all of McCudden's medals including his Victoria Cross are displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, Kent, alongside those of two of <b>his</b> <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> his father. The original brass engraved grave plaque used, along with a wooden propeller, are also displayed. The shattered windscreen from McCudden's crashed S.E.5a is preserved {{in the collection of}} the Imperial War Museum. The museum's collections also include McCudden's uniform 'maternity jacket' and a half-length portrait of McCudden by William Orpen. In March 2009, McCudden and his contemporary Edward Mannock, were the subjects of the BBC Timewatch episode, WWI Aces Falling.|$|E
5|$|Pei's ancestry traces {{back to the}} Ming Dynasty, {{when his}} family moved from Anhui {{province}} to Suzhou, but most importantly his family were directors of the Bank of China which later on funded the construction of important projects including the Kips Bay project in New York. They also found wealth {{in the sale of}} medicinal herbs, the family stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate. Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee Pei and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later. The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, <b>his</b> <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> his sisters to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{seeing that}} <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> {{returned}} home Hoderi attacked <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> Hoori countered <b>his</b> attack {{with the use}} of his jewel that raised the tide in order to make him drown. Hoderi, drowning because of the tide, pleaded to <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> to save <b>his</b> life, so Hoori used the other jewel to lower the tide <b>and</b> saved <b>his</b> <b>brother’s</b> life. Being saved by Hoori, Hoderi vowed to <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> that he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> descendants would then on serve <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> children for all eternity.

When he met the witch, he stabbed her with his word, and then she asked him to save her life with magical plants from the garden. He found the bodies of <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> all her other victims, whom he restored with the same magic, and also a cave full of the maidens killed by the dragon, whom he also restored. After they all escaped, the witch died and the castle fell.|$|R
