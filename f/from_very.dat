5|$|Crook Peak {{has been}} {{important}} as a landmark and boundary <b>from</b> <b>very</b> early times, and {{the origins of the}} name are unclear. The local parish council state that 'Crook' comes from the Old English 'Cruc' meaning 'peak' or 'pointed hill'. 'Shute' is a contraction of schute which meant slope in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind wings and have {{shortened}} fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the fore wings. In Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies <b>from</b> <b>very</b> low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings longer than fore wings engage in flight.|$|E
5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects recede from the Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light <b>from</b> <b>very</b> distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh came <b>from</b> <b>very</b> {{different}} backgrounds. Cope {{was born}} into a wealthy and influential Quaker family based in Philadelphia. Although his father wanted his son to work as a farmer, Cope distinguished himself as a naturalist. In 1864, already a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Cope became a professor of zoology at Haverford College and joined Ferdinand Hayden on his expeditions west. In contrast, Marsh would have grown up poor, the son of a struggling family in Lockport, New York, {{had it not been for}} the benefaction of his uncle, philanthropist George Peabody. Marsh persuaded his uncle to build the Peabody Museum of Natural History, placing Marsh as head of the museum. Combined with the inheritance he received from Peabody upon his death in 1869, Marsh was financially comfortable (although, partly because of Peabody's stern views on marriage, Marsh would remain a lifelong bachelor).|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factorâ€”settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and <b>from</b> <b>very</b> frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging <b>from</b> <b>very</b> positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy is a media {{franchise}} {{created by}} Hironobu Sakaguchi and owned by Square Enix that includes video games, motion pictures, and other merchandise. The series began in 1987 as an eponymous role-playing video game developed by Square, spawning {{a video game}} series that became the central focus of the franchise. The music of the Final Fantasy series refers to the soundtracks of the Final Fantasy series of video games, {{as well as the}} surrounding medley of soundtrack, arranged, and compilation albums. The series' music ranges <b>from</b> <b>very</b> light background music to emotionally intense interweavings of character and situation leitmotifs.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known <b>from</b> <b>very</b> fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth <b>from</b> <b>very</b> distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the clade may include Eoraptor from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as Herrerasaurus, Chindesaurus from the Upper Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and {{possibly}} Caseosaurus from the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, although the relationships of these animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, Alwalkeria from the Late Triassic Maleri Formation of India, and Teyuwasu, known <b>from</b> <b>very</b> fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted {{that it had been}} incorrectly suggested that Staurikosaurus pricei was a juvenile Herrerasaurus. This claim was refuted when pelvic bones from a juvenile Herrerasaurus were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the pelvic bones of Staurikosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Poling took severe {{punishment}} <b>from</b> <b>very</b> accurate bombing. Since Ventnor {{radar station}} had been knocked out already, this attack demonstrated that {{an attack on}} Fighter Command's command, communication and control system was possible. Emergency equipment had been installed on the site {{in case of a}} breakdown, but the information and reading of the radar was significantly less reliable. In fact, Poling was so badly damaged it was out of action for the rest of August. Fortunately, the CH chain had a mobile radar station at the Isle of Wight to fill in for it. Another was due to be set up near Poling anyway, so the chain remained unaffected. The damage done to Kenley and Poling were no more than inconveniences to Park and Dowding. Only one WAAF member, Avis Parsons, was studying the plots at Poling up until the attack. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors <b>from</b> <b>very</b> early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|The {{colour pattern}} varies, ranging <b>from</b> <b>very</b> light-coloured {{specimens}} with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, {{and on to}} melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most {{have some kind of}} zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusual for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.|$|E
