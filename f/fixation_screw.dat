40|$|This is {{a report}} of 2 cases that showed {{dissociation}} of the acetabular cup liner by acetabular <b>fixation</b> <b>screw</b> among patients who underwent total hip replacement. Screws for fixation of the acetabular cup were used during the primary surgery in both cases. Each patient visited the out patient department complaining of pain and noise from the joint; radiologic finding revealed a collapse of the column shape bone graft area with dissociation of the acetabular cup liner. In both cases, during revision surgery, screw was extruded to the inner side of the acetabular cup, since it migrated superiorly. There has been no report of liner dissociation by extrusion of acetabular cup <b>fixation</b> <b>screw</b> after total hip replacement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} a prototype correction algorithm to reduce metal artefacts in flat detector computed tomography (FDCT) of scaphoid <b>fixation</b> <b>screws.</b> FDCT has gained interest in imaging small anatomic structures of the appendicular skeleton. Angiographic C-arm systems with flat detectors allow fluoroscopy and FDCT imaging in a one-stop procedure emphasizing their role as an ideal intraoperative imaging tool. However, FDCT imaging can be significantly impaired by artefacts induced by <b>fixation</b> <b>screws.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS:Following ethical board approval, commercially available scaphoid <b>fixation</b> <b>screws</b> were inserted into six cadaveric specimens in order to fix artificially induced scaphoid fractures. FDCT images corrected with the algorithm were compared to uncorrected images both quantitatively and qualitatively by two independent radiologists in terms of artefacts, screw contour, fracture line visibility, bone visibility, and soft tissue definition. Normal distribution of variables was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In case of normal distribution, quantitative variables were compared using paired Student's t tests. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for quantitative variables without normal distribution and all qualitative variables. A p value of[*]<[*] 0. 05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences. RESULTS:Metal artefacts were significantly reduced by the correction algorithm (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and the fracture line was more clearly defined (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). The inter-observer reliability was "almost perfect" (intra-class correlation coefficient 0. 85, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS:The prototype correction algorithm in FDCT for metal artefacts induced by scaphoid <b>fixation</b> <b>screws</b> may facilitate intra- and postoperative follow-up imaging. KEY POINTS:• Flat detector computed tomography (FDCT) is a helpful imaging tool for scaphoid fixation. • The correction algorithm significantly reduces artefacts in FDCT induced by scaphoid <b>fixation</b> <b>screws.</b> • This may facilitate intra- and postoperative follow-up imaging...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{simulation of}} trabecular surface remodeling {{was performed to}} investigate the basic effects of a <b>fixation</b> <b>screw</b> on the trabecular structural changes in a vertebral body. Voxel-based finite elements were used to construct computational models of the bone and screw for an entire vertebral body with the screw and for the bone-screw interface. The remodeling simulation for the entire vertebral body showed that the implantation of the <b>fixation</b> <b>screw</b> caused changes in the mechanical environment in the cancellous bone, leading to trabecular structural changes at the cancellous level. The effect of the screw on trabecular orientation was greater in the regions {{above and below the}} screw than on that in front of the screw. In the case of the bone-screw interface, the trabecular structural changes depended on the load applied to the screw. It was suggested that bone resorption predicted in the pull-out loading case would be a candidate cause of loosening of the screw. The results indicate that the effects of the implanted screw on the trabecular structural changes would be more important for longer-term fixation. 1...|$|E

However, after implant therapy is completed, several complications might occur (4, 5). These vary from peri-implant soft tissue lesions (viz. peri-implant mucositis, soft-tissue dehiscence, fistula) and abnormal marginal peri-implant bone loss (peri-implantitis), to more technical-related complications as implant fracture and fracture or loosening of the abutment, <b>fixation</b> <b>screw</b> or crown. Overload by occlusal forces {{is one of the}} factors that may induce these complications (6 – 8). Besides this overload, a relatively rare factor is an acute excessive load caused by a dental trauma. There is a deficiency in literature concerning the consequences of these suddenly high forces to the implant, restoration and surrounding tissues. To date, only three case reports have been published that present the consequences of a trauma to implant-supported single crowns (9 – 11). In two cases, the trauma resulted in damaged implant crowns and a bent <b>fixation</b> <b>screw,</b> but the implants sustained no damage (9, 10). In one case, however, the implant gave way resulting in a palatal movement of the implant within the bone, possibly in combination with a fracture of the alveolar process (11).

MethodsA finite element model of Tile type C pelvic ring injury (unilateral Denis type II fracture of the sacrum) was produced. The unilateral sacral fractures were fixed with lengthened sacroiliac screw and sacroiliac screw in six different types of models respectively. The translation and angle displacement of the superior surface of the sacrum (in standing position on both feet) were measured and compared. ResultsThe stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 or S 2 segment is superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in the same sacral segment. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively. The stability of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is superior to that of one lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 or S 2 segment. The stability of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is markedly superior to that of one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 or S 2 segment. The vertical and rotational stability of lengthened sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> and sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 2 is superior to that of S 1. ConclusionIn a finite element model of type C pelvic ring disruption, S 1 and S 2 lengthened sacroiliac screws should be utilized for the fixation as regularly as possible and the most stable fixation is the combination of the lengthened sacroiliac screws of S 1 and S 2 segments. Even if lengthened sacroiliac screws cannot be systematically used due to specific conditions, one sacroiliac <b>screw</b> <b>fixation</b> in S 1 and S 2 segments respectively is recommended. No matter which kind of sacroiliac screw is used, if only one screw can be implanted, the fixation in S 2 segment is more recommended than that in S 1.

40|$|Abstract Background Numerous {{proposed}} surgical {{techniques have}} had minimal success in managing greater trochanter overgrowth secondary to retarded {{growth of the}} femoral capital epiphysis. For reconstruction of residual hip deformities, a novel type of proximal femur L-osteotomy was performed with satisfactory results. Although the clinical outcome was good, the biomechanical characteristics of the femur after such an osteotomy have not been clearly elucidated. Therefore, this study presents a three dimensional finite element analysis designed to understand the mechanical characteristics of the femur after the L-osteotomy. Methods A patient with left hip dysplasia was recruited as the study model for L-osteotomy. The normal right hip {{was used as a}} reference for performing the corrective surgery. Four FEA models were constructed using different numbers of <b>fixation</b> <b>screws</b> but the same osteotomy lengths together with four FEA models with the same number of <b>fixation</b> <b>screws</b> but different osteotomy lengths. The von Mises stress distributions and femoral head displacements were analyzed and compared. Results The results revealed the following: 1). The fixation devices (plate and screws) sustained most of the external loading, and the peak value of von Mises stress on the <b>fixation</b> <b>screws</b> decreased with an increasing number of screws. 2). Additional screws are more beneficial on the proximal segment than on the distal segment for improving the stability of the postoperative femur. 3). The extent of osteotomy should be limited because local stress might be concentrated in the femoral neck region with increasing length of the L-osteotomy. Conclusion Additional screw placement on the proximal segment improves stability in the postoperative femur. The cobra-type plate with additional screw holes in the proximal area might improve the effectiveness of L-osteotomies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{determine}} whether immediate loading of orthodontic bone anchors (OBAs) generates more failures than delayed loading and (2) {{to evaluate the}} impact of different variables on the success rate {{of the use of}} OBAs as temporary anchorage devices in orthodontic treatment. Materials and Methods: In a prospective registry, consecutive patients were treated with OBAs by one experienced maxillofacial surgeon. An independent evaluator compared and analyzed different prospectively determined parameters: gender, age (young [< 16 years] versus mature 16 years]), time of loading (delayed versus immediate), jaw, location, <b>fixation</b> <b>screw</b> length, complications, and orthodontic indications. Success with the OBA was defined as the capacity to maintain anchorage throughout treatment. Premature removal of an OBA because of infection, serious mobility, or persistent pain was considered a failure. Fisher exact tests for analysis of associations between the categorical variables, with the patient as independent variable, were performed. Success and complications were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Sixty-one patients (37 male, 24 female) were treated with 106 OBAs over a 5 -year period (2001 to 2006). The reported success rate in this study was 88. 3 %. In seven patients (11. 7 %) an OBA was removed prematurely. Age, gender, time of loading, jaw, and location did not influence the failure rate. In 25 % of patients, at least one screw failure was noted. A statistically higher screw failure rate was noted in female patients, and the younger group presented more complications than the mature group. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, OBAs are a reliable means to obtain absolute orthodontic anchorage. Immediate loading of an OBA did not generate more failures than delayed loading. Age, jaw, and position did not seem to play important roles in success. Age and gender were important parameters in <b>fixation</b> <b>screw</b> failure rate...|$|E
