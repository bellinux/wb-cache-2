40|$|To {{determine}} the spectrum and associated anomalies of double inlet ventricle (single ventricle), echocardiographic data of SO patients with double inlet ventricle were reviewed and {{compared with the}} data obtained by cardiac catheterization, cardiac surgery and autopsy. Standard echocardiographic planes were used to {{determine the}} cardiac anatomy {{and the size of the}} <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication.</b> Double inlet by way of two perforate valves was found in 44 patients. In 42 of the 44 patients the dominant ventricular morphology was of the left ventricular type (double inlet left ventricle); in 13 of these 42 patients stenosis of one atrioventricular (AV) valve was found. Double inlet right ventricle and double inlet indeterminate ventricle were each found in one patient. Double inlet by way of a common AV valve was found in six patients, all of whom had atrial isomerism. The diagnosis of double inlet ventricle was accurate by two-dimensional echocardiography in all 44 patients. A restrictive <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> was shown in 13 patients and a nonrestrictive communication in 17 patients by cardiac catheterization. Patients with a restrictive <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> had a significantly smaller <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> area normalized by the body surface area (mean ± SD 1. 21 ± 0. 53 cm 2 /m 2) than did those with a nonrestrictive <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> (2. 33 ± 0. 71 cm 2 /m 2) (p < 0. 01). Infants with an aortic anomaly had a significantly smaller <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> area (1. 35 ± 0. 65 cm 2 /m 2) than did those without an aortic anomaly (2. 57 ± 0. 76 cm 2 /m 2) (p < 0. 05).

40|$|A hipertrofia septal assimétrica (HSA), ou estenose subaórtica dinâmica é doença que apresenta características peculiares relacionadas tanto ao diagnóstico quanto à técnica cirúrgica empregada para o seu tratamento. De setembro de 83 a setembro de 89, 16 pacientes consecutivos (10 homens) com idades de sete meses a 66 anos (30, 87 ± 22, 42) foram submetidos a tratamento cirúrgico. Este consistiu, fundamentalmente, da não abordagem do septo {{interventricular}} e sim da ressecçáo muscular realizada na região da via de saída do ventrículo esquerdo, parede anterior entre os seios aórticos coronarianos direito e esquerdo. Esta miectomia, profunda e extensa foi realizada isoladamente em dez pacientes e nos outros seis associada a outros procedimentos: ligadura de canal arterial e ressecção de anel subaórtico fibroso em dois; descalcificação de valva aórtica (VAo) em um; ressecção de banda muscular em ventrículo direito em um: ressecção de vegetação de VAo em um; fechamento de CIV com plastia de VAo em um. Em todos os casos foram feitas medidas intra-operatórias das pressões do VE e aorta após desconexão da circulação extracorpórea. Não houve nenhum óbito imediato neste grupo de pacientes. Houve um (6, 2 %) óbito tardio, um anos após, não relacionado à doença. Com relação a distúrbios na condução atrioventricular, houve um (6, 2 %) bloqueio A-V total, com implante de marcapasso definitivo. Houve dois (12, 5 %) bloqueios de ramo esquerdo, e três (18, 7 %) bloqueios divisionais ântero-superiores, sem alterações nos demais pacientes. Em um peíodo de 19 a 90 meses (56, 00 ± 23, 72), 14 (87, 5 %) pacientes encontram-se assintomáticos. The dynamic subaortic stenosis, {{more commonly}} named hypertrofic subaortic stenosis (HSS) presents some aspects specially related with its diagnosis and surgical treatment. From September/ 83 to September/ 89, sixteen patients (10 men) with age between 7 month and 66 years (30. 87 ± 2. 42) were submitted to surgical treatment {{to correct the}} HSS. The surgical technique employed the muscular resection in left ventricular outflow tract, in the anterior wall, between left and right coronary aortic sinus. This resection was characterized by an extensive and deeply miectomy and was performed with no other procedures in 10 patients and in association with other procedures in 6 patients (correction of patent arterious ductus with fibrotic subaortic stenosis in 2; surgical conservative procedure in aortic valve stenosis in one; right ventricle muscular anomalous band resection of vegetative lesion in aortic leaflet in one; <b>interventricular</b> septum <b>communication</b> closure and aortic valve conservative procedure in one. After cardiopulmonary by-pass, intraoperative evaluation in aortic and left ventricle pressure were made in all patients. No immediate deaths were present in this group of patients. There was one (6. 2 %) death with one year of follow-up, not related with the disease. After surgery related to AV disturbances, one (6. 2 %) patient presented AV block with need of pacemaker implantation; two (12. 5 %) presented left bundle block; three (18. 7 %) presented left bundle branch block, with no alteration in the other patients.

40|$|The precise {{method of}} {{surgical}} repair of double outlet right ventricle depends {{both on the}} relation of the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> to the cardiac outlets and on the course and insertion of the atrioventricular valve tension apparatus. It may be difficult to connect the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> with one or other outlet or both either because the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> is too far from the outlets or because atrioventricular tension apparatus interposes between them. This study was carried out in order to establish whether these details could be recognised preoperatively using cross sectional echocardiography. Forty two echocardiograms were reviewed retrospectively from patients with double outlet right ventricle, excluding those with atrioventricular septal defects and atrioventricular discordance. Ten further such patients were studied prospectively. The diagnosis was confirmed at open heart surgery in 19 patients. The relation of the great arteries and their outlet tracts {{to each other and to}} the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> was readily and accurately predicted. Four patients (7. 7 %) had no infundibular septum. The remaining 48 had such a septum. In 27 (52 %) the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> was overridden by a great artery. In 14 (27 %) it was roofed by the ventriculoinfundibular fold, and in 11 (21 %) it was confined to the inlet or trabecular septa. The insertion of chordae tendineae limited the possible surgical options in 12 patients (23. 1 %) who were distributed unpredictably among the above groups. Four patients had straddling atrioventricular valves. In five, tricuspid tension apparatus inserted into the underside of the infundibular septum and, in two, into the roof of the defect. In one patient the mitral valve inserted into the defect floor. Tricuspid tension apparatus inserted into the floor of the defect in a further nine patients, but this does not compromise surgery. Thus in double outlet right ventricle cross sectional echocardiography can provide unique information necessary for planning of rational surgical management...|$|E

40|$|Tetralogy of Fallot is a {{congenital}} cardiac malformation {{that consists}} of an <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication,</b> {{also known as a}} ventricular septal defect, obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, override of the ventricular septum by the aortic root, and right ventricular hypertrophy. This combination of lesions occurs in 3 of every 10, 000 live births, and accounts for 7 – 10 % of all {{congenital cardiac malformation}}s. Patients nowadays usually present as neonates, with cyanosis of varying intensity based on the degree of obstruction to flow of blood to the lungs. The aetiology is multifactorial, but reported associations include untreated maternal diabetes, phenylketonuria, and intake of retinoic acid. Associated chromosomal anomalies can include trisomies 21, 18, and 13, but recent experience points to the much more frequent association of microdeletions of chromosome 22.

40|$|The {{remodeling}} of the atrioventricular valves {{in patients}} with complete atrioventricular septal defects is the crucial part of surgical repair. Variability in valve morphology is an important factor. This study evaluates the variability in morphology of the anterior and posterior leaflets in 30 heart specimens. All hearts had an anterior bridging leaflet: Rastelli type A in 12, type B in 2, and type C in 16. The posterior leaflet revealed four morphologic patterns: a right- and left-sided posterior leaflet, both inserting directly onto {{the crest of the}} ventricular septum (5 hearts); a common posterior leaflet attached to the septal crest by a membrane (2 hearts); a common posterior leaflet attached to the septal crest by multiple chordae (13 hearts); and a virtually free-floating posterior leaflet (11 hearts). The categorization is surgically relevant in making a distinction between hearts with and without an <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> underneath the posterior leaflet. Surgically relevant variations occurred also in arrangement and positioning of chordae originating from the right septal side. There was no relationship between the Rastelli classification of the anterior leaflet and that of the posterior leaflet.

40|$|A new case of {{an unusual}} {{association}} of mitral atresia with single left ventricle is reported. The salient anatomic features include: (1) the right atrioventricular valve is atretic; (2) the left atrioventricular valve enters the large ventricle with morpho-logic characteristics of the left ventricle; and (3) this large ventricle communicates by way of an <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> with a smaller left-sided ventricle, but with the morphologic characteristics of the right ventricle. Guidelines for the recogni-tion of these uncommon malformations are given. Additional Indexing Words: Single left ventricle Double-inlet left vei Mitral ateresia L-Loop T HE SINGLE left ventricle ' or single (primitive) ventricle 2 {{has been defined as}} an anomaly of the heart in which both atrioventricular orifices, either separated or fused into a common atrioventricular canal, are received by a left ventricle.

40|$|Methods of {{three-dimensional}} reconstruction of cardiac images and emerging clinical applications are described, with special reference to congenital heart disease. Compared to other techniques providing dynamic three-dimensional visualization of heart structures, echocardiography has advantages of better temporal resolution and minor cost. Current applications include assessment of volumes and global and regional ventricular performance, evaluation of time motion of valves and other dynamic processes together with color-flow images, and dissection {{of the heart}} into specific areas of interest, such as atrial septum, mitral inflow and aortic outflow. In complex congenital heart disease, {{three-dimensional reconstruction}} provides {{an interpretation of the}} mode of atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, with simulations of a "surgeon's view" of the heart. Defects as atrioventricular canal, double inlet left ventricle and tricuspid atresia can be examined in details concerning the architecture of valvar and subvalvar apparatus and presence and importance of ventricular septal defect. Other congenital malformations such as transposition of great arteries, truncus, coarctation syndrome, and double outlet right ventricle can be assessed in regard to <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> and infundibular obstruction. Multiplane transesophageal probes are best suitable to this sort of electronic vivisection, but rotational and linear scanning methods have also given useful images of cardiac structures in children as well as adults.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Considering {{that the}} brain abscess is rare in infants, with a high {{mortality}} rate, {{the objective of this}} paper is to report the clinical evolution of ten children with the diagnosis of brain abscess in the Pediatric Nursery of the Hospital das Clínicas of the Medical School of the Campinas State University (UNICAMP). METHODS: The data of the patients with diagnosis of brain abscess recorded between January 1986 and July 1995 were reviewed. The following data were analyzed: age, sex, clinical manifestations, physical examination, radiological data, etiological agent, treatment, complications and clinical evolution of the patients. RESULTS: The age of the patients varied from 2 to 13 years (median 3 years); 6 of them were female. The neurological manifestations predominated, and 2 patients had history of prior otorhinolaryngological infection (chronic otitis media and sinusitis). Two patients had congenital cyanogenic cardiopathy (Fallot tetralogy and Pulmonary Stenosis with <b>Interventricular</b> <b>Communication).</b> The diagnosis and follow-up were made with computed tomography of the brain. In six cases there were one sole abscess located more frequently in the frontal lobe. The treatment in majority of the cases was broad-spectrum antibiotic association and surgical drainage. Five patients had neurological sequelae (seizure, hydrocephalus and paresis); one death occurred.

40|$|Percutaneous {{closure of}} {{interventricular}} defects {{is an alternative}} or adjunct to surgery with the disadvantage of a sometimes prolonged and difficult catheterisation only during which the choice of prosthesis can be determined. Despite {{the existence of an}} occlusion prosthesis, the Amplatzer Septal Defect Occluder, specifically conceived for this purpose, an arterial canal occlusion prosthesis such as the Amplatzer Duct Occluder is sometimes better suited for the occlusion of certain interventricular defects. Since 1999, 11 Amplatzer Duct Occluders were used for the closure of interventricular muscular defects, during 10 catheterisations in 9 patients with a median age of 2. 5 (0. 1 to 43. 9) years. In 5 cases there were residual septal defects after failure of initial surgery. 10 were successful with prostheses of 6 / 4 mm to 12 / 10 mm while in one patient the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> had to be closed surgically because the 14 / 12 mm prosthesis could not be positioned due to a tortuous introduction route. The only complication was a pericardial effusion requiring surgical drainage in one infant. After a median follow up of 2. 1 (0. 3 to 4. 2) years, all of the patients had a satisfactory functional status, with minimal residual shunt on echocardiography in 2 cases. The Amplatzer Duct Occluder therefore seems better adapted for the closure of post-operative residual interventricular communications, with a thickened interventricular septum or even when the tricuspid valve is very close to the right ventricular side of the orifice...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{access the}} {{incidence}} of diagnostic errors in the initial evaluation of children with cardiac murmurs. METHODS: We evaluated our 7 -years of experience in a public pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic. Of 3692 patients who {{were sent to the}} hospital, 2603 presented with a heart murmur and were investigated. Patients for whom a disagreement existed between the initial and final diagnoses were divided into the following 2 groups: G 1 (n= 17) with an initial diagnosis of an innocent murmur and a final diagnosis of cardiopathy, and G 2 (n= 161) with an initial diagnosis of cardiopathy and a final diagnosis of a normal heart. RESULTS: In G 1, the great majority of patients had cardiac defects with mild hemodynamic repercussions, such as small ventricular septal defect and mild pulmonary stenosis. In G 2, the great majority of structural defects were <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication,</b> atrial septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis. CONCLUSION: A global analysis demonstrated that diagnostic error in the initial evaluation of children with cardiac murmurs is real, reaching approximately 6 % of cases. The majority of these misdiagnoses were in patients with an initial diagnosis of cardiopathy, which was not confirmed through later complementary examinations. Clinical cardiovascular examination is an excellent resource in the evaluation of children suspected of having cardiopathy.

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesTransesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) {{is extremely}} useful in surgeries like valvuloplasty, of the thoracic aorta, and correction of congenital cardiopathies. The low degree of invasiveness {{and the capacity}} to aggregate information that can change the course of the surgery are among the advantages of TEE. The objective of this report was to present a case in which the surgical conduct was changed due to a new diagnosis provided by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, and to emphasize the importance of using the transesophageal echo in surgeries to correct congenital cardiopathies. Case reportA 28 -year old female, ASA II, with a history of dyspnea progressing from medium to small efforts was referred by another department for elective surgical correction of stenosis of the pulmonary valve diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed patent foramen ovale, infundibular stenosis of the right ventricular outlet, and perimembranous subaortic <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> (IVC) of 0. 4 cm with left to right shunt. After beginning ECC, the above mentioned diagnoses were confirmed and the surgery included closure of the foramen ovale and IVC, and resection of the infundibular stenosis. Intraoperative intercurrences were not observed and the patient was intubated when she was transferred to the intensive care unit. ConclusionsTransesophageal echocardiography is extremely useful in patients undergoing surgical correction of congenital cardiopathies because, besides helping the hemodynamic management, it can provide new information capable of improving the final result of the surgery...|$|E

This study describes the immediate and medium-term outcomes of stent implantation in neonates and infants with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation. MethodsThis was a descriptive and prospective study including different cyanotic congenital heart diseases treated between 2014 and 2015. ResultsFourteen patients {{with a mean age of}} 46 days, and mean weight of 4. 5 kg were assessed, and pulmonary artresia with <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> was the most treated condition. The femoral artery approach was used in 70 % of procedures; carotid approach was used in the remaining cases. Stents of 3. 5 x 12 mm were used in most cases, and implant success was achieved in 78 % of interventions (11 / 14). The failed cases were referred to surgery – one of them was an emergency, which resulted in death. Ductal spasm occurred in < 48 hours in three patients who required mBT, with favorable outcome. Complications after discharge and within the first 30 days included stent thrombosis (2 / 11), one of which was controlled with redilation, another progressed to death, and one sudden death (1 / 11). The overall mortality was 21. 4 % (3 / 14). A patent ductus arteriosus in the first 6 months was present in five cases, which underwent palliative surgery.

40|$|First considerations: {{in spite}} of {{technological}} progresse in diagnosis, treatment and surgical techniques, which allowed today a larger survival and better life for children bearer of congenital cardiopatias, the growth and development deficits continues {{being one of the}} most common problems in those children. Objective: to assess the growth and development of children in the presence of congenital cardiopathie. Methods: this is an exploratory, descriptive, and field study using a quantitative approach. The sample was comprised of 14 children between the ages of three and twenty-four months with congenital cardiopathies. For the growth assessment, the Z score of weight-for-age and height-for-age were determined. For the developmental assessment, the Denver II was used. Results: the children presented a height and weight deficit of 42. 85 %, evidence by the Z score of weight-for-age and height-for-age less than or equal to - 2. The congenital cardiopathies that most affected growth were <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> and tetralogy of Fallot. As for development of these children, the study detected a suspected developmental delay in the personal-social (14, 29 %), language (14, 29 %) and motor (64, 29 %) areas. Conclusions: the results point up the importance of monitoring the growth and development of children with congenital cardiopathies by healthcare professionals, with the aim of minimizing the effects of these pathologies on nutritional states, a risk factor for worsening the health of these children. Parents must be advised about the importance of meeting these children’s needs and establishing measures to reduce the negative impacts of cardiopathies on their children’s growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to whether the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> in complete atrioventricular septal defect is different beneath the superior and inferior bridging leaflets, a feature of obvious surgical significance. We searched for a defect under the bridging leaflets and examined the valve morphologies in 98 autopsied and 86 surgical patients. Of the overall specimens, 27 were associated with Fallot's tetralogy, and a further 20 had subaortic stenosis, aortic coarctation, or both. In the autopsied specimens, we also measured the degree of deficiency of the ventricular septum. No communication was found under the inferior bridging leaflet in 30 % (29 of 98) of the specimens. All 29 hearts except two without such communications showed an undivided inferior leaflet. In contrast, all patients undergoing operation except 1 had a communication beneath both bridging leaflets (p < 0. 001). The absence of a communication beneath the inferior leaflet was observed more in hearts with Fallot's tetralogy (seven of 14) or those with subaortic stenosis, aortic coarctation, or both (eight of 18) than in those without associated anomalies (14 of 66; p < 0. 01). Those with a communication under the inferior leaflet showed a greater deficiency of the inlet ventricular septum than did those without it (p < 0. 001).

Methods: The sample consisted of all patients undergoing surgical correction for congenital heart disease for ten years in Sergipe, Brazil. The patients were operated in three hospitals located {{in the city of}} Aracaju, capital of the state of Sergipe (Brazil). The study was divided into two periods defined by the start date of centralization of surgery. The variables collected were: age, sex, postoperative diagnosis, destination, type of surgery and hospital where the procedure was performed and the classification RACHS- 1. Results: In the period I, the estimate deficit of surgery was 69 % decrease occurring in the period II to 55. 3 %. The postoperative diagnosis was more frequent closure of the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> (20. 5 %), closure of patent ductus arteriosus (20. 2 %) and atrial septal defect (19 %). There was a statistically significant correlation between the expected mortality RACHS- 1 and observed in the sample.

40|$|The {{post-operative}} {{review of}} 81 patients operated {{for a large}} <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> {{before the age of}} two years reveals excellent results: the mean age at operation was 7 months, extracorporeal circulation was performed in 25 patients for a mean duration of 77 minutes and profound hypothermia to 18 degrees C was induced in 56 patients. The atrial approach was used in 30 % of cases. The mean follow-up period is 26 months. There was one case of complete bundle branch block, which was subsequently fitted with a pacemaker, 7 cases of bifascicular branch block and a right bundle branch block in the majority of cases. The pulmonary vascular resistance was virtually normal (a mean of 3. 2 U. m- 2 prior to the operation and a mean of 1. 9 U. m- 2 after the operation). The left ventricular volume, which was markedly increased in all patients preoperatively, returned to normal with maintenance of a normal ejection fraction. The neuro-psychomotor behaviour was abnormal in 13 of the 63 patients tested. These abnormalities are not related to the correction procedure, but to pre-existing pathology (small birth weight). 52 patients from a series of 63 cases operated for tetralogy of Fallot before the age of 2 years (median age 12 months) were also reviewed. Extracorporeal circulation lasting a mean of 115 minutes was performed in 31 patients, cardiac arrest under profound hypothermia was induced in the other cases, for a mean duration of 61 minutes. The mean follow-up period was 29 months. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesSurgical {{repair of}} post–myocardial {{infarction}} ventricular septal rupture is challenging with reported early mortality being substantial. In addition, congestive cardiac failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmia frequently occur long term after the operation, although frequency and predictive factors {{of these events}} have been poorly identified. MethodsA consecutive series of 68 patients who underwent repair of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture by 14 surgeons between 1988 and 2007 was studied. Fifty-eight (85 %) patients underwent repair in an urgent setting (< 48 hours after diagnosis). Coronary artery bypass grafting was concomitantly performed in 48 (71 %) patients. Mean follow-up period was 9. 2 ± 4. 9 years. ResultsThirty-day mortality was 35 %, with previous myocardial infarction, previous cardiac surgery, preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 %, and urgent surgery being independent risk factors. Actuarial survival of 30 -day survivors was 88 % at 5 years, 73 % at 10 years, and 51 % at 15 years. Actuarial freedom from congestive cardiac failure and ventricular tachyarrhythmia was 70 % and 85 % at 5 years, 54 % and 71 % at 10 years, and 28 % and 61 % at 15 years, respectively. Independent predictors for congestive cardiac failure included hypertension, posterior septal rupture, residual <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication,</b> and preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 %, whereas concomitant ventricular aneurysmectomy and preoperative occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were independent predictors of ventricular tachyarrhythmia. ConclusionsLong-term outcomes after surgical repair of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture was favorable, despite infrequent exposure by individual surgeons to the pathologic features, indicating that an aggressive surgical approach is warranted.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{congenital}} supravalvular mitral ring {{is a rare}} subtype of congenital mitral stenosis. This form {{is poorly}} understood and thus underestimated. It has a good prognosis with appropriate management. The identification of this entity remains unrevealed in the literature, only less than 100 cases were reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to share the diagnostic and therapeutic experiences of the Casablanca pediatric cardiology unit. MethodsBetween December 2008 and January 2014, 1927 patients with congenital heart disease were collected retrospectively in the Ibn Rochd cardiology department of Casablanca university hospital. Results 19 patients had congenital mitral stenosis (0. 01 % of the entire series), 8 of them were related to a supravalvular mitral ring. The sex ratio M / F was 1 : 1. The median age was 10 months [5 - 168]. For all patients, the diagnosis was made by echocardiography. The average mean mitral valve gradient was 14 ±. 8 mmHg. Associated anomalies were: <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> (n= 3), coarctation of the aorta alone (n= 1), coarctation of the aorta associated with a bicuspid aortic valve (n= 2), Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) (n= 1) and a complex congenital cardiopathy (n= 1). The surgery was indicated to 7 patients; the 8 th patient had DORV with Eisenmenger. The supra-mitral ring was surgically resected to 4 patients with a good surgical outcome, 2 patients are awaiting for surgery and one patient was lost to view. No deaths per or postoperative were noted. ConclusionThe supravalvular mitral ring is a rare variety of congenital mitral stenosis. It is often underestimated and potentially serious. The echocardiography is the diagnosis key. Surgical treatment is usually indicated. After resection, the prognosis is good without risk of recurrence and that improves long-term survival...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Brazil, since 2001, the {{congenital}} abnormalities have represented the second {{cause of death}} in children younger than one year, with cardiovascular defects being responsible for 39. 4 % of these deaths. Objectives: To establish the prevalence and the characteristics of the congenital cardiac malformations in pediatric necropsies performed in Hospital Regional da Asa Sul, Brasília, DF, Brazil, from January 1996 to December 2007. Methods: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study that reviewed 1, 591 necropsies performed from January 1996 to December 2007 and found 189 (11. 9 %) with congenital cardiac malformations, included in this study. Results: The cardiac abnormalities were observed mainly in the group of live births (117 / 61. 9 %), followed by the stillbirths (35 / 18. 5 %), the infant group (30 / 15. 9 %) and the preschoolers ’ group (7 / 3. 7 %), with no cases identified among school-aged children. The main alterations detected were: interatrial communication in 96 patients (27 %), <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> in 66 patients (18. 5 %) and patent ductus arteriosus in 51 (14. 3 %), with no predominance of either sex. In 133 patients (70. 4 %), the cardiopathies were multiple and in 96 (50. 8 %) they were associated with anomalies in other organs and systems; among these, 45 (23. 8 %) presented cardiopathies as syndrome components, especially trisomies, at all age ranges. Conclusions: The {{results of the present study}} show a high prevalence of congenital cardiac anomalies in our country and distribution and association that were similar to the ones observed in developed countries. The high mortality associated to such anomalies highlights the need for more comprehensive research in order to identify the risk factors and seek the primary prevention of some of these defects.

40|$|AbstractDiscrete subvalvular aortic {{stenosis}} is a progressive lesion. Most reported cases {{have had a}} measurable left ventricular. aortic gradient that progressed in severity. This report describes 35 patients in whom no significant left ventricular-aortic obstruction was noted at initial cardiac catheterization, but who later were shown to have significant subvalvular {{aortic stenosis}}. In 24 of the 35 cases, absence of a significant left ventricular-aortic gradient (≤ 10 mm Hg) was documented at initial cardiac catheterization. In 11 patients, a left ventricular-aortic pressure gradient was not obtained or not sought {{in the absence of}} clinical evidence of an obstructive lesion. In each case, discrete subaortic stenosis was not noted on angiography. Associated lesions included ventricular septal defect in 7, patent ductus arteriosus in 12, coarctation of the aorta in 8, pulmonary stenosis in 3, atrioventricular canal in 2 and miscellaneous lesions in 3 cases. The 35 patients had documentation of subvalvular aortic stenosis 3 months to 19 years after their initial study based on repeat catheterizations in 26, echocardiography in 6 or discovery at surgery in 3 cases. There were eight children with coarctation and no left ventricular-aortic gradient who developed significant subvalvular stenosis at a median of 2 years 9 months after initial cardiac catheterization. Of 30 patients with associated lesions, 23 had surgical intervention before development of subvalvular aortic stenosis, but only 5 of 17 patients with ventricular septal defect had surgical repair or palliation specifically for the <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication</b> before development of subvalvular aortic stenosis. Thirty patients required surgery for subvalvular obstruction at a median of 7. 7 years after initial catheterization. It is concluded that discrete subvalvular aortic stenosis may develop despite prior documentation of no left ventricular-aortic gradient. Although subvalvular aortic stenosis may have a preexisting substrate, the lesion can present as an “acquired” disease with progressive hemodynamic severity...|$|E
40|$|To {{report the}} case of a prenatally {{detected}} de novo mosaic tetrasomy 18 p where a combination of different methodologies was used,including conventional cytogenetics and molecular genetics techniques. METHOD: Molecular rapid aneuploidy diagnosis, by quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR), conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS:Amniocentesis was performed at 22 + 5 gestational weeks, on a 37 -year-old woman, due to ultrasound detection of fetal <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication,</b> overlapped fingers and unilateral club foot. Molecular rapid aneuploidy testing, by QF-PCR, showed highly increased ratios for markers on the short arm of chromosome 18. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a male karyotype with mosaicism involving two cell lines: one with a supernumerary isochromosome 18 p and another with two extra derivative chromosomes 18. Parental karyotypes were normal and QF-PCR analysis indicated that the extra chromosome 18 p material was of maternal origin. After counseling the couple opted for pregnancy termination. Anatomopathological studies, as well as further characterization of the derivative chromosomes, are underway in order to provide more accurate genotype-correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of tetrasomy 18 p reported cases were ascertained postnatally, had a de novo occurrence and an isochromosome 18 p in all cells examined. Prenatal diagnoses of mosaic tetrasomy 18 p are, on the other hand, rarely described in the literature. The case herein reported, where a mosaic is present and none of the cell lines is chromosomally normal, may provide further insight on this rare syndrome and help in the knowledge of the associated phenotype. The application of a combined strategy, using QF-PCR, conventional cytogenetics and FISH analysis allowed not only for the identification of the extra chromosome 18 p material, {{in the form of a}} mosaicism involving isochromosome 18 p, but also for determining its parental origin. This information is of particular importance in recurrence risk assessment and therefore crucial for genetic counseling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tetralogy of Fallot is a {{congenital}} cardiac malformation {{that consists}} of an <b>interventricular</b> <b>communication,</b> {{also known as a}} ventricular septal defect, obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, override of the ventricular septum by the aortic root, and right ventricular hypertrophy. This combination of lesions occurs in 3 of every 10, 000 live births, and accounts for 7 – 10 % of all {{congenital cardiac malformation}}s. Patients nowadays usually present as neonates, with cyanosis of varying intensity based on the degree of obstruction to flow of blood to the lungs. The aetiology is multifactorial, but reported associations include untreated maternal diabetes, phenylketonuria, and intake of retinoic acid. Associated chromosomal anomalies can include trisomies 21, 18, and 13, but recent experience points to the much more frequent association of microdeletions of chromosome 22. The risk of recurrence in families is 3 %. Useful diagnostic tests are the chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. The echocardiogram establishes the definitive diagnosis, and usually provides sufficient information for planning of treatment, which is surgical. Approximately half of patients are now diagnosed antenatally. Differential diagnosis includes primary pulmonary causes of cyanosis, along with other cyanotic heart lesions, such as critical pulmonary stenosis and transposed arterial trunks. Neonates who present with ductal-dependent flow to the lungs will receive prostaglandins to maintain ductal patency until surgical intervention is performed. Initial intervention may be palliative, such as surgical creation of a systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunt, but the trend in centres of excellence is increasingly towards neonatal complete repair. Centres that undertake neonatal palliation will perform the complete repair at the age of 4 to 6 months. Follow-up in patients born 30 years ago shows a rate of survival greater than 85 %. Chronic issues that now face such adults include pulmonary regurgitation, recurrence of pulmonary stenosis, and ventricular arrhythmias. As the strategies for surgical and medical management have progressed, the morbidity and mortality of those born with tetralogy of Fallot in the current era is expected to be significantly improved. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Identificar a prevalência de complicações pulmonares em crianças submetidas à cirurgia cardíaca, assim como características demográficas e clínicas da população estudada. MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta por 37 crianças, de ambos os sexos, submetidas à cirurgia cardíaca no Hospital Universitário Presidente Dutra, São Luís (MA), durante o ano de 2007. Não foram incluídos pacientes que apresentaram doença pulmonar pré-cirúrgica, portadores de distúrbios neurológicos, óbito intra-operatório, além de falta de dados no prontuário. Os dados foram obtidos pela coleta nas evoluções médicas e de enfermagem dos respectivos prontuários. RESULTADOS: Quanto às características populacionais, houve predomínio de crianças do sexo feminino, provenientes do {{interior}} do estado e na faixa etária escolar. Patologias consideradas de baixo risco foram a maioria, destacando-se a persistência do canal arterial, comunicação interventricular e comunicação interatrial. Observou-se que a maior parcela das crianças fez uso de circulação extracorpórea por mais de 30 minutos, sendo a mediana igual a 80 minutos, sofreu esternotomia mediana, utilizou apenas dreno mediastinal e fez uso de ventilação mecânica pós-operatória, sendo a mediana aproximadamente de 6, 6 horas. Somente três (8, 1 %) pacientes apresentaram complicações pulmonares, sendo que destes, dois foram a óbito. CONCLUSÃO: A maioria das crianças da amostra era do sexo feminino, na faixa etária escolar e proveniente do interior do estado. Os baixos tempos de circulação extracorpórea e ventilação mecânica, além de cardiopatias congênitas consideradas de baixo risco, podem ter sido fatores contribuintes para o pequeno índice de complicações pulmonares no pós-operatório.
