50|$|East Hill Cliff Railway, or East <b>Hill</b> <b>Lift,</b> is a {{funicular}} railway {{located in the}} English seaside town of Hastings. It provides access to Hastings Country Park via the East Hill, which overlooks the Old Town and Rock-a-Nore, an area {{to the east of}} Hastings. The line provides views over the Stade, home to the largest beach launched fishing fleet in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The West Hill Cliff Railway, or West <b>Hill</b> <b>Lift,</b> is a {{funicular}} railway {{located in the}} English seaside town of Hastings. It runs largely in tunnel, and provides access to Hastings Castle and St Clement's Caves from George Street, on the town's sea front. The West Hill overlooks the sea to the south, the Old Town to the east, and the current central business district of Hastings to the west.|$|E

5000|$|Pitchfork {{ranked the}} song No. 68 on {{its list of}} the Top 100 Tracks of 2011, with author Amy Phillips writing: [...] "The Joy Formidable aren't {{headlining}} soccer stadiums quite yet, but you wouldn't know it from listening to 'Whirring'. An aerobic rush of a song that builds {{to the kind of}} explosive alt-rock chorus that would've blown the roof off of '120 Minutes' circa 1995, it's {{the kind of thing that}} gets you pumped to run up a steep <b>hill,</b> <b>lift</b> heavy objects, or defeat Bob Dole's Presidential run." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thermal soaring {{is often}} {{combined}} with slope soaring. Thermals from elsewhere can drift {{in over the}} hill to combine with the <b>hill</b> <b>lift</b> or they can be formed by the hill itself, if the slope is angled to the sun causing the slope to heat up faster than in the surrounding areas. The resulting warm air will then flow upwards pulling in air from the valley below, causing a wind up the slope. The lift is thus a combination of ridge lift and thermal. This has produced a new term, [...] "slermal", to describe the mixture of both slope lift and thermal activity coming up the hill face.|$|E

50|$|TOGO's {{model would}} be the only {{somewhat}} successful design. Six of these were made and were successful in small parks due to its small footprint. The ride inverts riders three times through three Heartline Roll elements and utilizes a special near-vertical <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> The <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> would be prone to down time for maintenance and the Ultra Twister owned by Six Flags had its <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> modified by Premier Rides to a less steep angle when it was moved to Six Flags Astroworld.|$|R
50|$|Launch <b>lift</b> <b>hills</b> {{are like}} launch tracks, {{but instead of}} having it flat, it is rather at an incline. Sometimes, launch <b>lift</b> <b>hills</b> serve the same purpose as <b>lift</b> <b>hills</b> but faster {{transport}} {{to the top of}} the lift hill; or they are sometimes used to power the train up into an element, like the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal Orlando. Launch <b>lift</b> <b>hills</b> use mostly linear synchronous motors or linear induction motors but sometimes use drive tires.|$|R
50|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> or chain <b>lift,</b> {{is often}} the initial upward section of track on a typical roller coaster that {{initially}} transports the roller coaster train to an elevated point. Upon reaching the top, the train is then disengaged from the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> and allowed to coast {{through the rest of}} the roller coaster's circuit.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{during the}} park's off-season, the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> was rehabilitated and {{straightened}} removing the well known [...] "kink" [...] {{that was in}} the <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|R

50|$|After {{exiting the}} station, the train turns right and {{is taken up}} a {{friction}} wheel <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> to a height of 13 m. A small drop follows the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> that then leads into two downward helices. The train then dips diagonally under the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> before elevating and approaching {{the back end of}} the station and passing over top. The train then runs back parallel with the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> before entering two separate helices and entering the brake run. The train then returns to the station where riders dismount and exit back into the Kids' WB Fun Zone.|$|R
50|$|Log Jammer had two <b>lift</b> <b>hills</b> {{and three}} drops. This was {{possible}} because of Log Jammer's terrain layout. Log Jammer left the station and travelled through an s-bend. It then began its first <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> After a small dip, the flume made several right turns. After a straight piece of track, the flume then made another s-curve. After several bends it then climbed its second <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> After the <b>lift,</b> Log Jammer went through several turns, then it went down a medium-sized drop. Then after more bends the flume went down its largest drop into a small lake, {{before returning to the}} station.|$|R

500|$|On 18 October 2011, the coaster's {{longest and}} {{heaviest}} <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> track piece, standing at [...] long, was installed. By mid–November the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> and drop were finished and the overbank turn was nearing completion.|$|R
50|$|After being {{dispatched}} {{the ride}} slowly moves around {{a series of}} turns before ascending the 8 m chain <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> The ride drops down a spiraling turn to the right before crossing under the first <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> It then goes through a banked turnaround before navigating through several Wild Mouse-style unbanked turns. A second <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> follows, however, this hill is propelled by drive tires allowing for the cars to accelerate whilst climbing the hill. A number of left hand turns follow this <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> before the cars enter the final brake run. The cars {{then return to the}} station where riders are informed that their mission is complete.|$|R
50|$|Riders {{board the}} trains in an {{enclosed}} loading station on a hillside. Leaving the station, trains make a left hand {{turn into a}} bat-infested tunnel, make a slight right turn, and climb the first <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> At {{the top of the}} <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> trains pass under a waterfall and drop to the left. This is followed by a right hand turn, after which the track crosses under the second <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> and drop. After crossing under the second <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> drop, the track goes through a 270 degree clockwise spiral and passes through a short tunnel. Trains emerge from the tunnel and pass through the flooded town of Tumbleweed. The train passes over a decaying trestle (where the track is slightly banked from side to side), before entering Davy Jones Mine, where it hits a trim brake. Trains then make a left hand turn and climb the second <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wood for {{the actual}} coaster started to be {{installed}} in late May 2017 with supports for {{the base of the}} <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> in place by early June. The <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> was topped at its highest point in early July.|$|R
50|$|After {{ascending}} {{the first}} <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> the train travels {{around the front}} facade of the enclosure to ascend the second <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> The first drop is the ride's only steep drop, {{while the rest of}} the ride contains three horizontal helices.|$|R
50|$|The Spiral is simple. It, too, has a 3-foot-tall <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> {{that goes}} into a 540-degree helix to the right. A brief 9-inch drop follows with a straightaway into a 180-degree turn to the {{right back to the}} <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|R
50|$|The train then {{enters a}} set of Block Brakes. Following the brakes, the train then turned right, and began to ascend a second <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> The second <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> climbed towards the park's mock Rhine River. At {{the top of the}} 100 ft lift, the ride turned 90 degrees to the left, before {{traveling}} down a 80 ftdrop, barreling straight towards the river at 48 mph, swooping to the left in close proximity to the water.|$|R
6000|$|A rough smack of resin {{was in the}} air, and {{a crystal}} {{mountain}} purity. It came pouring over these green slopes by the oceanful. The woods sang aloud, and gave largely of their healthful breath. Gladness seemed to inhabit these upper zones, and we had left indifference behind us in the valley. [...] "I to the <b>hills</b> <b>lift</b> mine eyes!" [...] There are days in a life when thus {{to climb out of}} the lowlands, seems like scaling heaven.|$|R
50|$|As {{the train}} {{comes out of}} the station, it makes a 90 degree turn to the right, and starts up the tire drive <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> As the train exits the <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> it is sent on a double helix to the left. From there, the train makes its way under the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> and over {{to the top of the}} station, making the riders feel as if they could touch it with their feet. Then it turns right and travels {{alongside}} of the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> and then turns right 180 degrees. At this point the train is very close to the ground. Then, it turns 180 degrees to the left into the activating brakes.|$|R
50|$|Another train may pass by {{the riders}} {{climbing}} the <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> It {{is also possible}} to make out riders on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority passing through the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> bay, as well as riders on the other track climbing the <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> At the top, riders descend a short drop and then descend {{through a series of}} turns, sharp climbs, and steep drops {{in the darkness of the}} mountain. The ride ends with trains passing through a red swirling wormhole and then hitting the final brake run, before returning to the unload station. After unloading, trains then travel around a short turn and climb a short <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> to return to the loading station.|$|R
50|$|I to the <b>hills</b> will <b>lift</b> mine eyes,from whence doth come mine aid.My safety cometh {{from the}} Lord,who heav'n and earth hath made.|$|R
50|$|Turbo Mountain was a steel {{roller coaster}} at Adventure World in Perth, Western Australia, Australia. The ride {{was closed and}} removed in 2009 {{to make room for}} a HUSS Shot'N Drop tower named Freefall. The ride was {{originally}} located in Luna Park Sydney as a standard Schwarzkopf Jet Star 2 bought second hand. When the ride was moved to Adventure World in 1991, the ride's <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> was modified from a spiral <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> to a standard chain <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> due to maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> or chain hill, is an upward-sloping {{section of}} track on {{a roller coaster}} on which the roller coaster train is {{mechanically}} lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast {{throughout the rest of}} the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple <b>lift</b> <b>hills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Riders {{are seated}} in a dragon-themed train in pairs with a lap bar restraint. The train is taken up a {{friction}} wheel <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> to a height of 13 m. At {{the top of this}} hill, riders can see across Universal Studios Singapore's lagoon and towards othe areas of the park. A small drop follows the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> that then leads into two downward helices. The train then dips diagonally under the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> before elevating and approaching the back end of the station and passing over top. The train then runs back parallel with the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> before entering two separate helices and entering the brake run. Throughout several times the train passes themed elements including Shrek's Swamp, a forest and Medieval areas.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{begins with}} riders {{in the station}} facing the {{entrance}} to the ride. Immediately after dispatch the train takes a 180° turn over the queue area and into the transfer track, which runs parallel to the station. After passing through the transfer track, the train dips down and under the final brake run before latching onto the <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> chain. The <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> chain takes the train {{up to the top of}} the hill. Once at the top of the <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> the train dips down a little and makes a turn to the right as riders overlook the park's main entrance and the parking lot. The train then dives down its initial 85 ft drop at almost 50 mph.|$|R

50|$|The Giant Inverted Boomerang is a {{departure}} from Vekoma's earlier Boomerang designs. This model features a vertical cable <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> that quickly <b>lifts</b> the train up a vertical tower. Also, this model is larger than previous Boomerang designs. From above, the track layout looks like an 'X'.|$|R
5000|$|For the new [...] "Twister," [...] ride {{designer}} John Fetterman {{created a}} modified {{mirror image of}} the original [...] "Mister Twister" [...] layout, compacting the ride but preserving the highlights of the old design and Allen's original mathematical model. These highlights included the large double helix, which now wraps around the ride's curved station, and a large swoop curve {{at the top of the}} <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> To keep the swoop curve in the new design, Fetterman created a split <b>lift</b> <b>hill.</b> To achieve this, the train climbs halfway up the structure on one <b>lift</b> <b>hill,</b> makes a 180-degree turn and finishes the climb on the second lift, stacked directly above the first one. While several roller coasters use more than one <b>lift</b> <b>hill</b> in their layout, Twister's zig-zag lift is unique.|$|R
