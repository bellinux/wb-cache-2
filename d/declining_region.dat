40|$|The {{abundance}} of Rio Grande wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) {{in the southeastern}} Edwards Plateau of Texas has declined since the late 1970 s. Because knowledge of reproductive rates is important to understanding the dynamics of a population, radio-tagged hens were monitored during the 2005 ? 2007 reproductive seasons to evaluate and compare reproductive parameters from areas with both declining and stable population trends. During January?March of 2005 ? 2007, turkey hens were captured and radiotagged on 4 study areas; 2 within a region of stable turkey populations, and 2 within a region of declining populations. Monitoring occurred from January?July each season to determine nest- site locations. Nesting attempts, nest fate, clutch size, initiation date, and nest age were recorded. Nests were monitored ? 3 times weekly in order to estimate production parameters and daily nest survival. Poults were captured by hand and fitted with a 1. 2 glue-on transmitter and monitored daily to estimate daily survival. Estimates show production was greater in stable regions than declining regions of the Edwards Plateau. Eighty-four percent of hens attempted to nest in the stable region and 67 % attempted in the <b>declining</b> <b>region.</b> Eighteen of 102 nests were successful (? 1 egg hatched), in the stable region and 7 of 60 nests were successful in the <b>declining</b> <b>region.</b> Nest-survival analysis showed an influence of temporal variation within years, yet no differences in nest survival were detected between stable and declining regions. Poult survival also showed no difference between regions. The 2 overall objectives {{of this study were}} to determine if nesting parameters and nest survival were limiting factors in Rio Grande wild turkey abundance in the Edwards Plateau. Regional differences in production suggest the cause of the decline in the southeastern portion of the Edwards Plateau could be associated with lower reproductive output and consequently, success. Regional differences in nest survival were not detected, thus not likely to cause differences in turkey abundance between regions...|$|E
40|$|A {{recurring}} {{question in}} {{regional and national}} politics in Sweden is how Norrland a sparsely populated and partly <b>declining</b> <b>region</b> {{in the north of}} the country will be able to survive in the long run. The answer to this question varies between different political parties. With Swedish parliamentary material (non-government bills) as the point of departure this paper examines how the region of Norrland is used and created in political rhetoric. Four discourses were identified that all tried to fixate Norrland in different ways. The paper argues that pro-Norrland arguments may be counterproductive on a discursive level due to how they are organised. By identifying two dominant logics that traversed the different discourses and affected the processes of meaning making, we describe how pro-Norrland arguments that differ ideologically and/or employ different discourses reproduced a common view of Norrland as an inherently rural, remote and problematic area. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Health {{disparities between}} {{population}} declining and non-declining areas have received little attention, even though population decline is an established phenomenon in Europe. Selective migration, in which healthier people {{move out of}} deprived areas, can possibly explain worse health in <b>declining</b> <b>regions.</b> We assessed whether selective migration can explain the observed worse average health in <b>declining</b> <b>regions</b> as compared with non-declining regions in the Netherlands. Methods: Combining data from the Dutch Housing and Living Survey held in 2002 and 2006 with Dutch registry data, we studied the relation between health status and migration in a 5 -year period {{at the individual level}} by applying logistic regression. In our sample of 130 600 participants, we compared health status, demographic and socioeconomic factors of movers and stayers from <b>declining</b> and non-declining <b>regions.</b> Results: People in the Netherlands who migrated are healthier than those staying behind [odds ratio (OR) : 1. 80]. This effect is larger for persons moving out of <b>declining</b> <b>regions</b> (OR: 1. 76) than those moving into <b>declining</b> <b>regions</b> (OR: 1. 47). When controlled for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, these effects are not significant. Moreover, {{only a small part of}} the population migrates out of (0. 29 %) or into (0. 25 %) <b>declining</b> <b>regions</b> in the course of 5 years. Conclusion: Despite the relation between health and migration, the effect of selective migration on health differences between <b>declining</b> and non-declining <b>regions</b> in the Netherlands is small.

The statistical mechanics of a micro-canonical ensemble of isochrone oscillators shows that the temperature reaches a maximum {{as a function of}} the energy and then declines to zero at the escape energy.

We then define the internal temperature of an ensemble of binary stars all at the same (negative) energy and show that they too get cooler when heated and hotter when cooled. When the internal temperature of a binary is less that the temperature of the stars it interacts with, then on average heat will flow into it, making it less bound and of still lower temperature. Conversely hard binaries have higher internal temperatures than the local stars, so they lose energy and become hotter and yet more strongly bound, a process invoked by Michel Hénon in his explanation of star-cluster evolution. Finally we give an isochronal {{variation of}} Newton’s exactly soluble N-body problem. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} findings yielded by {{the empirical}} study {{performed in the}} framework of an RGNF grant entitled “Image of a region as a communicative strategy for the authorities and mass media”. The methods of study included expert survey and formal survey (N= 1000, July-September 2013), studying the opinion of respondents who were either internal experts residing in the Volgograd region (N= 20; May-September 2013) or external experts who reside outside the region but maintain stable ties with the representatives of state and municipal authorities, regional mass media and business. The findings indicate that the Volgograd region has fallen behind other modernized Russian regions, that young people tend to leave it, that a negative image of the region as a declining territory persists. Answers to the open question “What is unacceptable for you in the existing image of the Volgograd region?” revealed major problems determining the local context of a <b>declining</b> <b>region,</b> and those were issues associated with inefficient regional/municipal administration: “the condition of the roads”, “constant replacement of people in the administration”, “politics as a whole”, “a destitute region without a good manager”, “unemployment”, “countryside is dying off”, “indifference of the authorities”, “roads, housing and public utilities and the administration”, “the authorities are not responsible for the people”, “the authorities do not solve the problems of the city or its people”, “thieving”, “dishonest authorities”, “the region goes to rack and ruin, no kindergartens or jobs”, “one cannot even walk in the streets”, “corruption”, “a stagnant region with low pay”, “no perspectives in the future”, “the region is stagnating due to corruption among officials”. According to the local Census Bureau, the Volgograd region can be classified as a declining territory where the population decline exceeds incoming migrants.

40|$|Trembling aspen {{recently}} experienced extensive crown thinning, branch dieback, {{and mortality}} across North America. Most <b>decline</b> <b>regions</b> experienced exceptionally severe drought preceding these episodes. Decline tended {{to occur in}} marginally suitable habitat, and climatic suitability decreased markedly in the period leading up to decline in almost all <b>decline</b> <b>regions.</b> Other factors, notably multi-year defoliation by tent caterpillars and stem damage by fungi and insects, also play substantial roles in decline episodes. Many severely affected stands have poor regeneration potential, raising concerns that increasing aridity could ultimately lead to widespread loss of aspen forest cover. The analysis indicates that exceptional droughts were {{a major cause of}} the decline episodes, especially in the drier regions, and that aspen is sensitive to drought in much of its range. Models suggest that we should expect substantial loss of suitable habitat within the current distribution, especially in the USA and Mexico. Particularly in the interior western U.

Further, they suggest approaches for deciding where to invest in management under changing climates, taking advantage of the diversity offered by changes in elevation and aspect...|$|R

40|$|Since 1970, Rio Grande {{wild turkey}} (Meleagris gallapavo intermedia) {{numbers in the}} {{southern}} region of the Edwards Plateau of Texas have been declining. Nest-site characteristics and invertebrate abundance were hypothesized as limiting wild turkey numbers in declining regions. Wild turkeys were trapped and fitted with mortality-sensitive radio transmitters on 4 study areas; 2 within a region of stable (northern Edwards Plateau) populations, and 2 within a region of declining populations. Monitoring occurred from February 2001 to August 2003. Nest-site locations were determined via homing during the breeding season. Following nesting attempts/completions, nest fate, vegetation height, visual obstruction, litter depth, percent cover, and cover scores of forbs, grass, litter, and bare ground at each nest site and surrounding area were sampled. This was done to determine if wild turkey hens selected nest sites with vegetative characteristics differing from surrounding habitat. Brood survival was calculated as > 1 poult surviving to 2 -weeks. Broods were followed for 6 -weeks post-hatch or to brood failure. Invertebrates were collected, via sweep-net and D-vac, at each visually confirmed brood location and a paired random site to determine if wild turkey hens selected brood habitat based on invertebrate abundance. Analyses were performed to determine if invertebrate abundance differed between study regions. Turkey hens selected nest sites with greater visual obstruction and more litter depth on both regions of stable and declining turkey abundance. No vegetative differences were detected between stable and <b>declining</b> <b>region</b> nest sites. Frequency of Orthoptera was 3 ? 5 times greater at nest sites on stable regions than declining regions in all 3 years. Orthoptera is a noted food source for young galliformes and comprised the majority of dry mass in invertebrate samples, nest sites and brood locations, on both the stable and declining regions. No differences in total invertebrate dry mass were detected between regional brood locations. Nest-site vegetative characteristics did not alter nest success between regions. The 2 overall objectives {{of this study were}} to determine if nest-site vegetation characteristics and invertebrate abundance affected wild turkey numbers in the Edwards Plateau. Regional differences in vegetative characteristics were not detected, thus not likely to be causing differences in turkey numbers between regions.

Following this, regional variety measures are decomposed into domestic and foreign subsets, and a new variable, ownership variety, is introduced. Findings suggest that regional employment growth is due to related variety in the domestic set in earlier phases, whereas the economy has evolved into a stage in which relatedness among foreign firms enhances regional employment growth significantl...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{technological change}} in coal mines in five regions [...] the Northern and Southern Appalachians, the Rocky Mountains, the Interior and Gulf and Northern Great Plains. Such an analysis can help identify the regions that are growth centres {{of the future}} and those that are the declining centres, so that an orderly transfer of manpower and resources from the latter to the former can be brought about efficiently and expeditiously. Section 2 deals with changes in production profiles, over time, of the regions by dividing coal mines into underground and surface mines. It concludes that the Appalachian <b>regions</b> are the <b>declining</b> <b>regions</b> with lower labour productivity and that the Northern Great Plains, with its increasing labour productivity, is the expanding region. Technological changes (TC) in underground mines consist of replacement of conventional mining machines by the continuous miners and the replacement of the latter by the long-wall machines. The TC in the surface mines is the substitution of intermediate- and large-sized power shovels and draglines (PS and Ds) for their smaller size counterparts. Section 3 presents a methodology of S-shaped growth curves. Section 4 reports empirical results for growth rates of adoption of the newer techniques across regions. These results reveal that the Northern Great Plains region is not absorbing the manpower and resources released by the Appalachian regions so that there are shortages in the former in the face of unemployment in the latter. There is, therefore, an opportunity for the <b>declining</b> Appalachian <b>regions</b> to inform their surplus manpower and resources about the growth centre in the north and prepare them for relocation, retraining and readjustment to the changes. ...|$|R
