In addition, to study the possible reversal of drug effects by sympathetic stimulation, AV node conduction and tachycardia induction were reassessed during isoproterenol infusion (1 to 3 μg/min), a dose calculated to increase the rest heart rate by 25 ± 10 %. Sustained AV node reentrant tachycardia could be initiated in all 16 patients in the control state, in 2 patients after <b>encainide</b> and in 10 patients during isoproterenol infusion. The shortest mean atrial paced cycle length sustaining 1 : 1 AV conduction was 358 ± 57 ms during the control study, which increased to 409 ± 59 ms with <b>encainide</b> (p < 0. 01 versus control) and decreased to 313 ± 31 ms during isoproterenol infusion (p < 0. 01 versus control and <b>encainide).</b> he shortest mean ventricular paced cycle length with 1 : 1 ventriculoatrial conduction was 337 ± 56 ms in the control study, 551 + 124 ms with <b>encainide</b> infusion (p < 0. 01 versus control) and 354 ± 72 ms during isoproterenol infusion in the encainide-loaded state (p < 0. 01 versus both control and <b>encainide).</b> During a mean follow-up period of 19 ± 10 months, significant clinical recurrences occurred in 4 of the 10 patients in whom tachycardia could still be initiated with <b>encainide</b> (with or without isoproterenol).

30|$|Cardiology has {{improved}} outcomes through well-designed, large RCTs and emphasizes {{a model of}} cooperation between academia and industry [28]. Cardiology RCTs adjusted design from lessons learned from earlier missteps. For example, the CAST trial [29, 30] enrolled patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias and randomized to the anti-arrhythmics moricizine, <b>encainide</b> or flecainide versus placebo. At the first interim analysis, the DSMB recommended stopping the <b>encainide</b> and flecainide arms (pooled mortality was higher than placebo). Ironically, a later editorial bemoaned that two “potentially efficacious” drugs could be removed from clinical usage, not mentioning the increased mortality [30]. CAST catalyzed rigorous, independent monitoring of RCTs [31] [e.g., Academic Research Organizations in independent DSMBs and regulatory guidance on DSMB function (www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/ 98 fr/ 01 d- 0489 -gdl 0003.pdf)].|$|E
40|$|Conduction slowing is {{the major}} in vivo effect of sodium channel {{blocking}} drugs. Although this action may promote arrhythmia suppression, apparently paradoxical arrhythmia aggravation does occur. The latter outcome is most frequently seen during treatment with the class IC agents such as <b>encainide</b> or flecainide, which are potent depressors of conduction even at usual plasma concentrations and heart rates. Anecdotal reports in patients with such drug toxicity have suggested a beneficial effect of sodium lactate or NaHCO 3 administration. The purpose of this study, therefore, {{was to examine the}} changes induced by sodium loading on the electrophysi-ologic properties of the canine ventricle pretreated with a class IC drug. Thirty dogs received loading and maintenance infusions of O-desmethyl <b>encainide</b> (ODE), an <b>encainide</b> metabolite that as a sodium channel blocker is approximately 10 times more potent than the parent drug. Interventions were administered during the maintenance phase when stable plasma ODE concentrations of 448 ± 68 (SEM) ng/ml were present, and QRS was prolonged from 62 ± 1 to 89 + 2 msec, and HV was prolonged from 28 ± 1 to 50 ± 1 msec.

40|$|AbstractPatients {{randomized}} to placebo in the <b>encainide</b> and flecainide {{arms of the}} Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) {{have been}} found to have a relatively low 1 -year mortality rate of 3. 9 % in comparison with previous studies of patients in the postmyocardial infarction period. To determine the comparability of CAST with previous studies, baseline variables were examined in the 743 patients randomized to placebo in the flecainide and <b>encainide</b> arms of CAST. Twenty-three baseline characteristics were correlated with major outcome events: arrhythmic death (16 events), total mortality (26 events) and congestive heart failure (51 events). On multivariate analysis the risk of new or worsening congestive heart failure was significantly associated with diuretic use, diabetes, high New York Heart Association functional class, age, prolonged QRS duration and low ejection fraction. The risk of arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest was significantly associated with an index Q wave myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, use of digitalis, diabetes and prolonged QRS duration. Total mortality or resuscitated cardiac arrest was significantly associated with an index Q wave myocardial infarction, diabetes, ST segment depression, high functional class, prolonged QRS duration and low ejection fraction. The variables at baseline associated with mortality from all causes or arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest and heart failure in the CAST placebo-treated patients are similar to those identified in previous postmyocardial infarction studies. Thus, the observation of increased mortality in CAST associated with the administration of <b>encainide</b> and flecainide for suppression of ventricular premature depolarizations is probably applicable to any comparably defined group of patients in the postmyocardial infarction period...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs after myocardial infarction improves survival, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was initiated. Suppression was evaluated before randomization during an open label titration period. Patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed were randomized in the main study and those whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed were randomized in a substudy. Overall survival and survival free of arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest were higher in patients treated with <b>encainide</b> or flecainide than in patients treated with placebo. However, the death rate in patients randomized to placebo therapy was lower than expected. This report describes the survival experience of all patients enrolled in CAST and compares it with mortality in other studies of patients with ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. As of April 18, 1989, 2, 371 patients had enrolled in CAST and entered prerandomization, open label titration: 1, 913 (81 %) were randomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy (1, 775 patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed and 138 patients whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed during open label titration); and 458 patients (19 %) were not randomized because {{they were still in}} titration, had died during titration or had withdrawn. Including all patients who enrolled in CAST, the actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of 1 -year mortality was 10. 3 %. To estimate the “natural” mortality rate of patients enrolled in CAST, an analysis was done that adjusted for deaths that might be attributable to <b>encainide</b> or flecainide treatment either during prerandomization, open label drug titration or after randomization. Because the censoring procedure excluded patients treated with <b>encainide</b> or flecainide after randomization, the mortality estimate will be less than the unadjusted mortality estimate of 10. 3 %. A minimal 1 -year “natural” mortality rate of 6. 3 % was estimated by assuming that all deaths during open label titration with <b>encainide</b> or flecainide were due to drug treatment and that after randomization all excess mortality in the group randomized to active treatment was also due to drug effect. A maximal 1 -year “natural” mortality rate of 8. 4 % was estimated by assuming that no deaths during open label titration with <b>encainide</b> or flecainide were due to drug treatment and that after randomization all excess mortality in the group randomized to active treatment was due to drug effect. Thus, the “natural” overall mortality rate in CAST, falling somewhere between 6. 3 % and 8. 4 %, is similar to rates observed in other postinfarction natural history studies, suggesting that the low mortality rate in the group randomized to placebo is largely due to the process of selecting only those enrolled patients for the randomized phase of CAST whose ventricular arrhythmias were suppressed in the prerandomization open label titration phase...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that antiarrhythmic drugs that decrease RR variability will predict all-cause mortality during follow-up after myocardial infarction. Background. RR variability, a noninvasive indicator of autonomic nervous system activity, predicts death after acute myocardial infarction independently of other risk predictors and changes substantially in response to some drugs. A previous study in patients with chronic heart disease and frequent ventricular premature complexes reported that flecainide decreased vagal modulation of RR intervals but amiodarone did not. The investigators of that study speculated that changes in RR variability during antiarrhythmic drug therapy predict an increased mortality rate during long-term drug treatment. To explore this hypothesis further, we compared the effects of <b>encainide</b> and flecainide, which increase long-term mortality substantially, on RR variability with the effects of placebo and moricizine, which have no significant effect on mortality during long-term treatment of unsustained ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Methods. The 24 -h power spectral density was computed from the baseline electrocardiography recordings and drug evaluation tapes, and six frequency domain measures of RR variability were calculated: ultra-low frequency (2. 0, adjusted p < 0. 05). The antiarrhythmic drug-induced change in measures of RR variability was not a significant predictor of all-cause mortality during a year of follow-up after myocardial infarction. Conclusions. <b>Encainide,</b> flecainide and moricizine all caused a decrease in RR variability in patients studied ~ 1 month after acute myocardial infarction. <b>Encainide</b> and flecainide caused a significant increase in mortality rates; placebo and moricizine did not. Baseline measurements of RR variability also predicted all-cause mortality after myocardial infarction. The decrease in RR variability produced by the three antiarrhythmic drugs did not predict mortality during follow-up...|$|E

Arrhythmias {{resulting}} from treatment with sodium channel-blocking antiarrhythmic drugs {{have been successfully}} treated with sodium infusion, although the mechanism underlying this effect is uncertain. Methods and Results. In this study, we used a multielectrode array {{to examine the effects}} of O-desmethyl <b>encainide</b> (ODE), a potent sodium channel-blocking metabolite of <b>encainide,</b> on conduction in canine ventricle. ODE depressed both longitudinal and transverse conduction velocities in a plasma concentra-tion-related fashion (r =- 0. 74,- 0. 60;p 300 ng/ml (n= 17), conduction was significantly more impaired longitudinally than transversely (- 44. 5 ± 11. 7 % versus- 34. 4 ± 13. 7 %, p< 0. 02). In 12 animals with high concentrations (mean, 432 ± 32 ng/ml), a 5 -meqlkg bolus of sodium chloride over 1 minute immediately increased conduction velocity; this effect was significantly greater and longer lasting in the longitudinal orientation. In two animals, conduction block in the longitudinal orientation was documented at high plasma ODE and was immediately reversed by sodium bolus. Conclusions. We conclude that the major effect of sodium in animals with excess sodium channel bloc...|$|E

The IA drugs all produced significant slowing of spontaneous rate in therapeutic concentrations. The IB agents did so only in concentrations well above therapeutic levels and the IC drugs were of intermediate potency.
