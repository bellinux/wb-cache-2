5|$|However, {{this was}} another {{temporary}} home. The club stayed <b>here</b> <b>until</b> 1905, when they moved into Windsor Park. The club's first silverware at Windsor arrived in the 1906–07 season, with the club lifting both the league title and the County Antrim Shield. This {{would be the first}} of a trio of league titles, with the 1907–08 and 1908–09 league titles to follow.|$|E

5|$|The {{underground}} station was opened on 27 March 1907 by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway {{under the name}} Great Central (following a change from its intended name Lisson Grove). The railway terminated <b>here</b> <b>until</b> the extension to Edgware Road opened on 15 June. The station was renamed Marylebone on 15 April 1917. The original name still appears in places on the platform wall tiling, although the tiling scheme is a replacement designed to reflect the original scheme.|$|E

5|$|At Remagen the 47th Regiment {{was given}} the mission of {{guarding}} the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine River. Twenty five years later the 47th would once again guard this bridge during World War II. The regiment remained <b>here</b> <b>until</b> given orders to return home in mid-summer 1919. Before his departure from Europe, Middleton was summoned {{to report to the}} Third Army Chief of Staff in Koblenz. Here he was informed that he and other senior officers were being assigned to Camp Benning, Georgia to form the first faculty of the Infantry School that was being established there. Middleton sailed out of Brest in mid-July, met his wife in New York, and together they traveled to Columbus, Georgia by way of Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, now already {{sixty years}} old, {{he got the}} chance to put his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch {{government}} appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed <b>here</b> <b>until</b> early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to Czechoslovakia. In Prague he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, inter alia looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm Philips.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{southern}} waterfront, {{away from}} the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located <b>here</b> <b>until</b> 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.|$|E

5|$|The {{headquarters}} of North Yorkshire County Council (County Hall) and Hambleton District Council (the Civic Centre) are both located in Northallerton; these serve many parishes in the area. The RPA (Rural Payments Agency) was based <b>here</b> <b>until</b> 2014. The nearby base at RAF Leeming {{is a major}} source of employment and income in the area. Northallerton Prison, which used to house young offenders and adults from the North Yorkshire area, closed in 2014. It once had the world's largest treadmill.|$|E
5|$|Forester {{was built}} by J. Samuel White at its Cowes {{shipyard}} under the 1932 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 15 May 1933, launched on 28 June 1934, as the eleventh ship to carry the name, and completed on 19 April 1935. The ship cost 248,898 pounds, excluding Admiralty supplied equipment such as armaments and communications sets. Forester was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sister ships, during the Abyssinian crisis in June and remained <b>here</b> <b>until</b> February 1936. She was deployed to Gibraltar in September–October 1937 during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. The ship then returned home {{and spent the next}} two years with the 6th DF. The flotilla was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939, five months before the start of World War II. Forester remained assigned to it until June 1940, escorting the larger ships of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Hindu {{philosopher and}} saint Adi Shankara (c. 8th century) is {{believed}} to have established Govardhana matha in Puri, with Vimala as its presiding goddess. According to Starza (author of The Jagannatha Temple at Puri), the Jagannath Temple was once a centre of worship for the Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, along with their consorts and the three central forms of the Hindu Goddess, Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Parvati (in the form of Vimala). The Shri Vidya sect devoted to Goddess worship was strong <b>here</b> <b>until</b> the 17th century. Slowly, Shri Vidya and Shiva-centric Shaiva traditions were eroded but remnants continue, with the Vishnu-centric Vaishnavism becoming the sole tradition. The Tantric Panchamakara, which includes fish, meat, liquor, parched grain and ritual intercourse, were replaced with vegetarian offerings and dance of devdasis. Fish was caught locally and offered to the goddess. King Narasimhadeva, who ruled between 1623–47, ended the meat and fish offerings of the goddess, although the tradition was later partly revitalized. Today, the goddess is offered meat and fish on special days.|$|E

5|$|The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore {{was built}} between 1718 and 1778. Its {{principal}} façade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral {{has a high}} Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles (Illustration 3). Ragusa Superiore, the most badly damaged part of the town, was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, {{is very different from}} the palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered on <b>here</b> <b>until</b> the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{similarity}} between Skerryvore and Dubh Artach 20miles (32kilometres) {{to the south}} east, led to the NLB painting a distinctive red band round the middle section of the latter in 1890. The Hynish Shore Station {{had the advantage of}} proximity to the site during the construction period. However, the small harbour offered little shelter for shipping. The keepers operated from <b>here</b> <b>until</b> 1892 when operations were transferred to Erraid adjacent to the Isle of Mull. Other than the signal tower, the land and buildings on Tiree were sold to George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll who had witnessed the laying of the first stone on Skerryvore fifty-two years previously. A paddle steamer, Signal, built by Laird of Greenock in 1883 was based at Erraid for relief operations. The shore station was moved to Oban in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived <b>here</b> <b>until</b> 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
