40|$|Objective Common mental {{disorders}} (CMDs) {{are among the}} leading causes of sick leave, and more knowledge on factors related to work participation and return-to-work (RTW) in CMDs is needed. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate RTW-expectations and illness perceptions as predictors of benefit recipiency in CMDs. Design Study participants were enrolled in a randomised controlled trial and reported CMDs as a main obstacle for work participation. Three prespecified subgroups were included: people at risk of going on sick leave, people on sick leave (> 3  weeks) or people on long-term benefits. Baseline questionnaire data and registry data at baseline and 6  months were used to investigate predictors of benefit recipiency at 6 -month <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Benefit</b> recipiency included sickness benefits, disability pension, work assessment allowance and unemployment benefits. Results In this study, uncertain and negative RTW-expectations were strong predictors of benefit recipiency at 6  months follow-up. Illness perceptions predicted benefit recipiency in the unadjusted model, but not in the fully adjusted model. In the subgroup on sick leave, uncertain and negative RTW-expectations predicted benefit recipiency, while in the subgroup of people at risk of going on sick leave, negative RTW-expectations predicted benefit recipiency. In the subgroup on long-term benefits, only female gender predicted benefit recipiency. Conclusions For people with CMDs, uncertain and negative RTW-expectations predict later benefit recipiency, and expectations seem particularly important for those at risk of or on sick leave. For those at risk of sick leave, benefit recipiency at follow-up denoted a transition onto sick leave or long-term benefit, while those on sick leave had remained so or were receiving long-term benefits. Addressing RTW-expectations in occupational healthcare services or vocational rehabilitation might be beneficial in early stages or even prior to a sick leave episode. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of adapting group-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-G) for patients with chronic post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: Thirteen subjects with DSM-IV-defined PTSD, with symptom duration greater than 12 months, entered the study, an 8 -week treatment programme conducted in a clinical setting using IPT-G modified for the treatment of PTSD. Data obtained were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: All 13 subjects completed the treatment programme and showed significant improvement in social functioning, general wellbeing and depressive symptoms. Treatment completers demonstrated a moderate reduction in the avoidant symptom cluster of PTSD. These improvements appeared stable at 3 -month <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Benefits</b> appeared to be associated with perceived intra-therapy progress in resolving identified IPT problem areas. Qualitative analysis found that themes of 2 ̆ 7 reconnection 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 interpersonal efficacy 2 ̆ 7 were core parts of the experience of the treatment. Conclusion: IPT-G modified for PTSD appears to be of modest symptomatic benefit, but may lead to improvement in social functioning, general psychological wellbeing and enhanced interpersonal functioning.

40|$|Pharmacoeconomic {{analysis}} of antihypertensive treatment {{should be performed}} following a correct methodological evaluation and considering with accuracy both {{costs and benefits of}} different therapeutic options. Costs evaluation is frequently performed simply examining the retail price of drugs which represents only a part (usually no more than 50 %) of cumulative costs of therapy. Controlled clinical trials are the main source of information about benefits of therapy, but probably, in many cases, they underestimate the benefits of treatment and are unable to differentiate the effects of different drugs because of a too short <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Benefits</b> should be calculated {{not only in terms of}} saved lives or prevented events, but also in terms of prevention-regression of target organ damage and of quality of life of patients. If analysis are performed correctly, more recent drugs, like ATII antagonists, even if they have a higher retail price, become highly costeffective thanks to their protective activity against events, and to unbeatable levels of compliance and persistence which are associated with treatment with these drugs. Comparison between old (cheaper) and newer (more expensive) drugs, and recommendations to start therapy with the cheaper drugs, are a nonsense since to achieve goal blood pressure combinations of more drugs are always necessary. Treatment of hypertension, if extended to all patients and performed aggressively, must be considered not only a life-saving, but also a money-saving tool...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to discover the views of patients about the effects of breast-reduction surgery carried out 2 years previously, to detect any change from perceptions at 3 – 6 months after surgery, and to determine whether the benefits of this operation are maintained long term. Qualitative research methods were employed, comprising: (a) an open-format survey of opinions; (b) semi-structured telephone interviews with a smaller number of patients; and (c) assessment of self-concept using a well-known scalar measure (the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale). The subjects were 93 patients treated at the regional Plastic Surgery Service in Salisbury, who had previously participated in a quantitative study at 3 – 6 months after surgery. Sixty patients responded to the 2 -year <b>follow-up.</b> <b>Benefits</b> of breast reduction most valued by patients did not change significantly with time and were: relief of pain and discomfort, which led to increased physical activity and better general health; greatly increased choice and fit of attractive clothes and underwear; improved personal and social life, leading to enhanced relationships with partner or friends; and greatly improved self-confidence in all areas of life. The interaction of all these factors led to improved self-image and improved quality of life. The main disadvantage of the operation for a small number of patients was the persistence of painful, disfiguring scarring which in two cases had a detrimental effect on social and personal relationships and led to a deterioration in quality of life. Improvement in self-esteem after surgery was maintained in 55 out of the 60 2 -year responders.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To develop French {{recommendations}} {{about the}} clinical and laboratory follow-up {{of patients with}} axial ankylosing spondylitis (AS) seen in everyday practice. METHODS: The recommendations were developed based on evidence from the literature and on expert opinion. A Delphi consensus procedure was used by a scientific committee to select five focal points, about which evidence was obtained by searching Medline and the databases maintained by the French Society for Rheumatology, European League against Rheumatism, and American College of Rheumatology. The results of the literature review were used {{by a panel of}} experienced rheumatologists to draft and to validate the recommendations, using expert opinion if needed to supplement gaps in published knowledge. For each recommendation, the level of evidence and the level of agreement among the experts were specified. RESULTS: The three focal points selected using the Delphi procedure dealt with choosing the best clinical and laboratory parameters for monitoring patients with AS; whether <b>follow-up</b> <b>benefits</b> from the use of composite indices (e. g., the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index [BASDAI], the BAS Functional Index [BASFI] and the BAS Metrology Index [BASMI]); and the clinical and laboratory parameters that predict functional or structural outcomes in patients with AS. The literature search retrieved 1510 relevant articles based on titles and abstracts, of which 322 were selected for in-depth review. Five recommendations about the clinical and laboratory follow-up of patients with AS were developed then validated by having all panel participants vote during a final meeting. CONCLUSION: Recommendations about the clinical and laboratory follow-up of patients with AS were developed. They can be expected to improve clinical practice uniformity and, in the longer term, to optimize the management of patients with AS...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI) {{has become}} the favored reperfusion strategy in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Lower post-PCI myocardial perfusion grade, no-reflow and even drug-eluting stent thrombosis have been related {{to the presence of}} intracoronary thrombus. Adjunctive thrombectomy refers to procedures and devices that remove thrombotic material from the infarction-related artery, in theory, before distal embolization can occur. There is substantial variability between randomized controlled trials of thrombectomy in primary PCI with regards to tested devices, procedural characteristics, adjuvant medical regimen and examined outcomes. As a general statement, improvements in myocardial perfusion endpoints do not translate into reductions in clinical outcomes. Yet, an increasing number of trials with a longer <b>follow-up</b> reported <b>benefits</b> arising late after the index myocardial infarction.

Fondaparinux is a synthetic selective Factor Xa inhibitor with a high efficacy and good safety, in terms of bleeding risk, in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, and {{in the treatment of}} non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (OASIS- 5). The OASIS- 6 trial was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing fondaparinux 2. 5 mg once daily with standard therapy, either placebo or unfractionated heparin according to the indication, in 12 092 patients with STEMI. At day 30, fondaparinux significantly reduced the occurrence of the primary efficacy outcome (death or recurrent myocardial infarction) by 14 % (p= 0. 008).

We undertook a multi-district study to determine if mid-CP follow-up is able to detect cases of treatment failures early among all types of patients with sputum smear-positive TB. Methodology: We reviewed existing records of patients with sputum smear-positive TB registered under the RNTCP in 43 districts across three states of India during a three month period in 2009. We estimated proportions of patients that could be detected as a case of treatment failure early, and assessed the impact of various policy options on laboratory workload and number needed to test to detect one case of treatment failure early.

The majority (56 / 61) preferred to receive follow-up care from the same care provider over time, for reasons related to a personal doctor-patient relationship and the physician's knowledge of the patient's history. About 75 % (43 / 56) preferred specialist follow-up to other follow-up models. However, primary care-based follow-up would be accepted by 57 % (39 / 68) provided that there is good communication between GPs and specialists, and sufficient knowledge among GPs about <b>follow-up.</b> Perceived <b>benefits</b> of primary care-based follow-up referred to the personal nature of the GPpatient relationship and the easy access to primary care. Perceived barriers included limited oncology knowledge and skills, time available, motivation among GPs to provide follow-up care and patients' confidence with the present specialist follow-up. Conclusions More than half of the patients were open to primary care-based follow-up. Patients' confidence with this follow-up model may increase by using survivorship care plans to facilitate communication across the primary/secondary interface and with patients. Training GPs to improve their oncology knowledge and skills might also increase patients' confidence...|$|R
40|$|Objective Mesh {{reinforcement}} in cystocele repair {{has become}} popular in recent years, with {{some evidence of}} reduced recurrence rates. In this retrospective cohort series, we aimed to assess subjective and objective outcomes, including ultrasound quantification of prolapse, following anterior colporrhaphy with and without mesh use for anterior compartment prolapse. Study design We assessed anatomical and functional outcomes of patients after cystocele repair in three tertiary urogynecology units. Outcome measures included either objective prolapse recurrence (defined as cystocele = Stage 2 ICS POP-Q or bladder descent = 10 mm below the symphysis pubis on ultrasound) or subjective prolapse recurrence (defined as symptoms of vaginal lump, bulge or dragging sensation post-operatively). Comparisons between mesh use and anterior colporrhaphy-only groups were undertaken, adjusting for potential confounders (age, BMI, vaginal parity, previous prolapse repair, levator avulsion and length of follow-up) using multiple linear regression and logistic regression methods. Results 183 patients were assessed at an average follow-up of 4 years. Eight-three patients had anterior colporrhaphy between January 2002 and December 2005, and 100 had an anterior mesh repair between March 2004 and October 2008. Forty-six (55 %) patients in the anterior colporrhaphy group compared to 33 (33 %) in the mesh use group were diagnosed with a recurrent cystocele (=stage 2) (p = 0. 002). After adjustment for age, BMI, previous vaginal delivery, previous vaginal repair surgery, and length of <b>follow-up,</b> the <b>benefit</b> of mesh on prolapse recurrence was principally experienced by women with major levator trauma. Conclusions At a mean of four years' follow-up, mesh augmentation was associated with reduced cystocele recurrence, but this effect was limited to patients with levator avulsion. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is considered to}} be an inevitably progressive disease. Complex therapies add to the financial and psychological burden. Very low-calorie diets (LCDs) are emerging as an option in the management of type 2 diabetes. Methods: We performed a clinical audit of patients with T 2 DM who received 12 weeks of LCD. Results: This case series documents that 6 out of 12 participants (median baseline HbA 1 c 9 %) achieved HbA 1 c level in nondiabetes range with LCD despite stopping all antidiabetes medications. There was an improvement in serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, C-Reactive protein, urine microalbumin, liver transaminases, liver fat and the indices of insulin resistance, beta cell secretory capacity, and insulin sensitivity. Conclusion: If long-term <b>follow-up</b> proves sustained <b>benefits,</b> such dietary restriction may be an alternative to more drastic options for reversal of type 2 diabetes. This may also help in changing the treatment perspective of a newly detected T 2 DM from an incurable and inevitably progressive disease to a potentially reversible disease...|$|R
40|$|Percutaneous mitral {{commissurotomy}} (PMC) {{has emerged}} as an effective nonsurgical technique {{for the treatment of}} patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis. This report highlights the immediate and long-term follow-up results of this procedure in an unselected cohort of patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis from a single center. PMC with Inoue balloon was performed in 70 patients in a 2 -year period (1993 - 1994). Age of patients ranged from 18 to 67 years (mean 38 ± 11). Atrial fibrillation was present in 18 (30 %) patients. A detailed clinical and echocardiographic (two-dimensional, continuous-wave Doppler and color-flow imaging) assessment was done at follow-up. The procedure was technically successful in 61 (85 %) patients with an increase in mitral valve area (MVA) from 0. 96 ± 0. 2 to 1. 7 ± 0. 28 cm² (P <. 001) and a reduction in mean trans-mitral gradient from 14. 3 ± 4. 8 to 6. 0 ± 2. 8 mmHg (P <. 01). Mitral regurgitation appeared or worsened in 25 (30 %) patients, of which 3 (4 %) developed severe mitral regurgitation. Urgent mitral valve replacement was performed in these 3 patients. Data of 52 patients followed over a period of 105 ± 10 months revealed MVA of 1. 4 ± 0. 4 cm. Elective mitral valve replacement was done in 14 (23 %) patients. Mitral restenosis diagnosed with echocardiography was seen in 24 (50 %) patients, of which 14 were having recurrence of class III or more symptoms and were treated with surgery. Thus, percutaneous mitral commissurotomy is an effective and safe procedure and over 2 / 3 of the patients were event-free at the end of <b>follow-up.</b> The <b>benefits</b> are sustained in most of these patients on long-term follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of halo immobilization in children younger than 3 years. Methods All children less than 3 years of age who were placed in a halo-orthosis at a tertiary pediatric center were reviewed to determine the indications, safety, and efficacy of this method. Adequacy of immobilization and correct technique was established considering the chronology of maturation (skull and brain development). The functional outcome was analyzed. Results Ten patients (years old) were identified from a total of 150 where halo ring/vest immobilization was used. There were six boys and four girls, {{with an average age}} of 2 years (range 10 months to 2 years and 10 months). The average time of immobilization in the halo-orthosis was 75 days (range 33 – 168 days), and the average follow-up time was 5 years and 2 months (range 1 – 12 years). There were two halo-related problems and four related to the index procedure. Halo-related problems included pin-site infection in one patient, and three pins loosening in another. There were four complications associated with the index procedure, all early in the series, including three cases of pseudarthrosis and one patient that had an insufficient decompression of basilar invagination. Two of the three failed fusions occurred at the occipito-cervical junction, which prompted us to develop new techniques for fusion at this level. Conclusions Halo-orthosis is a relatively safe and reliable device for immobilization of the upper cervical spine in children less than 3 years old. Understanding the devel-opmental anatomy and a limited CT scan are helpful in pin placement. We recommend the use of a multiple pin con-struct, perpendicular insertion, and precise tightening with good pin-site care and frequent <b>follow-up.</b> The <b>benefits</b> seem to outweigh the risks in this population, considering the mechanical advantages of the halo-orthosis...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) of India {{recommends}} follow-up sputum smear examination at {{two months}} into the continuation phase of treatment. The main intent of this (mid-CP) follow-up is to detect patients not responding to treatment around two-three months earlier than {{at the end of}} the treatment. However, the utility of mid-CP follow-up under programmatic conditions has been questioned. We undertook a multi-district study to determine if mid-CP follow-up is able to detect cases of treatment failures early among all types of patients with sputum smear-positive TB. MethodologyWe reviewed existing records of patients with sputum smear-positive TB registered under the RNTCP in 43 districts across three states of India during a three month period in 2009. We estimated proportions of patients that could be detected as a case of treatment failure early, and assessed the impact of various policy options on laboratory workload and number needed to test to detect one case of treatment failure early. ResultsOf 10055 cases, mid-CP follow-up was done in 6944 (69 %) cases. Mid-CP <b>follow-up</b> could <b>benefit</b> 117 / 8015 (1. 5 %) new and 206 / 2040 (10 %) previously-treated sputum smear-positive cases by detecting their treatment failure early. Under the current policy, 31 patients had to be tested to detect one case of treatment failure early. All cases of treatment failure would still be detected early if mid-CP follow-up were discontinued for new sputum smear-positive cases who become sputum smear-negative after the intensive-phase of treatment. This would reduce the related laboratory workload by 69 % and only 10 patients would need to be tested to detect one case of treatment failure early. ConclusionDiscontinuation of mid-CP follow-up among new sputum smear-positive cases who become sputum smear-negative after completing the intensive-phase of treatment will reduce the laboratory workload without impacting overall early detection of cases of treatment failure...|$|R
