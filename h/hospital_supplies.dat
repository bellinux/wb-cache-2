5|$|Intent {{on making}} more money, Forbes in November 1922 began selling {{valuable}} <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies</b> under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot in Maryland. The government had stockpiled huge quantities of <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies</b> {{during the first}} World War, which Forbes unloaded {{for a fraction of}} their cost to the Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly {{at a time when the}} Veterans' Bureau was buying supplies for the hospitals at a much higher price.|$|E
5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician {{and chairman of}} the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies</b> to an insider contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and in mid-March, Cramer committed suicide.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the UK <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain in light of recent government policy reform where patients will have, inter alia, greater choice of hospital for elective surgery. Subsequently, the hospital system should become far more competitive with supply chains having to react to these changes as patient demand becomes less predictable. Using a qualitative case study methodology, hospital managers are interviewed on a range of issues. Views on the development of the <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain in different phases are derived, and are used to develop a map of the current hospital chain. The findings show hospital managers anticipating some significant changes to the <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain and its workings as Patient Choice expands. The research also maps the various aspects of the <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain as it moves through different operational phases and highlights underlying challenges and complexities. The <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain as discussed and mapped in this research is original work given there are no examples in the literature that provide holistic representations of hospital activity. At the end, specific recommendations are provided tha...|$|R
25|$|Early on June 27, 1863, the New York troops {{left for}} Centreville. They watered their horses {{at a small}} stream {{crossing}} the road just outside Fairfax Court House, {{which would be the}} scene of some action when they returned. Upon their arrival at Centreville, about 10:00a.m., they found some Union Army <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies</b> which they inventoried and put in the care of a local storekeeper.

25|$|The {{proportion}} of GNP {{spent on the}} NHS rose from 4.2% in 1964 to about 5% in 1969. This additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and {{a significant increase in}} a hospital building programme. Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951–64 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service. Stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies,</b> while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care. In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools.|$|E
500|$|Although 300,000 {{soldiers}} had been wounded in combat, Forbes had only allowed 47,000 claims for disability insurance, while many were denied compensation {{for reasons that}} Congress called [...] "split hairs". [...] Even fewer veterans received any vocational training under Forbes' direction of the bureau. [...] According to the Charleston Gazette, Forbes toured with his contractor friends to the Pacific Coast, known as [...] "Joy-Rides", inspecting veterans' hospital construction sites. [...] Forbes and his contractor associates allegedly indulged in parties and drinking. [...] Forbes and corrupt contractors developed a secret code in order to communicate insider information and ensure government contracts. [...] According to congressional testimony, in Chicago, {{on one of his}} many inspection trips, Forbes gambled and took a $5,000 bribe from contractor J. W. Thompson and [...] E. H. Mortimer at the Drake Hotel to secure $17,000,000 in veterans' hospital construction contracts. [...] Mortimer was the middleman man who had handed Forbes the bribe in one of the rooms at the Drake. Forbes said the $5,000 payment was a loan. Mortimer stated that Forbes had an affair with Mortimer's wife while on the inspection tours. [...] After Forbes returned from his inspection tours he began to sell <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies</b> at severely discounted prices. [...] According to a Highbeam Business report, he sold nearly $7,000,000 of much needed <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies</b> for $600,000, a fraction of their worth. [...] Forbes was suspected of receiving kickbacks from contractors. [...] When President Harding ordered Forbes to stop, Forbes insubordinately disobeyed and kept selling supplies.|$|E

40|$|Challenges that {{hospitals}} are currently facing justify {{the focus on}} this research subject. The sector has to balance the seemingly incompatible demand of cost reduction and quality improvement. Despite <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chains having {{a great impact on}} hospital budgets, still opportunities for optimization exist. The prerequisite for <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain improvement is measurement. Therefore the purpose of this research is to identify performance indicators that allow the design of a hospital performance measurement system (HPMS) for the downstream pharmaceutical supply chain. This HPMS should answer the following question: to which degree the pharmaceutical supply chain in the hospital is efficient and effective and how to improve them?This paper is organized as follow: first, reviewing the literature on the <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain and the performance measurement. Second, modelling the <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain in order to gain profound understanding in its processes. Finally, designing a performance measurement system. Throughout the research, SCOR reference model is used for the modelling and the selection of indicators for the HPMS. Furthermore, the field research has been conducted based on semi-structured interviews with hospital staff from Belgian hospitals. 0 info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
500|$|With {{millions}} of dollars at his disposal, Forbes hired 30,000 new workers at the Veterans' Bureau, {{many of whom were}} personal friends to Forbes. [...] The Veterans' Bureau under Forbes was overstaffed and many appointed agents looked for means to justify their paid positions. [...] During his tenure as director, Forbes ignored the needs of the wounded veterans. [...] In the less than two years that Forbes held his position, he embezzled approximately $2 million, mainly in connection with the building of veterans' hospitals, from selling <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies</b> intended for the bureau, and from kickbacks from contractors. [...] The budget for the Veterans' Bureau during his tenure was $1.3 billion in total. [...] Forbes had rejected thousands of legitimate claims by veterans.|$|E
500|$|Forbes's resignation, however, {{would come}} earlier than June 1, 1923 as {{his friends had}} predicted. When President Harding was {{informed}} that Forbes had disobeyed a direct order to stop selling <b>hospital</b> <b>supplies,</b> Harding summoned him to the White House in January 1923. [...] Forbes pleaded with Harding {{to allow him to}} go to Europe to settle family matters. [...] Harding allowed him to flee to Europe only on the condition he would resign from the Veterans' Bureau. [...] While in Europe, he voluntarily resigned from office on February 15, 1923. [...] When Forbes took Elias H. Mortimer's wife to Europe with him, Mortimer decided to testify against him in a Congressional investigation that started on March 2, 1923. [...] Upon his return from Europe, Forbes visited President Harding at the White House. [...] The six-foot-tall President grabbed Forbes by the throat and began violently shaking him [...] "as a dog would a rat". [...] Forbes was saved from this attack when a guest who had an appointment with the President interrupted the altercation. [...] President Harding was angered over Forbes' duplicity in stopping the Perryville shipments. [...] The Senate investigation revealed Forbes had left 200,000 unopened pieces of mail from veterans at the Bureau. Belligerent before the Senate committee, Forbes renounced involvement in illegal activities. [...] Mortimer provided damaging information that Forbes took a $5,000 payment in Chicago and got kickbacks for land deals and building contracts for veterans' hospitals.

40|$|In recent years, the European {{hospital}} sector suffers {{the brunt}} of the economic crisis. This sector is now faced with a paradox, which is to reduce costs, related to the decline in government subsidies and an increase in the quality of care required by the regulatory bodies. This paradox can be resolved through the optimization of the <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Despite <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chains having a great impact on hospital budgets, still opportunities for optimization exist and improve the health care quality. This article aims to propose a conceptual framework that allows hospitals to evaluate the performance of their pharmaceutical supply chains in order to identify bottlenecks and cost reduction opportunities. After reviewing the literature regarding to the <b>hospital</b> <b>supply</b> chain and the performance measurement, the authors focused on the study of hospital processes of pharmaceutical distribution within the hospital. The findings of this study propose a conceptual framework that will allow hospital to measure the performance of their pharmaceutical supply chain. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
