In this paper, meta-synthetic methodology was used to investigate the <b>intervention</b> <b>mechanism</b> of online public opinion system.

We put forward a rumor <b>intervention</b> <b>mechanism</b> including intervention timing, intervention mode, and intervention intensity. Based on system modeling and simulation, an agricultural rumor case was used to verify the practical effects of online agricultural rumor intervention.

40|$|We {{consider}} a multi-user network where a network manager and selfish users interact. The network manager monitors {{the behavior of}} users and intervenes in the interaction among users if necessary, while users make decisions independently to optimize their individual objectives. In this paper, we develop a framework of <b>intervention</b> <b>mechanism</b> design, which is aimed to optimize {{the objective of the}} manager, or the network performance, taking the incentives of selfish users into account. Our framework is general enough to cover a wide range of application scenarios, and it has advantages over existing approaches such as Stackelberg strategies and pricing. To design an <b>intervention</b> <b>mechanism</b> and to predict the resulting operating point, we formulate a new class of games called intervention games and a new solution concept called intervention equilibrium. We provide analytic results about intervention equilibrium and optimal intervention mechanisms {{in the case of a}} benevolent manager with perfect monitoring. We illustrate these results with a random access model. Our illustrative example suggests that intervention requires less knowledge about users than pricing. Comment: 20 pages, 1 tabl...|$|E

While the 1999 Constitution identifies peace as a common aspiration, there is a deficit of a non-adversarial institutional mechanism to address violent identity related conflicts in Nigeria.

40|$|Purpose: This thesis {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} how theory-orientated approach to research synthesis of complex health care interventions may facilitate {{better understanding of}} <b>intervention</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Thesis intended also to evaluate how qualitative research compliments a systematic review and meta-analysis of complex health care interventions, especially what participants’ perceive as effective intervention features and how this compares with systematic review and meta-analysis evidence. By combining these different approaches thesis aimed to improve reporting of reviews of complex health care interventions by providing more detailed information about <b>intervention</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{that appear to be}} associated with a successful intervention. Methods: The thesis was built on a series of empirical studies. Multiple bibliographic databases and references of retrieved articles were searched for relevant review articles, randomised controlled and qualitative studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate effectiveness of psycho-educational smoking cessation interventions, while behaviour change techniques used in the studies and their suitability to change behavioural determinants were evaluated using a framework by Michie et al. (2008). Thematic analysis was conducted to explore qualitative studies, while narrative analysis was used to bring the different case studies together. Results: Psycho-educational interventions significantly increased point prevalent and continuous smoking cessation, and despite superficial differences, interventions appear to deploy similar behaviour change techniques. Qualitative research suggested considerable variation in patients’ expectations and experiences of psycho-educational interventions, but combined results suggested that many of the techniques used in psycho-educational interventions appear to be well matched with patients’ experiences of successful interventions. Conclusions: Although questions remain about how to distinguish characteristics of an effective intervention, the theory-orientated approach to systematic review and meta-analysis was able to provide a detailed analysis of the intervention techniques to help in the design of future interventions. This approach, however, is labour intensive in its present form...|$|R
