40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the clinical and radiological presentation, management, and outcomes of adenocarcinoma of the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses</b> Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of the 46 patients managed for adeno-carcinoma of the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses</b> at a teaching hospital in Toulouse, France, over an 11 -year period (1992 - 2002). Of the 38 patients with operable tumors, 36 {{were treated with}} surgery followed by radiation therapy and 2 were also given neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The 8 remaining patients received palliative therapy. Results: Mean follow-up was 3. 7 years. Actuarial survival rates were 70. 8 % after 3 years and 62. 2 % after 5 years. Discussion: As part of the pretreatment work-up, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging used in combination provide 98. 5 % agreement with histology. The management of adenocarcinoma of the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses</b> is not standardized. We recommend radiation therapy and surgery when curative therapy is feasible. Radiation therapy plus chemotherapy can be sued for inoperable tumors. Nasal endoscopy is useful for diagnosing and monitoring the tumor; its contribution to the treatment is being evaluated...|$|R

Neuroimaging results demonstrated a macrocystic tumour attached to <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses</b> and disclosed atypical findings. The tumour was totally removed. All the symptoms and signs ameliorated after surgery. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations led to a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumour. A solitary fibrous tumour {{could be seen in}} various intracranial areas but <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses</b> and anterior fossa are not an exceptional site. They appear as extra-axial tumours with a characteristic pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the cystic component is very unusual.

This nerve also includes taste fibers for palate via lesser palatine nerve and greater palatine nerve.|$|E
50|$|When {{diagnosing}} a sinus infection, one {{can identify}} which sinus cavity the infection {{is located in}} by the term given to the cavity. Ethmoiditis refers to an infection in the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinus</b> cavity/ies, frontal sinusitis refers to an infection occurring in the frontal sinus cavity/ies, antritis is {{used to refer to}} an infection in the maxillary sinus cavity/ies whilst spenoiditis refers to an infection in the sphenoid sinus cavity/ies.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} makes {{a surgical}} corridor from the frontal sinus to the sphenoid sinus. This {{is done by}} the complete removal of the ethmoid bone, which allows a surgeon to expose the roof of the ethmoid, and the medial orbital wall. This procedure is often successful in the removal of small encephaloceles of the ethmoid osteomas of the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinus</b> wall or small olfactory groove meningiomas. However, with larger tumors or lesions, one of the other approaches listed above is required.|$|E

50|$|Sinusitis is {{inflammation}} of the paranasal air sinuses. Infections associated with teeth {{may be responsible for}} approximately 20% of cases of maxillary sinusitis. The cause of this situation is usually a periapical or periodontal infection of a maxillary posterior tooth, where the inflammatory exudate has eroded through the bone superiorly to drain into the maxillary sinus. Once an odontogenic infection involves the maxillary sinus, it is possible that it may then spread to the orbit or to the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinus.</b>|$|E
50|$|This tumor is {{far less}} common than {{conventional}} ossifying fibroma, and is considered a rare tumor. Patients usually come to clinical attention when <15 years of age, but a wide age range (3 months to 70 years) can be affected. Both genders are affected equally, with the paranasal sinuses most commonly affected. Specifically, the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinus</b> is affected most often, followed by frontal sinus, maxillary inus and sphenoid sinus. The maxilla {{is the second most}} common location after the paranasal sinuses, while the mandible and temporal bone are infrequently affected. This tumor does not frequently extracranial sites nor soft tissues sites.|$|E
50|$|Propel {{mometasone}} furoate implant is a sinus implant {{used to treat}} inflammation associated with sinusitis. It {{is used as a}} stent and inserted into the sinus cavity during sinus surgery after an ethmoidectomy procedure, which removes bony partitions within the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinus.</b> It delivers steroids over a 30-day period to treat chronic sinusitis. The implant dissolves over four to six weeks and does not require removal from the sinus cavity, as well as reduces the need for additional surgical procedures and steroid pills, which can have detrimental side effects. The device was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on August 11, 2011.|$|E
40|$|Fifty-three {{patients}} with frontal, ehtmoid and sphenoid sinus mucoceles treated in our department from 1987 to 1997 were reviewed clinically. Their {{mean age was}} 51. 1 years old. There was neither difference between sexes (28 cases of male and 25 of female), nor sides of cystic lesions (28 cases in the right and 25 in the left). They were classified into three groups according to the origin of mucoceles: 1) 34 cases of post-operative mucocele, 2) 15 cases of primary mucocele, and 3) 4 cases of post-traumatic mucocele. Primary mucoceles were predominantly seen in frontal and anterior <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses.</b> In cases of post-operative mucoceles, {{the mean age of}} the initial operation was 27. 1 years old and the interval between the initial and the second operation was 24. 9 years. Blepharal swelling, exophthalmos and double vision were most frequent in mucoceles of the frontal and anterior <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses,</b> while optic pain, headache and paropsis were seen in those of the posterior <b>ethmoid</b> and sphenoid <b>sinuses.</b> In fifty-one cases, surgical treatments were performed. Recently, nasal endoscopic surgery has been increasing. Orbital complications are the most common symptoms of this disease. Most orbital symptoms improved post-operatively. Post-operative mucoceles, especially maxillary sinus mucoceles, have been decreasing due to the decrease of Caldwell-Luc operation on the young and advancement in drug therapy. On the other hand, post-traumatic and primary mucoceles continue to exist...|$|R
50|$|Neuroblastoma {{is a rare}} form of a {{malignant}} cancer that initiates in the olfactory nerve. The olfactory nerve is responsible for smell sensation.

50|$|The transpterygoidal {{approach}} enters {{through the}} posterior {{edge of the}} maxillary sinus ostium and posterior wall of the maxillary sinus. This involves penetrating three separate sinus cavities: the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinus,</b> the sphenoidal sinus, and the maxillary sinus. Surgeons use this method to reach the cavernous sinus, lateral sphenoid sinus, infra temporal fossa, pterygoid fossa, and the petrous apex. Surgery includes a uninectomy (removal of the osteomeatal complex), a medial maxillectomy (removal of maxilla), a ethmoidectomy (removal of ethmoid cells and/or ethmoid bone), a sphenoidectomy (removal of part of sphenoid), and removal of the maxillary sinus and the palatine bone. The posterior septum is also removed at the beginning to allow use of both nostrils.|$|E

He complained of pain and loss of visual acuity in the injured eye, which displayed redness and edema and eventually discharged pus. His symptoms became more severe after he was treated with steroids and several antibacterial agents. A computed tomography scan of the left eye revealed that the maxillary and <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses</b> were involved. A smear of purulent material from the left eye orbit revealed fungal elements, and cultures of the material grew a fungus. The isolate was identified as A. kalrae based on gross and microscopic morphologies, biochemical assays, and DNA sequence analysis. The patient received amphotericin B intravenously, itraconazole orally, and atomized allitridum by nebulizing allitridum therapy.

50|$|Because hypertelorism is an {{anatomic}} condition {{associated with}} a heterogeneous group of congenital disorders, {{it is believed that}} the underlying mechanism of hypertelorism is also heterogeneous. Theories include too early ossification of the lower wings of the sphenoid, an increased space between the orbita, due to increasing width of the <b>ethmoid</b> <b>sinuses,</b> field defects during the development, a nasal capsule that fails to form, leading to a failure in normal medial orbital migration and also a disturbance {{in the formation of the}} cranial base, which can be seen in syndromes like Apert and Crouzon.|$|R
