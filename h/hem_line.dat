50|$|In shirts {{made with}} the cekak musang collar, the placket of the baju will seem to form {{a third of the}} baju from the top when it is worn beneath the kain samping or kain sarung. However, the <b>hem</b> <b>line</b> of the baju {{actually}} runs {{to the middle of the}} lap. The placket typically has three to four buttonholes and is fastened together by dress studs called kancing which are not unlike those used in Western-style formal dress shirts. The studs usually have screw-in backs and can be made from a variety of materials including gold, silver and precious or semi-precious stones. The studs may also be connected with a light metal chain which will be concealed behind the shirt when the placket is fastened.|$|E
50|$|The Denison was {{significantly}} modified in the 1959 Pattern. This {{had a higher}} <b>hem</b> <b>line,</b> and was much less baggy. This was because wearing it over the personal carrying equipment (but under the parachute harness) while parachuting {{was no longer the}} practice. The '59 Pattern retained the full length zip and knitted wool cuffs, but the flannel lining of the collar was changed from khaki to light green. The most obvious difference to the eye, however, was the change in pattern and colours of the camouflage. The pattern became less random, more defined, with broad, vertical brush-strokes, and greater contrast between the base light khaki and the overprinted tones. The green was much darker than previous versions, and the brown was now chocolate, rather than brick. Where green and brown overlapped, they formed a fourth, darker, olive brown colour.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine the opening charac-teristics of several hemispherical parachutes at airspeeds up to 200 miles per hour and to study {{the influence of the}} parachute design variables on these opening characteristics. The effects of design variables on the drag and stability characteristics of the parachutes were also evaluated. The tests were made in the Langley 20 foot free—spinning tunnel and in the Langley 300 MPH 7 — by 10 —foot tunnel. Some of the parachutes blossomed fully when opened in the air stream. Beneficial effects on the parachute opening characteristics were obtained when longer shroud lines relative to parachute diameter were used, when the floating hem lines were tacked to prevent the hem—line loops from pulling out under load, or when a strip of low—porosity fabric was provided around the canopy in the area immediately above the <b>hem</b> <b>line.</b> The drag characteristics of the parachutes were not appreciably affected by these changes in design.

40|$|Shape {{factors of}} a tight skirt and 3 kinds of flared skirts were {{investigated}} precisely. Shape factors of circular fabrics were calculated from mechanical parameters obtained by KES system, however, those of skirts were obtained experimentally.

In the case of tight skirt, flare- 1 skirt and flare- 2 skirt, the shape factor showed high correlation with drape parameters of the skirts and circular fabrics. The shape factor of skirts has high positive correlation with node number and negative correlation with static drape coefficient of circular fabrics. In the case of flare- 3 skirt, there is no correlation between the shape factor and the drape parameters of circular fabrics and skirts, hence shape factor becomes an important parameter which can evaluate the appearance of flared skirt objectively...|$|E

5000|$|The lighthearted, forward-looking {{attitude}} and fashions {{of the late}} 1920s lingered through most of 1930, {{but by the end}} of that year the effects of the Great Depression began to affect the public, and a more conservative approach to fashion displaced that of the 1920s. For women, skirts became longer and the waist-line was returned up to its normal position in an attempt to bring back the traditional [...] "womanly" [...] look. Other aspects of fashion from the 1920s took longer to phase out. Cloche hats remained popular until about 1933 while short hair remained popular for many women until late in the 1930s and even in the early 1940s. The Great Depression took its toll on the 1930s womenswear due to World War II which dates from 1939-1945. This greatly affected the fashion of how women dressed during the 1940s era. According to Shrimpton [...] "Committed to ensuring the fair distribution of scarce but essential resources, namely food, clothing, and furniture, the government introduced a comprehensive rationing scheme based on allocation of coupons - a system deriving, ironically, from the German rationing plan devised in November 1930." [...] Because clothes were rationed and fabric was scarcer, the <b>hem</b> <b>lines</b> of dresses rose to knee length. The main sort of dress in the 1940s included features such as an hour glass shape figure, broad shoulders, nipped in high waist tops and A line skirts that came down to just at the knee. Many different celebrities who embraced this type of style such as Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers, Barbara Syanwyck, and Ava Gardner. Even though daywear dresses were influenced by the war, evening dresses remained glamorous. Women's undergarments became the soul of fashion in the 1940s because it maintained the critical hourglass shape with smooth lines. Clothes became utilitarian. Pants or trousers were considered a menswear item only until the 1940s. Women working in factories first wore men's pants but over time, factories began to make pants for women out of fabric such as cotton, denim, or wool. Coats were long and down to the knee for warmth.|$|R

40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{codes for}} four closely related nonstructural {{proteins}} (Rep) required for AAV DNA replication and gene regulation. In vitro studies {{have revealed that}} either Rep 78 or Rep 68 alone is sufficient for AAV DNA replication. Rep 52 and Rep 40 are not required for DNA replication but {{have been reported to}} enhance the efficiency of accumulation of single-stranded progeny DNA. Previous studies on rep-expressing cell lines had indicated that only a subset of the four Rep proteins are required for the production of infectious AAV. We therefore set out to determine the minimal set of Rep proteins sufficient for the generation of infectious AAV. Transient cotransfections in HeLa cells of constructs for high-level expression of individual Rep proteins with a rep-negative AAV genome revealed that either Rep 78 or Rep 68 alone could complement for a full replication cycle yielding infectious virus. This result was confirmed by transfection studies in the cell <b>line</b> <b>HeM</b> 2, which selectively expresses Rep 78 at rather low levels {{under the control of the}} glucocorticoid-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (C. Hölscher, M. Hörer, J. A. Kleinschmidt, H. Zentgraf, A. Bürkle, and R. Heilbronn, J. Virol. 68 : 7169 - 7177, 1994). Increasing the level of Rep 78 expression by transfection of a glucocorticoid receptor expression construct resulted in a higher level of DNA replication of a cotransfected rep-negative AAV genome and in the production of infectious rep-negative AAV particles. We further report on the generation of a new rep-expressing cell line, HeCM 1, which was obtained by stable supertransfection of a construct for constitutive Rep 40 expression into HeM 1 cells (Hölscher et al., J. Virol. 68 : 7169 - 7177). Transfection of rather large amounts of rep-negative AAV DNA led to detectable virus production in HeCM 1 cells even in the absence of the cotransfected glucocorticoid receptor expression construct, but higher yields were obtained after increasing the Rep 78 level by coexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor. These data demonstrate that all Rep functions required for the productive replication of AAV in HeLa cells are contained within both Rep 78 and Rep 68...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} requisites {{for evaluating}} the comfortable clothing pressure of brassieres, I measured changes in clothing pressure that felt comfortable at rest (normal standing posture) and subjective evaluation during movement. Clothing pressure data were measured at 0. 1 -second intervals, and the average of those was considered the synthetic value of the clothing pressure. The difference between the maximum and the minimum values of clothing pressure that varied according to respiration and movement was considered the change in clothing pressure. Changes in clothing pressure and subjective evaluation due to the removal of straps were also studied. Samples were four types of underwired brassieres of different designs including strapless brassieres. Points measured were the six points where thick fabric with wires or rubber tapes may tightly press the skin; the intersections of the lower <b>hem</b> and mammillary <b>lines</b> (points a and a 2 ̆ 7), those of the lower hem and side wires (points b and b 2 ̆ 7), {{and those of the}} upper hem and side wires (points c and c 2 ̆ 7). The results are reported as follows: 1) The brassieres that felt comfortable at rest were not necessarily comfortable during movement. It may be necessary to confirm subjective evaluation during movement to evaluate the comfortable clothing pressure. 2) The brassieres with small changes in clothing pressure tended to give a slightly tight impression. Thus, the changes in clothing pressure during movement should be studied when evaluating the comfortable clothing pressure. 3) The positions of straps tended to influence the distribution of clothing pressure at the lower hem of the brassieres. Therefore, it was difficult to determine a comfortable clothing pressure collectively for brassieres of different designs. The comfortable clothing pressure of brassieres should be determined in relation to their designs. 4) For strapless brassieres, movement caused a large shift and significantly ruined comfortableness. Rotation of the arms slightly increased pressure at points a and a 2 ̆ 7, and the change in clothing pressure at points b and b 2 ̆ 7 or c and c 2 ̆ 7 tended to be slightly small. The removal of straps may cause changes in the pressure applied to the body...|$|R
