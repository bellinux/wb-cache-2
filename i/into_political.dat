5|$|Hoysala {{literature}} {{is the large}} body of literature in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages produced by the Hoysala Empire (1025–1343) {{in what is now}} southern India.

5|$|After Blake's funeral, Manhattan {{is accused}} on {{national}} television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars.

Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{over the}} origin of falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved <b>into</b> <b>political</b> discussions {{about the relationship between}} Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel.

Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E
5|$|In early 1801, Adams {{had sent}} Thomas Jefferson a brief note after {{returning}} to Quincy to which Jefferson did not respond. In 1804, Abigail wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon {{the death of his}} daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses is London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence which quickly descended <b>into</b> <b>political</b> rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Welsh hopes of {{advancing}} the cause of female suffrage centred around the Liberal Party and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, {{one of the most}} important Welsh politicians of the day. After Liberal success in the 1906 Election failed to materialise <b>into</b> <b>political</b> change, suffragettes and in particular members of the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), took a hard line stance towards their Members of Parliament, engaging in direct action against them.|$|E
5|$|The {{translation}} of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid's Metamorphoses is suggested as being {{a critique of the}} political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of the leader of this revolution, William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell <b>into</b> <b>political</b> disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations.|$|E
5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy <b>into</b> <b>political</b> action. Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E

5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue <b>into</b> <b>political</b> support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him <b>into</b> <b>political</b> activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation <b>into</b> <b>political</b> participation.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, the Singapore {{strategy}} was revived {{in the form}} of Operation Mastodon, a plan to deploy V bombers of RAF Bomber Command equipped with nuclear weapons to Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the Vbombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at RAF Gan in the Maldives. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for Vbombers, so RAF Butterworth had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran <b>into</b> <b>political</b> complications.|$|E
5|$|Peckham laid {{stress on}} discipline, which often {{resulted}} {{in conflict with}} his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham's specifying that a copy of Magna Carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as an unnecessary intrusion <b>into</b> <b>political</b> affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence was if the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal policies or power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. One reason the archbishop may have backed down {{was that he was}} in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutions of 1989 and the {{dissolution}} of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and their focus on the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after {{the dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in December 1991. At that time, European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21 percent. NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Central and Eastern European nations, and extended its activities <b>into</b> <b>political</b> and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.|$|E

5|$|The US Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow, who {{had been}} in the post since 1957, had a long record of trying to {{pressure}} Diệm <b>into</b> <b>political</b> reforms. He felt that South Vietnam's political problems were due to Diệm's illiberalism and thought the communist insurgency would be more easily defeated if Diệm reached out to a broader cross-section of society, cracked down on corruption, cronyism, abusive public servants, and implemented land reform. However, the South Vietnamese president saw authoritarianism as the solution to political problems and opposition, and the US military hierarchy in Vietnam agreed, leading to frequent disputes between Durbrow and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Durbrow frequently reported to Washington that Diệm's strong-arm tactics against opposition only created more dissent and opportunities for the communists.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} unrest {{resulting from}} these losses {{led to the}} establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by Tsar Boris III (1918–1943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 {{as a member of the}} Axis but declined to participate in Operation Barbarossa and saved its Jewish population from deportation to concentration camps. The sudden death of Boris III in the summer of 1943 pushed the country <b>into</b> <b>political</b> turmoil as the war turned against Germany and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of Bogdan Filov subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944. The communist-dominated Fatherland Front took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The {{tensions}} {{between these two}} competing historical and cultural traditions erupted <b>into</b> <b>political</b> and social conflict during the Ukrainian crisis, which began when then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union on 21 November 2013. Support for closer ties with Europe was strong in western and central Ukraine, whilst many in eastern and southern Ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with Russia. President Yanukovych, who drew most of his support from eastern regions, was forced out of office in February 2014. His ouster was followed by protests in eastern and southern Ukraine that placed {{a strong emphasis on}} the importance of historical ties to Russia, the Russian language, and antipathy towards the Euromaidan movement.|$|E
