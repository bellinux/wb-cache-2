5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, <b>elongating</b> the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an <b>elongating</b> of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E
30|$|Elongation {{ratio is}} {{the ratio of}} the {{diameter}} of a circle of the same area as the basin to the maximum basin length (Schumm 1956). It is a significant parameter to analyse the shape of the watershed. The low Re value indicates a steep slope and an <b>elongated</b> basin. An index of elongation ratio, proposed by Schumm and further interpreted by Strahler, is used to evaluate the shape of the watersheds, i.e. circular (0.9 – 0.10), oval (0.8 – 0.9), less <b>elongated</b> (0.7 – 0.8), <b>elongated</b> (0.5 – 0.7) and more <b>elongated</b> (<[*] 0.5). The drainage basin in Jhajjar district is mostly <b>elongated</b> in shape. The elongation ratio of SW 1 to SW 7 calculated was 0.85 (oval), 0.69 (<b>elongated),</b> 0.40 (more <b>elongated),</b> 0.69 (<b>elongated),</b> 0.66 (<b>elongated),</b> 0.46 (more <b>elongated)</b> and 0.75 (less <b>elongated),</b> respectively.|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the <b>elongating</b> protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the <b>elongating</b> protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|Advancing northward over land, the once-powerful {{hurricane}} weakened, with {{somewhat higher}} atmospheric pressures and winds of less severity reported at Charleston, South Carolina. Paralleling the coast while situated inland, it hastened quickly toward the north, swiftly passing through North Carolina and {{arriving in the}} Chesapeake Bay region by 13October. Southeasterly gusts persisted as the storm continued its northerly progression inland along {{the course of the}} East Coast of the United States. After reaching Washington, D.C., in the early morning, it arrived near New York City by sunrise, and transited across Boston during the afternoon of 13October. The storm likely underwent an extratropical transition by the time it arrived in New York state, <b>elongating</b> linearly east-to-west. The gale's winds swept toward the southeast with a brief hiatus in the early evening. As it neared New England, it produced little precipitation yet intense gusts, which peaked at force9-strength in the vicinity of New Bedford, Massachusetts. The cyclone's diameter over New England, at its largest point, reached , accompanied by Category2-force winds. The system was last sighted on the morning of 14October, rapidly weakening as it meandered into the Canadian Maritimes.|$|E

25|$|All {{steps in}} the {{transcription}} are subject to some degree of regulation. Transcription initiation in particular is the primary level at which gene expression is regulated. Targeting the rate-limiting initial step is the most efficient in terms of energy costs for the cell. Transcription initiation is regulated by cis-acting elements (enhancers, silencers, isolators) within the regulatory regions of the DNA, and sequence-specific trans-acting factors that act as activators or repressors. Gene transcription can also be regulated post-initiation by targeting {{the movement of the}} <b>elongating</b> polymerase.|$|E
25|$|TFIIF and FCP1 {{cooperate}} for RNAPII recycling. FCP1, the CTD phosphatase, {{interacts with}} RNA polymerase II. Transcription is {{regulated by the}} state of phosphorylation of a heptapeptide repeat. The nonphosphorylated form, RNAPIIA, is recruited to the initiation complex, whereas the <b>elongating</b> polymerase is found with RNAPII0. RNAPII cycles during transcription. CTD phosphatase activity is regulated by two GTFs (TFIIF and TFIIB). The large subunit of TFIIF (RAP74) stimulates the CTD phosphatase activity, whereas TFIIB inhibits TFIIF-mediated stimulation. Dephosphorylation of the CTD alters the migration of the largest subunit of RNAPII (RPB1).|$|E
25|$|<b>Elongating</b> {{polymerase}} {{is associated}} with a set of protein factors required for various types of RNA processing. mRNA is capped as soon as it emerges from the RNA-exit channel of the polymerase. After capping, dephosphorylation of Ser-5 within the CTD repeats may be responsible for dissociation of the capping machinery. Further phosphorylation of Ser-2 causes recruitment of the RNA splicing machinery that catalyzes the removal of non-coding introns to generate mature mRNA. Alternative splicing expands the protein complements in eukaryotes. Just as with 5’-capping and splicing, the CTD tail is involved in recruiting enzymes responsible for 3’-polyadenylation, the final RNA processing event that is coupled with the termination of transcription.|$|E

25|$|Males of V. maculifrons tend to form loose aggregations, {{resembling}} leks, during mating. In one area, hundreds {{to thousands}} of males patrol prominent trees and bushes by constantly flying around them. Males typically patrol large areas randomly, rather than limiting to a few trees. If a male sees a female while patrolling, he flies closer to the female in a zigzag fashion and stops on a nearby leaf. This then allows the male to climb onto the female’s gaster from behind. Other males {{do not try to}} approach an ongoing copulation, but a male might try to copulate immediately after. If a second mating occurs, sperm competition may favor the second male. As a result, males can prevent competition from another male by <b>elongating</b> copulation.|$|E

As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits. However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the zodiac signs. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{elongation}} is not {{a smooth}} ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the polymerase is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription. In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes {{for long periods of}} time before resuming transcription. In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an <b>elongating</b> polymerase is stalled near the promoter. Promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative elongation factor) in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5). The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other elongation factors such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of elongation by limiting the length of time that polymerase pauses.|$|E
