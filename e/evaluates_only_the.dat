50|$|In the FASTA method, {{the user}} defines a value k {{to use as}} the word length with which to search the database. The method is slower but more {{sensitive}} at lower values of k, which are also preferred for searches involving a very short query sequence. The BLAST family of search methods provides a number of algorithms optimized for particular types of queries, such as searching for distantly related sequence matches. BLAST was developed to provide a faster alternative to FASTA without sacrificing much accuracy; like FASTA, BLAST uses a word search of length k, but <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> most significant word matches, rather than every word match as does FASTA. Most BLAST implementations use a fixed default word length that is optimized for the query and database type, and that is changed only under special circumstances, such as when searching with repetitive or very short query sequences. Implementations can be found via a number of web portals, such as EMBL FASTA and NCBI BLAST. Wani.|$|E

The IRTS algorithm is facilitated by carrying out the search on a reconfigurable tree, constructed by computing the reliabilities of symbols based on minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion and reordering the symbols according to their reliabilities. Results from computer simulations are presented, which proves the good performance of IRTS algorithm over a quasistatic Rayleigh channel even for relatively small list sizes.|$|E

Activation of AT 1 R signal transduction systems can occur within seconds through Gαq and IP 3 or within minutes to hours through MAP kinase and JAK/STAT systems [46]. Moreover, AT 1 Rs are endocytosed within 10  min after activation, with ~ 25  % recycled to plasma membrane and the remainder degraded in lysosomes [47]. Consequently, the dynamic nature of AT 1 R is a limitation for the accuracy of in vitro measurements and represents an added value for in vivo PET as an investigative tool to detect total receptor changes.|$|E

40|$|In {{modeling}} the morphological impact of an offshore dredging pit using a process-based model, the hydrodynamic conditions, often derived from regional scale models and sometimes incomplete measurements, {{may not be}} in equilibrium with the initial bathymetry profile before dredging. This lack of equilibrium causes a fast profile adjustment toward an equilibrium, which may bias the model results representing the direct effect of the pit. In this study, a method is described which uses the parallel computing technique and <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> morphological changes due to a single factor, i. e., the dredging of a pit. The hydrodynamics and morphodynamics are assumed to be in equilibrium before initial dredging of the pit. The morphological evolution is computed based on the change of sediment flux due to the presence of the pit. The model can avoid the computational demanding spin-up period necessary to reach equilibrium conditions. In particular the concurrent correction method is efficient for scenario testing with a large amount of morphological settings and hydrodynamic conditions...|$|E

How well can a country balance its international trade engagement over international price changes and/or applied exchange rate regime is of great importance, especially for a small, opened, indebted and import dependent country such as Croatia. By focusing on the relationship between the terms of trade, exchange rate, volume of trade, current account and output we are trying to provide some new insights into trade dynamics over a business cycle in Croatia. Furthermore, the analysis is done on aggregate level and <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> market of goods, for it constitutes the larger part of the trade balance.

40|$|Comparison {{with other}} tools Currently, {{there are some}} other {{applications}} to query gene signatures databases. They differ in different aspects such as the source of the gene signatures, the statistical tests to compare signatures, and the format of the query. Table 1 summarizes these differences. An important difference among the different applications is based on the similarity function and the statistical test. For example L 2 L <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> overlap of the query gene list with each signature list. In the other extreme, EXALT uses the expression levels of the genes in both the query list and the signatures, which requires the user to provide a file with the expression levels as a query (eg. a SOFT file). The Connectivity Map, GEOGLE, GeneChaser, and MARQ, all use simple lists for the query but consider the expression levels for the genes in the signatures. In the case of The Connectivity Map and MARQ, only the ranks of the genes in the signature are used, while GEOGLE and GeneChaser use the p-values, and the fold changes respectively. The Connectivity Map offers similar functionality to MARQ, the mai...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{investigation}} of network dynamics {{is a major}} issue in systems and synthetic biology. One of the essential steps in a dynamics investigation is the parameter estimation in the model that expresses biological phenomena. Indeed, various techniques for parameter optimization have been devised and implemented in both free and commercial software. While the computational time for parameter estimation has been greatly reduced, due to improvements in calculation algorithms and the advent of high performance computers, the accuracy of parameter estimation has not been addressed. We previously proposed an approach for accurate parameter optimization by using Differential Elimination, which is an algebraic approach for rewriting a system of differential equations into another equivalent system. The equivalent system has the same solution as the original system, and it includes high-order derivatives, which contain information about the form of the observed time-series data. The introduction of an equivalent system into the numerical parameter optimizing procedure resulted in the drastic improvement of the estimation accuracy, since our approach evaluates the difference of not only the values but also the forms between the measured and estimated data, while the classical numerical approach <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> value difference. In this report, we describe the detailed procedure of our approach for accurate parameter estimation in dynamic systems. The ability of our approach is illustrated in terms of the parameter estimation accuracy, in comparison with classical methods...|$|E

40|$|Overview. Neurophysiologic {{methods are}} {{used to assess the}} {{functional}} status of the CNS and are important adjuncts to the clinical examination. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records spontaneous electrical activity from the cerebral cortex. Visual, auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials probe the sensory pathways in the spinal cord, brainstem, subcortical regions, or cerebral cortex. Information concerning motor and sensory pathways in these regions is provided by brainstem reflexes (blink, acoustic, and oculographic). Spinal cord and spinal root function is assessed via somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Somatic reflex studies provide motor and sensory information about specific segments in the arm (C 6) and leg (S 1). Needle EMG is an established method for providing clinically useful and segmentally specific information in radicular disease affecting arms and legs. The major limitation of EMG, however, is that this technique <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> motor component of radicular function and many patients with radiculopathy only exhibit sensory complaints. SEPs are typically elicited by stimulating mixed nerves (median, ulnar, tibial, and peroneal) to assess sensory pathways. Therefore, the application of standard SEPs to study radicular disease is necessarily limited to investigating the lumbar and cervical regions because of the limited number of sites to stimulate. Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (DSEPs) involve recording cerebral evoked responses from cutaneous stimulation of areas of known dermatomal innervation providing a pure sensory input to any level of th...|$|E
40|$|Class of 2011 AbstractOBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the level of accuracy in terms of medical information presented in the popular television show, House, MD. This is part of a larger ongoing study, and <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> first 11 episodes of season four. METHODS: This study was a descriptive, retrospective assessment of the first 11 episodes in the fourth season of the medical television drama, House, MD. The signs and symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and medical treatment for one major disease portrayed in each episode were recorded and compared to authoritative medical sources. Based on the medical resource material used, an accuracy score for each of the three above-mentioned variables in each episode was assigned. Three researchers evaluated these ratings individually. A collaborative rating was determined for all three variables for all eleven episodes. RESULTS: The average accuracy scores for presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and medical treatments were 2. 36, 1. 82, and 1. 91, respectively. The average accuracy score across the three variables resulted in a rating of 2. 03. Episode one was excluded from the final analysis. The one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD test and the Kruskal Wallis test all found no significant difference among the data. Therefore, the null hypothesis was not excluded in this analysis. CONCLUSION: The presenting symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and medical treatments shown in the eleven episodes evaluated were not significantly different in terms of level of accuracy. The average accuracy score of the eleven episodes indicated that the information presented was correct but somewhat unusual...|$|E
