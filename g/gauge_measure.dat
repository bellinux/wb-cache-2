40|$|This paper {{considers}} the problem faced by a reliability analyst who has detected faults in a system, which {{were caused by}} a combination of random and systematic factors. Such faults usually occur at random points in space or time. The analyst&# 039;s challenge is to accurately gauge the scale of the problem, accepting the fact that an appropriate reliability estimate must also take into consideration the subjective nature of her assessment. In this paper, we introduce a reliability measure, which we called a <b>gauge</b> <b>measure,</b> which incorporates the randomness due to the locations of the faults as well as the imprecision caused by the subjective nature of the assessment. The randomness of the locations will be modeled by a point process and the subjective assessment of each fault by a random fuzzy mark. The mean and variance of a <b>gauge</b> <b>measure</b> will be obtained. Finally, through a generic example and several real world applications, we show how this measure can be applied to measure the reliability of many occurring working systems, especially software systems...|$|E

40|$|This study proposes an {{improved}} bonding method for attaching a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) on {{surface of a}} structure to measure its dynamic strains. The improved bonding fiber Bragg grating is called IBFBG for short in this study. The bonding method provides the chance to let the IBFBG and resistance strain <b>gauge</b> <b>measure</b> the longitudinal strain at the same point. This study use two steel cantilever beams, one with rectangular cross section {{and the other with}} circular, to demonstrate the ability of the IBFBG in dynamic strain measurements. Their dynamic strains are induced by impacts of a steel ball in free-fall transversely or in pendulum axially, respectively. The obtained strain time histories from both the IBFBG and strain gauge are nearly proportional in amplitudes; in addition, the Fourier spectra of those time histories show the IBFBG recognizes the natural frequencies of the cantilever beams up to 20000 Hz...|$|E
40|$|A {{precipitation}} {{event that}} took place on 12 October 2008 in Madrid, Spain, is analyzed in detail. Three different devices were used to characterize the precipitation: a disdrometer, a rain gauge, and a Micro Rain Radar (MRR). These instruments determine precipitation intensity indirectly, based on measuring different parameters in different sampling points in the atmosphere. A comparative study was carried out based on the data provided by each of these devices, revealing that the disdrometer and the rain <b>gauge</b> <b>measure</b> similar precipitation intensity values, whereas the MRR measures different rain fall volumes. The distributions of drop sizes show that the mean diameter of the particles varied considerably depending on the altitude considered. The level at which saturation occurs in the atmosphere is decisive {{in the distribution of}} drop sizes between 2, 700 [*]m and 3, 000 [*]m. As time passes, the maximum precipitation intensities are registered at a lower height and are less intense. The maximum precipitation intensities occurred at altitudes above 1, 000 [*]m, while the maximum fall speeds are typically found at altitudes below 700 [*]m...|$|E
40|$|Feature {{selection}} from {{measured data}} aims to extract informative features {{to reveal the}} statistic or stochastic mechanism underlying the complicated or high dimensional original data. In this thesis, the feature selection problem is probed under two situations, one is pattern recognition {{and the other is}} ultra-wideband radar signal analysis. Classical pattern recognition methods select features by their ability to separate the multiple classes with certain <b>gauge</b> <b>measure.</b> The deficiency in this general strategy is its lack of adaptation in specific situations. This deficiency may be overcome by viewing the selected features as a function of not only the training samples but also the unlabeled test data. From this perspective, this thesis proposes an adaptive sequential feature selection algorithm which utilizes an information-theoretic measure to reduce the classification task complexity sequentially, and finally outputs the probabilistic classification result and its variation level. To verify the potential advantage of this algorithm, this thesis applies it to one important problem of neural prosthesis, which concerns decoding a finite number of classes, intended reach directions, from recordings of neural activities in the Parietal Reach Region of one rhesus monkey. Experimental results show that the classification scheme of combining the adaptive sequential feature selection algorithm and the information fusion method outperforms some classical pattern recognition rules, such as the nearest neighbor rule and support vector machine, in decoding performance. The second scenario in this thesis targets developing a human presence and motion pattern detector through ultra-wideband radar signal analysis. To augment the detection robustness, both static and dynamic features should be utilized. The static features reflect the information of target geometry and its variability, while the dynamic features extract the temporal structure among radar scans. The problem of static feature selection is explored in this thesis, which utilizes the Procrustes shape analysis to generate the representative template for the target images, and makes statistical inference in the tangent space through the Hotelling one sample test. After that, the waveform shape variation structure is decomposed in the tangent space through the principal component analysis. The selected principal components not only accentuate the prominent dynamics of the target motion, but also generate another informative classification feature...|$|E
