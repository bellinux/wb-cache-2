Considering the massive economic measures {{that have been taken}} over the past 12 months or so, Egyptian economic policymakers score high based on the inside lag, i.e. the lapse of time between the moment that the shock began to affect the economy and the moment that economic (monetary and fiscal) policy as well as the regulatory policy are altered and put into effect in response to the shock to various markets: <b>goods</b> <b>market</b> (real GDP), the labor market (unemployment rate), money market (interest rate and inflation), and the financial (stock and bond) market. Indeed, moderate financial panic occurred driven—at least partially—by the fear that other investors are about to panic and sell. There were falls in stock and bond market prices, and rises in nominal interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's Mill {{was one of}} {{the first}} of many {{factories}} constructed in Leeds from around 1790 when the most significant were woollen finishing and flax mills. Manufacturing diversified by 1914 to printing, engineering, chemicals and clothing manufacture. Decline in manufacturing during the 1930s was temporarily reversed by a switch to producing military uniforms and munitions during World War II. However, by the 1970s, the clothing industry was in irreversible decline, facing cheap foreign competition. The contemporary economy has been shaped by Leeds City Council's vision of building a '24-hour European city' and 'capital of the north'. The city has developed from the decay of the post-industrial era to become a telephone banking centre, connected to the electronic infrastructure of the modern global economy. There has been growth in the corporate and legal sectors, and increased local affluence has led to an expanding retail sector, including the luxury <b>goods</b> <b>market.</b> In a 2010 index of sustainable cities, Leeds placed 6th for the second year running.|$|E
500|$|Despite its prevalence, {{the neoclassical}} {{synthesis}} had its Keynesian critics. A strain of disequilibrium or [...] "non-Walrasian" [...] theory developed that criticized the synthesis for apparent contradictions in allowing disequilibrium phenomena, especially involuntary unemployment, to be modeled in equilibrium models. Moreover, they argued, {{the presence of}} disequilibrium in one market must be associated with disequilibrium in another, so involuntary unemployment had to be tied to an excess supply in the <b>goods</b> <b>market.</b> Many see Don Patinkin's work as {{the first in the}} disequilibrium vein. Robert W. Clower (1965) introduced his [...] "dual-decision hypothesis" [...] that a person in a market may determine what he wants to buy, but is ultimately limited in how much he can buy based on how much he can sell. Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud (1968) argued that disequilibrium formed a fundamental part of Keynes's theory and deserved greater attention. Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman formulated general disequilibrium models in which individual markets were locked into prices before there was a general equilibrium. These markets produced [...] "false prices" [...] resulting in disequilibrium. Soon after the work of Barro and Grossman, disequilibrium models fell out of favor in the United States, and Barro abandoned Keynesianism and adopted new classical, market clearing hypotheses.|$|E

500|$|In 1937 John Hicks {{published}} an article that incorporated Keynes's thought into a general equilibrium framework where the markets for goods and money met in an overall equilibrium. Hick's IS/LM (Investment-Savings/Liquidity preference-Money supply) model {{became the basis for}} decades of theorizing and policy analysis into the 1960s. The model represents the <b>goods</b> <b>market</b> with the IS curve, a set of points representing equilibrium in investment and savings. The money market equilibrium is represented with the LM curve, a set of points representing the equilibrium in supply and demand for money. The intersection of the curves identifies an aggregate equilibrium in the economy where there are unique equilibrium values for interest rates and economic output. The IS/LM model focused on interest rates as the [...] "monetary transmission mechanism," [...] the channel through which money supply affects real variables like aggregate demand and employment. A decrease in money supply would lead to higher interest rates, which reduce investment and thereby lower output throughout the economy. Other economists built on the IS/LM framework. Notably, in 1944, Franco Modigliani added a labor market. Modigliani's model represented the economy as a system with general equilibrium across the interconnected markets for labor, finance, and goods, and it explained unemployment with rigid nominal wages.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} <b>goods</b> <b>market</b> and the sticky prices that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E

2500|$|When {{consumers}} {{increase the}} quantity demanded {{at a given}} price, it {{is referred to as}} an increase in demand. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve D1 to the new curve D2. In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from P1 to the higher P2. This raises the equilibrium quantity from Q1 to the higher Q2. [...] A movement along the curve is described as a [...] "change in the quantity demanded" [...] to distinguish it from a [...] "change in demand," [...] that is, a shift of the curve. [...] there has been an increase in demand which has caused an increase in (equilibrium) quantity. [...] The increase in demand could also come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute <b>goods,</b> <b>market</b> expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. [...] Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in movement along the supply curve from the point (Q1, P1) to the point (Q2, P2).|$|E
