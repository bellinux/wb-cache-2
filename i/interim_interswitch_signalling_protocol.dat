40|$|Nowadays, Multimedia Communication has {{improved}} rapidly {{to allow people}} to communicate via the Internet. However, Internet users cannot communicate with each other unless they use the same chatting applications since each chatting application uses a certain <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> to make the media call. The interworking module is a very critical issue since it solves the communication problems between any two protocols, and enables people around the world to make a voice/video call even if they use different chatting applications. Providing interoperability between different <b>signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> and multimedia applications takes the advantages of more than one <b>protocol.</b> Usually, each <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> has its own messages which differ from other <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> messages format. Thus, when two clients use different <b>signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> want to communicate phonetically, the sent/received messages between them will not be understood because the control and media packets in each protocol are different than the corresponding ones in the other protocol, The interworking module solves this kind of problem by matching the signals and media messages by providing translation gateways in the middle between the two protocols. Thus, many interworking modules have been proposed in order to enable many protocols’ users to chat with each other without any difficulties.

40|$|Abstract. Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), {{as a new}} layer- 2 Virtual Private Network (VPN) {{technology}} has attracted enormous interest in the filed {{during the last few}} years. Unlike traditional layer 2 VPN, which provides only point-to-point connectivity, VPLS is built for multi-point connectivity and has a broadcast capability like a common LAN. A series of RFCs and drafts related to VPLS have been proposed by IETF. To enable VPLS in a real network, signaling setup is the first step. In this paper, we first conduct some research on LDP-based <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> and demonstrate how to set up control-plane communication in VPLS network. Then, based on the research, we implement the <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> in an embedded router system.

With VPLS deploying more widely in the world, service providers and customers will benefit greatly from this technology...|$|R

The implementation feasibility of these protocols should be evaluated during their design phase, so that possible performance bottlenecks are identified and removed. In this paper we present a methodology for evaluating the performance of BISDN signalling systems under design. New performance parameters are introduced and their network-dependent values are extracted through a message flow model which has the capability to describe the impact of call and bearer control separation on the <b>signalling</b> performance. <b>Signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> are modelled through a modular decomposition of the seven OSI layers including the service user to three submodels. The workload model is user descriptive {{in the sense that}} it does not approximate the direct input traffic required for evaluating the performance of a layer protocol; instead, through a multi-level approach, it describes the actual implications of user signalling activity for the general signalling traffic. The <b>signalling</b> <b>protocol</b> model is derived from the global functional model of the <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> and information flows using a network of queues incorporating synchronization and dependency functions. The same queueing approach is followed for the signalling transfer network which is used to define processing speed and signalling bandwidth requirements and to identify possible performance bottle-necks stemming from the realization of the related protocols.

40|$|Abstract—Quality-of-service (QoS) <b>signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> for mo-bile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) {{are highly}} vulnerable to attacks. In particular, {{a class of}} denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can severely cripple network performance with relatively little effort expended by the attacker. A distributed QoS <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> that is resistant to a class of DoS attacks on signaling is proposed. The <b>signaling</b> <b>protocol</b> provides QoS for real-time traffic and employs mechanisms at the medium access control (MAC) layer, which serve to avoid potential attacks on network resource usage. The key MAC layer mechanisms that provide support for the QoS signaling scheme include sensing of available bandwidth, traffic policing, and rate monitoring, {{all of which are}} performed in a distributed manner by the mobile nodes. The proposed signaling scheme achieves a compromise between <b>signaling</b> <b>protocols</b> that require the maintenance of per-flow state and those that are com-pletely stateless.
