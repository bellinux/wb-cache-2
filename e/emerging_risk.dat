40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} <b>emerging</b> <b>risk</b> has gained {{increasing}} attention in recent years. The term has an intuitive appeal and meaning but a consistent and agreed definition is missing. We perform an in-depth analysis of this concept, in particular its relation to black swan type of events, and show that these can be considered meaningful and complementary concepts by relating <b>emerging</b> <b>risk</b> to known unknowns and black swans to unknown knowns, unknown unknowns and a subset of known knowns. The former is consistent with saying that we face <b>emerging</b> <b>risk</b> related to an activity when the background knowledge is weak but contains indications/justified beliefs that {{a new type of}} event (new in the context of that activity) could occur in the future and potentially have severe consequences to something humans value. The weak background knowledge among other things results in difficulty specifying consequences and possibly also in fully specifying the event itself; i. e. in difficulty specifying scenarios. Here knowledge becomes the key concept for both <b>emerging</b> <b>risk</b> and black swan type of events, allowing for taking into consideration time dynamics since knowledge develops over time. Some implications of our findings in terms of risk assessment and risk management are pointed out...|$|E

40|$|The {{mission and}} tasks of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) include the {{responsibility}} {{to set up a}} system for identifying <b>emerging</b> <b>risks.</b> In 2007, the EFSA Scientific Cooperation (ESCO) Working Group (WG) on <b>Emerging</b> <b>Risks</b> received a mandate by the EFSA to propose an operational strategy to achieve this task. Since then, 11 meetings have been organised. The mandate includes identification of priority indicators, identification of key sources of information and best practices for data collection and exchange, and development of procedures to collect, analyze and evaluate information. The WG, building on the operational definition of “emerging risks ” adopted by the EFSA in 2007, has developed an overall procedure for the collection, analysis and evaluation of the relevant data and information. The harvesting of data and information relevant to the identification of <b>emerging</b> <b>risks</b> relies principally on their detection through the use of indicators and signals. These should be considered as primary markers when screening appropriate sources electronically by means of a real-time central data collection facility.

40|$|Deborah Lawlor is an author/member of the <b>Emerging</b> <b>Risk</b> Factors CollaborationIMPORTANCE The {{prevalence}} of cardiometabolic multimorbidity is increasing. OBJECTIVE To estimate reductions in life expectancy associated with cardiometabolic multimorbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using individual participant {{data from the}} <b>Emerging</b> <b>Risk</b> Factors Collaboration (689   300 participants; 91 cohorts; years of baseline surveys: 1960 - 2007; latest mortality follow-up: April 2013; 128   843 deaths). The HRs from the <b>Emerging</b> <b>Risk</b> Factors Collaboration were compared with those from the UK Biobank (499   808 participants; years of baseline surveys: 2006 - 2010; latest mortality follow-up: November 2013; 7995 deaths). Cumulative survival was estimated by applying calculated age-specific HRs for mortality to contemporary US age-specific death rates. EXPOSURES A history of 2 {{or more of the}} following: diabetes mellitus, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality and estimated reductions in life expectancy. RESULTS In participants in the <b>Emerging</b> <b>Risk</b> Factors Collaboration without a history of diabetes, stroke, or MI at baseline (reference group), the all-cause mortality rate adjusted to the age of 60 years was 6. 8 per 1000 person-years. Mortality rates per 1000 person-years were 15. 6 in participants with a history of diabetes, 16. 1 in those with stroke, 16. 8 in those with MI, 32. 0 in those with both diabetes and MI, 32. 5 in those with both diabetes and stroke, 32. 8 in those with both stroke and MI, and 59. 5 in those with diabetes, stroke, and MI. Compared with the reference group, the HRs for all-cause mortality were 1. 9 (95 % CI, 1. 8 - 2. 0) in participants with a history of diabetes, 2. 1 (95 % CI, 2. 0 - 2. 2) in those with stroke, 2. 0 (95 % CI, 1. 9 - 2. 2) in those with MI, 3. 7 (95 % CI, 3. 3 - 4. 1) in those with both diabetes and MI, 3. 8 (95 % CI, 3. 5 - 4. 2) in those with both diabetes and stroke, 3. 5 (95 % CI, 3. 1 - 4. 0) in those with both stroke and MI, and 6. 9 (95 % CI, 5. 7 - 8. 3) in those with diabetes, stroke, and MI. The HRs from the <b>Emerging</b> <b>Risk</b> Factors Collaboration were similar to those from the more recently recruited UK Biobank. The HRs were little changed after further adjustment for markers of established intermediate pathways (eg, levels of lipids and blood pressure) and lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, diet). At the age of 60 years, a history of any 2 of these conditions was associated with 12 years of reduced life expectancy and a history of all 3 of these conditions was associated with 15 years of reduced life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mortality associated with a history of diabetes, stroke, or MI was similar for each condition. Because any combination of these conditions was associated with multiplicative mortality risk, life expectancy was substantially lower in people with multimorbidity.

40|$|Climate Change (CC) is {{recognised}} {{as having}} {{a significant impact on}} human decisions, subsequently affecting human-made networks and social systems. Accordingly, gaining insight into how and when CC-related data is established, distributed and utilised is essential in terms of the design of policies, approaches and systems governing everyday life. Uncovering the impacts and risks associated with CC on building sector assets has been highlighted in other research studies as an area necessitating further work. With this in mind, this study is directed towards considering the <b>risks</b> known to <b>emerge</b> from CC scenarios on UK buildings and real estate, and how buildings may be affected by CC. This study adopted a critical literature review with the goal of establishing the <b>risks</b> seen to <b>emerge</b> from CC. The study has adopted an online survey in order to explore the opinions and views of professionals and practitioners across several organisations, sectors and institutions in the UK in relation to the <b>risks</b> <b>emerging</b> from CCS. In addition, the research assessed the most likely <b>risks</b> <b>emerging</b> from CCS on buildings and real estate, along with the potential timescale of their emergence, as based on the experience of the respondents of the study. Moreover, the survey was designed empirically to identified—as based on the emerging risks—the possible and practical responses that will form the most effective Climate Change Risk Management (CCRM) strategies and tools to be adopted to cope with these <b>emerging</b> <b>risks</b> and accordingly avoid as much impact as is possible in direct consideration of property. The main findings from this study showed that, identifying and assessing the <b>emerging</b> <b>risks</b> from CC—specifically in terms of their damages, impacts and emergence timeframe—are crucial for all stages of the lifecycle of buildings and real estate. In this study, 112 risk factors have been identified and were grouped into seven main clusters; from which the operational <b>emerging</b> <b>risks</b> were the most important risks cluster. On the whole, this study provides a first attempt to uncover the potential <b>emerging</b> <b>risks</b> from CCS on the building sector from different perspectives, using conceptual study and simulation in relation to previous researches, and therefore helps to extend the understanding of the possible <b>risks</b> and impacts <b>emerging</b> from CC. In addition, this study builds knowledge in the building sector by providing the potential <b>emerging</b> <b>risks</b> that need to be integrated within a building’s lifecycle in a systematic manner for mitigating the impact of climate change...|$|R
