5|$|Toy Story {{has spawned}} three sequels: Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Toy Story 4, to be {{released}} in 2019. Initially, the first sequel to Toy Story was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996. However, after the cast from Toy Story returned and the story was considered to be better than that of a direct-to-video release, it was announced in 1998 that the sequel would see a theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 he {{made the}} {{decision}} that if there was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> war, {{he wanted to be a}} fighter pilot, and so immediately joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Within three months Lock had been called up and began flight training. On the outbreak of War in September 1939, as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a sergeant pilot. After further training at No. 6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington, he was commissioned as a pilot officer (service number 81642) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire, flying Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders {{released}} Last Splash in August 1993; {{the album was}} very successful, and its release was followed by much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One reason was that Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal wanted to do a solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be part of any immediate Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E
5|$|Northern Laos, however, was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft {{could be used for}} interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed Barrel Roll behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order of precedence. Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to be utilized in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{discovers that}} Ian's {{restaurant}} {{is on fire}} and goes inside to find Jane in a corridor on the floor struggling to breathe. A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} {{that she was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|Dead Phoenix was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 3D shoot 'em up {{featuring}} a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would {{take control of}} a winged man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, {{with the aid of}} allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and {{people have the right to}} defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

25|$|Adam Warlock appears {{briefly in}} Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.

5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} cover of Trans-Europe Express was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> monochrome {{picture of the}} group reflected {{in a series of}} mirrors. This idea was dropped for a photo by New York-based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour, with the group dressed in suits to resemble mannequins. J. Stara's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly retouched photo-montage of Kraftwerk from their shoulders up again posed as mannequins which are shown {{on the cover of the}} English version of the album. On the inside sleeve, a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used. The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour, taken on the group's American tour. Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group laughing and smiling. These were not used for the album's release.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fugitive, instead her husband {{was going to go to}} the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E

They then began jokingly questioning the arena about who the mystery team could be, before the Hardy Boyz's made their entrance to the stage to a massive ovation from the crowd. At the event, The Hardy Boyz won the Raw Tag Team Championship, defeating the teams of Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Cesaro and Sheamus, and then-reigning champions Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. The night after WrestleMania on Raw, they successfully defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Afterwards on Raw Talk, Matt mentioned that the Hardy Boyz had successfully completed the Expedition of Gold after winning the Raw Tag Team Championship. At Payback, the Hardy Boyz retained their championships against Cesaro and Sheamus. After the match, they were attacked by Cesaro and Sheamus. The next night on Raw, the villainous Cesaro and Sheamus would explain their actions, claiming the fans were more supportive of 'novelty acts' from the past like The Hardy Boyz, who they feel didn't deserve {{to be in the}} match at WrestleMania.
