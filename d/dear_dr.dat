60|$|Cecily. [Smiling.] But I see <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Chasuble {{coming up}} through the garden.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Prism. You are {{too much}} alone, <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Chasuble. You should get married. A misanthrope I can understand--a womanthrope, never! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Johnson had {{his doubts}} about Shakespeare, but here at least was poetry! This {{is one of}} the quatrains which he pronounces [...] "worthy of our author."[39] ...|$|E
5000|$|... advice {{dispensed}} through radio, TV, and print; {{for example}} <b>Dear</b> Abby, <b>Dr.</b> Phil and Dan Savage; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> a {{fortnight}} is all I require. Besides, I must {{be home for}} at least three weeks before Christmas to make the proper preparations. We will have a Christmas that is a Christmas this year, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear.</b> Do you think there is any chance of our boys being home for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> he {{was sitting}} out on the back steps this afternoon. It was just after the news came that the Armistice had been signed and he was looking his Hydest. I can assure you he was an awesome looking beast. All at once, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> Bruce Meredith {{came around the corner}} of the kitchen walking on his stilts. He has been {{learning}} to walk on them lately and came over to show me how well he could do it. Mr. Hyde just took a look and one bound carried him over the yard fence. Then he went tearing through the maple grove in great leaps with his ears laid back. You never saw a creature so terrified, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear.</b> He has never returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> May!" [...] was {{her first}} exclamation. [...] "Oh, how happy you must all be! And Margaret?" [...] She looked up at Norman, and came nearer. [...] "Is not Mr. Ernescliffe come?" [...] she asked softly, and trembling.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I choose, sir, {{that you}} should hear it now. Am I not to be obeyed when I first get up on to my own throne? Dear, <b>dear</b> <b>Dr</b> Crofts, how am I {{to thank you for}} all that you have done?" ...|$|E
60|$|Our kindest regards for <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Braun, and {{repeated}} truest {{thanks to both}} of you. Among his discoveries and inventions, he will invent some day an Aladdin's lamp, and then you will be suddenly potentates, and vanish in a clap of thunder.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Talk {{about trying}} to make bricks without straw, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear!</b> How am I to make a cake without butter or sugar? It cannot be done--not cake that is cake. Of course one can make a slab, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear.</b> And we cannot even camooflash {{it with a little}} icing! To think that I should have lived to see the day when a {{government}} at Ottawa should step into my kitchen and put me on rations!' ...|$|R
6000|$|AUGUSTA (a little {{baffled by}} DR. JONATHAN's self-command, {{sits down and}} begins to knit). I must get these socks {{finished}} {{for you to take}} with you, my <b>dear.</b> (To <b>DR.</b> JONATHAN) I can't realize he's going! (To GEORGE) You haven't got all your things in your bag! Where's the life-preserving suit I sent for? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> I do not know." [...] Susan {{nodded slowly}} and portentously. [...] "Whiskers-on-the-moon {{was there that}} very day. The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone. So much is a fact--but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody's barn until I have proof. However, {{everybody}} knows, <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> that both Uncle Mark's boys have enlisted, and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings. So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him." ...|$|R
60|$|MY <b>DEAR</b> <b>DR.</b> CONAN DOYLE,--The White Company {{has not yet}} turned up; {{but when}} it does--which I suppose will be next mail--you shall hear news of me. I have a great talent for compliment, {{accompanied}} by a hateful, even a diabolic frankness.|$|E
6000|$|... "But being {{tired of}} {{figuring}} to myself a character of which every [...] figure suits {{only one man}} in the world, without giving him the [...] praise of it, I shall end my letter, my <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Franklin, with a [...] personal application to your proper self.|$|E
60|$|MY <b>DEAR</b> <b>DR.</b> CONAN DOYLE, - The WHITE COMPANY {{has not yet}} turned up; {{but when}} it does - which I suppose will be next mail - you shall hear news of me. I have a great talent for compliment, {{accompanied}} by a hateful, even a diabolic frankness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen to this, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear.</b> 'Mrs. Sophia Crawford {{has given}} up her house at Lowbridge and will make her home in future with her niece, Mrs. Albert Crawford.' Why that is my own cousin Sophia, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear.</b> We quarrelled when we were {{children}} over who should get a Sunday-school card with the words 'God is Love,' wreathed in rosebuds, on it, and have never spoken to each other since. And now she is coming to live right {{across the road from}} us." ...|$|R
50|$|His <b>dear</b> wife <b>Dr.</b> Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar is {{an expert}} in Doppler and 3-Dimensional Ultrasound and specializes in imaging for {{reproductive}} medicine. She is an active member of their Institute and its research program. She is also a Member of Parliament from Barasat Lok Sabha constituency in West Bengal. They have two sons both of whom are doctors.|$|R
5000|$|Jarvis Lorry: An elderly {{manager at}} Tellson's Bank and a <b>dear</b> friend of <b>Dr.</b> Manette. He {{serves as a}} sort of trustee and {{guardian}} of the Manette family.|$|R
60|$|MY <b>DEAR</b> <b>DR.</b> JAPP,--My {{father has}} gone, but I think I may take it upon {{me to ask}} you to keep the book. Of all things you could do to endear {{yourself}} to me, you have done the best, for my father and you have taken a fancy to each other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Moberly,--Thank you heartily {{for writing}} to me. It {{is a real}} help {{to me and to}} others also, I think, of my party to be in {{communication}} with those whom we have long respected, and whose prayers we now more than ever earnestly ask. We returned on November 7 from a very remarkable voyage.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY <b>DEAR</b> <b>DR.</b> LEEDS: We {{have found}} a most {{important}} clew, and are [...] {{going to have a}} consultation, at which, of course, we want you to [...] be present. Could you manage to be at Mr. Pettigrew's office at [...] three o'clock? If so, on hearing from you, I will send to him to [...] make an appointment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Calm yourself, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear.</b> She did not succeed. But I {{really do}} not blame her for trying, for her husband is a terrible man. But she was very foolish to think of hanging herself and leaving the way clear for him to marry some other woman. If I had been in her shoes, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> I {{would have gone to}} work to worry him so that he would try to hang himself instead of me. Not that I hold with people hanging {{themselves}} under any circumstances, Mrs. Dr. dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} I could have said, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> if I had heard her," [...] said Susan grimly. [...] "I would have said, for one thing, {{that in my}} opinion clean bare legs were quite as decent as holes. And I would have said, for another, that the Presbyterians did not feel greatly in need of pity seeing {{that they had a}} minister who could PREACH and the Methodists had NOT. I could have squelched Mrs. Deacon Hazard, Mrs. <b>Dr</b> <b>dear,</b> and that you may tie to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you know}} old Bolus? Well, I thought every one in Barsetshire knew Bolus; you {{especially}} should do so, {{as he is}} such a <b>dear</b> friend of <b>Dr</b> Thorne." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had better}} add, that Lord ---- cannot as yet know of [...] {{this piece of}} preferment having fallen in, or rather of [...] its {{certainty}} of falling (for poor <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Trefoil is [...] past hope). Should Lord ---- first hear it from you, that [...] might probably be thought {{to give you a}} fair claim to [...] express your opinion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to lunch, <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Monygham, {{and come}} early," [...] said Mrs. Gould, in her {{travelling}} dress and her veil down, {{turning to look}} at him {{at the foot of the}} stairs; while at the top of the flight the Madonna, in blue robes and the Child on her arm, seemed to welcome her with an aspect of pitying tenderness.|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Certainly, a {{great deal}} may be done by means of cheap entertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth. <b>Dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Daubeny, our rector here, provides, with the {{assistance}} of his curates, really admirable recreations for the poor during the winter. And much good may be done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular amusement of that kind.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{man would}} spank an angel, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> that he would," [...] she had {{declared}} bitterly; {{and she would}} not make the poor doctor a pie for weeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{we went to}} bed, {{but were}} too excited to sleep. Really, as Susan said solemnly this morning, 'Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> I think {{politics}} are too strenuous for women.'" ...|$|R
40|$|Special thanks {{goes to the}} University of Bor√•s and all {{the staff}} of {{engineering}} school by whose kind attention and assistance this thesis could be conducted, especially our supervisor Dr. Daniel Ekwall, who patiently directed us through the process. We should like to thank our parents for their warm support during our studies. Also, we should like to thank <b>dearest</b> <b>Dr.</b> Duangporn Prasertsubpakij for her guidance on technical thesis writing. iv In this era, where international outsourcing and global distribution systems are thriving, providing the security of products in the logistic system is very crucial now. For corporates, it is highly vital to know how secure high-tech products and materials are handled, warehoused and transported as they move throughout the globe. Different international security standards have been introduced, {{two of which are}} TAPA FSR and ISPS. TAPA FSR (Freight Security Requirements) defines the smallest required security standards for goods travelling throughout the supply chain and the suitable approaches in keeping those standards.

6000|$|... "Thank you, <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Monygham," [...] said Mrs. Gould; {{and under}} the shade of the big trees her little, even teeth gleamed in a {{youthful}} smile of gentle malice. [...] "People don't know how really good you are. You will not let them know, as if on purpose to annoy me, who have put my faith in your good heart long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{that it will}} be my part," [...] said she, [...] "to seize you by the arm {{and hold}} you back. Oh, you will give me a great deal to do! That {{is one of the things}} I love you for. It was one of the things I loved my <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> McQueen for." [...] She looked up suddenly. [...] "I have told him also about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, poor <b>dear</b> <b>Dr.</b> Trefoil!" [...] {{said the}} countess, {{who had once}} in her life spoken to that gentleman. [...] "I was so distressed to hear it, Mrs. Proudie. And so Dr. Stanhope {{is to be the}} new dean! He comes of an {{excellent}} family, and I wish him success in spite of his daughter. Perhaps, Mrs. Proudie, when he is dean, they'll be better able to see the error of their ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then that's all you recollect, is it?" [...] he asked. [...] "You don't {{remember}} me before, <b>dear?</b> Not <b>Dr.</b> Marten, {{who used to}} take you on his knee {{when you were a}} tiny little girl, and bring you lollipops from town, to the great detriment of your digestion, and get into rows with your poor father for indulging you and spoiling you? You must surely {{remember me}}?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Constantine of Greece has a German wife, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> {{and that}} fact squelches hope. To think that I should have lived to care {{what kind of}} a wife Constantine of Greece had! The miserable {{creature}} is under his wife's thumb and that is a bad place for any man to be. I am an old maid and an old maid has to be independent or she will be squashed out. But if I had been a married woman, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> I would have been meek and humble. It is my opinion that this Sophia of Greece is a minx." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, Mrs. <b>Dr.</b> <b>dear,</b> {{you will}} not be {{thinking}} of flaunting worldly things like daffies after you are dead," [...] said Susan. [...] "And I do NOT believe in ghosts, seen or unseen." ...|$|R
