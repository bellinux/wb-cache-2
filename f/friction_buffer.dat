50|$|<b>Friction</b> <b>buffer</b> stops are clamped 'loosely' to the rails, {{and when}} {{hit by a}} train that fails to stop correctly, move with the train for perhaps 30 m {{scraping}} {{the top of the}} rails, which absorbs considerable energy.|$|E
50|$|A {{track circuit}} {{interrupter}} may be fitted behind a <b>friction</b> <b>buffer</b> stop. In {{the event of}} the buffer stop being struck by a train and pushed along, an adjacent line may potentially be fouled.

50|$|A further {{development}} of the MG 1A1 was the MG 1A2 (MG 42/59), which had a heavier bolt (950 g, compared to 550 g), a new <b>friction</b> ring <b>buffer</b> and was adapted to use both the standard German continuous DM1 ammunition belt and the American M13 disintegrating belt. Further improvements to the weapon's muzzle device, bipod and bolt resulted in the MG 1A3.|$|R
50|$|Largely {{because of}} its mass, a train {{transfers}} {{an enormous amount of}} kinetic energy in a collision with a buffer stop. Rigid buffers can only safely cope with very low-speed impacts (i.e., nearly stationary). To improve stopping performance, a way of dissipating this energy is needed, through compression or <b>friction.</b> Following a <b>buffer</b> stop accident at Frankfurt am Main in 1902, the Rawie company developed a large range of energy-absorbing buffer stops. Similar hydraulic buffer stops were developed by Ransomes & Rapier in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{electrification}} of the lines, Colchester was modernised in 1962, {{with a new}} station {{building on}} the north side of the tracks. Following the reconstruction the station has two main platforms. The [...] "up" [...] (London-bound) side comprises two platforms, numbers 3 and 4, which have an unusual layout: 3 is on the up main line and is served by intercity trains from Norwich, while 4 is on the up branch line which merges with the up main line where the two platforms join end-to-end. The junction is protected by a trap leading to <b>friction</b> <b>buffer</b> stops. There are also bay platforms at both ends of the up main platform. The London-end bay (platform 6) is used for peak trains to and from London. Previously this platform was used for frequent services for the Sudbury Branch Line. However, most of these services were truncated to terminate at [...] from the mid-1990s. The other bay platform (platform 5) is used for services to Colchester Town and Walton-on-the-Naze. The [...] "down" [...] side platform is an island platform with two faces, one on the down main, and one on the down branch line. Platform 1 is mainly used for Clacton-on-Sea trains and occasionally for Norwich trains.|$|E
40|$|<b>Friction</b> <b>buffer</b> stops are the favoured {{construction}} of buffer stop, mainly {{due to its}} high resistance and variety of layout. Last but not least is its manner of deceleration induced upon impact and during the braking what makes it smart solution in railway transport safety. The general approach of designing buffer stops is via usage of the kinetic energy and its conversion into work. Paper describes input parameters such as train velocity or buffer stop vicinity which is expressed by the safety coefficient implanted within the calculation. Furthermore, the paper shows the principle of calculation the <b>friction</b> <b>buffer</b> stop work, or to be more precise, the work of its braking jaws and optionally the work of additional braking jaws located behind the buffer stop. Last section of the paper {{is focused on the}} examples of designing <b>friction</b> <b>buffer</b> stops, points out the main complications and shows the charts of relation amongst braking distance, kinetic energy and braking force and the charts of relation between deceleration rate and braking distance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the movement period control of the <b>friction</b> <b>buffer</b> using finite element methods and theoretical methods. The emphasis is on the prediction {{of the relationship between the}} number of the friction loops and the movement period control. The mathematical-physical model and a finite element model of a kind of <b>friction</b> <b>buffer</b> that includes several friction loops and a buffer spring are developed. The experimental study on some friction buffers that are different in material and half cone angle is conducted. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical results and the simulation results. The obtained results are of great importance to improve the design quality of the automatic weapons, especially for those that have particular request for firing rate. The simulation results suggest that the number of the friction loops has its limits for controlling the movement period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyze {{impacting}} {{characteristics of a}} metro vehicle, the impacting governing Eq. is established, in which, nonlinear stiffness and damping of a <b>buffer,</b> <b>friction</b> force between rail and wheel of the vehicles is considered. In terms of testing results, nonlinear stiffness and damping of the buffers is simulated. By numerical simulation, {{it is found that}} when moving trainset impacts standing trainset, because the impacting force, stroke of buffers located in impacting interface is the maximum, the capacity of the buffers must be large enough to avoid rigid impact; when trainset with different number vehicles impacts each other, the maximum impacting force is not only different from each other, but the stroke and energy dissipation of the buffers is also different; the capacity of buffers far from impacting interface may be small...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince the 50 s {{many studies}} have tried to {{understand}} the remarkable tribological performance of biological rubbing contacts. These performances were initially correlated with hydrodynamic lubrication {{which was supposed to}} locate the velocity accommodation within a homogeneous and continuous fluid film. Then the difficulties associated with the rheological characterization of the "biological lubricants" have led to study the molecular composition of these lubricants, especially that of molecular interfaces they create with biological tissues. Therefore, recent studies [Trunfio et al., Langmuir, 2008] have shown the importance of surfactant-type molecules (known as surface active phospholipids - called thereafter SAPL) on obtaining molecular surface layers with high mechanical strength and capable of locating the velocity accommodation, leading to a very low friction coefficient. These molecular layers are indeed made of stacks of 3 to 7 SAPL bilayers, with a thickness of approximately 5 nm each and separated by aqueous layers (a few nm thick) with about 150 mM ion concentration and the pH around 7 in the healthy case. Recent tribological studies showed that the low friction coefficients are due to the location of the velocity accommodation in the aqueous layers [Klein, Science, 2002]. Thus the changes in ion concentrations or the presence of electrically charged SAPL can significantly influence the friction coefficient. Therefore, this work aims to study the influence of ion concentration and pH on the evolution of friction and the degradation of SAPL bilayers during tests carried on an experimental realistic tribological model. This model uses hydrogels type 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) to reproduce ex vivo the mechanical and physico-chemical properties of biological tissues. Nanostructural physical techniques such as lipid deposition by co-adsorption of lipid / detergent micelles [Tiberg, BBA, 2005] and atomic force microscopy are used to reproduce and characterize the nano-mechanical resistance of SAPL bilayers forming biological rubbing surfaces. The evolution of SAPL bilayers is visualized in situ, during friction tests (velocity: 0. 5 mm/s; contact pressure 0. 3 MPa), by fluorescence optical microscopy using specific molecular markers. To study the influence of pH, three tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) buffer solutions at pH 3, 7. 2 and 9 are used. The influence of ion concentration was tested using pH 7. 2 TRIS buffer solutions with ionic concentrations of 0, 50 or 150 mM monovalent NaCl and 20 mM divalent CaCl 2 (being known the presence of different ions in biological fluids in order to regulate different biological processes). The main experimental results are summarized below: - Using non-buffered solution gives to SAPL bilayers low mechanical strength to the nanoindentation (about 100 % of the bilayers do not resist to normal pressures between a few tenths of MPa and few MPa.), which promotes their degradation in friction tests and the increase in the friction coefficient by about 80 % after 1 hour of <b>friction.</b> - Using <b>buffered</b> solutions (pH 7. 2) increases the mechanical strength of the SAPL bilayers (the bilayers are broken in only 20 % of the cases for non-ionic solution and 0 % for ionic solution; in these cases they resist to pressures over 20 MPa) which prevents their degradation and stabilizes the friction coefficient to a value depending on the pH and ionic concentration. The low pH (~ 3) promotes friction coefficients up to 5 times smaller than the higher pH (7, 9). The ionic concentration decreases by about 1. 5 times the friction coefficient compared to a non-ionic solution. There were not noticed significant differences between the use of monovalent (NaCl) or divalent (CaCl 2) ions. This study therefore shows that good mechanical resistance of the bilayers (characterized by indentation tests) is essential to obtain low friction and suggests that low friction is ensured by ion hydration layers between adjacent SAPL bilayers. It also suggests an important role of the ions and the buffered medium in maintaining stable bilayers...|$|R
