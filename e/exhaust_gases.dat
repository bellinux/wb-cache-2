5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger}} to the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> and a cover that could be raised to allow the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|The Merlin {{consumed}} {{an enormous}} volume of air {{at full power}} (equivalent to the volume of a single-decker bus per minute), and with the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> exiting at 1,300mph (2,100km/h) it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting sideways.|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} {{controlled}} by a cylindrical cell rotor driven by the engine crankshaft via a belt or chain. Individual cells alternately open and close the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> side is reached, pressurized <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there. As the cell rotor continues to rotate and reaches the aperture on the inlet side, the compressed air flows to the engine. Before the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> can flow, the aperture is closed again and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> column is reflected before entering the engine. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> exits at high speed, sucking further intake air into the cell behind it, repeating the process.|$|R

40|$|The heat {{recovery}} boiler system uses {{the heat of}} the flue gas from the <b>gas</b> turbine <b>exhaust</b> to produce steam for the steam turbine and to heat up the main condensate which is collected in the feedwater tank. The <b>gas</b> turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> first flows horizontally through an <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> diffuser, the diverter damper and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> duct.

5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E
5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E

A novel approach is proposed which consists {{in the use of the}} measured <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature dynamics for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the enthalpy flux of successive pressure pulses of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> supplying the marine engine turbocompressor. General design assumptions are presented for the measuring and diagnostic system which makes use of a sheathed thermocouple installed in the engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> manifold.

5|$|The {{crew of the}} Sevastopol {{joined the}} Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921. She {{returned}} fire when the Bolsheviks began to bombard Kronstadt Island and was hit by three 12-inch shells that killed or wounded 102 sailors. After the rebellion was bloodily crushed, she was renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna after the Paris Commune on 31 March 1921. She was refitted several times before she was recommissioned on 17 September 1925. She was refitted again in 1928 at the Baltic Shipyard, in preparation for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet. Her forward funnel was raised and the upper part was angled aft {{in an attempt to}} keep the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> out of the control and gunnery spaces, while three 3-inch 'Lender' AA guns were added to the roofs of the fore and aft turrets. She received some additional rangefinders and she was given a false bow to improve her sea-keeping ability. She sailed for the Black Sea on 22 November 1929, in company of the cruiser Profintern, encountering a bad storm in the Bay of Biscay. The open-topped bow lacked enough drainage and tended to trap a lot of water which badly damaged both the false bow and the supporting structure. Parizhskaya Kommuna was forced to put into Brest for repairs, which included the removal of the bulwark that retained so much water. Both ships arrived at Sevastopol on 18 January 1930 and Parizhskaya Kommuna became the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} diagnostic informativeness of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature measurements in turbocharged marine internal combustion engines.

Diagnostic parameters are defined which enable to formulate general evaluation of technical condition of the engine based on standard online measurements of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature. A proposal is made to extend the parametric methods of diagnosing workspaces in turbocharged marine engines by analysing time-histories of enthalpy changes of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flowing to the turbocompressor turbine. Such a time-history can be worked out based on dynamic measurements of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature, performed using a specially designed sheathed thermocouple...|$|R

25|$|In incineration, dioxins {{can also}} reform or form de novo in the {{atmosphere}} above the stack as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> cool through a temperature window of 600 to 200°C. The most common method of reducing the quantity of dioxins reforming or forming de novo is through rapid (30 millisecond) quenching of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> through that 400°C window. Incinerator emissions of dioxins have been reduced by over 90% {{as a result of}} new emissions control requirements. Incineration in developed countries is now a very minor contributor to dioxin emissions.|$|E

25|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} (or incineration) {{can also}} be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> or effluent off-gas. Controlled, high temperature incineration with filtering of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream. The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream. Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) influent vapor streams (which require less natural gas usage) than catalytic oxidation at ~2,000 ppmV.|$|E
