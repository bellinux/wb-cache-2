40|$|BACKGROUND: The natural triterpenes, <b>erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol,</b> exert anti-inflammatory, vasorelaxing and anti-proliferative effects. Angiotensin II is a {{well-known}} profibrotic and proliferative agent that participates in the cardiac remodeling associated with different pathological situations through the stimulation and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} study was to investigate the preventive effects of the natural triterpenes <b>erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol</b> on the proliferation and collagen production induced by angiotensin II in cardiac myofibroblasts. Their actions on cardiac hypertrophy triggered by angiotensin II were also studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effect of <b>erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol</b> on angiotensin II-induced proliferation was evaluated in cardiac myofibroblasts from adult rats in the presence or the absence of the inhibitors of PPAR-γ, GW 9662 or JNK, SP 600125. The effect on collagen levels induced by angiotensin II was evaluated in cardiac myofibroblasts and mouse heart. The presence of low doses of both triterpenes reduced the proliferation of cardiac myofibroblasts induced by angiotensin II. Pretreatment with GW 9662 reversed the effect elicited by both triterpenes while SP 600125 did not modify it. Both triterpenes at high doses produced an increase in annexing-V binding in the presence or absence of angiotensin II, which was reduced by either SP 600125 or GW 9662. <b>Erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol</b> decreased collagen I and galectin 3 levels induced by angiotensin II in cardiac myofribroblasts.

40|$|Pomace oil ('orujo' olive oil), is {{an olive}} sub-product which {{possesses}} potential beneficial components (e. g. tetra- and pentacyclic triterpenes: oleanolic and maslinic acids, <b>erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol)</b> to which {{great variety of}} biological effects is attributed. Pharmacological properties of oleanolic acid have been demonstrated: anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, hepatoprotective, cytotoxic, anti-diabetogenic, antibacterial and anti-HIV activities. There is scarce evidence about the pharmacological effects of these triterpenoid on vascular events; the chronic treatment of Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats with these natural compounds (oleanolic and ursolic acids) prevent the development of hypertension with significant bradycardia and potent diuretic activity.

40|$|Background]: Triterpene {{alcohols}} and acids are multifunctional compounds {{widely distributed}} throughout the plant kingdom that exhibit a variety of beneficial health properties, being synthetic analogs of oleanolic acid under clinical evaluation as anti-tumoral therapeutic agents. However, the antineoplastic activity of two natural occuring triterpenoid alcohols extracted from olive oil, erythrodiol (an intermediate from oleanolic acid), and its isomer, uvaol, has barely been reported, particularly on brain cancer cells. Astrocytomas {{are among the most}} common and aggressive type of primary malignant tumors in the neurological system lacking effective treatments, and in this study, we addressed the effect of these two triterpenic diols on the human 1321 N 1 astrocytoma cell line. [Principal Findings]: <b>Erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol</b> effectively affected cell proliferation, as well as cell cycle phases and induced 1321 N 1 cell death. Both triterpenes successfully modulated the apoptotic response, promoting nuclear condensation and fragmentation. They caused retraction and rounding of cultured cells, which lost adherence from their supports, while F-actin and vimentin filaments disappeared as an organized cytoplasmic network. At molecular level, changes in the expression of surface proteins associated with adhesion or death processes were also observed. Moreover, triterpene exposure resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and correlated with the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The presence of catalase reversed the triterpenic diols-induced mitochondrial depolarization, JNK activation, and apoptotic death, indicating the critical role of ROS in the action of these compounds. [Conclusions]: Overall, we provide a significant insight into the anticarcinogenic action of <b>erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol</b> that may have a potential in prevention and treatment of brain tumors and other cancers. ﻿This study has been funded by a grants SAF 2005 - 01242, SAF 2008 - 00245 and AGL 2008 - 022845 from MICINN, and CSI 11 A 08 from the Government of 	 Castilla y Leon.

40|$|This work {{establishes}} a new procedure for the extraction {{and analysis of}} pentacyclic triterpenes, with which fruits and leaves from three Spanish olive cultivars (“Picual”, “Hojiblanca”, and “Arbequina”) has been studied. The leaf contains important amounts of oleanolic acid (3. 0 − 3. 5 % DW), followed by significant concentrations of maslinic acid and minor levels of ursolic acid, <b>erythrodiol,</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol.</b> The abundance and profile of triterpenoids change during the leaf ontogeny. In the fruit, triterpenes are exclusively located in the epicarp at concentrations 30 -fold lower than that in the leaf. Maslinic acid is the main triterpenoid, only accompanied of oleanolic acid. Along the ripening the levels of these triterpenes decreased. All the analyzed leaves and fruits {{come from the same}} agricultural estate, with identical climate and culturing conditions.

40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a considerable amount of}} interest in the benefits of certain dietary elements, and in particular of olive oil, in endothelial function and thus in hypertension. “Orujo” or pomace olive oil is obtained from the residues of the olive by a novel centrifugation process, and it is a good dietary source of triterpenic compounds such as oleanolic and maslinic acid, <b>erythrodiol,</b> <b>and</b> <b>uvaol.</b> Until now, there was no information available regarding the properties of these triterpenoids on the vasculature of hypertensive animals. However, in this in vitro study, we have analyzed the vasorelaxation induced by these triterpenoids in isolated aorta from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The triterpenoids tested induced concentration-dependent vasorelaxation, mostly involving nitric oxide (NO). Indeed, the responses were attenuated by removal of the endothelium or following pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME. Furthermore, the differences that were observed in the potency of relaxation, the selectivity, and the dependence on the endothelium were attributed to structural features of the triterpenoids. In conclusion, triterpenic components in pomace olive oil induce vasorelaxation of the aorta from SHR, and this effect generally involves endothelial NO. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to other metabolic functions, {{the role of}} dietary antioxidants and oil on microsomal lipid oxidation has been less extensively studied. This study examines ascorbate−Fe 2 + and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation of hepatic microsomes of rats that were fed for three weeks high-oleic-acid oils (high-oleic sunflower oil, HOSO; olive oil, OO; or olive pomace oil, OPO) containing different concentrations of the antioxidants α-tocopherol, <b>erythrodiol,</b> <b>and</b> oleanolic acid. The fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes of Wistar rats that were fed for three weeks with the above-mentioned oils had lower proportions of C 16 : 0, C 18 : 2 n 6, and C 22 : 6 n 3 and higher proportions of C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 n 9 than rats fed the control diet. Light emission by hepatic microsomes increased, in the first 180 min, 2 -fold after ascorbate-Fe 2 + addition compared with NADPH addition. Both increases were less pronounced in microsomes of OPO-fed rats and to a smaller extent in microsomes of OO-fed rats. Smaller increases in light emission were associated positively with higher concentrations of dietary α-tocopherol, <b>erythrodiol,</b> <b>and</b> oleanolic acid but were not associated with changes in fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes. Addition of α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, or oleanolic acid decreased light emission of hepatic microsomes with a greater inhibition in microsomes of rats fed the control diet.

40|$|Olive pomace oil, {{also known}} as "orujo" olive oil, {{is a blend of}} refined-pomace oil and virgin olive oil, fit for human consumption.

In the present work, we investigated the effect of these minor components on pro-inflammatory cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in six different samples. Uvaol, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid significantly decreased IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 production in a dose-dependent manner. All three compounds significantly reduced TNF-alpha production at 100 mu M; however, at 10 mu M, uvaol and oleanolic acid enhanced the generation of TNF-alpha. In contrast, maslinic acid did not significantly alter the concentration of those cytokines, {{with the exception of a}} slight inhibitory effect at 100 mu M. All four triterpenes inhibited production of I- 309, at 50 mu M and 100 mu M. However, uvaol enhanced I- 309 production at 10 mu M. The triterpenic dialcohols had a similar effect on MIG production.

There were significant effects of cultivars or ps on unsaponifiable matter, β-sitosterol, Δ 5 -avenasterol, total sterols, 1 -docosanol, 1 -tetracosanol (ps), <b>erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> percentage <b>erythrodiol</b> + <b>uvaol.</b> The values of most of these parameters were within the limits established by the EU Directives for olive and pomace oils but classification of the respective oils was not conclusive. Predictive discriminant analysis using these variables permitted 100 % success in the classification according to cultivars and ps (68 % in the case of cross validation). Results revealed that some influential steps should be re-designed, particularly the storage phase, in order to minimise changes in the studied fat components during ripe olive processing.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are inflammatory demyelinating {{diseases that}} develop {{as a result}} of deregulated immune responses causing glial activation and destruction of CNS tissues. Oleanolic acid <b>and</b> <b>erythrodiol</b> are natural triterpenes that display strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Oleanolic acid beneficially influences the course of established EAE. We now extend our previous observations to <b>erythrodiol</b> <b>and</b> address the efficacy of both compounds to protect against EAE, given under different regimens. The utility of both triterpenes in disease prevention was evaluated at a clinical and molecular level: in vivo through their prophylactic administration to myelin oligodendrocyte protein-immunized C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and in vitro through their addition to stimulated-BV 2 microglial cells. These triterpenes protected against EAE by restricting infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS and by preventing blood–brain barrier disruption. Triterpene-pretreated EAE-mice exhibited less leptin secretion, and switched cytokine production towards a Th 2 /regulatory profile, with lower levels of Th 1 and Th 17 cytokines and higher expression of Th 2 cytokines in both serum and spinal cord. Triterpenes also affected the humoral response causing auto-antibody production inhibition. In vitro, triterpenes inhibited ERK and rS 6 phosphorylation and reduced the proliferative response, phagocytic properties and synthesis of proinflammatory mediators induced by the addition of inflammatory stimuli to microglia. Both triterpenes restricted the development of the characteristic features of EAE. We envision these natural products as novel helpful tools for intervention in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases including MS.

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{process is}} involved in the genesis and evolution of different diseases like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Macrophages {{play a central role in}} inflammation. In addition, they can regulate some stages of cancer development. Macrophages can polarize into M 1 or M 2 functional phenotype depending on the cytokines present in the tissue microenvironment. On the other hand, triterpenes found in virgin olive oil are described to present different properties, such as antitumoral and anti-inflammatory activity. The present study was designed to elucidate if the four major triterpenes found in virgin olive oil (oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, <b>uvaol,</b> <b>and</b> <b>erythrodiol)</b> are able to enhance M 1 macrophage response which represents an important defense mechanism against cancer. Our results indicated that maslinic acid modulated the inflammatory response by enhancing the production of IL- 8, IL- 1 α, and IL- 1 β; it promoted M 1 response through the synthesis of IFN-γ; and finally it did not modify significantly the levels of NFκβ or NO. Overall, our results showed that maslinic acid could prevent chronic inflammation, which represents a crucial step in the development of some cancers...|$|R
40|$|Orujo' {{olive oil}} is {{obtained}} by chemical processes from the waste {{resulting from the}} mechanical extraction of virgin olive oil. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate a new pharmacological property of two natural triterpenoids contained in olive oil, as vasodilatory agents, and to determine their mechanism of action. The two compounds studied were oleanolic acid <b>and</b> <b>erythrodiol.</b> The vasorelaxant effect induced by these pentacyclic triterpenoids was studied in isolated thoracic rat aorta. Oleanolic acid <b>and</b> <b>erythrodiol,</b> accumulatively added, showed vasorelaxant activities in aortic rings with endothelium pre-contracted by 10 - 6 M-phenylephrine (maximum percentage of relaxation 86. 38 (SEM 2. 89) and 73. 53 (SEM 6. 01), respectively). They had almost no relaxant effect on depolarised or endothelium-denuded aortic segments. The relaxation was significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor Nω -nitro-L-argi-nine-methylester (L-NAME; 3 × 10 - 4 M). To characterise the involvement of endothelial factors, in addifion to NO, arteries with endothelium were exposed to 10 - 5 M-indomethacin (INDO), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, or INDO plus L-NAME. INDO did not have any significant effect on the relaxant response of both compounds. The combination of L-NAME plus INDO only abolished the oleanolic acid-induced relaxation. The present results suggest that the mechanism of relaxation seems to be mainly mediated by the endothelial production of NO; however, other mechanisms cannot be excluded. It can be concluded that oleanolic acid <b>and</b> <b>erythrodiol</b> may have interesting therapeutic potential as new vasodilator drugs, thus protecting the cardiovascular system. Therefore, the intake of 'orujo' olive oil, as a source of these compounds, might be beneficial in this regard. © The Authors 2004.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 There are {{numerous}} references {{in the literature}} concerning the use of various Arctostaphylos species as medicinal plants. One of the species, A. uva-ursi, was listed in the United States official compendia from 1820 until 1946 as a urinary antiseptic. Many species indigenous to the Pacific Northwest were employed by the Indians {{for a variety of}} uses, ranging from consuming the ripe fruits as a food to utilizing the leaves in urinary tract and other infections. Early settlers in the West consequently used the plants for the same purposes. Phytochemical investigations of the genus Arctostaphylos have not been extensive although several members of the family, Ericaceae, yield compounds restricted only to the family. A thorough review of the literature revealed that there has been little phytochemical investigation of species other than Arctostaphylos uva-ursi. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to thoroughly investigate two other Arctostaphylos species, viz., A. Columbiana and A. patula, for organic components. The development of newer methods of extraction, isolation and identification, as well as, a screening of both plants for possible biological activity was also pursued. A new extraction solvent mixture was utilized in order to extract all of the components of interest in one extraction procedure. The residue from the extraction was then separated into two fractions; one containing sterol and triterpenoid compounds; and the other, phenolic components. The sterol and triterpene fraction of A. patula yielded the following isolated compounds; β-amyrin, β-sitosterol, ursolic acid, <b>uvaol,</b> <b>and</b> nonacosane. Only ursolic acid <b>and</b> <b>uvaol</b> were previously shown to exist in the genus. The identical fraction of A. columbiana was screened chromatographically for the same components and all except nonacosane were identified in this manner. Nonacosane was also isolated from A. columbiana. A separation of the components of the phenolic fraction was attempted using several standard methods. However, the method utilized for the identification of these compounds consisted of thin-layer chromatography and ultra-violet analysis. A relatively crude mixture was chromatographed along with a standard, both spots were eluted from the plate, scanned on a spectrophotometer, and co-spotted in three different solvent systems. This procedure proved the presence of the following compounds in both species; arbutin, ellagic acid, gallic acid, hydroquinone, hyperin and quercetin. The presence of o-pyrocatechuic acid, found in other members of the genus and family, could not be confirmed in these species. A screening for antibacterial and antifungal properties was conducted on crude plant extracts as well as the compounds found to be present in both plants. Some extracts of both plants demonstrated more antibacterial and antifungal activity than did any of the pure compounds. Further investigation is warranted in this area. Generally, the results obtained demonstrated the applicability of the new extraction scheme devised for the screening of hitherto uninvestigated plants. Eleven compounds were identified in both species, three of which had not been demonstrated in the genus previously. Another compound, assumed to be widespread in the family, was found to be absent in A. columbiana and A. patula...|$|R
40|$|Interest in the health-promoting {{effects of}} virgin olive oil, an {{important}} part of the "Mediterranean diet", prompted us to determine the antiinflammatory effects of <b>erythrodiol,</b> beta-sitosterol <b>and</b> squalene, identified as major components of the so-called "unsaponifiable fraction" of virgin olive oil, as well as of the phenolic compounds from the "polar fraction": oleuropein, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and caffeic acid. Their activities were compared to those of both, total unsaponifiable and polar fractions. This study was designed to analyse the antiinflammatory effect of these specific compounds from virgin olive oil on edema in mice induced by either arachidonic acid (AA) or 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA). The inhibition of the myeloperoxidase (MPO), marker enzyme of the accumulation of neutrophils in the inflamed tissue, was also investigated by the TPA model. The topical application of the olive oil compounds (0. 5 mg/ear) produced a variable degree of antiinflammatory effect with both assays. In the auricular edema induced by TPA, beta-sitosterol <b>and</b> <b>erythrodiol</b> from the unsaponifiable fraction of the oil showed a potent antiedematous effect with a 61. 4 % and 82. 1 % of inhibition respectively, values not very different to that of the reference indomethacin (85. 6 %) at 0. 5 mg/ear. The four phenolics exerted a similar range of inhibition (33 - 45 %). All compounds strongly inhibited the enzyme myeloperoxidase, indicating a reduction of the neutrophil influx in the inflamed tissues. The strongest inhibitor of AA edema was the total unsaponifiable fraction which inhibition was 34 %, similar to that obtained by the reference drug dexamethasone at 0. 05 mg/ear. Among the phenolics, oleuropein also produced an inhibition of about 30 % with the same dose, but all the other components were found less active in this assay. The anti-inflammatory effects exerted by both unsaponifiable and polar compounds might contribute to the potential biological properties reported for virgin olive oil against different pathological processes.
