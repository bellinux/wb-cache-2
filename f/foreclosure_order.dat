50|$|The {{official}} {{move toward}} foreclosure against First Arena began after 4:30 p.m. January 17, 2012, and {{the deadline for}} Elmira Downtown Arena to pay $123,849 in overdue taxes. Elmira Downtown Arena LLC, {{which was supposed to}} pay taxes and utility bills, is owned by Michigan businessman Mostafa Afr, who also owned the Elmira Jackals hockey team, the arena's primary tenant. The owner of First Arena in Elmira planned to apply to repurchase the arena from Chemung County if a judge signs a <b>foreclosure</b> <b>order</b> and a redemption period.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of his career, Traficant worked as {{consumer}} finance director for the Youngstown Community Action Program. [...] He taught courses on drug and alcohol dependency and recovery at Youngstown State University and Kent State University, as well as lecturing on drug and alcohol abuse for colleges and government agencies outside Ohio. In addition, Traficant taught at the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy. He was {{the executive director of the}} Mahoning County Drug Program from 1971 to 1981, and Sheriff of Mahoning County from 1981 to 1985. While serving as sheriff, Traficant made national headlines by refusing to execute <b>foreclosure</b> <b>orders</b> on several unemployed homeowners, many of whom had been left out of work by the recent closures of steel mills. This endeared him to the local population, which was dealing with a declining economy following the closures and relocations of steel making and steel-associated businesses.|$|R

50|$|After {{not paying}} taxes {{for three years}} and being hit with a <b>foreclosure</b> <b>order</b> by Chemung County, Mostafa Afr finally wrote a check to pay off all of the back taxes and fees he was {{responsible}} for on February 21, 2012. Afr owed $136,234. The arena was owned by Southern Tier Economic Development, STED, but Elmira Downtown Arena LLC is the arena's operator. STED's lawyer, Steven Agan, said Afr's check would be delivered to Chemung County later that week. If the check had not been written and the debt had not been paid, the county would gain ownership of the arena.|$|E
5000|$|Pat Bingham {{was then}} hired {{as head coach}} for the 2011-12 season. On February 21, 2012, the Jackals season was {{threatened}} after the Arena owner failed to pay $136,234 in taxes {{for three years and}} being hit with a <b>foreclosure</b> <b>order</b> by Chemung County. The Jackals continued to play not knowing if or when they would be locked out by the County. Jackals and First Arena's general manager, Robbie Nichols, and assistant general manager, Don Lewis, were fired in January 2012 and replaced by Matt Hufnagel. The operator of First Arena filed two lawsuits, one against Nichols and Lewis and the other against Chemung County, the County Executive, County Treasurer and Southern Tier Economic Development. This statement by the owner's lawyers was released: [...] "The truth will come out. Fact of the matter is the money was here to pay the taxes. And the fact is Robbie Nichols told the Afrs it was paid." [...] Afr, the Jackals and First Arena owner requested that the Legislature hold off their vote until June 30, 2012, to continue the foreclosure proceedings. On the ice, the Jackals had their best ECHL season and Bingham led the Jackals to a 45-22-5 record and captured the Eastern Conference regular season title. The Jackals advanced to the 2012 Kelly Cup playoffs for their fifth straight season, falling in the second round to the Florida Everblades, 4-games-to-1.|$|E
50|$|On December 5, 2007, Clinton {{unveiled}} {{her plan}} to ameliorate {{the effects of}} the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis on homeowners. She called for a 90-day moratorium on <b>foreclosures,</b> in <b>order</b> that lenders and mortgage servicers have sufficient time to get through paperwork complications and an expected high volume of troubled borrowers without having to shut out the lights, and a five-year freeze on the interest rates of adjustable rate mortgages, so that borrowers would not get slammed by expected 30, 40 or more percent increases in monthly payments due to {{the effects of the}} crisis and of unwise initial borrowing decisions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} the first rigorous {{assessment of the}} homeownership experiences of subprime borrowers. We consider homeowners who used subprime mortgages to buy their homes, and estimate how often these borrowers end up in <b>foreclosure.</b> In <b>order</b> to evaluate these issues, we analyze homeownership experiences in Massachusetts over the 1989 – 2007 period using a competing risks, proportional hazard framework. We present two main findings. First, homeownerships that begin with a subprime purchase mortgage end up in foreclosure almost 20 percent of the time, or more than 6 times as often as experiences that begin with prime purchase mortgages. Second, house price appreciation plays a dominant role in generating foreclosures. In fact, we attribute most of the dramatic rise in Massachusetts foreclosures during 2006 and 2007 to the decline in house prices {{that began in the}} summer o...|$|R
50|$|Foreclosure {{is rarely}} {{exercised}} as a remedy. To execute foreclosure, the secured party needs to petition the court, {{and the order}} is made in two stages (nisi and absolute), making the process slow and cumbersome. Courts are historically reluctant to grant <b>orders</b> for <b>foreclosure,</b> and will often instead order a judicial sale. If the asset {{is worth more than}} the secured obligations, the secured party will normally have to account for the surplus. Even if a court makes a decree absolute and <b>orders</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> the court retains an absolute discretion to reopen the foreclosure after the making of the order, although this would not affect the title of any third party purchaser.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{the front}} {{companies}} of the Saudi citizen Adnan Khashoggi began buying houses in Lamar Terrace. From 1982 to 1985 Khashoggi-controlled companies purchased 75 houses. Mainland Savings Association and Summit Savings Association of Dallas had provided the financing. Triad America, a Utah-based company {{owned by the}} Khashoggi family, had {{plans to build a}} complex including a skyscraper and a 1,000 room hotel on a 21 acre strip of land east of Lamar Terrace. Triad had acquired the site in the mid-1970s. In 1983 the company said that it had suspended the project. In 1985 Triad sold the hotel site to Mainland and gained a line of credit. In 1986 Summit, which had loaned $5 million ($ in current money) to Triad Properties Corp., a subsidiary of Triad America, filed loan <b>foreclosure</b> proceedings in <b>order</b> to repossess 47 of the houses. In 1986 Summit declined to foreclose on the houses. Later in 1986, the houses were foreclosed upon.|$|R
40|$|The {{foreclosure}} {{of property}} tax liens performs an essential economic function by reconnecting underutilized properties {{to the real}} estate market. To clear title in an efficient and just manner, local jurisdictions foreclosing on tax liens require clear, balanced procedures {{for the provision of}} notice to affected parties. In its 2006 decision in Jones v. Flowers, the U. S. Supreme Court found that the foreclosing jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s lack of direct follow-up on returned notice mailings denied the addressee due process because the foreclosing party did not take steps that would be chosen by one desirous of actually informing the property owner. In subjecting to direct constitutional review the myriad notification decisions a foreclosure petitioner must make in conducting diligent attempts at notification, Jones, though rightly decided, threatens the validity of tax foreclosure proceedings and the titles that result from them in a fundamentally different way than earlier precedents that made notification more rigorous without loss of clarity. After demonstrating the Court 2 ̆ 7 s historical use of rules and standards in this area of notice and opportunity to be heard, this Article will show how the development of constitutional safe harbors can be used to resolve the shortcomings of the rule/standard dichotomy. Deploying a theoretical framework for the judicial fostering of fair and efficient constitutional safe harbors, this Article advocates legislative enactment of and judicial support for detailed notification protocols tailored to the particular needs and behaviors of the different types of land interest holders entitled to <b>foreclosure</b> notice. In <b>order</b> to provide reliable guidance to foreclosing parties, these notice procedures should be designed to meet a higher standard developed in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s due process jurisprudence. If a court finds a set of legislated protocols reasonably certain to inform the interested parties for whom they were designed, then that court should judge the constitutionality of notification choices that come before it against that certified rule. Such an approach would be preferable to reviewing those decisions directly using vague, albeit generally less restrictive, constitutional standards such as reasonably calculated... to apprise or chosen by one desirous of actually informing. Notification protocols that meet this due process super standard of reasonable certainty can become safe harbors for those pursuing tax foreclosure remedies while still assuring full compliance with the guarantees of notice and opportunity to be heard embodied in constitutional jurisprudence. due process, notice and opportunity to be heard, tax foreclosure, constitutional safe harbor, rules, standards, pliability rule...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Eurocode, different formulas are used for shear tests in concrete structures than the previous Dutch standard. These formulas are often used in new building designs. If the result compared with the Dutch standard is either favorable or unfavorable, the design should be modified. It is interesting to research the impact of new formulas applied to existing structures. In certain situations the structural safety has to be reviewed and the use of Eurocode could apply. This research compares four methods of calculation for the shear test in an existing immersed tunnel. The four methods of calculation are based on the Dutch standard, the Eurocode, the IBBC method and a finite element calculation with the program Atena. In addition also the effects of fire on the shear test are considered. The reference project is the Maastunnel, the oldest immersed tunnel in the Netherlands. To compare the different methods properly a unity check is used. The load on the structure is divided by the maximum load that the structure can bear. The construction is safe when the unity check is less than 1. By the results of the unity check it is possible to draw conclusions about the safety of the construction according to the different methods. The most critical parts of the structure are near the corners in the roof. Three methods meet the requirements of the shear test and therefore show that the construction is safe, only the Eurocode does not. Calculations with Atena shows that the construction has a unity check of 0, 4 (safe) and more important, shear failure is not dominant. The shear test for the current immersed Maastunnel results in roughly the same safety features for the current Dutch standards, the IBBC formulation and the finite element method in Atena. The shear test by the new Eurocode shows a clearly lower safety. Main reason is that according to Eurocode, the contribution of the strength of concrete and reinforcing steel should not be added. For the authors of the Eurocode, testing of existing structures was not the starting point. The finite element method shows that the vault function has a major influence on the ultimate failure behavior. If an arch can occur, the shear strength would increase significantly. The shear strength is strongly influenced by the geometry of the corner of the roof. A frequently used general formulation for the shear tests, results in the use of tests which are not designed specifically for the type of construction. This may result in an unnecessarily amount of reserve, while construction is actually stronger than predicted by the test. The influence of fire on the shear test is limited if the structure can deform. Even if splashing of concrete occurs, a vault can add significant strength. It is shown that prevented deformation has a major influence on the shear test. For tunnels a certain degree of foreclosure cannot be neglected. The assumption that the tunnel deformation by fire is completely forbidden, will require too conservative results. It is therefore recommended to examine the <b>foreclosure</b> rate in <b>order</b> to calculate the additional internal forces.
