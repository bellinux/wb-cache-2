This has an impact onrising extraction costs and selling prices to the public. In addition, the emissions produced by during fossil fuels had a devastating impact on the environment. One of the alternative energy to reduce fossil fuel is bio-oil produced from biomass through pyrolysis technology. Pine bark isa potensial biomass {{to be used as}} bio-oil material. Until now, this pine bark only regarded as wastes that pollute the environment. Thought pine bark {{can be used as a}} source of fuel, because the pine bark has a potential source of energy. The purpose of this study is to know the effect of the ratio impregnated metal of Ni and Mo on NZA catalyst and the ratio amount of catalyst on the yield of bio-oil produced, knowing the value of density, viscosity, acidity and a flash point of bio-oil as well as determine the chemical components in bio-oil by GC-MS method. Pyrolysis bio-oil begins to process the biomass size reduction (- 60 + 80 mesh) and natural zeolite (- 100 + 200 mesh). Metal Ni and Mo was impregnated into the zeolit to form a bimetallic catalyst NiMo/NZA. Then the catalyst was activated by calcination stage, oxidation and reduction pyrolysis using pine bark as much as 50 grams along with 500 ml silinap with variations developing of metal Ni and Mo to NZA without metal (0 %), 1 %, 2 % and 3 % b/b and weight variation of NiMo catalyst/NZA 3 %, 6 % and 9 % of the biomass with a stirring speed of 300 rpm and temperature of 320 oC for 120 min.

40|$|The inverse {{geothermal}} problem {{consist of}} estimating the temperature distribution below the earth’s surface using temperature and heat-flux measurements on the earth’s surface. The problem is important since temperature governs {{a variety of}} the geological processes including formation of magmas, minerals, <b>fosil</b> <b>fuels</b> and also deformation of rocks. Mathematical this problem is formulated as a Cauchy problem for an non-linear elliptic equation and since the thermal properties of the rocks depend strongly on the temperature, the problem is non-linear. This problem is ill-posed {{in the sense that}} it does not satisfy atleast one of Hadamard’s definition of well-posedness. We formulated the problem as an ill-posed non-linear operator equation which is defined in terms of solving a well-posed boundary problem. We demonstrate existence of a unique solution to this well-posed problem and give stability estimates in appropriate function spaces. We show that the operator equation is well-defined in appropriate function spaces. Since the problem is ill-posed, regularization is needed to stabilize computations. We demostrate that Tikhonov regularization can be implemented efficiently for solving the operator equation. The algorithm is based on having a code for solving a well- posed problem related to the operator equation. In this study we demostrate that the algorithm works efficiently for 2 D calculations but can also be modified to work for 3 D calculations...|$|R

40|$|Bio-resins are an {{emerging}} industrial technology derived from natural renewable components such as Plant-based Oils. Bio-resins {{can be obtained}} from the epoxidation of Vegetable Oils, which creates suitable thermoset resins known as Epoxidized Vegetable Oils (EVO). This initial process can be followed by a 2 nd chemical functionalization known as the acrylation process of the epoxidized oils, which generates the acrylated-type of bio-resins (AEVO). The current international interest on bio-resins stems largely from increasing regulation and public concern for a pollution-free environment and the need for sustainable alternatives to reduce the dependence on <b>fosil</b> <b>fuels.</b> The synthesized bio-resins can be used as the matrix of 100 % bio-composites with the application of Natural Fibers such as Flax, Hemp, Bamboo or Jute fibers between others, used as natural reinforcement to the bio-composites. At the Centre of Excellence in Engineered Fibre Composites (CEEFC– USQ university, Australia) we have been working in the last 10 years on the development and characterization of bio-composites. In a particular investigation we established the mechanical properties (tensile, flexural and Charpy impact resistance) of bio-composites made of epoxidized hemp oil (EHO) reinforced with natural Jute fibbers and synthetic Glass fibber mats. The EHO bio-resins were synthesized as world-first in the CEEFC laboratories. These bio-composites were investigated and compared with samples containing commercially produced epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) and a synthetic commercial epoxy resin. EHO based bio-resins and related bio-composites were found to have superior mechanical and impact resistance properties in comparison with equivalent structural materials made with the commercially available ESO bio-resins. ...|$|R
