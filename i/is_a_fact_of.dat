500|$|In {{an honest}} {{description}} of the disadvantages of Florida, Stowe attempts to disabuse readers {{of the notion that}} the region is perfect. She writes, [...] "In New England Nature is an up-and-down smart, decisive, housemother that has her times and seasons and brings up her ends of life with a positive jerk" [...] and contrasts that characterization with Nature in Florida, an [...] "indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular time for any thing and does every thing when she happens to feel like it". Those who wish to live in Florida, Stowe warns, must also get to know its deficiencies: occasional freezing weather in winter, unsculptable lawns, insects and snakes, and people who disagree as they do everywhere else. Were Florida a woman, Stowe writes, she would be a dark brunette, full of jolly untidiness. Malaria <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> life, and Stowe cautions Northerners who may be lured to the region by tales of the mild climate to understand that temperature extremes are common, taking particular effort to address consumptives, or those afflicted with tuberculosis. Those who consider moving to the region should weigh all these issues before making their decisions. In The Journal of Southern History, Susan Eacker attests that Stowe's assignment of female characteristics to Florida coincided with her own gradual admission that she may be turning into a [...] "woman's rights woman".|$|E

2500|$|Transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom {{has argued}} that any {{technological}} advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.

In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> life and those who believe the dragon {{can and should be}} destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.|$|E
2500|$|Another equally scathing {{review was}} {{published}} by the American historian Charles Sydnor who argued that Hitler's War was marred by Irving's efforts to present Hitler in the most favourable light possible. Sydnor commented that Irving wrongly and bizarrely presented SS massacres in Poland in September 1939 as the legitimate response to the British rejection of Hitler's peace offer of October 1939, and that Irving seemed to imply that Hitler's anti-Semitism was justified by the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive against German cities. Sydnor noted numerous errors in Hitler's War such as Irving's claim that Andreas Hofer was shot by the French in 1923 for opposing the French occupation of the Ruhr (Irving probably had Albert Leo Schlageter in mind), and that the 1945 film Kolberg, which dealt with the theme of a Prussian fortress besieged by the French in 1806, was set in the Seven Years' War. Sydnor also speculated about just what motivated the East German government to allow Irving entry into the German Democratic Republic to search for information about Hitler, commenting [...] "That the East Germans assisted Mr. Irving in an effort that would culminate in a revisionist interpretation of Hitler <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> real interest – and some amusement if one speculates {{on the question of}} who may have been taken in by whom." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the use of}} United States case law, {{from which}} the {{doctrine}} had largely been drawn, the court acknowledged that decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States were of course not binding in Australia, but given {{the similarities between the}} American and Australian Constitutions, such decisions [...] "may well be regarded... not as an infallible guide, but as a most welcome aid and assistance." [...] The court went on to discuss the method by which the Constitution was formed, at the Constitutional Conventions, and said that [...] "we think... we are entitled to assume — what, after all, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> public notoriety — that some, if not all, of the framers of the Constitution were familiar, not only with the Constitution of the United States, but with that of the Canadian Dominion and those of the British colonies", and that when provisions of the Australian Constitution are in substance the same as those in other constitutions, and those other provisions have been interpreted by courts in a certain way, [...] "it is not an unreasonable inference that [...] framers intended that like provisions should receive like interpretation."

2500|$|In Rome in 1992, a 45-year-old driving {{instructor}} {{was accused of}} rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told {{her that if she}} was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual ("because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex"). [...] The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision “it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.” This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.” As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made Denim Day an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest. As of 2008 the Italian Supreme Court has overturned their findings, and {{there is no longer a}} [...] "denim" [...] defense to the charge of rape.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E
