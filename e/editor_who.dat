5|$|Lenalee {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{characters}} Hoshino created for the manga, most notably before the series' protagonist, Allen Walker. She originated in Hoshino's one shot, Zone, where she is depicted as a teenager who wants the Earl to revive her boyfriend. Hoshino's design changes across the D.Gray-man series led to arguments between Hoshino and her <b>editor</b> <b>who</b> argued how Lenalee's hairstyle should look.|$|E

5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary <b>editor</b> <b>who</b> {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work was meant to be realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E

5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as Little Bee, is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave. It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine <b>editor,</b> <b>who</b> meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. Cleave, inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} humanise the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum system, as well as issues of British colonialism, globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Nordale hired {{a recent}} University of Alaska Fairbanks {{graduate}} named Bob Bartlett. Bartlett {{had worked for}} the paper during school vacations, but he made journalism a full-time job following graduation. For four years, Bartlett was the only reporter (other than the <b>editor)</b> <b>who</b> regularly wrote local stories. In late 1930, Bartlett was made the paper's assistant editor in lieu of a raise that the paper couldn't afford to pay. Bartlett remained the paper's assistant editor until 1933, when he became the secretary to Anthony Dimond, Alaska's delegate to the U.S. Congress. Bartlett became the delegate to Congress in 1945, and in 1958, when Alaska hosted its first election for state office, Bartlett was elected one of its first two U.S. Senators.|$|E

He has two children, including his son Patrick, a photojournalist, and two grandchildren.

5|$|With {{respect to}} the theory {{that there was a}} single author, as {{initially}} postulated by Dessau, this is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an <b>editor</b> <b>who</b> brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the scriptores. If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must {{have been involved in the}} project in order to select one scriptors life over another's.|$|E
5|$|After {{the primary}} defeat, Boddy went into semi-retirement, and profits from {{sales of the}} Daily News began to decrease. In early 1951, he made his assistant, Robert Smith, editor of the paper. In mid-1952, Boddy sold out to a consortium. In August 1952, Boddy {{announced}} his retirement as publisher in Smith's favor. Smith instituted changes, scrapping the money-losing Saturday edition and started a Sunday News. He called in WIlliam Townes as <b>editor,</b> <b>who</b> was well known for restoring ailing newspapers. However, Smith fired Townes after twelve weeks on the job. Smith attempted to sell the paper, and reached an agreement with a small-time Oregon newspaper owner, Sheldon F. Sackett. After signing, Smith {{backed out of the}} deal, apparently out of seller's remorse. By the time Smith finally sold the paper, in December 1952 to Congressman Clinton D. McKinnon, who was leaving office after losing a Senate primary bid, the Daily News was losing over $100,000 a month. McKinnon had no better luck than anyone else in reviving the paper, and in December 1954, the paper was sold to the Chandler family, owners of the Los Angeles Mirror. Under the sale agreement, the Mirror became the Mirror & Daily News (before again being renamed the Mirror-News) and all Daily News employees lost their jobs. On December 18, 1954, publication of the Daily News ceased.|$|E
5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the {{transcript}} of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown <b>editor</b> <b>who</b> signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.|$|E

5|$|William Trotter Porter (December 24, 1809– July 19, 1858) was an American {{journalist}} and newspaper <b>editor</b> <b>who</b> founded an early American newspaper devoted to sports. After {{working at a}} number of small newspapers, Porter moved to New York City in the 1830s. After employment at a newspaper in the city, he founded the Spirit of the Times, a newspaper modeled on a London paper called Bell's Life in London. The Spirit, which went through a number of names and incarnations over the years, was devoted to sports and other recreational pursuits. One of Porter's main interests involved horse racing, and he was involved in attempts to create the first stud book in the United States, which did not bear fruit. He was also instrumental in the development of American literature, as the Spirit published a number of short stories by American tall tale writers, and Porter edited two collections of short stories by American writers. After publishing the Spirit through the 1830s, he sold it to another printer but continued as the editor into the 1850s. He left the original Spirit in 1855 and in 1856 was hired as editor for another sporting newspaper, Porter's Spirit of the Times, published by George Wilkes. Porter died in 1858.|$|E
