5|$|Florida Atlantic <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{since its}} opening in 1964. As of 2013, {{there are more}} than 30,000 {{students}} attending classes on seven campuses spread across 120miles (193km). The university consists of ten colleges and employs more than 3,200 faculty and staff. The university's endowment decreased from $182 million in June 2008 to $142 million in January 2009 due to a worsening economy. However, with the national economic recovery the endowment has increased to $179 million by the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|Lara's backstory <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{over the}} course of the series. During the first era, game manuals {{describe}} the character as the Wimbledon, London-born daughter of Lord Henshingly Croft (Lord Richard Croft in Legend and its sequels). She was raised as an aristocrat and betrothed to the fictitious Earl of Farringdon. Lara attended the Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun and a Swiss finishing school. At the age of twenty-one, she survived a plane crash, which left her stranded in the Himalayas for two weeks; the experience spurred her to shun her former life and seek other adventures around the world. Croft published books and other written works based on her exploits as a mercenary, big-game hunter, and master thief.|$|E

5|$|The new 1981-2010 (as {{opposed to}} 1971-2000) averages from the Met Office {{show how the}} climate of Leeming <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{compared}} with most places in the UK. The average April maximum temperature is only 12.3°C, compared with 14.1°C previously. The average yearly temperature has decreased to 9.45°C compared to 9.55°C previously and in contrast most places of the UK have become warmer. The days have become cooler and the nights warmer. Winters have become much milder, summers cooler. Leeming now gets an additional 44.7mm of rain per year, although also 62.3 more hours of sunshine. The climate of Leeming has generally lost its characteristics of being drier and with more seasonal variation, compared {{with the rest of}} the UK. Leeming recorded its warmest December temperature on record in 2015.|$|E

25|$|China's {{investment}} climate <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{with more}} than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms. The Encouraged Industry Catalogue sets out the degree of foreign involvement allowed in various industry sectors. From the beginning of the reforms legalizing foreign investment, capital inflows expanded every year until 1999. Foreign-invested enterprises account for 58–60% of China's imports and exports.|$|E
25|$|Within {{recent years}} the role of special constables <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> and they are now {{increasingly}} used alongside their regular colleagues to perform almost all police duties. As well as patrol duties, they often take part in response duties and specials often police events such as sports matches, carnivals, parades and fêtes. While this event policing is the stereotypical image of a special constable, it only {{represents one of the}} wide range of duties undertaken. Many police Forces in England and Wales have introduced Neighbourhood Policing Teams and the Special Constabulary has been incorporated into this concept.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{several generations}} of Franco-Ontarians grew up without formal {{education}} since the dropout rate for francophones was quite high during this period. Franco-Ontarians thus opted for jobs which did not require reading and mathematical skills, such as mining and forestry, and were virtually absent from white collar jobs. Sociologically, it meant that education was not a value transmitted to younger Franco-Ontarians. Although this <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> {{since the advent of}} funding for francophone high schools in the 1960s, according to the 2001 census, francophones in Ontario still tend to have a lower level of education than the general population.|$|E

25|$|MotoGP, {{the premier}} class of GP {{motorcycle}} racing, <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> in recent years. From the mid-1970s through to 2001, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc displacement {{with a maximum}} of four cylinders, {{regardless of whether the}} engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Consequently, all machines were two-strokes, due to the greater power output for a given engine capacity. Some two- and three-cylinder two-stroke 500s were seen, but though they had a minimum-weight advantage under the rules, typically attained higher corner speed and could qualify well, they lacked the power of the four-cylinder machines.|$|E
25|$|Society in Willow Bunch <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> over time. The {{school is}} closed down so {{children}} have to attend school in Coronach and Assiniboia. Graduation rates are higher because girls have fewer duties at home and attending school is free. Most women now have employment outside of their homes. Fewer families make a living by farming and people in Willow Bunch often find work in neighbouring towns. Since most of their day is spent outside of Willow Bunch they tend to buy necessary items, such as groceries, elsewhere. This has affected the town greatly and businesses in Willow Bunch have suffered and even shut down because of this change.|$|E
25|$|However, its {{relationship}} to the European Union and its institutions <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> and is still the subject of a lively debate. In the 1970s and 1980s the European Greens were generally sceptical of European political and economic integration, which was seen as contrary to environmental and social interests. In its 1984 program, the European Greens advocated the formation of an alternative Europe, which would be neutral and decentralised. In 1989, some member parties adopted a more parliamentary course and became more supportive of European integration. The program advocates the democratisation of Europe's institutions. In their 1994 program, the Greens abandoned their principled opposition of European integration and began to propose pragmatic alternatives for the European Union's policies and institutions. The 1999 and 2004 programs also reflect this.|$|E

25|$|From the 1980s onward, {{the major}} league game <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> from a {{combination}} of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes {{in the way that the}} game is played, and problems with the use of performance-enhancing substances like steroids tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit 70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.|$|E
25|$|In recent centuries, {{the range}} of wild boar <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically,</b> largely due to hunting by humans and more {{recently}} because of captive wild boar escaping into the wild. Prior to the 20th century, boar populations had declined in numerous areas, with British populations probably becoming extinct during the 13th century. In Denmark, the last boar was shot {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, and in 1900 they were absent in Tunisia and Sudan and large areas of Germany, Austria, and Italy. In Russia they were extirpated in wide areas in the 1930s. The last boar in Egypt reportedly died on 20 December 1912 in the Giza Zoo, with wild populations having disappeared around 1894–1902. Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein attempted to repopulate Wadi El Natrun with boars of Hungarian stock, but they were quickly exterminated by poachers.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically.</b> Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E

500|$|Burke {{has been}} a {{principal}} draftsman of the map of ward boundaries. When Burke started his political career, the 14th Ward that he represents was centered in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, {{more than a mile}} and a half east of where it is now. The 14th Ward is a gerrymandered area whose shape has been described as [...] "like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle". With each new ward map, drawn every 10 years, its boundaries have been moved farther west. As of 2010, its boundaries extended from 39th Street south to 59th and from Western Avenue west to Cicero Avenue, including most of the Brighton Park, Gage Park and Archer Heights neighborhoods. The ethnic composition of the ward <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> during Burke's tenure in office. As of 1968, residents were predominantly of Polish or other Eastern European extraction, but by 2010 it had a large Mexican and Mexican-American population.|$|E

Anything that moves my emotion gives me inspiration". Shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is [...] "not part of [...] daily routine, like traveling." [...] Although her influences are mostly classical, she has said that in her opinion her [...] "style <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>dramatically</b> over the years, though the passion for music stays the same." [...] Shimomura has said that she believes that {{an important part of}} [...] "the creative process behind music" [...] is to [...] "convey a subtle message, something that comes from your imagination and sticks with the listener, without being overly specific about what it means", rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages. Her favorite track that she has ever composed is [...] "Dearly Beloved" [...] from Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
