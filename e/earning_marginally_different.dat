40|$|Smallholder {{irrigation}} {{is emerging}} as a development priority in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on a survey of 1554 smallholders from nine countries, this paper compares rainfed farming with gravity-flow, manual-lift and motor-pump irrigation. Motor-pump-irrigation farmers reported the highest net value added per acre and per family worker, with gravity-flow and manual-irrigation farmers <b>earning</b> <b>marginally</b> more than rainfed-only farmers. In addition to making affordable pumps more readily available, improving the availability of working capital, enhancing security of tenure and ensuring the availability of affordable fuel are all likely to accelerate smallholder irrigation development in Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R

40|$|The risk/return {{characteristics}} of world stock markets are examined {{for the period}} 1973 - 1990 and three sub-periods. From {{the perspective of the}} US investor, EC stock markets individually and collectively yield higher average rates of return but with higher variability than the US stock market (except for the sub-period 1979 - 1984). However, investment in a well-diversified portfolio of EC stocks <b>earned</b> <b>marginally</b> higher average returns with less risk than investing in the Japanese stock market (except for the sub-period 1979 - 1984). The evidence suggests that a strong dollar and deeper recession in Europe {{may have contributed to the}} poor performance of EC stock markets between 1979 and 1984. ...|$|R
50|$|Femininity {{has become}} a place of {{contention}} between transfeminists and some other feminists. Trans women {{have been accused of}} exaggerating their feminine traits. Because hate crimes and social punishments are rampant against trans people, portraying gender unambiguously can increase a trans person's sense of safety. Even when the visible signs of femininity are only <b>marginally</b> <b>different</b> from norms, they may be seen as wildly inappropriate.|$|R

One common criticism is that radical centrist policies are only <b>marginally</b> <b>different</b> from conventional centrist policies. Another criticism is that the radical centrist penchant for third parties is naive and self-defeating. Some observers see radical centrism as primarily a process of catalyzing dialogue and fresh thinking among polarized people and groups.|$|R
