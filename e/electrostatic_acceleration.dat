Goddard's handwritten notebook in an entry dated September 6, 1906. The first experiments with ion thrusters were carried out by Goddard at Clark University from 1916-1917. The technique was recommended for near-vacuum conditions at high altitude, but thrust was demonstrated with ionized air streams at atmospheric pressure. The idea appeared again in Hermann Oberth's [...] "Wege zur Raumschiffahrt” (Ways to Spaceflight), published in 1923, where he explained his thoughts on the mass savings of electric propulsion, predicted its use in spacecraft propulsion and attitude control, and advocated <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration</b> of charged gases.|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear space-charge effects play an {{important}} role in emittance growth in the production of kA electron bunches with a bunch length much smaller than the bunch diameter. We propose a scheme employing the radial third-order component of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration</b> field, to fully compensate the nonlinear space-charge effects. This results in minimal transverse root-mean-square emittance. The principle is demonstrated using our design simulations of a device for the production of high-quality, high-current, subpicosecond electron bunches using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration</b> in a 1 GV/m field. Simulations using the GPT code produce a bunch of 100 pC and 73 fs full width at half maximum pulse width, resulting in a peak current of about 1. 2 kA at an energy of 2 MeV.

40|$|The γ-ray flares {{from the}} Crab nebula {{observed}} by AGILE and Fermi-LAT between 2007 - 2013 reached GeV photon energies and lasted several days. The strongest emission, observed during the 2011 April "super-flare," exceeded the quiescent level {{by more than}} an order of magnitude. These observations challenge the standard models for particle acceleration in pulsar wind nebulae, because the radiating electrons have energies exceeding the classical radiation-reaction limit for synchrotron. Particle-in-cell simulations {{have suggested that the}} classical synchrotron limit can be exceeded if the electrons also experience <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration</b> due to shock-driven magnetic reconnection. In this paper, we revisit the problem using an analytic approach based on solving a fully time-dependent electron transport equation describing the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration,</b> synchrotron losses, and escape experienced by electrons in a magnetically confined plasma "blob" as it encounters and passes through the pulsar-wind termination shock. We show that our model can reproduce the γ-ray spectra observed during the rising and decaying phases of each of the two sub-flare components of the 2011 April super-flare. We integrate the spectrum for photon energies > 100 MeV to obtain the light curve for the event, which agrees with the observations. We find that strong <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration</b> occurs {{on both sides of the}} termination shock, driven by magnetic reconnection. We also find that the dominant mode of particle escape changes from diffusive escape to advective escape as the blob passes through the shock. Comment: 8 figures, 29 page...|$|E
40|$|The γ-ray flares {{from the}} Crab nebula {{observed}} by AGILE and Fermi-LAT reaching GeV energies and lasting several days challenge the standard models for particle acceleration in pulsar wind nebulae, because the radiating electrons have energies exceeding the classical radiation-reaction limit for synchrotron. Previous modeling {{has suggested that}} the synchrotron limit can be exceeded if the electrons experience <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration,</b> but the resulting spectra do not agree very well with the data. As a result, there are still some important unanswered questions about the detailed particle acceleration and emission processes occurring during the flares. We revisit the problem using a new analytical approach based on an electron transport equation that includes terms describing <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration,</b> stochastic wave-particle acceleration, shock acceleration, synchrotron losses, and particle escape. An exact solution is obtained for the electron distribution, which is used to compute the associated γ-ray synchrotron spectrum. We find that in our model the γ-ray flares are mainly powered by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration,</b> but the contributions from stochastic and shock acceleration {{play an important role in}} producing the observed spectral shapes. Our model can reproduce the spectra of all the Fermi-LAT and AGILE flares from the Crab nebula, using magnetic field strengths in agreement with the multi-wavelength observational constraints. We also compute the spectrum and duration of the synchrotron afterglow created by the accelerated electrons, after they escape into the region on the downstream side of the pulsar wind termination shock. The afterglow is expected to fade over a maximum period of about three weeks after the γ-ray flare. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

30|$|As {{shown by}} Hendell and Even [14], and later applied by Hsu and {{co-workers}} [28], a linear accelerator for large molecular ions can be configured using modern high-voltage MOSFET switching techniques.

Starting from direct <b>electrostatic</b> field <b>acceleration</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the black hole up to Fermi-type particle acceleration in the jet and beyond, possible efficiency constraints on the energization of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) are evaluated. When paradigmatically applied to Cen A, the following results are obtained: (i) Proton acceleration to energies of E_c = 5 × 10 ^ 19 eV and beyond remains challenging and most likely requires the operation of an additional mechanism capable of boosting energetic seed protons up by a factor of ∼ten. It is argued that shear acceleration along the large-scale jet in Cen A could be a promising candidate for this. (ii) Heavier elements, like iron nuclei, are more easily accelerated (by, e. g., shocks or direct electrostatic fields) and may not need additional boosting to reach E ≥ E_c; (iii) If Cen A indeed proves to be an UHECR source, the cosmic ray composition might thus be expected to become heavier above energies of a few times 10 ^ 19 eV.

40|$|The Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) {{diffusion}} thruster is {{an experiment}} in active development that takes advantage of physical phenomenon that occurs during operation of an IEC device. The IEC device has been proposed as a fusion reactor design that relies on traditional <b>electrostatic</b> ion <b>acceleration</b> and is typically arranged in a spherical geometry. The design incorporates two radially-symmetric spherical electrodes. Often the inner electrode utilizes a grid of wire shaped in a sphere with a radius 15 to 50 percent of the radius of the outer electrode.

When operating the IEC, an unsteady plasma leak is typically observed passing out one of the gaps in the lattice grid of the inner electrode. The IED diffusion thruster is based upon the idea that this plasma leak can be used for propulsive purposes. The IEC diffusion thruster utilizes the radial symmetry found in the IEC device. A cylindrical configuration is employed here as it will produce a dense core of plasma the length of the cylindrical grid while promoting the plasma leak to exhaust through an electromagnetic nozzle at one end of the apparatus.

Rotating electron {{clouds in}} the thruster overcome the space charge limitations of other methods. Images of the thruster startup, taken with a fast camera, reveal a bright ionization period which settles into steady state operation over 50 μs. The cathode introduces azimuthal asymmetry, which persists for about 30 μs into the ignition. Plasma thrusters are used on satellites for repositioning, orbit correction and drag compensation. The advantage of plasma thrusters over conventional chemical thrusters is that the exhaust energies are not limited by chemical energy to about an electron volt.

During quiet periods generally Maxwellian electron precipitation is observed from the central plasma sheet, which is completely contained within the sunward flow region. As substorms grow and begin to recover, a strong sunward flow appears within the high latitude ionospheric electron trough, equatorward of the central plasma sheet electron precipitation. Intense inverted-V electron structures consistent with strong <b>electrostatic</b> <b>acceleration</b> appear near the Harang discontinuity and extend poleward to the polar cap boundary.

Also, 14 C AMS might be improved by removing its dependency on negative-ionisation in a sputter ion source.
