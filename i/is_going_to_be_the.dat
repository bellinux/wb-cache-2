The review commending Burke's look in the video calling her, [...] "the gutsier, sassier alternative to the anaemic, high school warbling of, say, Kelly Clarkson or the pre-pubescent offal piped into our children by Miley Cyrus." [...] Whitehouse stated, [...] "It has pomposity, big dance routines, cars built like tanks, moody street hunks (also built like tanks), stunts, jewellery and a rapper, Flo Rida, who in honesty, could have been anyone". He went on to say, [...] "If {{we want to make}} a megastar, let the Americans do it for us. They make megastars.

This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that I think has been kind of hopping around in pop culture at the moment. But it's kind of like a fun Marvel take on that. For all those people who wished to see these characters in a different light, this <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> time for that to happen."

500|$|Stanton noted many {{commentators}} placed {{emphasis on}} the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because [...] "that disconnection <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet". Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the Axiom has separated them from nature, making them [...] "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. [...] "WALL-E is not a Luddite film," [...] he said. [...] "It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature—that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along." ...|$|E

Although they had enjoyed working on those projects, Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to [...] "something original". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the nine to 14 year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator {{on their way back}} to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, [...] "Kim Possible. She can do anything", to which Schooley responded, [...] "Ron Stoppable, he can’t", and nearly the entire premise of Kim Possible naturally unfolded thereafter. According to Schooley and McCorkle, both lead characters' names indicate that Kim Possible [...] "is going to be an arched show that is a little bit over the top, but also that the girl <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> action lead and the guy is going to be funny." [...] Conceiving all main characters themselves, Rufus and Wade were eventually created and added to the roster, but the series essentially remains about Kim [...] "who is incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world" [...] while [...] "Ron would be challenged everywhere." ...|$|E
