40|$|Abstract — Feedback {{control laws}} have been {{traditionally}} treated as periodic tasks when implemented on digital platforms. However, the growing complexity of systems calls for efficient implementations of control tasks that reduce resource utilization while keeping desired levels of performance. In this paper we drop the periodicity assumption in favour of selftriggered strategies for the execution of control laws. Such strategies determine the next execution time based on {{the current state of}} the plant. Under the self-triggered policy, the inter-execution times scale in a predictable manner: a scaling of the state of the plant entails a scaling in the inter-execution times. This property allows us to derive a simple formula for the next execution time guaranteeing performance.

40|$|Output {{feedback}} control of nonlinear systems {{is an important}} open research topic which attracts attention for both its theoretical interest and its practical applications. This thesis relies on the theory developed by Maggiore and Passino in [27] towards a separation principle for nonlinear systems. That work crucially relies on the existence and construction of a set P, enjoying special properties, separating two non-convex sets. The class of sets P we choose to work with is that of polytopes. In this thesis we develop two algorithms to accomplish the task of separating two non-convex sets. The first algorithm relies on semi-infinite programming. The second algorithm relies on orthogonal projection and outer polytopic approximation. Both algorithms are first tested on basic examples and later used to design nonlinear observers for the Moore-Greitzer three-state model of surge and stall in <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>compressors...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the output feedback control of nonlinear systems. The employment of a state-variable approach is the trait d'union which proves to be crucial for {{the understanding of the}} limitations of other approaches {{and the development of a}} new methodology. The class of systems considered throughout this work is that of incompletely observable nonlinear systems, i. e., systems for which observability is not a global property. In the SISO case, tools leading to the formulation of a separation principle are introduced. Their application to the control of stall and surge in the Moore-Greitzer model of <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>compressors</b> underlines the advantages of the proposed methodology. The approach is then extended to the stabilization of MIMO nonlinear systems affected by a class of time-varying disturbances. Finally, by introducing the concept of practical internal models, a solution to the output feedback tracking problem is devised. The idea exploits the tools introduced in other parts of the dissertation and represents a unifying framework for other existing approaches to the solution of this problem...|$|R

The platform is instrumented to allow a dynamic measurement of forces and displacements as well as high-speed imaging of the blade/seal interaction zone throughout the experiment. The experiments showed that the blade incursion speed and penetration depth in the abradable seal both affect the amplitude and frequency of blade vibration. The amount and severity of blade incursions into the abradable seal have an impact on seal wear type and intensity, which can in turn increase blade excitation...|$|E

The MBC 500 is a magnetic bearing system which includes an internal air turbine drive for a rotor that can reach a speed of ± 10, 000 RPM. In this paper, a project aiming to design and implement a speed controller for the air turbine is discussed. In order to design the speed controller, a model of the air turbine is identified using data collected in the frequency domain. Methods to overcome the difficulties encountered in system identification caused by the MATLAB μ-Analysis and Synthesis toolbox are addressed. The model obtained at a particular operating point using frequency response data is validated in the time domain. Since the system is nonlinear, a set of models has been obtained at different operating points and a nominal model is determined.

Today, they are also used in the high-pressure turbine of <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> and are gaining more interest for applications in industrial gas turbines. They minimise the clearance between the rotating blade tips and the stationary liners. Aside from being abradable, the coatings have to be mechanically stable and withstand high thermo-mechanical loadings. A typical material used in engines today is yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ). This material advantageously combines a suitable thermal conductivity with a high thermal expansion coefficient, but shows a temperature capability limited to 1200 °C in long-term applications. Typical abradable coating thicknesses are above 1 mm. With increasing coating thickness and limited cooling efficiency leading to high surface temperatures, there is a risk of premature failure. As a result, new ceramic materials have been developed with better high-temperature capability. The present work investigates an atmospheric plasma sprayed ceramic double-layer coating system composed of 7 YSZ as an intermediate layer and magnesia alumina spinel as a top layer. This double-layer system was sprayed onto disc-shaped Inconel 738 superalloy substrates, which were coated with a vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY bondcoat. The lifetime of the coating system was assessed via thermal gradient cycling testing with surface temperatures above 1400 °C. During cycling, the samples showed a typical failure mechanism with exfoliation of thin coating lamellae starting from the coating surface. This failure mechanism was not observed in thermal barrier or abradable coatings in the past. The failure mechanism was analysed and mismatch stress calculations were carried out...|$|R
