25|$|As {{a concert}} organist, he {{frequently}} performs at recitals throughout North America, Europe and the Far East. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> season, Mr. Swann performed more than 40recitals throughout North America {{and in two}} European tours, including special appearances at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, St. Paul's Cathedral in London; and Passau Cathedral in Germany. He is known for dedicating new organs, said to exceed 600 in churches, concert halls, and auditoriums during his career. Swann was chosen to dedicate the new instruments at Orchestra Hall in Chicago, Illinois, with the Chicago Symphony in 1981 and at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California, with the San Francisco Symphony, in 1984. September 9, 2003 he dedicated the largest church organ in Asia, 104 stops, 119 Ranks, 6820 Pipes, located in YounDong Presbyterian Church, Seoul, Korea. On September 30, 2004, he played the inaugural concert of the 6,125-pipe organ of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at Walt Disney Concert Hall. The following month, he performed at the largest pipe organ in the island nation of Bermuda, playing the 88-rank organ of St. Paul's Anglican Church there.|$|E

500|$|The {{mucilage}} {{produced by}} Drosera has remarkable elastic properties {{and has made}} this genus a very attractive subject in biomaterials research. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> study, the adhesive mucilages of three species (D.binata, D.capensis, and D.spatulata) were analyzed for nanofiber and nanoparticle content. [...] Using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, researchers were able to observe networks of nanofibers and nanoparticles of various sizes within the mucilage residues. In addition, calcium, magnesium, and chlorine – key components of biological salts - were identified. These nanoparticles are theorized to increase the viscosity and stickiness of the mucilage, in turn increasing {{the effectiveness of the}} trap. More importantly for biomaterials research, however, is the fact that, when dried, the mucin provides a suitable substrate for the attachment of living cells. This has important implications for tissue engineering, especially because of the elastic qualities of the adhesive. Essentially, a coating of Drosera mucilage on a surgical implant, such as a replacement hip or an organ transplant, could drastically improve the rate of recovery and decrease the potential for rejection, because living tissue can effectively attach and grow on it. The authors also suggest a wide variety of applications for Drosera mucin, including wound treatment, regenerative medicine, or enhancing synthetic adhesives. Also of note, because this mucilage can stretch to nearly a million times its original size and is readily available for use, it can be an extremely cost-efficient source of biomaterial.|$|E

Also, the authors found that [...] "Even if it were allowed that Caucasus affinities could represent Khazar ancestry, the use of the Armenians and Georgians as Khazar proxies is particularly poor, as they represent the southern part of the Caucasus region, while the Khazar Khaganate was centered in the North Caucasus and further to the north. Furthermore, among populations of the Caucasus, Armenians and Georgians are geographically the closest to the Middle East, and are therefore expected a priori to show the greatest genetic similarity to Middle Eastern populations." [...] Concerning the similarity of South Caucasus populations to Middle Eastern groups which was observed at the level of the whole genome <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> study (Yunusbayev and others, 2012). The authors found that [...] "Any genetic similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Armenians and Georgians might merely reflect a common shared Middle Eastern ancestry component, actually providing further support to a Middle Eastern origin of Ashkenazi Jews, rather than a hint for a Khazar origin". The authors claimed [...] "If one accepts the premise that similarity to Armenians and Georgians represents Khazar ancestry for Ashkenazi Jews, then by extension one must also claim that Middle Eastern Jews and many Mediterranean European and Middle Eastern populations are also Khazar descendants. This claim is clearly not valid, as the differences among the various Jewish and non-Jewish populations of Mediterranean Europe and the Middle East predate the period of the Khazars by thousands of years".|$|E
