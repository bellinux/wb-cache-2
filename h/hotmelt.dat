The heated hoses are used wherever a liquid, viscous or melted medium has to be transported {{from one place to}} another, e.g. chocolate, jelly or <b>hotmelt.</b> In most applications, the temperature of the medium needs to remain constant at a specified value irrespective of variations in ambient temperature.|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{polyurethane}} <b>hotmelts</b> have a {{wide variety}} of uses because of their favourable processing and application properties. However, the elevated temperatures required for processing these adhesives mean that monomer emissions have to be taken into consideration. These monomer emissions can be described by their material-specific emission rates (SER=mass of emitted substance [µg]/emitting area [m 2]xemission time [h]) and this is an important criterion for assessing the risks associated with these adhesives. In this work, the experimental determination of these constants for PUR <b>hotmelts</b> is carried out using a new laboratory cell whose entire surface can be heated. This minimises the undervaluation of emissions caused by irreversible adsorption effects on the cell walls. Prediction of the room air concentrations of monomeric isocyanates is not possible by simply extrapolation of the laboratory cell results. The use of statistical experimental planning allowed the key factors influencing the expected air concentrations to be determined for defined workplaces. In particular, it was found that reducing the residual monomer content of the adhesives being used reduces the risk of elevated concentrations of airborne monomeric isocyanates at the workplace...|$|R
30|$|In the {{footwear}} industry, {{the most}} important method for joining materials is adhesive bonding. In 1906 nitrocellulose adhesives were introduced, being replaced in 1949 by polychloroprene adhesives (PCP), which due to their versatility present good results in leather bonding, textiles and other materials. In 1970 the PU adhesives are then introduced in the footwear industry. Subsequently adhesives based on styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), latex, aqueous dispersions and <b>hotmelts</b> were used [4]. However, for the bonding of upper/soles, adhesives used are based on PCP and PU. This work discusses the PU solvent-based adhesives because {{they are able to}} bond various types of materials, regarding the application upper/soles [5].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{covers a}} {{recently}} completed research project in Germany aimed at {{using a new}} rapid adhesive bonding technology in wood panel construction for modular prefabricated houses, which is an increasingly popular way of building single-family houses in Central Europe. In general, the prefabricated panels are built up by planking a frame of woodensquare ribs with particleboards. Nailing or stapling has been the main joining technique so far. A new approach was established by applying an adhesive tape based on an adhesively coated metallic carrier inserted into the joint. By connecting it to an electric power supply and heating it {{within a short time}} to the melting point, the adhesive can wet the wood andcure in the compressed joint. Different thin metallic carriers made of sheets of steel, aluminum, and brass or expanded metal were used and combined with adhesives, such as polyurethane <b>hotmelts</b> (PUR), PUR adhesive dispersions, andco-polyamides. Because of the requirements for structural joining in the building industry, different European Standards, such as EN 15425 [EN 15425 : 2008, “Adhesives—One Component Polyurethane for Load Bearing Timber Structures—Classification and Performance Requirements,” CEN-CENELEC, Brussels, Belgium, 2008], and preparation according to EN 302 - 1 [EN 302 - 1 : 2013, “Adhesives for Load-Bearing Timber Structures—Test Methods—Part 1 : Determination of Longitudinal Tensile Shear Strength,” CEN-CENELEC, Brussels, Belgium, 2013], were discussed and implemented to find out whether a combination of squared timber, new tapes, and attached panel materials are sufficient ornot. In this paper, this new method and the material testing are introduced, from early screening for suitable adhesives to semi-sized panelspecimens {{in the context of the}} European Standards...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} the {{development}} of conductive and mechanically improved adhesives, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were dispersed by melt mixing into a non-reactive polyolefine based <b>hotmelt</b> adhesive. The composite materials, containing 0. 5 to 5. 0 wt% multi-walled CNTs (MWNTs), showed electrical percolation at about 0. 75 wt%. Investigations of the mechanical properties using tensile tests resulted in a significant enhancement of Young's modulus up to 372 % and nearly doubling of tensile strength at 5. 0 wt%. Even if the <b>hotmelt</b> material is highly elastic compared to typical thermoplastic matrices, the melt mixing resulted in suitable CNT dispersion. The melt viscosity increased with CNT loading, however near the observed electrical percolation threshold the processability was not notably reduced. Most important, next to conductivity at low CNT loadings, also a significant enhancement in the shear strength of bonded joints of AlMg 3 up to values of 250 % of the pure <b>hotmelt</b> could be obtained. The property profile can be tailored with CNT concentration, indicating the suitability of CNT addition into these <b>hotmelt</b> adhesives...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of thermal management, thermal interface material (TIM) plays a more and more important role in electronic packaging. This paper reports the study on fabrication of a nanofiber films used for nano-thermal interface material (nano-TIM) with the adhesive function. The nano-TIM with high thermal conductivity and low thermal resistivity has been fabricated by electrospinning process. In the present work, <b>hotmelt</b> was added into the electrospinning solution to improve the adhesion properties of the film. The morphology of the film was observed by Scanning Electrical Microscope (SEM). The nanofiber films have a nano-scale structure with <b>hotmelt</b> randomly attached into the fiber matrix. Shear tests were conducted to measure the bonding strength of nanofiber films. The {{results show that the}} nanofiber films reached a 6. 52 MPa in terms of average shear strength, more than 2 times better than the case without the <b>hotmelt</b> addition...|$|E
40|$|As the {{measuring}} equipments {{used for the}} abrasion testing of lacquers and plastics are generally not suitable for <b>hotmelt</b> coatings {{it had to be}} examined in how far the <b>hotmelt</b> coatings can be differentiated by a simple laboratory vibration test. Thereby hand-made flat bags (100 x 100 mm) with sealed seams, filled with glassy Raschig rings (20 g), were used. The bags were shaken in an eccentrically operated laboratory machine during a fixed period (0, 5 to 2 hrs.). After the transfer of the bag content into extraction shells the abrasion rate was determined and the data regarding time and surface were recorded. The investigations which had been conducted with different <b>hotmelt</b> coatings reflected correctly and sufficiently reproducible the rank of the abrasion resistance noticed in practical operation. The effort to show a relation between the abrasion characteristics and the properties of the coatings resulted {{in the fact that the}} toughness of the coating obviously is an importantcriterion which by itself, however, is not sufficient to predict the abrasion resistance of the coating...|$|E
30|$|Sealant {{materials}} like Surlyn® and Bynel® <b>hotmelt</b> foils {{are used}} in DSSCs to seal the cells [48]. Their sealing capability decreases when the pressure builds up inside the cell [51] and also if exposed within a cyclic or regular temperature variation [52]. But due to their low cost and easy processing, their utilization cannot be neglected. Thus, it is required to increase their adhesion with glass by pretreatment of the glass with metal oxide particles. As an alternative, sealants based on low melting glass frits [53] were also developed which offer more stability than the <b>hotmelt</b> foils, but these sealants are not suitable for the large area module production.|$|E

Efficiencies up to 18 % with fill factors of 79. 5 % on large area industrially pre- processed monocrystalline wafers were achieved. In order to further increase the efficiency, Voc and jsc need to be improved, by e. g. reducing the doping level of the emitter. Solar cells with an average emitter sheet resistance up to 75 Î/sq could be successfully contacted with <b>hotmelt</b> ink achieving fill factors up to 78 %. These cells clearly showed an improvement in the short circuit current density compared to solar cells with a higher doped emitter. In a further investigation the ability of fine line printing has been analyzed...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a detailed series resistance characterization of silicon solar cells with screen-printed front contacts using <b>hotmelt</b> silver paste. Applying the <b>hotmelt</b> technology energy conversion efficiencies up to 18. 0 % on monocrystalline wafers with a size of 12. 5 cut X 12. 5 cut have been achieved, an increase of 0. 3 % absolute compared to cells with conventional screen-printed contacts. This is mainly due to the reduction in the finger resistance to values as low as 14 Omega/m, which reduces the series resistance of the solar cell significantly. To retrieve the lumped series resistance as accurately as possible under the operating condition, different determination methods have been analyzed. Methods under consideration were fitting of the two-diode equation function to a dark IV-curve, integration of the area A under an IV-curve, comparison of a j(sc) -V-oc with a one-sun IV-curve, comparison of the jsc and V-oc points of a shaded curve with the one-sun IV-curve as well as comparison of a dark IV-curve with a one-sun IV-curve, and comparison of IV-curves measured at different light intensities. The performed investigations have shown that the latter four methods all resulted in reliable series resistance values...|$|E

30|$|To upscale {{the cell}} performance, silver fingers {{can be used}} to collect the current and using a sealant {{material}} like <b>hotmelt</b> tape, for the protection from the leakage of the electrolytes. Although due to the chemically aggressive nature of the electrolyte, the use of silver fingers is less feasible. And due to the small modules, the chances of leakage increase which results in reduced active cell area by 32 % [47]. Another factor is the conductivity of the glass sheet that affects the performance of the DSSCs. Therefore, the conductivity of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) can be improved by combining the indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, highly conductive but less chemically stable) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, highly chemically stable but less conductive) together. This results in the reduction of the sheet resistance of TCO glass to 1.3  Ω/sq. [50].|$|E

Inkjet structuring is a suitable technique {{for the formation of}} interdigitated structures used in back contacted silicon solar cells because it allows small feature sizes and has high alignment accuracy. Therefore all structuring steps in this EWT solar cell process are done with the help of inkjet masking. This includes the structuring of a silicon oxide passivation layer and the evaporated aluminum metallization. For all masking processes an acid-resistant inkjet <b>hotmelt</b> ink is used. An evaporated thick aluminum layer and laser-fired contacts (LFC) to contact the bulk region are introduced. Cell efficiencies above 15 % prior to a forming gas anneal are reached.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is the analyze {{the impact of}} extremely low temperatures to the bonded joint of ABS furniture edges and PB. Temperature {{is one of the}} factors with a significant influence of strength of bonded joints, which has a major impact on the selection of a suitable adhesive. It should withstand extremely low and high temperatures and therefore should has adequate properties which are related to the conditions for transport logistics. Thesis deals with the strength of the bond furniture edges, which is subjected of cyclic thermal loading. The bond strength is tested by peeling ABS edges at 90 ° and by shear loading at 45 °. The research worked with available and commonly used materials (ABS and PB) and bonded joint was connected with <b>hotmelt</b> adhesive PUR. The results were statistically processed, interpreted in the text and graphically depicted. In the final part of the thesis was the issue comprehensively evaluated and conclusions were expressed...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} determine if a quicksetting type lithographic ink printed into the bind edge of an adhesive bound product influences adhesion at the spine in a negative manner. The testing system included four (4) paper lots; two (2) coated and two (2) uncoated, five (5) ink levels; 0. 0 to 2. 2 (10 percent) solid ink density, and three (3) testing times. Two (2) methods were chosen to test variables. The first was considered a traditional, practical method of binding book blocks which included selected test units that were later pulled from the block. The second method sought to simulate the adhesive bind condition through lamination of a test unit, <b>hotmelt</b> and an internally strong base paper. Although a quick test of this sort would be valuable from a production quality control viewpoint, further experimentation and analysis indentified this configuration as not being a valid predictor for the pagepull test, at this time. Based upon the results gathered from this investigation using a pagepull technique, the statement tying a quicksetting type lithographic ink to a loss of adhesion at the spine of an adhesive bound product can not be supported...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheology}} {{of a low}} viscous aerosol ink {{was modified}} into a hot melt ink by substituting the original solvent system by a thermo plastic alcohol. Additionally the aerosol printer was adapted to hot melt printing by heating all parts which are {{in contact with the}} ink, including the atomizer, virtual impactor, printing head and atomization gas. Front side contacts on silicon solar cells were printed with a metal aerosol jet printer using this <b>hotmelt</b> ink. Improved line resolution, higher aspect ratio and higher solid content compared to conventional aerosol inks could be achieved. To demonstrate the industrial feasibility, a multi-nozzle printing system was used. Line widths of 40 µm could be achieved. The aspect ratio of the fingers is increased from 1 : 40 to 1 : 6. Large-area multicrystalline silicon solar cells were, printed at room temperature at different printing speeds, fired in an in-line belt furnace and finally plated in an industrial plating machine. Energy conversion rates as high as 16. 1 % were achieved. The short-circuit current and the fill factor of these cells is around 34 mA/cm 2 and 78 %, respectively, showing the excellent contact geometry of the fabricated fingers...|$|E
40|$|International audienceProperties of {{pharmaceutical}} drug polymer mixtures like miscibility, stability and drug release {{are determined by}} the interactions of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients (e. g. plasticizers) with functional polymers. Molecular dynamics simulations (Materials Studio, compass force field) are used to predict the principal behaviour of such drug products, especially miscibility and glass transition temperature (Tg). Different mixtures containing APIs (theophylline or ibuprofen) and water soluble (triethyl citrate) or water insoluble plasticizer (acetyltributyl citrate or dibutyl sebacate) dissolved/dispersed in a cationic polymethacrylate (Eudragit® RS) were studied. Force field based calculations of the cohesive energy densities of single constituents led to a qualitative approach according to Hanson describing the solid state of the mixture while further calculations {{on the basis of the}} theory of free energy of mixing facilitated a semi quantitative prediction. In case of miscibility also calculation of Tg was possible via modelling specific volumes of amorphous cells at various temperatures. The simulated data correlated well with the experimental data obtained from differential scanning calorimetry of drug products processed via <b>hotmelt</b> extrusion. Accordingly, the described method facilitates a good estimate {{of pharmaceutical}} polymer drug mixtures thus decreasing product development time as well as the consumption of active ingredients...|$|E
40|$|Carton board {{packages}} are often closed with an adhesive. The adhesive joint thus formed has {{to meet the}} demands during the entire product life from converting to end-use. The adhesive joint has to be characterized if it is good or bad for the actual application. Today such characterization is done by manually peeling the joint, immediately after the adhesive application in the gluing machine. The manual peel test is a subjective test that is operator dependent. An operator needs long experience to be able to perform a manual peel test. Therefore, the packaging industry is interested in a test method that can objectively predict good or bad adhesive joints. The adhesive joints have been tested in the so-called Y-peel test arrangement. An advantage of the Y-peel test is that it gives an objective result from the force–elongation curve. Testing has been performed with carton boards of two different thicknesses. <b>Hotmelt</b> adhesive was used and the open time was varied in the glue applicator. It was found that the Y-peel test gives results in qualitative agreement with the manual peel test. Moreover, by evaluating the energy consumption (dissipative energy) during the Y-peel test it was possible to obtain not only a qualitative but also a quantitative assessment of the adhesive joint...|$|E
40|$|Thermal oxides are {{commonly}} used for the surface passivation of high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells and {{have led to the}} highest conversion efficiencies of mono- and multicrystalline silicon reported so far. In contrast to the laboratory fabrication of solar cell structures with lithographically defined and evaporated front contacts, in this study we combine several technologies ready for industrial implementation. On the front side, surface passivation of the lowly doped emitters up to 90 ?/sq is achieved with sputtered SiNx:H, the contact grid is created with screen-printing of a <b>hotmelt</b> silver paste, the electrical properties of the grid are improved by lightinduced silver plating. Since contact formation on the front requires a short high-temperature firing process, the rear surface passivation layer needs to be thermally stable. A wet thermal oxidation is applied on the rear and the surface recombination velocity of the fired oxide is experimentally determined to be below S <= 38 cm/s {{at the end of the}} process sequence. This includes evaporation of aluminium on the rear, the formation of laser-fired contacts and a short annealing process under air ambience.

40|$|Silicone Pressure Sensitive Adhesives (PSAs) {{have been}} used for many years in areas where typical organic PSAs have failed. One of the most {{important}} uses is in applications where large temperature extremes occur. A wide variety of silicone PSAs are available on the market today and in all cases these materials are offered at 50 - 60 % solids in an organic carrier solvent. While many organic PSAs have found alternative delivery systems (emulsion, <b>hotmelt,</b> etc.), industrial silicone PSAs have been slow to evolve with the times. Attempts {{have been made in the}} past to make solventless versions of an industrial silicone PSA without much commercial success. The PSA would have the tack and adhesion performance that was typical of a silicone PSA, but the high temperature shear performance was lacking. Recently, there have been advancements in silicone-based raw materials that have opened up the ability to formulate solventless silicone PSAs that have the tack, adhesion and high temperature shear performance of common solvent-based silicone PSAs.

40|$|Adhesively bonded {{connections}} usually outperform traditional mechanical fasteners, as forexample dowels, screws of bolts. Among {{the most}} promising bonded joints commonly used intimber engineering, glued-in rods stand out for their capacity to achieve architecturallyappealing and yet mechanically performing connections [1]. Adhesively bonded connectionsrely upon a series of requirements to achieve adequate quality and performance; among themost critical are long curing times, minimum temperatures for curing, compliance with exactmixing ratios, and, {{in the case of}} glued-in rods, ensuring the complete filling of the borehole. The Fraunhofer IFAM has developed the so-called PASA technology (Pre ApplicableStructural Adhesive). These Adhesives allow a separation of the adhesive application and theactual joining process which can be carried out at different times and at different places [2]. The example considered in this research was realized as a reactive <b>hotmelt</b> epoxy resin; it issolid and tack-free at room temperature and is applied in melted state at about 80 °C. Thesubsequent curing of the adhesive occurs at a considerably higher temperature (> 120 °C), [3]. In the research presented herein, G-FRP rods were coated with a PASA filled with metallicparticles, leading to a semi-finished product, subsequently inductively heated, and finallytested for strength. The study demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} separate the adhesiveapplication (which requires much care) from the application on site (which much lessstringent requirements), thus lowering the hurdles for practitioners to consider adhesives forstructural applications...|$|E

Both thermoplastic and duroplastic packaging processes will be described. By thermoplastic packaging the injection molding process and the <b>hotmelt</b> process will be specified. By duroplastic packaging the transfer molding process and an extra method of liquid encapsulation for non-planar surfaces / volumes will be shown. In particular for injection molding the MTTCs (Mechatronic Thermoplastic Circuit Carriers) will be regarded by demonstrators which were manufactured at the MMZ-Oberpfaffenhofen. MTTCs are injection molded thermoplastic parts with integrated circuit traces. By the 3 -dimensional combination of mechanical and electronic elements, this technology offers a huge potential in design and functionality. Because of the geometric adaption of the circuit carrier and the increasing miniaturization, {{it is possible to}} assemble smallest, reliable and cost-efficient systems. Also an overview above available thermoplastic materials for MTTCs which are appropriate for the LDS-process (Laser Direct Structuring) will be given.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the interconnection between innovations {{and the general}} competitive strategy of a transnational concern. Looking for robust and sustainable solutions, the management turns to integration approaches analyzing the whole process chain. Basic elements from the functional strategy of an enterprise are selected {{in order to enhance}} the value creating processes. A structure for forming the cost-cutting strategy by means of the Lean Production is suggested. The necessity for using Value Stream Mapping as a strategy execution tool is demonstrated. W ithin the Value Stream Design each particular process step is reconsidered with respect to wasting in order to shorten the lead time and to enhance the flow along the process chain. Process steps which do not add value the customer’s needs are modified or eliminated. A new “road map” of the process is drawn pointing out future activities of the enterprise to be implemented. Practical significance of the devised approach to forming and realizing the cost-cutting strategy is indicated. During realization of the cost-cutting strategy at the enterprise a set of recommendations was formulated, advising the use of equipment with flexible readjustment. This equipment was also recommended for use on various stages of the production process. For example, installation of multipurpose <b>hotmelt</b> lamination device and integrating folding unit for the table cover drape prior to set assembly reduced the wasting by 3. 7 days within the overall process time. Implementation of the organizational innovations that we have formulated lead to the improvements in the material and information flows within the Lean Production Concept at the enterprise.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{adhesive}} bonds {{are more and}} more used in structural joints where mechanical performance is crucial. Currently, many different material types are combined in a sole product. Especially in applications where lightweight materials are used, adhesive bonded joints can offer distinct advantages over traditional joining techniques like welding, bolting and riveting. The possibility to join different material types and the ability to smoothen structural stress concentrations are very attractive from a mechanical-elastic point of view. A lot of research work has already been carried out in the field of adhesives. However, much of the documented work mainly focuses on the more fundamental physical-chemical properties of the different adhesive types, the substrate adhesion and theoretical models that describe the viscoelastic behaviour of adhesives. There are not many publications that discuss application driven research on elastic properties of adhesive joints, certainly not in the area of structural dynamics. There is a high number of environmental parameters that influence the elastic behaviour of an adhesive joint. Therefore, also the vibration behaviour of adhesively bonded structures is a process that is subjected to many uncertainties. This paper focusses on the joining of glass fibre reinforced polypropylene honeycomb sandwich panels by means of a <b>hotmelt</b> adhesive bond. The simple case of lap-joining two rectangular panels is considered. A first part discusses the adhesive type and bonding application. It thereby focusses on the estimation of elastic properties of the bonded zone. The second part estimates the impact of the uncertainty on bonding parameters on the resonant behaviour of the two joined honeycomb panels. As reference data, experimentally determined resonance frequencies and mode shapes under free boundary conditions are used. This part fully discusses how finite element modelling is used to estimate the bonding layer’s shear modulus. The third part discusses the influence of vibration frequency, temperature and amplitude on the bonding layer’s complex shear modulus. Various validation experiments are considered.

40|$|During stock {{preparation}} from waste paper recycling some polymeric substances will {{be separated from}} raw materials. Treatment temperature, shear and pH of the process enhance the tackiness of the polymeric materials and form the “stickies” problems. Furthermore, more closure of the white water system lead to heavier stickies problems. As different materials, additives and operation sequence in the paper mills are adopted, the stickies problems are also varied in sloving difficulty. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the compositions of stickies in three paper mills of Taiwan, and to determine the possible sources of stickies. In addition to control stickies problems by adding cationic polymeric electrolyte to pulp slurry and fixing the stickies particle onto fibers. Stickies were analyzed by FTIR and Py-GC/MS and comparison were made among the possible sources and stickies. Stickies control was made on addition of cationic polymeric fixing agents to pulp slurry. Amounts of stickies from resulting white water filtrate were determined by extracting with dichloromethane. And two filtrates from treated white water were compared on cationic demand and particle size. The sources of stickies from A mill were shown to be a mixture of polyacrylates, <b>hotmelt</b> and plastics etc., and the sources of stickies from B and C mills were shown to be a mixture of SBR, EVA, polyacrylates, <b>hotmelt</b> and plastics etc. The results of the control of stickies formation were improved by adding cationic polymeric fixing agents. The DCM extracts of white water reduced 30 - 50 ％ on addition of 1400 ppm HM Polymin and PL 1310. The cationic demand reduced 40 - 45 ％ on addition of 1400 ppm PC 1279, HM Polymin and ATC 4150. The particle size reduced 25 - 45 ％ on addition of 600 ppm fixing agents. 由於廢紙再生備漿時，加工或應用時各種高分子物質如膠合劑及黏著劑等的脫離，以及在備漿製程中溫度、剪力及 pH 值等作用因子導致這些高分子物質在系統中黏性的增加或粒子變大，而黏著造紙設備或殘留於產品中，產生黏著物(Stickies) 的問題。又由於環保及降低成本等因素的考量，製程中的白水不斷重複回收利用，因而使黏著物的問題更趨嚴重。更由於不同的原料、不同製程添加物以及製程讓多數紙廠產生不同類型的黏著物障礙，而增加其解決的困難度。本文研究的目的為了解以廢紙作為原料的三家台灣紙廠中其黏著物的組成成分，並推估其可能來源，並希望藉由在漿料中添加凝集劑(Fixing agent) 以降低黏著物的問題。 試驗部分主要分成兩大部分：(1) 黏著物的定性分析及(2) 以高分子凝集劑進行控制。分析部分以傅利葉紅外光光譜測定儀(Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy；FTIR) 及熱裂解氣相質譜層析儀(Pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry；Py-GC/MS) 鑑別並判定黏著物的成分及可能來源。黏著物的控制試驗則是添加陽離子性凝集劑於 C 廠頭箱的漿料中，比較處理前後其二氯甲烷萃取物含量的變化，並利用不同孔徑過濾，比較不同粒徑的黏著物在處理前後其陽離子需求量及粒子大小的變化。 FTIR 及 Py-GC/MS 分析結果發現 A 廠的烘缸上黏著物主要來源經判定為丙烯酸酯類感壓膠及熱熔膠或塑膠等。 B 廠及 C 廠的烘缸上黏著物主要來源則可能為 SBR、EVA、丙烯酸酯類感壓膠及熱熔膠或塑膠等。凝集劑控制試驗部分結果為以凝集劑處理後白水中的黏著物，各項性質皆可獲得改善的效果。如以 HM Polymin 及 PL 1310 最高添加劑量 1400 ppm 的凝集劑處理後可減少黏著物萃取物 30 ~ 50 ％。以最高添加劑量的 PC 1279 、HM Polymin 及 ATC 4150 處理後可降低陽離子需求量 40 ~ 45 ％。而以最低添加劑量 600 ppm 的凝集劑處理後可使黏著物粒子變小 25 ~ 45 ％。摘要………………………………………………………………………………………i Abstract…………………………………………………………………………………. ii 目次……………………………………………………………………………………. iii 表目次…………………………………………………………………………………viii 圖目次. ………………………………………………………………………………… xi 壹、前言………………………………………………………………………………… 1 貳、前人研究…………………………………………………………………………… 2 一、廢紙再生的現況……………………………………………………………… [...] 2 二、黏著物的形成及影響形成的因子…………………………………………… [...] 3 三、黏著物的鑑定方法…………………………………………………………… 5 （一）黏著物的定性…………………………………………………………… 5 （二）黏著物的定量…………………………………………………………… 7 （三）其他常見的相關測試方法……………………………………………… 10 四、黏著物的成分及特性…………………………………………………………. 10 （一）製程中之汙染物………………………………………………………… 10 （二）最有害之黏著物………………………………………………………… 12 （三）黏著物的特性及危害…………………………………………………… 13 五、黏著物控制對策…………………………………………………………… 15 參、試驗材料與試驗方法…………………………………………………………… 21 一、黏著物的可能來源物質之定性分析……………………………………… 21 （一）試驗材料……………………………………………………………… 21 1. 膠合劑標準品……………………………………………………… 21 2. 其他可能進入廢紙回收系統之常見可能造成黏著物的來源… 21 （二）試驗方法…………………………………………………………… [...] 22 1. 傅利葉紅外光光譜測定(Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy；FTIR) …………………………………………………………… 22 2. 衰減式全反射傅里葉轉換紅外線光譜(Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared；ATR-FTIR) ………………………… 22 3. 熱裂解氣相質譜層析儀(Pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry；Py-GC/MS) ……………………………………… 22 二、紙廠中黏著物的定性分析………………………………………………… [...] 23 （一）試驗材料………………………………………………………………. 23 1. 造紙廠中的黏著物………………………………………………… 23 （二）試驗方法……………………………………………………………… 23 1. 萃取………………………………………………………………… 23 2. 灰分………………………………………………………………… 23 3. 傅利葉紅外光光譜測定(Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy；FTIR) ……………………………………………………………… 23 4. 衰減式全反射傅里葉轉換紅外線光譜(Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared；ATR-FTIR) …………………………. 24 5. 熱裂解氣相質譜層析儀(Pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry；Py-GC/MS) ……………………………………… 24 三、紙廠頭箱漿料中的黏著物定量及控制試驗……………………………… 24 （一）試驗材料………………………………………………………………. 25 1. 工廠試驗用漿料…………………………………………………… 25 2. 定量試驗用所添加之凝集劑……………………………………… 25 （二）試驗方法……………………………………………………………… 26 1. 漿料濾液中黏著物的定量………………………………………… 26 2. 陽離子需求量……………………………………………………… 27 3. 粒徑分析………………………………………………………… [...] . 27 肆、結果與討論……………………………………………………………………… 28 一、黏著物的可能來源物質之定性分析………………………………………… 28 （一）膠合劑標準品………………………………………………………… 28 1. 苯乙烯丁二烯乳膠(Styrene butadiene rubber；SBR) …………… 28 (1) SBR的FTIR光譜圖……………………………………………… 28 (2) SBR的Py-GC/MS圖譜………………………………………… 29 2. 聚乙烯醇(Polyvinyl alcohol，PVA) ……………………………… 31 (1) PVA 的 ATR-FTIR 光譜圖…………………………………… 31 (2) PVA 的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜……………………………………… 31 3. 乙烯醋酸乙烯酯(Ethylene vinyl acetate，EVA) …………………… 33 (1) EVA 的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………………… 33 (2) EVA 的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜………………………………………. 34 4. 聚異丁烯(Polyisobutene) ………………………………………… 36 (1) 聚異丁烯的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………………. 36 (2) 聚異丁烯的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜………………………………… 36 5. 熱熔膠……………………………………………………………… 39 (1) 熱熔膠的 ATR-FTIR 光譜圖…………………………………… 39 (2) 熱熔膠的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜……………………………………. 39 6. 聚醋酸乙烯酯(Polyvinyl acetate，PVAc) ………………………. 42 (1) PVAc 的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………………… 42 (2) PVAc的Py-GC/MS圖譜………………………………………… 42 7. 環氧丙烯酸酯(Epoxyacrylate) …………………………………… 44 (1) 環氧丙烯酸酯的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………… 44 (2) 環氧丙烯酸酯的Py-GC/MS 圖譜……………………………… 44 （二) 其他可能進入廢紙回收系統之常見可能造成黏著物的來源……… 46 1.

40|$|Protective {{coatings}} {{are used}} for external and internal corrosion protection of gas/oil storage, transmission and distribution. The key factors for corrosion protection are adhesion of the coating to the steel surface, and resistance of the coating to permeation of water, oxygen and/or ions. External three layer polyethylene/hotmelt/Fusion Bonded Epoxy (FBE) coating is being used for corrosion protection of gas/oil pipelines buried under soil. FBE, being {{in direct contact with}} steel surface, has immense bearing on corrosion protection and hence service lifetime of the pipeline. The corrosion protection properties of the two FBE materials have been assessed on the basis of inherent chlorine contamination, reaction kinetics, dimensional stability after cure, water absorption etc. Analytical techniques such as Thermal Analysis (TA), surface characterization techniques like Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOFSIMS) and electrochemical techniques like Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) have proved to be extremely helpful not only for performance evaluation of coating materials but characterization of the coating-substrate interface as well. ToFSIMS has been extremely useful in elucidating the detrimental effect of contamination such as oil, grease, fats etc at the FBE–substrate interface on the coating disbondment. The characterization of the interface has helped to predict service lifetime of a 3 LPE coating. Our analytical results have been validated by field tests. The most important factor influencing the service lifetime of a coating is the steel surface preparation by minimizing residual contamination. Clean interface should contribute towards alleviating the need for Cathodic Protection (CP) application and hence reducing maintenance costs. The ionic chlorine contamination {{is one of the most}} important critical interfacial characteristics of epoxy coating adhesion on steel surfaces. Incomplete crosslinking of the resin has turned out to be one of the contributory factors towards coating disbondment on steel pipeline buried under irrigated pathways. The strength of coating adhesion has been found out to be damaged by molecular moisture which diffused from the soil and surrounding atmosphere through the free volume in polyethylene and <b>hotmelt.</b> Quality of wash water for steel substrate turned out to be one of the characteristics for better performance of epoxy coatings on steel substrates. Furthermore the results confirmed that special attention must be accorded to periodic removal of settled water from fuel storage tanks at regular interval...|$|E
40|$|Adhesive bookbinding, {{a method}} of holding trimmed pages {{together}} in a book using <b>hotmelt</b> glue, offers rapid binding and curing time, but has the disadvantage of poor glue penetration into the paper edges. A weak binding will result unless good linkage can be made between paper and glue, which is the objective of spine-roughening treatments. Eight spine-roughening treatments from three manufacturers were compared on an uncoated and a coated paper stock, against a control treatment of trimmed paper. Treatments were studied by light- and scanning electron microscopic examination of paper edges and by measurement of the mean page-pull values based on samples of 30 or more page-pulls. The results were compared with four hypotheses concerning bookbinding strength. First, when 95 percent confidence intervals were compared, different spine-roughening treatments were found to produce different bookbinding strengths, as measured by mean page-pull value. Specifically, {{almost all of the}} treatments produced higher page-pull values than the control, showing that these roughening treatments increased book strength. Some treatments produced significantly higher page-pull values than others, indicating that some roughening treatments were better than others for binding the two papers studied. The results of these tests are summarized in the table {{at the top of the}} next page. Secondly, comparing mean page-pull values ranked on the uncoated stock with those of the coated stock, the relatively low correlation of 0. 66 indicated that a spine-roughening treatment appropriate for one kind of paper may not be suitable for another kind of paper. One treatment produced the highest page-pull value on both papers, however, indicating that its edge geometry produced a strong bond in both papers studied. Table of Spine-Roughening Treatments with Page-Pull Values and Duncan Groupings. Ranked by Uncoated Paper: (Treatment, Mean Page-Pull Value, Duncan 1 Groupings) : ((Control) # 1, 2. 12 lb/in, F), (# 48, 2. 36, F E), (# 2, 2. 62, D E), (# 16, 2. 88, D C), (# 24, 3. 14, B C), (# 20, 3. 26, B), (# 3, 3. 34, B), (# 30, 3. 42, B), (# 10 3. 74 A). Ranked by Coated Paper: (Treatment, Mean Page-Pull Value, Duncan 1 Groupings) : ((Control) # 1, 0. 74, E), (# 2, 0. 78, E), (# 30, 0. 95, D), (# 48, 1. 09, D C), (# 3, 1. 16, C), (# 20, 1. 20, C), (# 16, 1. 36, B), (# 24, 1. 43, B), (# 10, 1. 61, A). 1 Duncan groupings indicate means which are not significantly different. Thirdly, two page-pull testers commonly used to measure page pull were compared using the Mandrell Sensitivity Analysis, which considers sensitivity to the measured attribute along with consistency of measurement. The Martini Tester was shown to be approximately 1. 5 times, or barely significantly, more sensitive than the Moffett Tester. Fourthly, three spine-roughening treatments were compared for book strength vs. production speed. Some treatments-those in which the edge-weakening effect of pattern undercutting was apparent produced higher page-pull values as production speed increase...|$|E
