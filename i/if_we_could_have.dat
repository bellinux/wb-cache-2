500|$|The band {{spent the}} {{remainder}} {{of the year in the}} studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as [...] "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" [...] in January 1986. [...] "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because I think <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E
500|$|Despite the M2B's lack {{of success}} Herd said of the team, [...] "Everyone was ten times more {{determined}} to do better the following year." [...] On {{the design of the}} car he reflected that, [...] "our emphasis tended to be more on the elegance of the chassis structure rather than on the design of a really quick racing car" [...] and that, [...] "we ... tended to go towards technical ingenuity and bullshit rather than racewinning engineering". Team member and later manager of the organisation Teddy Mayer said, [...] "Our main problems were with the choice of the Ford engine." [...] Bruce McLaren's personal secretary and author Eoin Young concurs. The winners of the 1966 drivers' and constructors' championships, Jack Brabham and his eponymous team, used a Repco-modified and badged Oldsmobile engine. It produced approximately 290bhp – less than the Ford – but its light weight and reliability rendered it effective. Despite having used the Oldsmobile in sports racing cars, the McLaren team discounted it. Afterwards, Mayer said, [...] "We considered it, but the kind of modifications which Repco did were well beyond our resources, and I doubt very much <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done any more with it than we did with the Indy Ford." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winning captain Dhoni {{said that}} {{playing in the}} IPL just after the World Cup was tough and added that the fans were also [...] "emotionally drained" [...] after the India's win at the World Cup. Opposing captain Daniel Vettori, who conceded that they were already on the back foot after letting Chennai score 205, said [...] "Would have been a much better game <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> put up a bowling {{performance}} like yesterday, {{but it was not}} to be. I think 200-plus was tough for us; 160–170 would have been chaseable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Decoud, exchanging {{a steady}} stare with Mrs. Gould, added, tentatively, as it were, [...] "And yet, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been done." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{still the}} King hung back and was afraid. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> had him there to back {{us with his}} authority! Bedford had lost heart and decided to waive {{resistance}} and go an concentrate his strength in the best and loyalest province remaining to him--Normandy. Ah, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> persuaded the King to come and countenance us with his presence and approval at this supreme moment! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgotten most wretchedly, and it's {{an immense}} inconvenience. It has only just {{been found that}} it didn't get there; so that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{immediately}} <b>have</b> it--" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{location}} {{was chosen to}} cater to the medical needs of Doyle's wife Louise, nicknamed 'Touie', who suffered from tuberculosis; doctors of the era recommended healthy air, for which Surrey was known. [...] Writing to his mother Mary in May 1895, Doyle lauded the building site because [...] "... its height, its dryness, its sandy soil, its fir trees, and its shelter from all bitter winds present the conditions which all agree to be best {{in the treatment of}} phthisis. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> ordered Nature to construct a spot for us we could not have hit upon anything more perfect. ... I have bought 4 acres under £1000 and I don't think it will prove to be a bad investment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We found a heavy drag on {{the center}} that {{flattened}} the curve. Of course, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> pushed it up farther, we'd have got a stronger form." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it does," [...] said Clara, sadly; [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> it hot {{for them}} when they come for it, wouldn't that be better?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How wicked I was to {{wish that}} {{something}} dramatic would happen!" [...] she thought. [...] "Oh, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> those dear, monotonous, pleasant days back again! I would never, never grumble about them again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, it {{will break}} {{my heart to}} think that I cannot keep you from this. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> managed {{for a year or}} two I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> earned more then; but to think of you--you in the workhouse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, that is true, and I {{know that}} even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got at them the first day, taken them ashore and buried them, {{it would have been}} an {{unpleasant}} business.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you don't}} speak English yet?" [...] Hunting Dog again shook his head. [...] "That is a pity," [...] Tom went on; [...] "it {{would have been}} jolly <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> talked together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you {{not hear}} him call the guards?" [...] he moaned. [...] "Ah, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> but intercepted him! Then {{there might have}} been hope; but, alas, he was too quick for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{am quite}} sure," [...] he continued, [...] "that {{it would have}} afforded as much {{satisfaction}} to you as it would to my dear wife and me, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> had our sedate friend, Big Otter--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you are one}} of us. Of {{course we}} cannot shake you off. <b>We</b> would not <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> all been very unhappy because,--because of what has happened. But don't you think you ought to make some {{sacrifice}} to us,--to our father, I mean, and to Sir Alured and Lady Wharton? When you go on weeping, other people have to weep too. I have an idea that people ought to be happy if it be only for the sake of their neighbours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was right}} about the gold," [...] Monty faltered. [...] "It's there for the picking up. <b>If</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got back <b>we</b> were rich for life. If you escape--you need never do another stroke of work as long as you live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, and {{it would}} be well for us all <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> our legs {{stretched}} out and go with our heads two or three bracci foremost! It's ill standing upright with hunger to prop you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{be afraid}} of hurtin' me, aunt Dorcas. I can stand a good deal more'n that without yippin'. I'd been willin' to got it twice as bad, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> held on to that duffer." ...|$|E
6000|$|BEFORE {{another word}} had been {{exchanged}} between us, Lucilla entered the room. We {{looked at each}} other. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> spoken at that moment, I believe we should both have said, [...] "Thank God, she is blind!" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the intent}} of the Satire is pointed at the vanity of those who talk of their antiquity, and value {{themselves}} upon their pedigree, their ancient families, and being true-born; whereas 'tis impossible we should be true-born: and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> should <b>have</b> lost by the bargain.|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> lived more outside, {{the life}} {{might have been}} {{pleasant}} enough, but the weather rendered it impossible, six days out of the seven, {{for us to do}} more than look out of the window and feel thankful that we had a roof over our heads.|$|R
6000|$|... "How much {{we would}} {{both of us}} avoid <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> another chance!" [...] said Lady Laura. [...] "If I could only be as I was before I persuaded myself to marry a man whom I never loved, what a paradise the earth would be to me! With me all regrets are too late." ...|$|R
60|$|Our coming {{was in a}} way well timed. I doubt <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{stayed the}} {{execution}} of Saint-Eustache's warrant even had we arrived earlier. But for effect--to produce a striking coup de theatre--we could not have come more opportunely.|$|E
6000|$|... "What right {{had they}} {{to marry her}} up to him?" [...] said Claude. [...] "I don't blame poor January. I suppose none of us, gentlemen, would have refused such a pretty toy, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> afforded it as he could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said she, [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{discovered}} a good while ago {{some sort of}} ray by which we could see into each other's souls, we should have gained a great many hours which are now lost." ...|$|E
60|$|June 17th.--At eleven, at {{this season}} (and {{how much longer}} I know not), {{there is still a}} twilight. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> such dry, deliciously warm evenings as we used to have in our own land, what {{enjoyment}} there might be in these interminable twilights! But here we close the window-shutters, and make ourselves cosey by a coal-fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, daddy, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> just <b>have</b> an orchard!" [...] she {{had been}} wont to say wistfully, when other farmhouses in White Sands were smothered whitely in apple bloom. And when she had gone away, and her father had nothing {{to look forward to}} save her return, he was {{determined}} she should find an orchard when she came back.|$|R
60|$|Let me put my {{conception}} of the Socialist world {{to a number of}} typical readers, as it were, so that they may see clearly just what difference in circumstances there would be for them <b>if</b> <b>we</b> Socialists <b>could</b> <b>have</b> our way now. Let me suppose them as far as possible exactly what they are now save for these differences.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alfred, of course,' {{said the}} Doctor. 'Nothing would serve you {{but you must}} be called Alfred's wife; so we called you Alfred's wife; and you liked it better, I believe (odd as it seems now), than being called a Duchess, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> made you one.' ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately I was {{thoughtful}} {{enough to}} build the concern with one end resting {{on the top of}} the rail. Had I not done so it is doubtful <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got the raft over the side. When completed it was all of twelve feet square.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a very}} {{delicate}} matter to postpone the draft in one State, because of the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases, we could act upon it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{they were}} {{completely}} {{exhausted by the}} time they got into that ravine. I don't think they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> gone much farther; they dropped off to sleep the instant we lighted the fire, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> done so I fancy they would never have woke again. The women bore up bravely as long as they had strength to struggle on. They literally went on until they dropped.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{people die}} on Mondays and Saturdays?" [...] said the colporteur, for such he was. [...] "It {{would be a}} bad job <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> the Bible on Sundays. God's Word says, `To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.' `Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.' `Now is the {{accepted}} time, now is the day of salvation.' It says the same on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and {{every day of the}} week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How?" [...] {{repeated}} Stacy impatiently. [...] "You {{know what}} Barker said? Van Loo, either through stupidity, fright, or {{the wish to}} get the lowest prices, {{was too late to}} buy up the market. <b>If</b> he had, <b>we</b> might have openly declared the forgery, and if it was known that he or his friends had profited by it, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> proven his actual complicity, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> at least <b>have</b> made it too hot for him in California. But," [...] said Stacy, looking intently at his friend, [...] "do you know how the case stands now?" ...|$|R
