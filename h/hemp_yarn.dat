40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} major environmental impacts {{associated with the}} production of <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> using Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). A reference scenario of traditional hemp warm water retting was compared to: (1) bio-retting, i. e. hemp green scutching followed by water retting, (2) babyhemp, based on stand retting of pre-mature hemp, (3) dew retting of flax. overall, neither of the alternative scenarios was unambiguously better than the reference. The impacts of the hemp reference scenario and the flax scenario were similar, except for pesticide use (higher for flax) and water use during processing (higher for hemp). Bioretting had higher impacts than the reference scenario for climate change and energy use, due to higher energy input in fibre processing. Babyhemp had higher impacts than the reference scenario for eutrophication, land occupation and pesticide use.

40|$|The {{increase}} of production of woven structures from natural fibres for reinforced composites can be noticed in different sectors of economy. This {{can be explained by}} limited sources of raw materials and different environmental issues, as well as European Union guidelines for car manufacture [4]. This research produced 2 D textile structures of <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> and polypropylene yarn and tested the impact of added glass fibre yarn on the mechanical properties of the woven structures and the composites produced from them. The woven structures were manufactured using hand looms or industrial looms (CТБ- 175) using one layer technique. The mechanical testing of the reinforcements showed that the parameters of the looms had significant impact on the properties of the reinforcements. However, the desired improvement of strength by adding glass fibre to the fabric was not achieved. The one, two, three and four layer composites were produced in a hydraulic press using reinforcements woven from <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> and polypropylene yarn. The mechanical testing of composites showed that the tensile strength of the composites and the tensile stress at maximum load depends on number of the reinforcement layers, but the tensile extension of the composites and the modulus of elasticity are not closely related to the number of reinforcement layers, but rather on elasticity of yarn used in weaving. Swelling of composites in water was detected...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years the media have {{highlighted}} the damage {{of the ozone layer}} and the resulting increase of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the earth’s surface. Prolonged and repeated, both occupational and recreational, sun exposure of the population causes some detrimental effects. Clothing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important tools for UV protection. It is generally accepted that synthetic fibres provide a high UV protection capability of textiles, while cellulose fibres (cotton, linen, hemp, viscose) have a low UV absorption capacity. However, natural pigments, pectin and waxes in natural cellulose fibers, and lignin in hemp fibers, act as UV absorbers having a favorable effect on UPF of grey-state fabrics. Bearing in mind the trend of reintroduction of hemp fibers as a source of eco-friendly textiles, there is a serious lack of study about the potential of hemp materials in terms of UV protection. Folded yarn is a complex yarn composed of two or more component yarns arranged parallel and twisted together to make a “new quality” yarn. Folding of yarns is an operation undertaken in order to modify single-yarn properties to an appreciable degree. There are very few investigations concerning the relationship between the yarn properties and UV protection effectiveness of the fabric made there from. In addition, there is no any result in the scientific literature about the influence of yarn folding on UV protection properties of textile materials. Having this in mind, for our research the idea was to evaluate the effect of yarn folding in this regard. The plain knitted fabrics composed of single or two-folded <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> were compared in terms of UV protection properties. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as the quantitative measurement of the material effectiveness to protect the human skin against UVR, was determined for the textile materials by in vitro test method according to the European standard EN 13758. The knitted fabrics construction and physical properties were also determined. Bearing in mind that plain knitted fabrics are particularly susceptible to relaxation, they were subjected to relaxation and shrinkage by wetting process, and testing procedure was repeated on the water-treated samples. The results obtained indicated that the folding operation influences UV protection properties of knitted fabrics through an influence on a loop configuration, i. e. the fabric openness. Relaxation and shrinkage of the knitted fabrics due to wet relaxation caused the reduction of macro-porosity increasing the UPF of the knitted fabrics. Although the knitted fabric produced from single <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> was characterized by higher UPF, the UVR transmittance of the folded <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> knitted fabric after wet relaxation placed it in the “excellent UV protection category” (according to European Standard EN 13758 - 2). This fact together with the better thermal comfort manifested itself in higher air permeability, confirmed the potential of folding operation in terms of UV protection properties of textile materials...|$|E

Composites fabricated from recycled hemp sacks were tested to determine their tensile strength properties. Compared to virgin-hemp yarn composites, recycled <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> composites are weak, with tensile strength of 39 MPa. However, addition of hemp resulted in a modulus of elasticity of 765 MPa, a 100 % improvement in the modulus of elasticity compared to the epoxy matrix (386 MPa). This study found that hemp surface treatment weakened the fiber, caused fiber loss, and reduced the fiber weight fraction, so no further processing is recommended when using long-fiber recycled hemp. According to the study, the volume fraction of the fiber is 15. 6 %, and only marginally increases tensile strength. However, it is cheap, and should not be precluded from use in composites, as there are many other synthetic-hemp fiber hybrid composites to be explored...|$|E

Therefore, higher requirements will be imposed to the physical fiber properties, fiber-matrix adhesion, and the quality assurance. To improve the properties of epoxy resins (EP) and polypropylene (PP) composites, flax and hemp fibers were modified by mercerization and MAH-PP coupling agent was used for preparing the PP composites. The effects of different mercerization parameters such as concentration of alkali (NaOH), temperature, and duration time along with tensile stress applied to the fibers on the structure and properties of hemp fibers were studied and judged via the cellulose I-II lattice conversion. It was observed that the mechanical properties of the fibers can be controlled in a broad range by using appropriate mercerization parameters. Unidirectional EP composites were manufactured by the filament winding technique; at the PP matrix material, a combination with a film-stacking technique was used.

40|$|With growing {{volumes of}} {{utilisation}} of traditional natural resources, increasing attention {{is given to}} new environmentally friendly materials. Worldwide, work is under way on obtaining new materials and upgrading {{the properties of the}} already existing ones. New material compounds are created; as a result, composite materials with higher physico-mechanical and service properties have been developed. One of such promising composite materials is plywood, which makes it possible, due to its constructive structure, to reach an enhanced mechanical strength. With increasing application of plywood in the national economy, it becomes necessary to enhance its physico-mechanical properties and to decrease the production costs. Plywood with different coats, varying their surface physical properties, is developed and introduced in production. In industry, plywood coating with different non-wood materials is widely used. An alternative for the so far used methods is the enhancement of the plywood strength with fibre materials of natural origin. The objective of the study was, using a bicomponent binder, to mutually compare the effect of the long fibres of dried hemp and <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> woven technical fabrics on the changes in the physico-mechanical properties of the plywood composite material. It is shown that, for the composite material with the hemp technical textile introduced in its matrix, bending strength index, in comparison with that for the control sample, increases by 21. 8 % and modulus of elasticity in static bending increases by 23 %. However, introducing individual hemp fibres, these strength indices are lower.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that synthetic fibres provide high UV protection capability of textile products, while cellulose fibres have low UV absorption capacity. However, textile materials made {{of synthetic fibres}} are {{not considered to be}} comfortable for wear in warm weather, whereas cellulose-based textile materials are considered to be much more comfortable to wear, especially in the summer months. For this research, the idea was to produce specially blended knitted fabrics from staple/fi lament hybrid yarns in order to provide clothing materials with eff ective UV protection properties, keeping satisfactory comfort properties as well. To obtain hybrid yarns, folding technique was used. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as a quantitative measure of the eff ectiveness of the material to protect human skin against UV radiation, was determined for the rib knitted fabrics by in vitro test method according to the European standard. The physical properties of the knitted fabrics related to their UV protection properties: bulk density, porosity and air permeability were also determined. The hybrid yarns, from which the rib knitted fabrics were produced, having always <b>hemp</b> <b>yarn</b> as a staple component, caused the differences in UV protection capability of the rib knitted fabrics through the influence of a filament spun component. The hybrid yarn aggregation within knitted fabrics also fibrestheir UPF values. Even though the pure hemp knitted fabric was marked as “UPF> 50 ” (according to European standard) due to natural pigments and lignin in hemp fibres which act as UV absorbers, most of the hemp/fi lament hybrid yarn knitted fabrics exhibited even higher UPF. Therefore, the engineering approach proposed in this research was confi rmed as an eff ective way to design clothing materials with optimal UV protection capability and other wear comfort parameters...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} {{residual}} gum exists in degummed or retted hemp fibres. Gum removal results in improvement in fibre fineness and {{the properties of the}} resultant <b>hemp</b> <b>yarns.</b> However, it is not known what correlation if any exists between the residual gum content in retted hemp fibres and the fibre fineness, described in terms of fibre width in this paper. This study examined the mean width and coefficient of variation (CV) of fibre width of seventeen chemically retted hemp samples with reference to residual gum content. The mean and CV of fibre width were obtained from an Optical fibre diameter analyser (OFDA 100). The linear regression analysis results show that the mean fibre width is directly proportional to the residual gum content. A slightly weaker linear correlation also exists between the coefficient of variation of fibre width and the residual gum content. The strong linear co-relation between the mean of fibre width and the residual gum content is a significant outcome, since testing for fibre width using the OFDA is a much simpler and quicker process than testing the residual gum content. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reinforces the OFDA findings. SEM micrographs show a flat ribbon like fibre cross-section hence the term “fibre width” is used instead of fibre diameter. Spectral differences in the untreated dry decorticated skin samples and chemically treated and subsequently carded samples indicate delignification.

40|$|In recent years, natural fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} attracting {{attention from the}} viewpoint of reducing the impact on the natural environment. Currently, the use of thermoplastic resins in composites is clearly of higher potential than the use of thermoset. There are many thermoplastic polymers derived from renewable raw materials, which are also biodegradable. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one such candidate, and it shows rather good properties that are suitable for applications that do not require long-term durability or elevated mechanical performance at higher temperatures. In order to make their possible use in many technical applications more attractive, the mechanical properties of the PLA can be enhanced by using reinforcements. Hemp fibres can be considered to be a good choice for reinforcing polymer composites, due to their high stiffness, strength, and aspect ratio. Highly ordered textile reinforcements, such as interlaced woven fabrics and unidirectional fabrics made from natural-fibre yarns, perform considerably better than random non-woven mats in natural-fibre composites. At present, the commercially available plant-fibre yarns are not intended for structural composites, but for textiles, which have entirely different demands on the yarns. Thus, work is needed to tailor-make the best plant-fibre yarn for reinforcement of composites. This also includes investigation of the possibility of combining plant-fibre yarns with the matrix polymer in fibre form into one hybrid yarn (a composite preform), and how to do it (twisting or blending). It is well known that fibres provide the highest strength and stiffness when they are continuous and aligned {{in the direction of the}} applied load. Natural fibres are naturally discontinuous and conventional spun staple yarns tend to be highly twisted, which leads to fibre misalignment and poor resin wet-out. The structured natural-fibre composites reported so far are based on twisted yarns produced by long-established conventional spinning methods, mainly ring spinning. In this paper, we report our work on improving the orientation of hemp fibres in composites by using our recent development of co-wrapped yarn structures. This novel co-wrapped yarn consists of low twist and very fine <b>hemp</b> <b>yarns</b> next to PLA filaments in the core part, which are wrapped by PLA filaments. By varying the composition of hybrid yarn, it is possible to vary the hemp fibre content from 10 to 45 wt %. An exciting recent advancement has been a new family of aligned natural-fibre reinforcements, which has overcome these issues by using low twist yarns. We also report the influence of fibre content and wrap density (number of wraps per unit length) on the properties of composites. Before compression moulding, multilayer 0 / 90 bidirectional hybrid yarn prepregs were prepared by winding the hybrid yarn around a steel rectangular frame. We investigated the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of hemp-reinforced PLA composites. Compared to neat PLA, the tensile and flexural modulus and the strength of the PLA-hemp composites were significantly higher as a result of the increased fibre content. Impact strength of the composites decreased initially up to 10 wt % fibre loading, but even higher fibre loading caused an improvement in impact strength. From the DMTA results, it is evident that incorporation of the fibres gives a considerable increase in storage modulus and a decrease in tan δ values. These results show the reinforcing effect of hemp on PLA matrix. From the general trend in the results obtained, it can be affirmed that co-wrapped hybrid yarn with lower wrapping density leads to lower mechanical properties in the composite. The study performed with DSC revealed that the glass transition temperature and the crystalline melting point of PLA were not affected significantly after reinforcement with hemp. The crystallisation temperature of the hemp-reinforced PLA composites decreased compared to pure PLA, which indicates that the hemp fibres hinder the migration and diffusion of PLA molecular chains to the surface of the nucleus in the composites. No noteworthy differences in calorimetric data from DSC for composites were observed between the hybrid yarn preforms with different wrapping density. Future work will concentrate on efforts to evaluate the biodegradability of these developing and promising composites...|$|R
