5|$|Encouraged by the Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (who {{was later}} {{appointed}} a High Court <b>Judge),</b> <b>to</b> study law, Choor Singh enrolled as an external {{student at the}} University of London, passing the matriculation examination and intermediate LL.B. examination. In 1948 he was appointed a coroner, and the following year was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. Following law studies at Gray's Inn on a government scholarship, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. He was appointed a district judge in 1960 and a judge of the Supreme Court in 1963. Especially noted for his criminal judgments, Singh was the first Singapore <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> impose the death penalty on a woman.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The <b>Judge</b> <b>to</b> his pigs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Supreme Court appointments, Harrison appointed ten <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the courts of appeals, two <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the circuit courts, and 26 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the district courts.|$|R

5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|Harlan {{died from}} spinal cancer three months later, on December 29, 1971. He was buried at the Emmanuel Church Cemetery in Weston, Connecticut. President Richard Nixon {{considered}} nominating Mildred Lillie, a California appeals court <b>judge,</b> <b>to</b> fill the vacant seat; Lillie {{would have been}} the first female nominee to the Supreme Court. However, Nixon decided against Lillie's nomination after the American Bar Association found Lillie to be unqualified. Thereafter, Nixon nominated William Rehnquist (a future Chief Justice), who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E

The second son {{was named after}} Hinde's friend Dr. John Madison, a nephew of George Madison and a {{relative}} of James Madison. The daughter Martha married Charles H.

25|$|In major competitions, {{there are}} {{additional}} officials present (in-goal touch <b>judges)</b> <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> success of kicks at goals, {{which means the}} game is not delayed waiting for touch <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> move into position <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> conversion attempts.|$|R
5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, police arrested their suspect. Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> show leniency because the suspect had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|Reagan also {{nominated}} Vaughn Walker, {{who would}} later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal <b>judge,</b> <b>to</b> the United States District Court for the Central District of California. However, the nomination stalled in the Senate, and Walker was not confirmed until he was renominated by Reagan's successor, George H.W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|The Judges of the Underworld– Featured in God of War III, King Minos, King Rhadamanthus, and King Aeacus {{were the}} judges of the dead. The statues of the trio held the Chain of Balance that {{connected}} Olympus to the Underworld. Kratos encountered the statues, who {{declared that he}} was not yet ready for the afterlife. Kratos later returned to the statues and destroyed them in order to raise the labyrinth so that Pandora could reach Pandora's Box. King Minos, who was the only <b>Judge</b> <b>to</b> speak through his statue, was voiced by Mark Moseley.|$|E

5|$|The killings {{helped to}} spur {{the passage of}} a new Maryland state law {{pertaining}} to the treatment of the mentally ill, which went into effect on October 1, 2003. The law's creation and passage were spurred in part by testimony from Logan's parents, James Logan, Sr. and Karen Logan. The law allows a <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> order a mandatory psychiatric evaluation of a person, if the person presented a threat to themselves or to others.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|While he {{is leaving}} court, Uncle Junior is {{hit in the}} head with a boom mic and falls down several steps. Tony advises him to take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, act mentally incompetent, and employ it as a ruse for not continuing the trial. Later, Eugene Pontecorvo intimidates a juror, resulting in a deadlocked jury, forcing the <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> declare a mistrial.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Kennedy {{appointed}} 21 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States Courts of Appeals, and 102 <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> the United States district courts.|$|R

5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples. Said advocated {{the establishment of a}} Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has “to sift, to <b>judge,</b> <b>to</b> criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual” man and woman.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York <b>judge)</b> <b>to</b> replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|Lad {{is accused}} of killing eight sheep owned by a neighbor. When the Master refuses to believe the accusations, they are taken to court where the neighbor's farmhand testifies that he saw Lad kill two of the sheep. The Master {{successfully}} shows the improbability of a single dog carrying off six sheep in two nights and that the two dead sheep left behind were clearly cut with a knife, not teeth. After Lad is given a 24-hour parole, the Master asks the <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> accompany him to the neighbor's house that night, where they discover that the farmhand was actually stealing the sheep, then killing one from each batch to put the blame on Lad.|$|E

5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels to}} Provo, Utah to meet Calvin Smith (Michael O'Neill), the {{prosecutor}} in a local murder case; and Didi Higgens (Sarah Koskoff), a pathologist for the County Medical Examiner's office. Smith and Higgens {{have been involved in}} the trial of former sheriff William Garry (John Finn), who has been convicted of killing his three children and wife. Garry pleaded guilty to murders, and forensic evidence has linked him to a wood-carving chisel used to commit the murders. Black has been asked to construct an offender profile for Garry, to determine whether the man is sufficiently dangerous to society for a <b>judge</b> <b>to</b> issue a death penalty. Garry himself is asking to be executed.|$|E
