5|$|Broad Channel is a {{small island}} with fewer than 3,000 residents, and as a result, it has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} least-used stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> In 1985, the station had only 224 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters (people not paying their fare) {{making it one of the}} least used stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> The station has the second-lowest ridership in the subway system as of 2015, with 91,766 annual riders, or 310 riders per weekday. In terms of annual ridership, it was only trailed by Cortlandt Street, a station that is closed to be rebuilt as a result of damage from the September 11 attacks. Overall, Broad Channel is the least used of any fully operating subway station in the city, although on weekdays it has on average 5 more riders than the Beach 105th Street station. However, it is the only transfer point between the A train and the Rockaway Park Shuttle, and some 2,700 daily riders use it in this capacity. As a result, the platforms are sometimes packed.|$|E
