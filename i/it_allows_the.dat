5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a 1997 sports {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. A simulation of The Open Championship, <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to engage in multiple forms of golf, including stroke play and fourball. The player competes at reproductions of the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews as and against famous golfers of the time. Announcer commentary is provided by actor Michael Bradshaw and Wide World of Sports host Jim McKay.|$|E
5|$|Guilty Gear X2 adds a {{new feature}} to the series: a burst gauge, which is {{fulfilled}} as the player causes or receives damage. By pressing buttons in combination, the player character jump and unleash {{a blast of}} energyâ€”a Psyche Burst. <b>It</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to break combinations and super moves {{in the middle of}} the opponent's offensive. Also, if the blast hit the adversary, the tension gauge is filled to its maximum capacity immediately.|$|E
5|$|One {{advantage}} of this camera system is that <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> game designers to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E

5|$|A {{third party}} sells an adapter that {{includes}} USB, SD, and microSD {{on a single}} unit. An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> iPad to charge through another dock connector. While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II is a {{role-playing}} video game. <b>It</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> {{player to}} control {{more than one}} character, each of whom has their own characteristics, {{and it is the}} first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members {{during the course of the}} game. The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.|$|E
50|$|The {{elongated}} orbit had {{two other}} benefits: <b>It</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft time to cool after the {{times it was}} between the hot surface of Mercury and the Sun, and also <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft to measure the effects of solar wind and the magnetic fields of the planet at various distances while still allowing close-up measurements and photographs of the surface and exosphere.|$|R

5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|In {{carbohydrate}} anabolism, simple {{organic acids}} {{can be converted}} into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate {{through a series of}} intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis. However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a {{six degrees of}} freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in that <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E
5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the Georgia Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on {{the north end of the}} Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E
5|$|The main mode {{of play in}} the Guitar Hero {{games is}} Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional {{performance}} arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across {{the rest of the}} game. Players can choose their on-stage character, their guitar of choice, and the venue in which they wish to play. In this mode, the player can earn money from his/her performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus songs, additional guitars and finishes, your characters clothing and bonus content can be unlocked. Quick Play mode is a quicker method of playing songs, as <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player to select a track and difficulty, selecting the character, venue, and guitar and guitar skin for the player based on the song chosen. After successfully completing a song, the player is given a score, a percentage of how many notes they hit and a rating from three to five stars, and two in rare cases depending on his/her final score on the song, with money being awarded in Guitar Hero World Tour.|$|E

5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the heads-up display (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, to converse with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> {{track to}} be divided up into {{a large number of}} small blocks if {{necessary}} to increase capacity.|$|E

50|$|While the RSI {{supported}} <b>the</b> Nazi Germany, <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> Italian Fascist {{movement to}} build a completely totalitarian state. During the preceding twenty years of Fascist association with the Savoy monarchy of the Kingdom of Italy, the Fascists had been restricted in some of their actions by the monarchy. The formation of <b>the</b> RSI <b>allowed</b> Mussolini to at last be the official head of an Italian state, and <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> Fascists {{to return to their}} earlier republican stances.|$|R

25|$|Implemented by {{objects that}} accept dropped objects, i.e. {{that can be}} the target of {{drag-and-drop}} operations. When implemented <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> target to specify if a dropped object will be accepted, {{and what happens to}} an object after it is dropped.|$|E
25|$|Implemented by {{objects that}} can be dragged, i.e. {{that can be}} the source of a {{drag-and-drop}} operations. When implemented <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> object to draw drag-and-drop effects, and to specify when the object is dropped, or the drag-and-drop operation is cancelled.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> general {{formulation}} of arithmetical laws (such as a + b = b + a for all a and b), {{and thus is}} the first step to a systematic exploration of the properties of the real number system.|$|E
