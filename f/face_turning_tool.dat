40|$|The analyze {{of overall}} {{force on the}} {{operating}} of <b>tool</b> <b>turn</b> machine with one <b>face</b> <b>tool</b> <b>turn</b> machine divided by three components, i. e : tangential force (Fc), radial (Fb), and axial (Ff), with comparation Fc : fb : Ff = 4 : 2 : 1. The forces which once intended are one received by tool from impulse speciment rotation between cluck and center. The tangential force (Fe) is the biggest force which is always used for a power consumption calculation in which it said as force primary cutting. These force cause face tool is buckling down vertical (bending moment). If torsion which is resulted by is that machine up and down, the effect of setting tool and angle tool is less accurate, or material will be non uniform in e 1 ´ery node materials and effects tool in vibration and break on the working production.

40|$|Duane’s {{retraction}} syndrome (DRS) type I {{is often}} associated with esotropia (ET) and <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> in those with fusion. This study was designed to delineate the quantitative relationship between the angles of eye deviation with that of <b>face</b> <b>turn.</b> Ten patients with DRS type I with ET and <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> toward the deviated eye, who had central fixation, were chosen. Esodeviation was measured by alternate prism-cover test, and the angle of <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> was measured by an orthopedic protractor in degree and then converted to prism diopter. The subtraction of eye deviation from <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> showed 2. 4 prism diopters of <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> underestimation in comparison with esodevition, which is so small that deviations of eye and face may be considered virtually equal...|$|R
40|$|This book present {{selected}} advance {{related to}} manufacturing and industrial engineering. It presents 12 technical papers written by professors, lecturers, students and associate partners of the Department of Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The issues covered {{in this book}} include application of industrial engineering in construction industry, quality engineering, total quality management and ISO/TS 16949 certification, statistical process control, control chart patterns classification, end-of-life vehicle design and development process, product disassembly analysis and disposal. Updates related to manufacturing technology covers <b>turning,</b> <b>face</b> milling, <b>tool</b> life, surface roughness, and evaluation of ground optical glass. The book concludes with a chapter on computer integrated manufacturing system. Many individuals have helped make this book a reality. We are most grateful to the chapter contributors, and all the staff {{and management of the}} Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Without their cooperation, this book would have not come to this completion. Above all, we thank Allah for granting us perseverance and strength we needed to complete this book...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Currently, most of {{the diamond}} <b>turning</b> <b>tools</b> used for {{precision}} machining are still manually manufactured, the profile accuracy of the diamond cutting edge depends on the operator’s experience and skill, so that the process need to be automated. Therefore in this research, an automated grinding system has been developed for the diamond <b>turning</b> <b>tools,</b> controlled by a vision system. The profile of the diamond <b>turning</b> <b>tools</b> is captured in real time via CCD camera. The deviation from an ideal circle is calculated and feedback to the controller, the grinding system then removes cutting edge of <b>turning</b> <b>tool</b> selectively to achieve high quality and high productivity...|$|R

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to design a set of miniature <b>turning</b> <b>tools</b> with insert. Elaboration is divided into four chapters. In the first chapter we can find research, which deals {{with the issue of}} the construction of <b>turning</b> <b>tools.</b> In the second chapter appears survey produced miniature types and their uses. The most important is the third chapter, because it deals with the main output, and the actual design of selected types of <b>turning</b> <b>tools.</b> The three of turning knives were selected, which are reviewed in the fourth chapter, both technically and economically...|$|R
