[...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|We agonised {{over the}} {{inclusion}} of [...] "Yesterday" [...] in the show. It is such a famous song, the icon of an era, but had it been heard too much? The story of {{the addition of the}} original string quartet is well known, however, few people know how limited the recording was technically, and so the case for not including it was strong, but how could we ignore such a marvellous work? We introduced it with some of Paul's guitar work from [...] "Blackbird", and hearing it now, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> right to include it. Its simplicity is so direct; it tugs at the heartstrings.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the LGBT community being left [...] "very disgruntled" [...] with the Reese and Bianca storyline, Braun said, [...] "I am sorry they were not happy, because one of my main reasons for taking this role was {{to be able to}} give a positive voice to same-sex couples." [...] Braun agreed that [...] "the issues" [...] went [...] "off-point" [...] and that she understood why it was difficult for viewers to root for the Reese and Bianca couple. She thanked the viewers who supported the pairing despite the way the romance was told. [...] "I was shocked by [...] because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not the story they wanted," [...] she said, [...] "but they were so happy to be represented on TV and on a soap." ...|$|E
2500|$|Springsteen {{originally}} wrote [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] as [...] "Love Is a Dangerous Thing" [...] in December 1981; {{this version}} was lyrically {{distinct from the}} eventual [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] except for the line [...] "Eve tempted Adam with an apple", which Springsteen {{decided to make the}} basis for a more lighthearted lyric. The first lyrics Springsteen wrote for [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] were: [...] "They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple but man I ain't going for that/ <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her pink Cadillac". The auto imagery was inspired by Elvis Presley's 1954 rendition of [...] "Baby Let's Play House" [...] in which Presley replaced the original lyric: [...] "You may get religion" [...] with: [...] "You may have a pink Cadillac", a reference to the custom painted Cadillac that was then Presley's touring vehicle.|$|E

In August 2010 she gave birth to a second son. On 3 November 2011 it was reported that she was pregnant with a third son, and she gave birth in March 2012. When she was interviewed about parenting with Tennis.com she said [...] "Being a mother is so different; it’s not that it’s quieter or faster, it’s just different. Being a mom is tough. You understand what’s good for you and the babies, while tennis is just a game. It’s fun because you have a different life when you step on the court but when the baby is sick you go crazy.

2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. About {{the timing of}} the episode's airdate with Hurricane Sandy's landfall, he said, [...] "It's very strange and somewhat sad. We wrote this script I think in June. We based it on several big 50s and 60s Nor'easters that hit the East Coast, obviously not as severe as the one that just hit. It's very eerie." [...] About Jessica Lange's performance, he said, [...] "She's never really played a drunkard in her career so her doing this big drunk monologue that has both comedy and tragedy sometimes within a single minute and I think she just killed it. I think its really brilliant and tragic and it contains my favorite line she's ever said, which is 'Charles Laughton is an enormous whoopsie.' I thought that was really quite brilliant. Jessica Lange talking about Charles Laughton is just great. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very challenging and she had a great time doing it. It was just a master class in acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|The single [...] "Cannonball" [...] {{was written}} by Sia Furler. Originally, this song wasn't meant for Michele; it was {{introduced}} to her a month after her boyfriend's death and she had an instant connection with its lyrics because they encapsulated her feelings in that moment. Michele has stated, [...] "I just felt that [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record. It just really explains where I am right now and it's been such an inspirational song for me. The minute I heard the song, I had a physical reaction to it. For me, it's been my strength. I listen to it every day. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> brought into my life for a reason. It's really been so helpful for me and I hope it's the same for other people as it's been for me." [...] Because of this, Furler gave the song to her. Furler also wrote the song [...] "Battlefield" [...] especially for Michele, and co-wrote [...] "If You Say So" [...] with her. [...] "If You Say So" [...] was confirmed to be dedicated to Cory Monteith, Michele's Glee co-star and late boyfriend, who died in July 2013.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very difficult decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel {{and the fact that we}} were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
