500|$|In his {{analysis}} of the four cases of fallen civilizations, he notes that two (Easter Island and Sumer) failed due to depletion of natural resources—"their ecologies were unable to regenerate." [...] The other two failed in their heartlands, [...] "where ecological demand was highest," [...] but left remnant populations that survived. He asks the question: [...] "Why, if civilizations so often destroy themselves, has the overall experiment of civilization done so well." [...] For the answer, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>we</b> must look to natural regeneration and human migration (Wright, 102). [...] While some ancient civilizations were depleting their ecologies and failing, others were rising. Large expanses of the planet were unsettled. The other factor, evident in both Egypt and China, was that due to abundant resources (e.g., topsoil), farming methods (ones that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles), and settlement patterns, these civilizations had greater longevity (103-104).|$|E

2500|$|The God Who Risks has {{a section}} where Sanders delineates his sources and four {{criteria}} for a successful theological proposal. [...] First, he says a theological model must agree with the major themes of Scripture. It need not agree with each and every biblical text, however. Second, it must find consonance with Christian tradition. He notes that there are multiple streams of tradition so a theological model {{is not likely to}} agree with all of them. Third, it must have conceptual intelligibility which includes logical consistency and comprehensiveness. He rejects theological ideas that are self-contradictory since they are “literally ‘nonsense’ and unintelligible.” Fourth, a good theological proposal must help one live out the Christian life by providing meaning to real-life situations. He acknowledges that these criteria do not offer a definitive way to resolve all theological differences and that theological diversity should be expected. This is why <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>we</b> need to practice dialogical virtues.|$|E
