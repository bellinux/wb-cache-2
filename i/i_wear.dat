500|$|Gaddafi {{regarded}} {{personal appearance}} as important, with Blundy and Lycett referring {{to him as}} [...] "extraordinarily vain". Gaddafi had a large wardrobe, and sometimes changed his outfit multiple times a day. He favoured either a military uniform or traditional Libyan dress, tending to eschew Western-style suits. He saw himself as a fashion icon, stating [...] "Whatever <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> becomes a fad. <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> a certain shirt and suddenly everyone is wearing it." [...] Following his ascension to power, Gaddafi moved into the Bab al-Azizia barracks, a 6-square-kilometre (2.3 sq mi) fortified compound located {{two miles from the}} centre of Tripoli. His home and office at Azizia was a bunker designed by West German engineers, while the rest of his family lived in a large two-story building. Within the compound were also two tennis courts, a soccer field, several gardens, camels, and a Bedouin tent in which he entertained guests. In the 1980s, his lifestyle was considered modest in comparison to those of many other Arab leaders.|$|E
500|$|Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter {{believes}} [...] "You Belong with Me"'s plot is [...] "confessional" [...] and regards scenarios themed {{with high}} school, while Swift [...] "is {{the girl next}} door who's had her heart broken and takes refuge in music". Lucy Davies of the BBC noted, [...] "Swift deals in the prosaic imagery of high school boys". In one verse, Swift contrasts herself with her friend's girlfriend and states, [...] "She wears high heels, <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> sneakers / She's cheer captain, I'm on the bleachers", which Davies interpreted as the song's protagonist feeling envy towards cheerleaders, in particular, the one dating her male friend. In the choruses, Swift attempts [...] "to persuade some boy to come to his senses and submit to her everygirl charms".|$|E

500|$|Bianca Castafiore is {{an opera}} singer of whom Haddock is terrified. She was first {{introduced}} in King Ottokar's Sceptre and seems to appear wherever the protagonists travel, along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner. She is comically foolish, whimsical, absent-minded, and talkative, and seems unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud. Her speciality is the Jewel Song ( [...] / Ah! My beauty past compare, [...] these jewels bright <b>I</b> <b>wear)</b> from [...] opera, Faust, which she sings at the least provocation, much to Haddock's dismay. She is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant. She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her; [...] "Haddock" [...] is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as [...] "Paddock", [...] "Stopcock", or [...] "Hopscotch", while Nestor, Haddock's butler, is confused with [...] "Chestor" [...] and [...] "Hector". Her own name means [...] "white and chaste flower": a meaning to which Professor Calculus once refers when he breeds a white rose and names it for the singer. She was based upon opera divas in general (according to Hergé's perception), Hergé's Aunt Ninie (who was known for her [...] "shrill" [...] singing of opera), and, in the post-war comics, on Maria Callas.|$|E
500|$|Sometimes Levin {{wrote about}} frivolous, even farcical matters, {{such as a}} series of mock-indignant {{articles}} about the sex-lives of mosquitoes. At other times he wrote about matters of grave moral importance, unfailingly denouncing authoritarian regimes whether of the left or the right. He observed, [...] "I am barred by the governments concerned from entering the Soviet Union and the lands of her empire {{on the one hand and}} South Africa on the other. These decrees constitute a pair of campaign medals that <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> with considerable pleasure and I have a profound suspicion of those who rebuke me for partisanship while wearing only one". He wrote regularly about the arts. Music was a recurrent theme; he was notorious for his addiction to Wagner, and other favourite composers included Schubert and Mozart. He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. He turned less regularly to the visual arts, but when he did his views were clear-cut and trenchantly expressed. He wrote of a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in 1984, [...] "Never, in all my life, not even at the exclusively Millais exhibition in 1967, have I seen so much sickening rubbish in one place at one time". His knowledge and love of literature were reflected in many of his writings; among his best-known pieces is a long paragraph about the influence of Shakespeare on everyday discourse. It begins: ...|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him better than she does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

She was frequently arrested for wearing men's clothing, and insisted on her right to wear clothing that she thought appropriate. She wrote two books that discussed women's rights and dress. She replied to criticism of her attire: [...] "I don't wear men's clothes, <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> my own clothes." ...|$|E

He said if it doesn't burn a hole through my skin, it will protect me." [...] In July 2008, Vanity Fair reported that the couple had split. However, in October 2008, the media reported they were on [...] "the road back to being together". The couple attended the wedding of Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky, but split again in March 2009.

On July 24, 2012, production was halted for ten days due to actor John Noble's treatment for a sleeping disorder in Los Angeles. According to Noble, he [...] "basically hit a wall" [...] after having struggled with insomnia and sleep apnea for years.

2500|$|The costumes of the prequel trilogy are purposefully more {{elaborate}} {{than those of}} the original trilogy. Lucas asserts that galactic society in the prequels is much more sophisticated. Commenting on the disparities between the two trilogies, Carrie Fisher mused, [...] "Harrison Ford wears the same outfit for three flicks, and I was complaining that <b>I</b> <b>wear,</b> like, six outfits. And my mother – Natalie Portman – she wears three million. She walks through a doorway and there's another outfit. It's like the Liberace of sci-fi changing of clothes." [...] Trisha Biggar reveals that originally there were only three costumes planned for Amidala in The Phantom Menace, but [...] " [...] decided that every time we saw [...] {{she was going to have}} a different costume."

[...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at.

2500|$|Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon {{thought that}} he would be drafted {{anywhere}} from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. [...] "I'm a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you." [...] Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, [...] "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn't much I could do about it. So all I did was just [...] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> No. 7." [...] The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{newspaper}} The Sun published {{a story on}} 14 October 2011 citing that the Roses had signed {{for a series of}} gigs across the UK, rumours again began to circulate. The NME reported that Alan 'Reni' Wren had responded to these rumours, contacting them with a cryptic message that read: [...] "Not before 9T will <b>I</b> <b>wear</b> the hat 4 the Roses again". On 17 October, Dynamo told The Sun that Brown had confirmed the reunion by saying that the band were [...] "ready to take the world by storm", and that Brown had sent him a text message with the words [...] "It's happening". On 18 October 2011, the Stone Roses announced at a press conference the end of a fifteen-year split. An [...] "extensive" [...] Reunion Tour of the world, starting in Warrington, for a low-key warm-up show, was scheduled. However, the main attractions of the tour were three homecoming shows at Heaton Park, Manchester, on 29–30 June and 1 July 2012 plus one show in Dublin's Phoenix Park on 5 July 2012. In a press conference interview, the members of the Stone Roses said they had plans to record a third album. 150,000 tickets for the two Heaton Park shows sold out in 14 minutes, with the band then announcing a third show at the venue to be held on 1 July 2012. They then announced a show would take place in Ireland, with Ian Brown saying [...] "After Manchester, Ireland is always next on our list". The first leg of the tour would consist of two warm-up gigs in Barcelona in early June and then shows in The Netherlands, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and France.|$|E
