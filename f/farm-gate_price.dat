40|$|While {{smallholder}} market {{participation is}} seen as a catalyst for poverty alleviation, farmers in rural areas face a number of challenges in doing so. One of the most important factors is considered transaction costs related to transportation. Our study quantifies the benefits associated with improvement of rural road infrastructure by scrutinizing <b>farm-gate</b> <b>prices</b> of beans in rural Nicaragua. We find that the longer the distance and traveling time are to major commercial centers from farming communities, the less <b>farm-gate</b> <b>prices</b> producers receive. We find that a decrease in distance and traveling time by one unit is associated with an increase in <b>farm-gate</b> <b>prices</b> by 2 - 2. 5 cents/qq. If infrastructure development can reduce travel time by 25 %, an average farm would increase its annual revenue from beans by between $ 27. 69 and $ 125. 96 (between 4 % and 18 % of annual revenue today). Given that such infrastructure development affects all farmers and all crops, our findings suggest a larger implication at the sectorial level...|$|R

40|$|Switchgrass, a warm-season {{perennial}} grass, {{native to}} the region, has received considerable interest for its potential role as a dedicated feedstock for cellulosic-based bio-fuels. This research examined the <b>farm-gate</b> <b>price</b> needed for switchgrass to provide per-acre net returns equal to those obtained from traditional crops in south central North Dakota. Future production costs for switchgrass and net returns from traditional crops were estimated for three soil productivity classes and also were developed to reflect the historical revenue and cost patterns associated with producers who are typically more or less profitable (i. e., average net return per acre) than regional averages. Prices were calculated using an annualized equivalent analysis of switchgrass production costs and net returns from traditional crops from 2008 through 2017. Switchgrass production costs ranged from just over $ 40 per ton on marginal soils to $ 34. 80 per ton on highly productive soils. Breakeven switchgrass prices across the three soil productivity classes ranged from $ 47 per ton in the low productivity soils to $ 76 per ton in the most productive soils. Production costs for low-profit producers were estimated at $ 47 per ton, compared to the regional average of $ 37. 50 per ton. Switchgrass production costs for the remaining profitability groups ranged from about $ 33. 50 per ton to about $ 36. 75 per ton. The breakeven <b>farm-gate</b> <b>price</b> for switchgrass ranged from $ 56 per ton for the two lowest profitability groups to over $ 94 per ton for the most profitable producers. A key economic criterion influencing the breakeven price for switchgrass will be the foregone net revenue from displaced traditional crops. On marginal soils, just under one-third of the breakeven price {{was derived from the}} level of foregone net returns from traditional crops; whereas, over 80 percent of the breakeven price was derived from the level of foregone net returns from traditional crops on the most productive soils. As net returns from traditional crops decreased the more that breakeven switchgrass prices approached production costs for switchgrass. Under current conditions of high input costs, escalating transportation costs, and given the increases in net returns from traditional crops, switchgrass, as a feedstock to a cellulosic ethanol plant, will be more expensive than previously estimated. switchgrass, production costs, <b>farm-gate</b> <b>price,</b> North Dakota, soil productivity, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E

This paper examines the costs of producing two bioenergy crops, switchgrass and miscanthus, in Illinois for co-firing with coal to generate electricity. A crop-productivity model, MISCANMOD, is used together with a GIS to estimate yields of miscanthus across counties in Illinois. Spatially variable yields, together with county-specific opportunity costs of land, are {{used to determine the}} spatial variability in the breakeven <b>farm-gate</b> <b>price</b> of miscanthus. Costs of transporting bioenergy crops to the nearest existing power plant are incorporated to obtain delivered costs of bioenergy. The breakeven delivered cost of miscanthus for an average yield of 35. 76 t ha? 1 in Illinois is found to be less than two-thirds of the breakeven price of switchgrass with an average yield of 9. 4 t ha? 1. There is considerable spatial variability in the breakeven <b>farm-gate</b> <b>price</b> of miscanthus, which ranges between 41 and 58 $ t? 1 across the various counties in Illinois. This together with differences in the distances miscanthus has to be shipped to the nearest power plant causes variability in the costs of using bioenergy to produce electricity. The breakeven cost of bioenergy for electricity generation ranges from 44 to 80 $ t? 1 DM and is considerably higher than the coal energy-equivalent biomass price of 20. 22 $ t? 1 DM that power plants in Illinois might be willing to pay. These findings imply a need for policies that will provide incentives for producing and using bioenergy crops based on their environmental benefits in addition to their energy content.

However, current maximum growth rates of 150 g/annum are too slow for profitable production. This study investigated whether enhanced growth rates of black bream would improve profitability and justify a genetic improvement program. A partial budget analysis was conducted for two different fish production systems; a commercial operation that incurred more operating expenses due to costs associated with farm initiation (stand-alone farm model), and an existing farm that diversified into aquaculture using the saline water resources of established farm dams (integrated farm model). Sensitivity analyses indicated that a 33 per cent increase in growth rate to at least 200 g/annum would allow either production system to return a profit at a <b>farm-gate</b> <b>price</b> of AUS$ 6 /kg whole fish, with fish survival rates of 98 per cent for the stand-alone farm, and 65 per cent for the integrated farm model.

Cashews represent 90 percent of the country’s exports and the principal source of income in rural areas.

The paper examines the pork, beef, poultry, and milk agri-food chains generally from May 2004 to June 2011. The time series of selected variables contain biweekly, monthly or annual data and, according to data availability, contain a different number of observations within the selected period. The first part of the paper is focused on a descriptive analysis of the selected agri-food chains.

Astrong relationship existed between harvest index and fruit mass (r 2 = 0. 88) in control plants, whereas the correlation with fruit TSS was poor (r 2 = 0. 11). Augmentation of assimilate supply to fruit early in fruit development (before approx. 21 days before harvest, DBH) resulted in more fruit set and increased fruit biomass, whereas augmentation after 21 DBH resulted in increased fruit TSS. Thus, fruit biomass was increased (1644 cf. 1442 g FW per fruit for control, P= 0. 02), but not TSS, on plants in which fruit set was delayed (source biomass increased, harvest index decreased from 59 % for control to 38 %). Treatment of plants with a cytokinin-based vegetative growth inhibitor at 14 DBH produced fruit with higher TSS (11. 3 cf. 10. 7 % for control). Thinning fruit to leave 1 fruit per plant 1 week before harvest increased the proportion of fruit in a population that exceeded a quality control standard of 10 % TSS from 20 to 80 %.

This will shorten the chain and occasion a lower delivered price...|$|E
40|$|The article {{addresses}} {{the reasons for}} the domination of large-scale corporate farms in the Moscow oblast of Russia and concludes that high external transaction costs are likely to be an important determining factor. Over the nine year period studied, larger farms are shown to achieve higher performance. Increasing returns to scale, however, were not significant in explaining the superior performance of the larger farms. It is hypothesised that high external transaction costs due to lack of transparency in the milk market, typical of underdeveloped markets, give the larger farms a competitive advantage. Their search costs per unit of output are relatively low and they are able therefore to achieve higher <b>farm-gate</b> <b>prices</b> for milk as a result. The results confirm the dependence of the <b>farm-gate</b> milk <b>price</b> on farm size due to the presence of high transaction costs in the market of milk, the major output of the studied farms. The high performance farms were able to grow during the study period whereas the lower performing farms had limited growth capacity. A more competitive and transparent market environment along with improved infrastructure could lower transaction costs and entry barriers and provide opportunities for smaller scale corporate farms to compete more effectively.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the spatial and intertemporal price relations of grains in Pakistan’s Punjab. The salient {{feature of the}} paper is that quantity variables such as market surplus and government release are incorporated in the price arbitrage model to quantify the effects of government interventions. Regression analysis using three-year crosssection data shows that the <b>farm-gate</b> <b>prices</b> of wheat after harvest are mostly explained by the government support price while those of Basmati paddy have more unexplained variation. This difference {{could be due to}} a difference in the price support mechanism. Investigation on intertemporal price relations shows that wholesale wheat prices regularly increase at the rate of storage costs {{in the first half of}} a food year, and that the price rise is repressed by the government release in the second half only in a normal year. ...|$|R
