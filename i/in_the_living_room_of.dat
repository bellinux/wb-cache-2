By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty sleeping. At {{the end of}} his life he was sleeping on the sofa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47Canadian dollars, about 98,000Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

West kept compositions simple in order to hear the tracks more clearly; too much bass or complexity would simply overpower the room's poor acoustics. The beats emanating from the loft space, which sometimes lasted through the night, provoked complaints from neighbors. Reports emerged that he and his then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian had moved to the loft in order for West to begin work on the album.|$|E

Woodson's The Mis-Education of the Negro: [...] " [...] adopts Woodson's thesis and makes it part of her own artistic process. Like the songs themselves, the intro/outro classroom scenes suggest a larger community working to redefine itself." [...] Along with Woodson's book, the album's title was inspired by the film and autobiographical novel The Education of Sonny Carson.|$|E

The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} examining the activities that are performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> both private and public activities can be performed. Living room serves as a stage where dwellers reflect their identity to <b>the</b> outside world. <b>In</b> this study, <b>the</b> factors that affect the use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> are defined. According to these factors, <b>the</b> group differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> has been examined. A field survey was conducted in “Angora Evleri” which is an upper income suburb in Ankara. Results indicated that the existence of the family room affected the type, number and frequency of activities that were performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> existence of the family room also affected the intentions for the interior design and the selected interior design elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> selected interior design elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> varied according to different groups of users. The results of the study indicated that the interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was related to gender, occupational status and time spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house, whereas the use of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> seemed independent of these factors.

2500|$|In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales (Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz) {{a former}} engineer, {{is unable to}} come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana (Dalal Badr) who has died of cancer. Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his {{financial}} affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray (Clinton Lee Pontes) who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired.
