But he could still bowl at speeds more than 85mph (~145–150km/hr) owing to his athletic body and a good run up speed.

25|$|She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> {{for being}} at {{the right place at}} the right time: she interviewed and photographed Mohandas K. Gandhi just a few hours before his {{assassination}} in 1948. Alfred Eisenstaedt, her friend and colleague, said one of her strengths was that there was no assignment and no picture that was unimportant to her. She also started the first photography laboratory at Life magazine.|$|E
25|$|Rayburn also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for {{dressing}} to suit his occasion. While in Washington, D.C., he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, and perfectly shined shoes. However, while {{back in his}} poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including Ronald Reagan's famous example of clearing brush when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.|$|E

25|$|Bullock {{took his}} job seriously, deputizing several {{residents}} and tackling {{the job of}} civilizing the camp. Despite (or perhaps because of) a reputation for fearlessness and an uncompromising nature, Bullock managed the task without killing anyone. Bullock had several 'run ins' with Al Swearengen, proprietor of the notorious Gem Theater, Deadwood's most notable brothel. Swearengen <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for making money from vice and shrewdly invested some of his profits in cultivating alliances with the camp's wealthy and powerful.|$|E
25|$|The two admirals were a {{contrast}} in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating and cautious. Notwithstanding their different personalities, Spruance and Halsey were close friends. In fact, Spruance <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for {{getting along with}} difficult people, including his friend Admiral Kelly Turner, the hotheaded commander of 5th Fleet's amphibious force. One exception was Admiral John Towers, a constant critic of Spruance, whom Spruance came to despise for his naked ambition.|$|E
25|$|Founder Paul Brown {{coached the}} team for its first eight seasons. One of Brown's college draft {{strategies}} was to draft players with above-average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate {{and went on to}} have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.|$|E

25|$|Lieber {{convinced}} Goodrich, the {{new governor}} and close friend, {{to create a}} Department of Conservation to unite all the various state groups that were involved in various natural causes; the department was stopped from forming by the Democratic legislature in 1917, but the new Republican one of 1919 created it. As the Conservation Commission Chairman until 1933, he saw the creation of ten state parks and five state memorials. Little state money was used; Lieber <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for inspiring private citizens to obtain money to acquire park areas that would later be turned over for state park use. Attendance at Indiana state parks rose to 623,000 in 1932, up from 33,000 in 1919. In 1934, {{despite the lack of}} people and wealth compared to other states, it was rated as one of the three best state park systems by the National Park Service.|$|E
25|$|After training, Lair was {{forwarded}} to the Kingdom of Thailand {{for his first}} assignment, arriving on 1 March 1951. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Edwin F. Stanton was {{in the throes of}} a postwar rapprochement between the two nations. Agreements between the two countries led to the beginning of the American buildup in Thailand. The aim was to help the Thais block any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for getting along with the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so congruent with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though he spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang. He trained with them, and underwent survival exercises with them. He even married a Thai socialite.|$|E

500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for that".|$|E
500|$|Standing [...] {{tall and}} {{weighing}} , Perry was small {{for a typical}} fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, but rather he was a straight-ahead runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. [...] "If you saw a hole, you take it," [...] Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. [...] "If you didn't, you kept moving until you did. You run with instinct." [...] Perry {{was known for his}} speed, which earned him the nickname [...] "The Jet". He ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds in 1947, two-tenths of a second slower than Mel Patton's then-world record of 9.3 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Peckinpah's {{intake of}} alcohol {{increased}} dramatically while making The Getaway, {{and he was}} fond of saying, [...] "I can't direct when I'm sober."

The director recalled one such incident {{on the first day of}} rehearsal in San Marcos: [...] "Steve and I had been discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed." [...] McQueen <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, [...] "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns." [...] It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up a squad car in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.|$|E

500|$|Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the {{television}} series Birds of Prey (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis {{at the hands of}} the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: [...] "She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius." [...] Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series Arrow, after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that [...] "Oracle" [...] was taken. Although, in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans she was slated to appear in the live-action Titans series for TNT. This version of the character will be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but will not yet be known as Oracle. This series has since been abanndoned ...|$|E

On May 7, 1998 Virus defeated El Oriental to win the vacant Mexican National Lightweight Championship, a title CMLL had brought back to help showcase smaller workers such as Virus. After winning the title Virus worked a storyline feud against El Oriental, centering on Virus' Mexican Lightweight title and Orientál's Districto Federatl Lightweight title. Despite several title matches neither belt changed hands {{during the course of the}} storyline. By 1999 CMLL decided that it was time to crown a new CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion as Virus was still technically the champion despite not having worked as a mini for over a year. Instead of making Virus return to the Minis division to lose the title CMLL decided to give the championship to Ultimo Dragoncito and then subsequently announce that Ultimo Dragoncito had [...] "won" [...] the title on an undisclosed day in October, 1999. In 1999 to 2000 CMLL made several tours of Japan to establish a [...] "CMLL Japan" [...] branch, Virus was one of the workers who regularly toured Japan and would capture the CMLL Japan Super Lightweight Championship on November 25, 1999. On August 6, 2000 Virus lost the CMLL Japan Super Lightweight title to Ricky Marvin and then on November 29, 2000 also lost the Mexican National Lightweight title to Ricky Marvin. Virus continued to show that while he may not have the size to be a headliner he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for helping young wrestlers improve by working with them in the ring.|$|E

2500|$|Undrafted rookie guard Erick Strickland {{averaged}} 10.6 ppg. He, {{along with}} Finley and Bradley, {{were expected to}} be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any sort of team chemistry in 1996–97, and the Mavericks finished 24–58. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997–98, despite a poor record of 20–62, Dallas <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time, as they beat the Seattle SuperSonics, New York Knicks, Indiana Pacers and Chicago Bulls.

In the same interview, Spacey said he went to Juilliard because Kilmer did. Kilmer was at that time the youngest person ever admitted to Juilliard. During Kilmer's subsequent Inside the Actors Studio interview, he said [...] "Robert Carrelli, who was our teacher, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for producing and directing.
