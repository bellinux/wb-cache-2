During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E

5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E
5|$|The Second Symphony, and Livre pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{for the purpose of}} a structural model analysis of family health of women who came to Korea for being married to Korean men. Methods: The data were collected from 260 immigrant women at multicultural centers located in C and B cities from May 10 th to 30 th, 2012. The variance analysis on the samples was conducted by using the maximum likelihood minimization function with AMOS 7. 0. The fitness was evaluated by means of the SRMR, RMSEA, CFI, and TLI with a 90 % confidence interval. Results: First, immigrant women’s self-esteem and acculturative stress were found to have significant <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> their family health. Second, their self-esteem and acculturative stress have <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> their marital adjustment. Third, their marital adjust-ment was found to have significant <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> their family health. Forth, immigrant women’s Korean language ability was found not to have significant <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> their marital adjustment and family health. Conclusion: In order to enhance the family health of immigrant women, it is necessary to develop and apply nursing program...|$|R

Thus, understanding factors affecting knowledge-sharing in group work settings is critical for group effectiveness and success. Based on organisational behaviour and information systems (IS) literatures, the present study suggests that group efficacy and group cohesion will have <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> perceived loafing. In turn, perceived loafing, group efficacy, and group cohesion are posited to have <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> a member's behavioural intention to share knowledge with other group members. The results revealed that group efficacy and group cohesion had negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> perceived loafing which, in turn, demonstrated a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> behavioural intention to share knowledge. Group efficacy and group cohesion demonstrated non-significant <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> behavioural intention. These results provide valuable implications for research and practice.

This research used a quantitative approach with a survey method. The research population was Chairmen of the study program of Universities Jakarta. The research sample was 64 Chairmen of the study program selected randomly. Data were obtained from questionnaires and, then, analyzed using descriptive statistics, path analysis and inferential statistics. These results indicate that the Leadership has a <b>direct</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Service Quality, Organizational Support has a <b>direct</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Service Quality, Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) has a <b>direct</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Service Quality, Leadership has a <b>direct</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB), Organizational Support has a <b>direct</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) and the Leadership has a <b>direct</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Organizational Support.

The final sample collected consists of 5. 793 users who use download websites. To analyze the data, conventional techniques of univariated statistics and the technique of modeling of structural equations were used. The results thus obtained have confirmed three of the six hypotheses that had been defined a priori, demonstrating that satisfaction has <b>direct</b> and positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> loyalty and trust and that perceived quality has <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> satisfaction. Three other hypotheses have been rejected, indicating that neither quality nor trust have <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> loyalty and that quality also does not directly influence trust...|$|R
