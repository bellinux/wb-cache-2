40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper focuses on the {{experimental}} pre-treatment of biomass in agricultural site using solar energy as power source and contribution of common use and efficiency solar dryer system for consumer. The main {{purpose of this}} design for solar cabinet dryer is to dry biomass via direct and indirect heating. Direct heating is the simplest method to dry biomass by exposing the biomass under direct sunlight. The solar cabinet dryer traps solar heat to increase the temperature of the drying chamber. The biomass absorbs the heat and transforms the moisture content within the biomass into water vapour and then leaves the chamber via the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>outlet.</b> This problem however can be solved by adopting indirect solar drying system. High and controllable temperatures can be achieved as a fan is used to move the air through the solar collector. This project has successfully created a solar cabinet dryer that combines both direct and indirect solar drying systems and functions to dry biomass as well as crops effectively and efficiently with minimal maintenance. Hence, it is indeed a substitution for conventional dryers which are affordable to local farmers...|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic marine {{bacterium}} Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 {{has been}} reported to produce several Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are able to inhibit the growth of Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) strains, opportunistic pathogens responsible for the infection of immune-compromised patients. However, no specific antibacterial VOCs have been identified to date. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify specific VOCs that contribute to Bcc inhibition by the Antarctic strain. When grown on defined medium containing D-gluconate and L-glutamate as carbon, nitrogen and energy sources, P. haloplanktis TAC 125 is unable to inhibit the growth of Bcc strains. However, single addition of several amino acids to the defined medium restores the P. haloplanktis TAC 125 inhibition ability. With the aim of identifying specific volatile compound/s responsible for Bcc inhibition, we set up an apparatus for VOC capture, accumulation, and storage. P. haloplanktis TAC 125 was grown in an automatic fermenter which was connected to a cooling system to condense VOCs present in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>outlet.</b> Upon addition of methionine to the growth medium, the VOC methylamine was produced by P. haloplanktis TAC 125. Methylamine was found to inhibit the growth of several Bcc strains in a dose-dependent way. Although it was reported that P. haloplanktis TAC 125 produces VOCs endowed with antimicrobial activity, this is the first demonstration that methylamine probably contributes to the anti-Bcc activity of P. haloplanktis TAC 125 VOCs...|$|E

50|$|The Save80 is a {{portable}} stove with an integral 8-liter pot (both made of stainless steel) and weighs about 4 kg. It has a nominal effective thermal power of 1.5 kW and needs 250 g of small dry wood sticks to bring 6 {{liters of water}} to the boil, which is 80% less than a traditional cooking fire. This efficiency is achieved using the 8-liter pot that is design-optimized for this stove.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between ventilation rate and occurrence of symptoms of the eyes, nose, throat, and skin as well as general symptoms such as lethargy and headache, often termed the sick building syndrome. METHODS [...] A cross sectional population based study {{was carried out in}} 399 workers from 14 mechanically ventilated office buildings without air recirculation or humidification, selected randomly from the Helsinki metropolitan area. The ventilation type and other characteristics of these buildings were recorded on a site visit and the ventilation in the rooms was assessed by measuring the airflow through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> in the room. A questionnaire directed at workers inquired about the symptoms and perceived air quality and their possible personal and environmental determinants (response rate 81 %). The outcomes were weekly work related symptoms experienced during the previous 12 months and symptom groups defined either by their anatomical location or hypothesised mechanism. RESULTS [...] In logistic regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for any symptom of interest was 3. 03 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 13 to 8. 10) in the very low ventilation category of below 5 l/s per person and 2. 24 (0. 89 to 5. 65) in the high ventilation category of over 25 l/s per person compared with the reference (15 - < 25 l/s). The ORs for ocular (1. 27, 1. 11 to 1. 46), nasal (1. 17, 1. 06 to 1. 29), skin symptoms (1. 18, 1. 05 to 1. 32), and lethargy (1. 09, 1. 00 to 1. 19) increased significantly by a unit decrease in ventilation from 25 to 0 l/s per person. CONCLUSION [...] The results suggest that outdoor air ventilation rates below the optimal (15 to 25 l/s per person) increase the risk of the symptoms of sick building syndrome with the sources of pollutants present in mechanically ventilated office buildings. The Finnish guideline value is 10 l/s per person...|$|R
40|$|Studying the {{problems}} of measuring tractor noises at the operator’s station using the drawbar test equipment at the Tractor Testing Laboratory was separated into two phases. The first of these two phases was concerned with the effect of noise being reflected from the front section of the test car and background interference due to noise generated by the test equipment. After {{it was determined that}} the noise generated by the test equipment did affect measurement of tractor noise, individual noise sources were isolated and studied which created the second phase. These sources included exhausting of compressed air, mechanical engine noise, transmission noise, and radiator cooling fan noise. Results from the test conducted to evaluate noise reflection from the front section of the test car indicated that this would not cause problems in measuring tractor noise. Studying the preliminary results indicated that noise generated by the drawbar test equipment did create excessive background interference in the octave bands above 4000 Hz. To correct this difficulty the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> used for small load adjustments was relocated from beneath the instrument cab {{to the rear of the}} test car. Relocating of this outlet solved the problem of high frequency background interference due to the fact that compressed air was muffled while traveling through flexible exhaust pipe and also the outlet was positioned a considerable distance from the operator’s station. The other sources of test equipment noise investigated were the compressed air outlet in the load unit exhaust system, radiator cooling fan, mechanical engine noise, and the load unit transmission. None of these sources caused excessive interference which would contribute to error in accurately determining tractor noise. An important fact that resulted from the studying of individual components was that a large reduction of noise at its source can be achieved but may result in little or no reduction of interference at the tractor operator’s station. Determination of the most efficient method of absorbing power with respect to generation of test equipment noise was also studied. The major cause of drawbar test equipment noise was the exhausting of compressed air from beneath the instrument cab. It was also concluded that consistent noise measurements could be obtained without regard to the background interference of campus traffic. Advisor:G. W. Steinbruegg...|$|E

40|$|If a {{building}} is heated by a heat pump, {{it is of}} high importance that the heat pump has a high coefficient of performance. An <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> heat pump extracts heat from the building’s <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> The air has a relatively high and constant temperature all year around, leading to a high seasonal coefficient of performance. This thesis examines whether it is profitable to complement an exhaust ventilation system with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> heat pump in an apartment block that already has geothermal heat pump, district heating, oil- or biofuel heated system. To determinate the profitability, a reference building in Strömstad has been used and was considered a representative of Sweden’s other apartment blocks.

However it must be added that <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> heat pumps are best suited for single-family houses since they provide relatively low energy compared to e. g. geothermal heat pumps...|$|R

Its working principle was tested on a scaled model of cooling tower and simulated in a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) package. From the guide-vanes study, optimum guide-vanes arrangement is 100 ̊, 70 ̊ and 90 ̊. The system with optimized guide-vanes arrangement produced the highest torque coefficient compared to the other configurations. The average torque coefficient of the system was increased by 24. 3 % with the introduction of diffuser and guide-vanes at optimized angles, i. e. from 0. 029 to 0. 036.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} a {{biological}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> washer on the emission of microorganisms and endotoxins was investigated. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> washer was originally developed to reduce ammonia- and odour emissions. It was a combination of a bioscrubber and a chemofilter. The washing water circulated within facility. In order to determine the effect of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> washer on the bioaerosol emission from the duck-fattening unit, the concentrations of dust, airborne aerobic bacteria, airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria, inspirable endotoxin and moulds were measured before and after the washing process. Furthermore, the concentrations of bacteria, endotoxins and moulds in the washing water and the composition of gram-negative bacterial and mould flora in the air and the washing water were determined. In all 22 cases the investigated <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> washer decreased the emission of dust, airborne aerobic bacteria and endotoxins. In some cases the concentrations of airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7 out of 22) and moulds (6 out of 22) were increased. In addition to this, the quality of the washing water had an influence on the air composition by forming a secondary aerosol. The predominant bacterial family in the air in front of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> washer were Enterobacteriaceae, whereas the air after the washer contained mainly Pseudomonadaceae. In order to express the quantitative effect of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> washer a reduction factor was applied. In average the dust concentration was reduced by a factor of 3. 0, the aerobic bacteria by a factor of 6. 1 and the endotoxin concentration by a factor of 12. 5. The airborne aerobic gram-negative bacteria were reduced in average by a factor of 1. 9, however, in 7 out of 22 cases it was increased by a factor of 14. 8 maximum. The concentrations of airborne moulds were decreased in average by a factor of 2. 3. In 6 out of 22 cases it increased by a factor of 3. 8 maximum. Future investigation should show whether another filter stage or a treatment of the washing water to minimize the germs (disinfection) can increase the purification efficiency of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> washer...|$|R
