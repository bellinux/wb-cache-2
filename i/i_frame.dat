30|$|Our {{analysis}} shows and compares multifractal properties of 3 D videos with different quantization parameters. It {{was found that}} a video with a higher value of quantization parameters (higher compression ratios) shows higher multifractal nature, as well as higher burstiness. Isolated intracoded (<b>I)</b> <b>frames,</b> predictive encoded (P) frames, and bi-directional (B) frames are analyzed. It is shown that <b>I</b> <b>frames</b> have very similar multifractal spectra regardless of the 3 D video representation format. It was also shown that B frames, the smallest frames, have the narrowest multifractal spectrum. With the highest bitrate variability (the smallest value αmin), P frames show rare prominent parts of the signal, while in comparison, <b>I</b> <b>frames</b> have higher αmin but with the higher probability of this singularity.|$|R

60|$|Now I have remarked {{already that}} I dare {{not say what}} I think of Thucydides, Book II. How then shall <b>I</b> <b>frame</b> my opinion of that {{examination}} paper? It was Thucydides, Book II, with the few easy parts left out. It was Thucydides, Book II, with special home-made difficulties added. It was--well, in its way it was a masterpiece. Without going into details--I dislike sensational and realistic writing--I may say that I personally {{was not one of}} those who required an extra ten minutes to finish their papers. I finished mine at half-past two, and amused myself for the remaining hour and a half by writing neatly on several sheets of foolscap exactly what I thought of Mr Mellish, and precisely what I hoped would happen to him some day. It was grateful and comforting.|$|E
60|$|To conclude, a man {{having no}} notion of {{anything}} without him, {{but by the}} idea he has of it in his mind, (which idea he has a power to call by what name he pleases,) he may indeed make an idea neither answering the reason of things, nor agreeing to the idea commonly signified by other people's words; but cannot make a wrong or false idea of a thing which is no otherwise known to him but by the idea he has of it: v.g. when <b>I</b> <b>frame</b> {{an idea of the}} legs, arms, and body of a man, and join to this a horse's head and neck, I do not make a false idea of anything; because it represents nothing without me. But when I call it a MAN or TARTAR, and imagine it to represent some real being without me, or to be the same idea that others call by the same name; in either of these cases I may err. And upon this account it is that it comes to be termed a false idea; though indeed the falsehood lies not in the idea, but in that tacit mental proposition, wherein a conformity and resemblance is attributed to it which it has not. But yet, if, having framed such an idea in my mind, without thinking either that existence, or the name MAN or TARTAR, belongs to it, I will call it MAN or TARTAR, I may be justly thought fantastical in the naming; but not erroneous in my judgment; nor the idea any way false.|$|E
6000|$|Dinner being over, I throw {{myself at}} length upon the sand and, {{basking in the}} sunshine, let my mind disport itself at will. The walls of this my hermitage have no tongue to tell my follies, though I {{sometimes}} fancy that they have ears to hear them and a soul to sympathize. There is a magic in this spot. Dreams haunt its precincts and flit around me in broad sunlight, nor require that sleep shall blindfold me to real objects ere these be visible. Here can <b>I</b> <b>frame</b> a story of two lovers, and make their shadows live before me and be mirrored in the tranquil water as they tread along the sand, leaving no footprints. Here, should I will it, I can summon up a single shade and be myself her lover.--Yes, dreamer, but your lonely heart will be the colder for such fancies.--Sometimes, too, the Past comes back, and finds me here, and in her train come faces which were gladsome when I knew them, yet seem not gladsome now. Would that my hiding-place were lonelier, so that the Past might not find me!--Get ye all gone, old friends, and let me listen to the murmur of the sea--a melancholy voice, but less sad than yours. Of what mysteries is it telling? Of sunken ships and whereabouts they lie? Of islands afar and undiscovered whose tawny children are unconscious of other islands and of continents, and deem the stars of heaven their nearest neighbors? Nothing of all this. What, then? Has it talked for so many ages and meant nothing all the while? No; for those ages find utterance in the sea's unchanging voice, and warn the listener to withdraw his interest from mortal vicissitudes and let the infinite idea of eternity pervade his soul. This is wisdom, and therefore will I spend the next half-hour in shaping little boats of driftwood and launching them on voyages across the cove, with the feather of a sea-gull for a sail. If the voice of ages tell me true, this is as wise an occupation as to build ships of five hundred tons and launch them forth upon the main, bound to [...] "Far Cathay." [...] Yet how would the merchant sneer at me! ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a traffic {{model for the}} {{characterization}} of VBR MPEG-coded video streams. This model provides the means to generate synthetic MPEG streams {{that can be used}} in performance studies of ATM networks. The model is appropriately fitted to three long empirical video sequences taken from different movies. We use multiple components to model bit rate variations in an MPEG stream. These components have different time scales. Long-term variations in the bit rate are captured at the scene level. Within a scene, the sizes of <b>I</b> <b>frames</b> tend to slightly fluctuate around some average. Hence, we measure the activity of the scene by the average size of <b>I</b> <b>frames</b> in that scene. This average varies from one scene to another, and its randomness is reasonably approximated by a lognormal distribution. For a given scene, the fluctuations of the sizes of <b>I</b> <b>frames</b> about their mean are modeled as an AR(2) time series. Finally, we show that the sizes of P and B frames can be appropriately [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether others, {{have this}} {{wonderful}} faculty of abstracting their ideas, they best can tell: for myself, I dare be confident I have it not. I find, indeed, I have indeed a faculty of imagining, or representing to myself, {{the ideas of}} those particular things I have perceived, and of variously compounding and dividing them. I can imagine a man with two heads, or the upper parts of a man joined {{to the body of}} a horse. I can consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself abstracted or separated {{from the rest of the}} body. But, then, whatever hand or eye I imagine, it must have some particular shape and colour. Likewise the idea of a man that <b>I</b> <b>frame</b> to myself must be either of a white, or a black, or a tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or a middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive the abstract idea above described. And it is equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving, and which is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear; and the like may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever. To be plain, I own myself able to abstract in one sense, as when I consider some particular parts of qualities separated from others, with which, though they are united in some object, yet it is possible they may really exist without them. But I deny that I can abstract from one another, or conceive separately, those qualities which it is impossible should exist so separated; or that I can frame a general notion, by abstracting from particulars in the manner aforesaid--which last are the two proper acceptations of ABSTRACTION. And there is ground to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case. The generality of men which are simple and illiterate never pretend to ABSTRACT NOTIONS. It is said they are difficult and not to be attained without pains and study; we may therefore reasonably conclude that, if such there be, they are confined only to the learned.|$|E
