The discussion begins with a succinct overview of the definitional aspects of geographical <b>indications,</b> traditional knowledge and traditional knowledge–based agricultural products. In an attempt to locate the issue of geographical <b>indications</b> in the current intellectual property landscape, the article examines their regulation in international and national legal frameworks, and critically appraises the attendant controversies in international negotiations.

The surgical panel considered more <b>indications</b> as being appropriate for cholecystectomy (29 % v 13 %) and fewer <b>indications</b> as being inappropriate (27 % v 50 %) than the mixed panel.

40|$|Objectives:The aim of {{this study}} was to derive {{specific}} clinical <b>indications</b> for surgery in patients with chronic critical lower limb ischaemia and to determine the extent to which practice in Scotland conformed to these <b>indications.</b> Design, materials and methods:Consensus on <b>indications</b> was achieved using a modified Delphi method in which a postal questionnaire was completed by 29 vascular surgeons on two occasions, with feedback between the rounds. Respondents indicated the appropriateness of arterial reconstruction and primary major amputation for 218 case scenarios comprising all possible combinations of clinical and angiographic findings. Results:Agreement was reached on 31 appropriate <b>indications</b> for major amputation and 65 for arterial reconstruction. In 10 hospitals in Scotland, 400 primary amputation and arterial reconstruction operations were reviewed retrospectively and compared with the <b>indications.</b> The clinical findings for 7 (4 %) arterial reconstructions and 48 (24 %) major amputations did not conform to the <b>indications</b> agreed by the Delphi method. The proportion of operations conforming to the agreed <b>indications</b> differed significantly by size of unit (p< 0. 025). Conclusions:This study shows that consensus can be reached on <b>indications</b> for surgery. However, in practice some operations performed do not conform with these <b>indications.</b> This discrepancy may be due to inappropriate practice...|$|R
