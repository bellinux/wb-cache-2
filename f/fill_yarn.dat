5000|$|Battening. As {{the shuttle}} {{moves across the}} loom laying down the <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> it also passes through {{openings}} in another frame called a reed (which resembles a comb). With each picking operation, the reed presses or battens each filling yarn against {{the portion of the}} fabric that has already been formed. The point where the fabric is formed is called the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.|$|E
50|$|Battening. Between the heddles and the takeup roll, {{the warp}} threads pass through another frame called the reed (which resembles a comb). The {{portion of the}} fabric {{that has already been}} formed but not yet rolled up on the takeup roll is called the fell. After the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> the weaver uses the reed to press (or batten) each filling yarn against the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.|$|E

50|$|Picking. As the {{harnesses}} {{raise the}} heddles or healds, which raise the warp yarns, the shed is created. The <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted through the shed {{by a small}} carrier device called a shuttle. The shuttle is normally pointed at each end to allow passage through the shed. In a traditional shuttle loom, the <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> is wound onto a quill, {{which in turn is}} mounted in the shuttle. The <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> emerges {{through a hole in the}} shuttle as it moves across the loom. A single crossing of the shuttle from one side of the loom to the other is known as a pick. As the shuttle moves back and forth across the shed, it weaves an edge, or selvage, on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from raveling.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{duct tape}} {{is made with}} any one {{of a variety of}} woven fabrics to provide strength. The threads or <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> of the fabric may be cotton, polyester, nylon, rayon or fiberglass. The fabric is a very thin gauze called [...] "scrim" [...] which is {{laminated}} to a backing of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The color of the LDPE is provided by various pigments; the usual gray color comes from powdered aluminum mixed into the LDPE. There are two commonly produced tape widths: 1.9 in and 2 in. Other widths are also offered. The largest rolls of duct tape were made in 2005 for Henkel, with 3.78 in width, a roll diameter of 64 in and weighing 650 lb.|$|E
50|$|FR-4 {{does not}} specify {{specific}} material, only a grade of material, {{as defined by}} NEMA LI 1-1998 specification. Typical physical and electrical properties of FR-4 are as follows. The abbreviations LW (lengthwise, warp yarn direction) and CW (crosswise, <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> direction) refer to the conventional perpendicular fiber orientations in the XY plane of the board (in-plane). In terms of Cartesian coordinates, lengthwise is along the x-axis, crosswise is along the y-axis, and the z-axis {{is referred to as}} the through-plane direction. Keep in mind that the values for the parameters listed below are an example for a certain manufacturer's material. Each manufacturer will have slightly different values for the parameters listed below. It's better to check the datasheet of the specific material being used. Verifying the actual values is very important for high frequency designs.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the geometric structural parameters of a glass textile reinforcement, which is embedded into an epoxy polymer matrix, by micro-computed tomography (CT). Therefore, four different glass fabrics were investigated. The CT images of the composites feature a good contrast between glass reinforcement and polymer matrix. The resolution is high enough for the determination of the geometric structural parameters: wavelength of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> amplitude of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> width of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> height of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> and the gap between two adjacent warp and fill yarns. The micro-computed tomography shows a high potential for an efficient measurement of the three dimensional geometric structural properties of laminated woven textile fabrics...|$|E

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for fabricating straight or curved planar or three-dimensional (C channel, for example) fabric for fabrication into composite structures is presented. In the first embodiment, the <b>fill</b> <b>yarns</b> are inserted between layers of warp yarns, and a canted or curved reed, {{depending on the}} desired orientation of the <b>fill</b> <b>yarns,</b> is used to compact or 'beat-up' the <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> In the second embodiment, the warp yarns of the fabric are curved using a conical {{or a combination of}} conical and cylindrical rollers to effect differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining a constant radius of curvature of the warp yarns. In a third embodiment, a clamping bar fabric take-up device is used to effect the differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining straight warp yarns, curved warp yarns with a constant radius of curvature, curved warp yarns with a non-contant radius of curvature, or some combinations of straight and curved warp yarns. In a fourth embodiment, for forming the flanges of the curved C channel, the warp yarns are alternately inserted through adjacent dent wires of the reed to permit vertical weaving of the flanges...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} prevent fiber {{distortion}} in textile materials employed in a modified weaving process. In a first embodiment, a tacifier {{in powder form}} {{is applied to the}} yarn and melted while on the fabric. Cool air is then supplied after the tacifier has melted to expedite the solidification of the tacifier. In a second embodiment, a solution form of a tacifier is used by dissolving the tacifier into a solvent that has a high evaporation rate. The solution is then sprayed onto the fabric or <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> as each <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted into a shed of the fabric. A third embodiment applies the tacifier in a liquid form that has not been dissolved in a solvent. That is, the tacifier is melted and is sprayed as a liquid onto the fabric or <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> as it is being extracted from a <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> spool prior to the <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> being inserted into the shed of the fabric. A fourth embodiment employs adhesive yarns contained {{as an integral part of}} the warp or <b>fill</b> <b>yarn.</b> Additional tacifier material is not required because a matrix is used as the tacifier. The matrix is then locally melted using heating elements on clamping bars or take-up rollers, is cooled, if necessary, and solidified...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for integral <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> insertion and beatup are disclosed. A modified rapier contains a channel for holding <b>fill</b> <b>yarn.</b> The channel {{is covered with}} a flexible and inflatable boot, and an inflating apparatus for this boot is also attached. <b>Fill</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted into the channel, and the rapier is extended into a shed formed by warp yarn. Next, the rapier is pushed into the fell of the fabric, and the flexible and inflatable cover inflated, which both pushes the yarn into the fell of the fabric and performs beatup. The rapier is withdrawn and the shed closed to complete one step of the weaving process...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for forming woven fabrics {{through the use}} of an adjustable reed. The adjustable reed has multiple groups of reed wires that guide the warp yarns. The groups of reed wires move on reed rails parallel to the warp direction. In addition, rail expanders permit the space between the reed wires to be modified and telescoping rods attached to the rail sliders can be turned to permit the reed wires to be skewed to alter the <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> angle. These adjustments to the reed permit simultaneous variation of <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> angles and fabric widths and allow these variations to be made during fabrication, without the need to halt production...|$|E
40|$|Fibre {{reorientation}} {{occurs when}} forming a reinforced structure {{such as a}} fabric onto a doubly curved surface. This leads {{to a change in}} the angle between warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> The composite properties change inhomogeneously, corresponding to the varying angle between warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> Many composite properties are determined by the angle between the warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns,</b> such as the mechanical properties, the coefficients of thermal expansion, the local fibre volume fractions, the local thickness and the permeability. The extent of the fibre reorientation is affected by the product shape and the forming process. The forming process may cause tensile stresses in the fabric yarns, causing subsequent product distortions. Also, wrinkling risks are present due to the incapability of the fabric to deform beyond a maximum shear deformation. The local change in composite properties {{must be taken into account}} to predict the properties of a product. Drape modelling can predict the process induced fibre orientations and stresses, which can speed up the product development process compared with trial-and-error development. The constitutive model for these bi-axially reinforced composite materials is the primary element of these process simulations...|$|R
50|$|In Medieval England, double weaves called {{compound}} weft-faced twills featured weft or <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> {{in multiple}} colors, {{with the design}} completely covering the face warp yarns and the unused colors for any particular section woven into a binding warp on the reverse side.|$|R

40|$|Basalt fabric composite, with {{different}} twill wave reinforcements, i. e. twill 2 / 2 and twill 1 / 3, {{have been studied}} in this work by means of experimental tests and numerical finite element (FE) simulations. As fabric reinforcements show repeating undulations of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> simple mixtures law cannot be applied. As a consequence, the mesoscopic scale, lying between the microscopic and the macroscopic one, {{has to be taken}} into account to mechanically characterize a fabric reinforced composite. The aim of this work is to evaluate the stiffness of a fabric reinforced composite in warp and fill direction. In particular a numerical FE model, assuming elliptical sections and sinusoidal shape of the yarns, has been implemented and experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the proposed model. Finally, the strength and the failure modes of the composite material, for each analysed structure and textile orientation, have been experimentally investigated...|$|E
40|$|Pilling {{has been}} one of the major {{consumer}} problems of man-made staple yarn products. This study evaluated the pilling performance of 65 / 35 % Dacron/cotton fabrics woven from open-end (OE) yarns by the Random Tumble Pilling Tester Method (ASTM Test Method D 3512 - 82) and the Elastomeric Pad Method (ASTM Test Method D 3514 - 81) at five specified test intervals. The effect of twist level of warp and <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> on pilling propensity, flex abrasion, tensile strength, and breaking elongation was also investigated. Pilling produced by the Random Tumble Pilling (RTP) procedure was mainly fiber fuzz and loosely anchored pills; that produced by the Elastomeric Pad Method (EPM) was large scale pills and fiber entanglement which did not wear off readily. ANOVA test revealed that the twist level of warp yarns had a significant influence on thepilling characteristics as evidenced in both pilling tests. Twist level of <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> influenced EPMpilling ratings only intermittently. The effect of twist level of warp yarns was highly significant for the warp direction on flex abrasion, tensile strength, and breaking elongation. On the other hand the twist level of <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> influencedfilling tensile and breaking elongation. The major findings of the study indicate that pilling performance was significantly influenced by pilling tes...|$|R

50|$|Double cloth or double weave (also doublecloth, double-cloth, doubleweave) {{is a kind}} of {{woven textile}} in which two or more sets of warps and one or more sets of weft or <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> are {{interconnected}} to form a two-layered cloth. The movement of threads between the layers allows complex patterns and surface textures to be created.|$|R
50|$|In a twill weave, each weft or <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> floats {{across the}} warp yarns in a {{progression}} of interlacings {{to the right}} or left, forming a pattern of distinct diagonal lines. This diagonal pattern {{is also known as}} a wale. A float is the portion of a yarn that crosses over two or more perpendicular yarns.|$|R
5000|$|Woven sail cloths have an {{inherent}} problem with stretch resistance. In a weave the warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns</b> pass over and under one another. As load is applied the yarns attempt to straighten out, {{this results in}} the fabric stretching, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "crimp". Fibers which are resistant to stretching cannot be woven as tightly as more flexible fibers such as PET, thus the cloth is more affected by crimp.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} study of fatigue {{behavior}} of a non-crimp 3 -dimensional woven carbon/epoxy composite in tension-tension fatigue. Infinite fatigue life limit corresponds to the load of 27. 5 kN for fill direction. The damage under fatigue loading starts and develops from intersection of z-yarns and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> Since the z-yarns bonded the yarn layers, it is not seen the delaminastion damages. This indicate that for load carrying capacity and stiffness of 3 -dimensional composites better than classic 2 -dimensional textile composites...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1920s, the American market {{has used the}} term {{broadcloth}} to describe a plain-woven, usually mercerised fabric woven with a rib and a slightly heavier <b>filling</b> <b>yarn,</b> used for shirt-making, made from cotton or a polyester-and-cotton blend [...] This fabric {{was introduced in the}} early 1920s as an import from the United Kingdom, where it was called poplin, but it was arbitrarily renamed broadcloth as it was thought that the British name had connotations of heaviness. Another version of this fabric, woven in rayon or polyester-and-rayon, is called fuji.|$|R
50|$|In weaving, the weft (sometimes woof) is {{the thread}} or yarn which is drawn through, {{inserted}} over-and-under, the lengthwise warp yarns that {{are held in}} tension on a frame or loom to create cloth. Warp is the lengthwise or longitudinal thread in a roll, while weft is the transverse thread. A single thread of the weft, crossing the warp, is called a pick. Terms do vary (for instance, in North America, the weft is {{sometimes referred to as}} the fill or the <b>filling</b> <b>yarn).</b> Each individual warp thread in a fabric is called a warp end or end.|$|R
50|$|Velvet is woven on {{a special}} loom that weaves two {{thicknesses}} of the material at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart to create the pile effect, and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. This complicated process meant that velvet was expensive to make before industrial power looms became available, and well-made velvet remains a fairly costly fabric. Velvet is difficult to clean because of its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods make cleaning more feasible. Velvet pile is created by warp or vertical yarns and velveteen pile is created by weft or <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
40|$|PET {{filament}} yarns {{have been}} prepared with TiO 2 micron fillers as UV absorbents {{for the production of}} UV protective clothing. Fiber formation as well as spinning and dyeing properties were comparable to common PET grades. Stretched yarns exhibited some strength enhancement of the micron TiO 2 <b>filled</b> <b>yarns</b> due to enhancing effects on orientation and crystallization of the filler. Mechanical properties, light fastness and hot-light fastness of the fibers indicated optimum fiber properties of PET containing mixed micron TiO 2 and standard TiO 2 pigments.
