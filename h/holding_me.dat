25|$|I can't quite {{root for}} Lieberman {{to lose his}} primary. What's <b>holding</b> <b>me</b> back is that the anti-Lieberman {{campaign}} has come to stand for much more than Lieberman's sins. It's a test of strength for {{the new breed of}} left-wing activists who are flexing their muscles within the party. These are exactly the sorts of fanatics who tore the party apart in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They think in simple slogans and refuse to tolerate any ideological dissent.|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, Tovey {{announced}} that she had filmed her final scenes with Home and Away. Lasance said he was sad but [...] "fortunate" [...] to work alongside Tovey. He credited their off-screen friendship as making Aden and Belle's dynamic develop successfully. In the weeks before filming her final scenes, Tovey asked Welsh how Belle would be written out. It was then she found out that Belle would die shortly after her wedding with Aden. Tovey said she was teary, but pleased with the way Belle would depart. Tovey said that filming her exit scenes were more emotional. Her last scene with Lasance required her to portray Belle's death scene. She added [...] "I had my eyes closed and he was <b>holding</b> <b>me</b> really tight", after the director cut the scene they pair could not separate themselves.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, Robbie {{confirmed}} rumours {{that she}} was to leave Neighbours after almost three years. Of her reason to leave Robbie said [...] "I {{want to go to}} America; it's always been my goal to work in Hollywood. It's the one stage in my life where I have absolutely nothing <b>holding</b> <b>me</b> down". Robbie filmed her final scenes in October and her character left on-screen in early 2011. Robbie later revealed her character's exit is positive and that Donna departs Ramsay Street for a fashion design school in New York. Robbie said [...] "It is very daunting for Donna at first. Ringo was the one who applied for Donna to do this course – it's like he's doing this one last thing for her." [...] She said that Donna becomes determined to be a success and that it is her last chance to live up to Ringo's expectations of her. Robbie added that she wanted Donna to go to rehab or have a dramatic death, but she got a [...] "boring old happy ending" [...] instead.|$|E

500|$|At the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Vijender Singh {{was beaten}} by England's Anthony Ogogo in the semi-finals. Leading 3–0 on points {{going into the}} final round, Singh was twice given a {{two-point}} penalty by Canadian referee Michael Summers, the second for coming just 20 seconds {{before the end of}} the bout, leading Ogogo to win by 4 points to 3. The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) launched an unsuccessful appeal, leaving Singh with a bronze medal. IBF Secretary General P K Muralidharan Raja said, [...] "The jury reviewed the bout and came to the conclusion that Vijender was holding his opponent and the referee was right in warning him. When the Indian team pointed out that even Ogogo was holding Vijender, the jury felt it was not the case." [...] Singh lashed out saying that the penalties were [...] "harsh and unfair. The warnings were unfair and harsh. If the referee thought I was holding Ogogo then he should have penalised this guy as well. He was also <b>holding</b> <b>me.</b> It's a joke that somebody has won by scoring points just out of warnings." [...] One month later, in November, he won the 2010 Asian Games shutting out Uzbek two time world champion Abbos Atoev 7:0 in the final.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next year}} he decided to race with a new car at Kingsport, Tennessee Speedway, which had begun hosting a $2,500-to-win event every Saturday night. [...] "I come rolling into the race with my dad and there sits Larry Moore," [...] Bloomquist said. [...] "He was the fastest guy in dirt late model racing and there he sits. And my dad says, `Well, there goes that $2,500.'" [...] Bloomquist {{qualified}} second fastest behind Moore and started out on Moore's outside in the first row. Bloomquist said, [...] "Moore took the lead but was <b>holding</b> <b>me</b> up, so I knocked {{him out of the}} way and won. That's $2,500. Next week, I'm on the pole, Moore's outside and I won again. Now I'm sitting here with five grand and I'm thinking that things are starting to look up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Adams' speech, {{attendees}} {{created the}} first pile of small bicycles. One participant, {{who was one of}} the first women of Zoobomb, said about the creation of the first new pile: [...] "I pushed through the crowd and handed it forth, bowing in honor of the golden b(eye)cycle winking in the sun. As I retreated to the crowd, my whole body was shaking. My hands were in disbelief. I paced in a circle and half-sigh/half-laughed and this darn smile was <b>holding</b> <b>me</b> so tight, I felt like the kiln was burning it into my clay, smile-shaped cheeks forever." [...] A long chain was wrapped through each of the nearly twenty bicycles, which were locked to the sculpture by Adams. Event attendees then posed for a group picture, then sang a song called [...] "16" [...] Rims", a parody of Janis Joplin's [...] "Mercedez Benz". The commemoration ended with [...] "dancing in the streets" [...] and music by The Sprockettes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, Ferguson {{rented a}} room in the Flatbush {{neighborhood}} of Brooklyn. He was unemployed. Ferguson lived around many other West Indian immigrants. Neighbors said he dressed very neatly, but kept to himself and rarely smiled or spoke to anybody, except occasionally to say hello. His landlord Patrick Denis said Ferguson once told him, [...] "I'm such a great person. There must be only one thing <b>holding</b> <b>me</b> back. It must be white people." [...] In 1992, Ferguson's ex-wife Audrey Warren filed a complaint with police alleging Ferguson pried open the trunk of her car. Prior to the incident, Warren had not seen him since the divorce. In February 1992, Ferguson {{was arrested and charged with}} harassing a woman on a subway. The woman tried to sit in a vacant seat alongside Ferguson and asked him to move over, prompting Ferguson to scream at her and press his leg and elbow against her until police officers pinned him to the ground. Ferguson tried to escape the police and shouted [...] "Brothers, come help me!" [...] Ferguson sent letters to the New York City Police Commissioner and other officials complaining about his arrest, describing it as [...] "viscous and racist", and claiming he was brutalized by the officers who arrested him. The New York City Transit Authority investigated and dismissed the claims.|$|E

Created for the general public, the book serves as a self-help version of her groundbreaking research about relationships - how to enhance them, how to repair them and how to keep them. <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Tight, designed to offer expertise for adult relationships, became the springboard for an innovative program geared to the reunion of military couples after deployment, called Strong Bonds, Strong Couples and the <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Tight Enhancement Program.|$|R
