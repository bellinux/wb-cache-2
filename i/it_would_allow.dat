5|$|The London and Southwestern Railway (LSWR) became {{interested}} in using Cannon Street as a terminus, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> a connection between Waterloo and the City.|$|E
5|$|Between June 1990 and 1998, Highway401 and Interstate75 {{were used}} for a pilot project named Advantage I-75 to test the {{reliability}} and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks. Termed MACS for Mainline Automated Clearance System, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> a truck to travel from Florida to Ontario without a second inspection.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain saw his {{elevation}} to the premiership as {{the final}} glory in {{a career as a}} domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions. One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> him to concentrate on domestic affairs.|$|E
50|$|The {{removal of}} the hotel <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> for a wider Main Street plaza and <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> for new features, such as a Washington Street entrance. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> also <b>allow</b> for more design {{flexibility}} and would lend itself to host after-hour concerts and other events on the plaza.|$|R
50|$|This {{approach}} would let mobile {{and other devices}} communicate without being turned on. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> also <b>allow</b> unpowered sensors to communicate, allowing them to function in places where external power cannot be conveniently supplied.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> {{also have}} {{established}} a limited right to return between the territories of the two communities, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> both Greece and Turkey to maintain a permanent military presence on the island, albeit with large, phased reductions in troop numbers.|$|R
5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities of the instrument, hoping <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Khánh had {{not spoken}} up and allowed the {{impression}} that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will, and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves. Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, {{the state}} of Massachusetts tabled a bill {{exploring}} the possibility of allowing the Massachusetts Lottery to run online, skill-based games, such as daily fantasy sports. On November 19, 2015, the government announced that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> daily fantasy sports services to operate within Massachusetts under proposed regulations, including the requirement for all players to be 21 and over, banning members of the professional sports industry from playing the games (including athletes), and banning the marketing of the services in colleges and high schools.|$|E
50|$|The Romanian {{language}} is not in use in local administration, not even in localities where members of the minority represent more than 15% of the population, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>allowed</b> according to Serbian law.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} taken over in 1899 by British Electric Traction in {{expectation}} that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>allowed</b> to modernise and electrify the services. However, it withdrew and the new tramway opened, operated by South Shields Corporation Tramways.|$|R
5|$|The 1880s {{also saw}} the {{beginnings}} of the Asian oil trade. The idea that led to moving Russian oil to the Far East via the Suez Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane. Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by the Suez Canal Company as being too risky. Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> through the canal.|$|E
5|$|The Apennine mountains, which rise to {{a height}} of nearly farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plainsare {{hypothesized}} to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as it was before the creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E
5|$|By the late-19th century, Charing Cross {{was seen}} as being inconveniently placed. In 1889, the newly-formed London County Council's John Burns {{proposed}} that the station and its approach should be demolished, with a road bridge put in place. The idea gained support with in the council as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> the Strand to be widened and put a road crossing over the Thames that could bypass Whitehall. When the SECR went to Parliament asking for an act to strengthen the bridge in 1916, Burns suggested the station {{was in the wrong}} place and should be rebuilt {{on the south side of}} the Thames. The following year, an act was passed to reconstruct the bridge, with strict conditions about its appearance and a ban on enlarging the station building itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> {{generate}} a steady 0.98G in lateral acceleration due to racing parts such as Sachs dampers, lightweight O.Z Alloy Wheels and a Quaife ATB Differential. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> also <b>allow</b> 1.0G of braking force {{due to the}} standard Brembo braking system 324 mm (Front) 280 mm (Rear).|$|R
50|$|In {{the medium}} term V2X is {{perceived}} as a key enabler for autonomous driving, assuming <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>allowed</b> to intervene into the actual driving. In that case vehicles would be able to join platoons, the way HGVs do.|$|R
50|$|Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan {{rejected}} Israeli objections, {{stating that}} Turkey is a sovereign nation {{and as such}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> any Israeli interference with Turkey's decision to design, develop, manufacture and launch high resolution intelligence satellites.|$|R
5|$|Election {{reform is}} {{a focus of}} the Wildrose Alliance. The party proposes to set fixed {{election}} dates rather than the current format which allows the Premier to call an election at any time. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> more free votes in the legislature and would seek to elect the province's Senators rather than have them appointed by the Prime Minister. The party also plans to introduce a bill giving voters the right to recall their MLA. The Wildrose Party proposes numerous changes to how the province delivers health care, which it claims will remain compliant with the Canada Health Act, as well as controls on government spending. Smith is also critical of international climate change treaties, believing climate change science remains inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people {{would see the}} film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished {{by the end of}} 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit. Quinto narrated the audiobook.|$|E
5000|$|Nine {{candidates}} were {{nominated for the}} position of position of Secretary-General. [...] All of the candidates came from the Third World, as China had {{made it clear that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> only <b>allow</b> candidates from Africa, Asia, or Latin America.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the second}} round campaign, Ialá blamed PAIGC for Guinea-Bissau's {{problems}} and alleged that it was responsible for Vieira's assassination.

5000|$|The First Nations Governance Act (Bill C-7) - {{introduced}} in 2002, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> bands to amend their own leadership selection processes and devolved some other powers. It was opposed by most bands {{and died in}} Parliament in 2003.|$|R
5|$|In January 2013, IndiGo was the second-fastest-growing {{low-cost}} carrier in Asia behind Indonesian airline Lion Air. In February 2013, {{following the}} announcement of the civil aviation ministry that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> IndiGo to take delivery of only five aircraft that year, the airline planned to introduce low-cost regional flights by setting up a subsidiary. Later, IndiGo announced that it planned to seek permission from the ministry to acquire four more aircraft, therefore taking delivery of nine aircraft in 2013. As of March 2014, IndiGo is the second-largest low-cost carrier in Asia in terms of seats flown.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during her North American debut in 2011, Kurosaki mentioned {{that it had}} been her long-time dream to perform theme songs for anime series, and that anime {{is a big part of}} her life. She related her experiences working at Dear Stage, where originally worked as a waitress and performer. She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage would prove to be a valuable experience as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> her to perform at larger stages with more imagination and inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5000|$|Opponents {{argued that}} the {{practice}} was dangerous to society, while other groups viewed the legislation as discrimination against women, since <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> for polyandrous marriages, which sparked a social debate over a possible [...] "common ground" [...] resolution.|$|R

50|$|This {{calculated}} Z.1018 payload {{was barely}} enough for takeoff with full fuel and crew (2,800 kg/6,1703 lb), so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>allow</b> for any weapon load. A {{possible explanation is}} that the prototype was never flight-tested at its maximum capacity including weapon load.|$|R
5|$|MTV Unplugged (listed on iTunes as MTV Unplugged: Katy Perry) is an {{extended}} play (EP) and live album by American singer Katy Perry, {{released in the}} United States on November 13, 2009 by Capitol Records. After airing more than 100 MTV Unplugged specials, MTV wanted {{to bring back the}} series, in order to expose them to a younger generation. The channel recruited various mainstream and popular artists to perform as part of the series, including Perry, who particularly expressed interest in the idea as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> her to showcase herself as an artist and share the stories behind her songs.|$|E
5|$|The Air Combat Group (ACG) {{was created}} on 1 January 2002 with {{the merging of}} two Force Element Groups (FEGs), Strike Reconnaissance Group (F-111) and Tactical Fighter Group (F/A-18 Hornet, Hawk and PC-9A). The ACG was tasked to deliver the core {{capabilities}} of Control of the Air and Precision Air Strike {{with the hope that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> the RAAF to more quickly deploy its combat aircraft. Although the fighter and strike elements will continue to operate as discrete units for some time, ACG will provide the opportunity for the RAAF to test the organisation required to deliver a range of combat capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
