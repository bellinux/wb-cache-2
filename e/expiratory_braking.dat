40|$|At birth, {{the lungs}} of preterm infants are most vulnerable. Current {{recommendations}} in respiratory support at birth {{are based on}} few data and little distinction has been made between term and preterm infants. The aim was to gather data {{that could lead to}} a better understanding of spontaneous breathing and improvement of the respiratory support of preterm infants at birth. We report that preterm infants at birth use <b>expiratory</b> <b>braking</b> and breath holds to create and defend their functional residual capacity (FRC). It is possible we should mimic these strategies when respiratory support is needed. Applying positive end expiratory pressure (CPAP) in spontaneous breathing preterm infants at birth is feasible and not detrimental, providing early surfactant is given. Experimental studies in this thesis showed that applying positive end expiratory pressure is essential for creating and maintaining FRC during ventilation of preterm infants at birth. Also, an initial sustained inflation of 10 - 20 seconds at birth creates an immediate FRC and more uniform lung aeration. Combining these strategies has led to a more efficient approach in preterm infants than repeated manual inflations with a self-inflating bag and mask. This thesis contributed to the accumulating evidence for a different approach than currently recommended. Promotor: F. J. Walther, Co-promotor: C. J. MorleyWith summary in Dutc...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{laryngeal}} paralysis in dogs, {{has become}} a frequently recognised disorder. Various surgical procedures have been advocated to relieve the consequential laryngeal obstruction, but few critical examinations {{of the effectiveness of}} these procedures have been attempted. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine and compare the efficacy of two of the more commonly used surgical methods (i) castellated laryngofissure with vocal fold resection and (ii) bilateral arytenoid lateralisation in providing an adequate laryngeal airway in dogs after surgically Induced laryngeal paralysis. The laryngeal function of ten adult healthy experimental dogs was assessed by clinical examination, laryngoscopy, blood gas and tidal breathing flow-volume loop analyses prior to and after bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve resection. Five dogs then underwent a castellated laryngofissure with vocal fold resection and the remaining five, bilateral arytenoid lateralisation. Six weeks later, the laryngeal function of the ten dogs was reassessed using the same investigative techniques. Radiographs of the chest were taken at the start and completion of the experiment on the live dogs to help detect the presence of any co-existent lower respiratory tract disease. An autopsy was performed on each dog. six weeks after surgery, and details of visible changes in the laryngeal structure recorded. After neurectomy, all of the dogs had inspiratory stridor, a hoarse bark and reduced exercise tolerance. Medial displacement of the arytenoid cartilages and vocal cords caused narrowing of the rima glottidis. No abduction of these structures occurred during inspiration. There was a significant fall in arterial oxygen tension and inspiratory airflow recorded on blood gas analyses and tidal breathing flow-volume loop studies, respectively. The degree of relief from the laryngeal obstruction in the neurectomised dogs after castellated laryngofissure with vocal fold resection was variable. Some of the animals still had signs of respiratory embarrassment. The size of the rima glolhdis achieved was either slightly narrower or similar to that seen in the non-abducted. pre-neurectomised larynx of the experimental dogs. No significant improvement in blood gas or tidal breathing flow-volume loop analyses were recorded following the surgical technique. In contrast, bilateral arytenoid lateralisation consistently alleviated the clinical signs of bilateral recurrent laryngeal neurectomy. The rima glottidis width was increased to either the non-abducted, pre-neurectomised size or greater, depending on the position of the lateralisation suture. Furthermore, blood gas and tidal breathing flow-volume analyses recorded a significant increase in arterial oxygen tension and inspiratory airflow, respectively. Although bilaterial arytenoid lateralisation was more efficient than castellated laryngofissure with vocal fold resection in alleviating the laryngeal obstruction caused by bilateral recurrent laryngeal neurectomy, it did have some inadequacies. The fixed abduction of the arytenoid cartilages destroyed the <b>expiratory</b> <b>braking</b> mechanism of the larynx. Furthermore, execution of the surgical technique requires intimate knowledge of the anatomy of the larynx and the surrounding structures and, since the position of the lateralisation suture is imporlant,best results are likely to bo achieved by surgeons experienced with the procedure...|$|E
40|$|During fetal life, {{the lung}} airways {{are filled with}} liquid that must be cleared at birth to allow air to enter the lungs. This initiates gas {{exchange}} and other cardiovascular changes that are vital for life after birth. Inadequate airway liquid clearance can quickly lead to respiratory failure and so assisted ventilation is frequently required to facilitate lung aeration and mitigate the respiratory failure. It is difficult to develop mechanical ventilation strategies that most effectively increase lung aeration {{because we do not}} understand the factors that influence airway liquid clearance at birth. This thesis aimed to determine the factors that regulate lung aeration and airway liquid clearance at birth and determine how these factors could be utilised in mechanical ventilation strategies to improve lung aeration in an immature lung. The experiments used a combination of traditional and new analytical techniques, including plethysmography and phase contrast (PC) X-ray imaging, to image and measure lung aeration at birth, thereby providing a unique perspective on this process. The first aim of this thesis was to determine the contribution of respiratory activity and <b>expiratory</b> <b>braking</b> manoeuvres (EBMs) to the formation and maintenance of a functional residual capacity (FRC) at birth in spontaneously breathing near-term rabbit pups (Chapter 3). Newborn rabbit pups develop most (~ 95 %) of their FRC in association with inspiration and the FRC rarely increases in the absence of breathing. This is emphasised in PC X-ray images that clearly show lung aeration increasing after individual breaths. These results highlighted the importance of inspiration for lung aeration and suggest that inspiration is a prominent airway liquid clearance mechanism at the time of birth. Newborn rabbit pups were found to utilise EBMs during the immediate newborn period, but these were associated with both increases and decreases in FRC, although overall, they resulted in net gain of FRC per pup. EBMs were not common when FRC was low and were most frequently observed after â‰¥ 80 % of the FRC had accumulated. In this experiment, I propose that FRC is developed by inspiration whereas FRC is maintained by EBMs during the early neonatal period. Findings from the first aim of this thesis implied that inspiration and its generation of a trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradient promotes rapid airway liquid clearance at birth. This challenges the currently supported hypothesis for airway liquid removal at birth; that adrenaline activates epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) to generate an osmotic gradient in favour of airway liquid clearance. In light of this, the second aim of this thesis (Chapter 4) investigated the relative role of trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients and activation of ENaCs in airway liquid clearance at birth. My findings demonstrated that FRC was similar in mechanically ventilated near-term rabbit pups with and without ENaC inhibition. ENaC inhibition, however, did increase the rate of lung gas volume loss in between inflations, indicating that the rate of liquid reflux may have increased. These findings further support the role of trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients as a primary mechanism for rapid airway liquid clearance at birth. ENaCs, may help to maintain FRC in between inflations when the lung is at rest and trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients are low. My findings, that trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients significantly influence airway liquid clearance and lung aeration at birth, led me to apply these principles to facilitate lung aeration in mechanically ventilated premature pups. Specifically, my third aim (Chapter 5) investigated the role of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the formation and maintenance of an FRC and the spatial and temporal pattern of lung ventilation in the preterm newborn rabbit pup ventilated from birth. Pups ventilated with 5 cmH 2 O of PEEP easily developed and maintained an FRC throughout the respiratory cycle well above the anatomical dead space (ADS) volume. The PC X-ray images clearly demonstrate the effect of PEEP on lung aeration, which followed a very similar temporal pattern as many of the near-term spontaneously breathing pups. In contrast, pups ventilated without PEEP were unable to aerate their lungs appropriately as the airways either collapsed and/or re-filled with liquid at the end of expiration. Therefore, gas filled the distal air sacs for {{less than half of the}} respiratory cycle. This form of ventilation would certainly impair gas exchange and cause atelectrauma leading to further lung injury in the newborn. My third study clearly demonstrated that PEEP increased FRC from birth but PC X-ray images indicate that PEEP did not promote uniform distribution of the gas. Non-uniform ventilation may result from high surface tension caused by the lack of surfactant within the immature lung. Therefore, my fourth aim (Chapter 6) was to investigate the role of surfactant with and without 3 cmH 2 O PEEP on the formation and maintenance of an FRC and the spatial and temporal pattern of lung aeration in the preterm newborn rabbit pup ventilated from birth. This study demonstrated that ventilation with 3 cmH 2 O of PEEP caused an ~ 6 -fold increase in FRC whereas ventilation with surfactant only caused an ~ 2 -fold increase in FRC. Although surfactant had a limited ability to increase FRC, from the onset of ventilation, surfactant increased respiratory system compliance (CRS) and markedly improved the uniformity of gas distribution within the lung ventilation at both FRC and at peak inflation. PEEP also increased CRS and promoted uniform lung ventilation however, this was secondary to the increase in lung gas volume with ventilation. When immature lungs were administered surfactant and mechanically ventilated with PEEP, large FRCs were formed and CRS was high, and demonstrated further improvement with increasing inflation number. In addition, at ventilation onset, aeration was so uniformly distributed at peak inflation and at FRC that there was little capacity for further improvement. Overall, this study demonstrated the different roles of PEEP and surfactant in lung aeration; PEEP increases lung gas volumes whereas surfactant promotes the even distribution of gas throughout the lung. When these techniques are used in combination, the effect is additive. In conclusion, the studies contained in this thesis increase our understanding of the factors that promote lung aeration at birth. Trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients rapidly increased lung aeration at birth, independent of ENaC mechanisms of airway liquid clearance. In immature lungs, PEEP was highly effective at increasing FRC whereas surfactant promoted uniform lung aeration. Therefore, trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressures increase airway liquid clearance and lung aeration whereas surface tension strongly influences the distribution of gas throughout the lung. The knowledge of how various factors influence lung aeration will benefit the future design of ventilation strategies that best aerate the lung at birth...|$|E
40|$|We {{undertook}} {{the present}} investigation to establish whether narrowing/closure of the upper airway occurs during spontaneous and provoked respiratory rhythm disturbances and whether pharyngeal constrictor muscle recruitment occurs coincident with upper airway occlusion during prolonged expiratory periods. Upper airway pressure-flow relationships and middle pharyngeal constrictor (mPC) EMG activities were recorded in 11 adult female goats during spontaneous and provoked prolongations in expiratory time (Te). A total of 213 spontaneous prolongations of expiration were recorded. Additionally, 169 prolonged expiratory events preceded by an augmented breath {{were included in the}} analyses. In separate trials on different days, Te was prolonged by systemic administration of dopamine, by raising the inspired fraction of O 2 from 0. 10 to 1. 00 during poikilocapnic conditions or by systemic administration of clonidine. Continuous tonic activation of the mPC EMG was observed during each prolonged Te period regardless of the duration or initiating cause. However, significant increases in subglottic tracheal pressure, with <b>expiratory</b> airflow <b>braking</b> indicative of upper airway narrowing or closure, was only observed during spontaneous events without a preceding augmented breath and during clonidine-induced events. Tonic mPC activation proved an unreliable indicator of airway occlusion. Furthermore, mPC muscle activation alone is not sufficient to induce pharyngeal occlusion during prolonged expiration. Our data suggest that airway closure is not a common occurrence during provoked respiratory disturbances in awake goats. We propose that airway closure, when present during prolonged Te, is more likely dependent on activation of laryngeal adductor muscles with glottic braking independent of pharyngeal narrowing...|$|R
