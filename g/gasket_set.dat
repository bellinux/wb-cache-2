Modifications to the engines included a Racer Brown stage 3 road camshaft with hydraulic lifters, an Edelbrock Torquer intake manifold, a 4-barrel Holly R6909 750 CFM carburetor, a Chrysler marine specification oil pump, Clevite shell bearings, Forge True pistons, Marine specification valves, and a Felpro race-quality <b>gasket</b> <b>set.</b> The compression ratio was 10.5:1. All of these changes combined to bring output to @5400 rpm and @4000 rpm.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{removability}} of compact sets for continuous Sobolev functions. In particular, {{we focus on}} sets with infinitely many complementary components, called "detour sets", which resemble the Sierpiński gasket. The main theorem is that if K⊂ R^n is a detour set and its complementary components are sufficiently regular, then K is W^ 1,p-removable for p>n. Several examples and constructions of sets where the theorem applies are given, including the Sierpiński gasket, Apollonian <b>gaskets,</b> and Julia <b>sets.</b> Comment: 29 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{conformal}} loop ensemble CLEκ is {{the canonical}} conformally invariant probability measure on non-crossing loops {{in a proper}} sim-ply connected domain in the complex plane. The parameter κ varies between 8 / 3 and 8; CLE 8 / 3 is empty while CLE 8 is a single space-filling loop. In this work we study the geometry of the CLE <b>gasket,</b> the <b>set</b> of points not surrounded by any loop of the CLE. We show that the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of the gasket is bounded from below by 2 − (8 − κ) (3 κ − 8) /(32 κ) when 4 < κ < 8. Together {{with the work of}} Schramm–Sheffield–Wilson (2009) giving the up-per bound for all κ and the work of Nacu–Werner (2011) giving the matching lower bound for κ ≤ 4, this completes the determination of the CLEκ gasket dimension for all values of κ for which it is de-fined. The dimension agrees with the prediction of Duplantier–Saleur (1989) for the FK gasket...|$|R
40|$|The {{conformal}} loop ensemble CLE_κ is {{the canonical}} conformally invariant probability measure on noncrossing loops {{in a proper}} simply connected domain in the complex plane. The parameter κ varies between 8 / 3 and 8; CLE_ 8 / 3 is empty while CLE_ 8 is a single space-filling loop. In this work, we study the geometry of the CLE <b>gasket,</b> the <b>set</b> of points not surrounded by any loop of the CLE. We show that the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of the gasket is bounded from below by 2 -(8 -κ) (3 κ- 8) /(32 κ) when 4 <κ< 8. Together {{with the work of}} Schramm-Sheffield-Wilson [Comm. Math. Phys. 288 (2009) 43 - 53] giving the upper bound for all κ and the work of Nacu-Werner [J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2) 83 (2011) 789 - 809] giving the matching lower bound for κ< 4, this completes the determination of the CLE_κ gasket dimension for all values of κ for which it is defined. The dimension agrees with the prediction of Duplantier-Saleur [Phys. Rev. Lett. 63 (1989) 2536 - 2537] for the FK gasket.
