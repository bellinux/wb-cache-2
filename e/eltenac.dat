Design The patients applied 3 g tid <b>eltenac</b> gel 0. 1 %, 0. 3 %, 1 % or placebo gel {{over a period of}} 4 weeks. The patients were supplied with paracetamol tablets as an escape analgesic. Primary efficacy end-point was mean global pain in the week preceding the examinations, evaluated on a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary criteria were Lequesne's score ISK, Jezek score, muscle strength and dolorimeter measurements, walking time, clinical examination results of the knee joint and patient's and investigator's overall efficacy estimates. Results The graphical depiction of VAS and ISK suggested a dose-related efficacy, but the pre-planned statistical analysis did not show significant differences between treatments. In the patient subgroup with a higher degree of baseline severity of knee OA the ISK showed significant and relevant advantages of <b>eltenac</b> gel 1 % to placebo at different examination times. Two patients each of the <b>eltenac</b> gel 1 % group and the placebo group showed local intolerance reactions which subsided spontaneously. Conclusion This study did not provide confirmatory proof of an efficacy of topical <b>eltenac</b> in patients with knee OA. Methodological pitfalls and possible responder subgroups are described. Despite the difficulties, dose-finding studies seem to be feasible even with topical NSAIDs...|$|E
