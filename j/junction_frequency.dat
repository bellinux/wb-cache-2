In particular, the ionograms contain unusual traces at frequencies close to and above the conventional or basic maximum usable frequency, i. e. above the <b>junction</b> <b>frequency</b> of {{the high and low}} angle modes. A series of experiments have been undertaken {{over a period of several}} years to investigate off-great-circle propagation mechanisms over high latitude and sub-auroral oval paths. In addition to measurements of the signal direction of arrival, oblique ionograms were also recorded over several of the paths. By these means, the characteristic ionogram signatures associated with off-great-circle propagation effects arising due to the presence of convecting patches of enhanced ionisation or sun-aligned arcs within the polar cap ionosphere, or to the presence of steep gradients to the side of the path within the mid-latitude trough region, have been identified...|$|E

The measured output power generated by such multiplier employing the distributed SIS junction at the second harmonic of the input frequency is in good agreement with the model.

Most striking is an invariant A for G substitution in codon 95 of VH which results in an asparagine instead of aspartate at that position. Because of the apparent importance of this substitution in an anti-PC(PM) response, we wanted to determine the molecular basis for this base change. A cDNA library derived from pre-immune splenic B cells was examined for the frequency of VDJ containing the A substitution at 95 and the presence of additional point mutations in these sequences. Six different cDNA were isolated which contained an A substitution at the VD <b>junction</b> (<b>frequency</b> 0. 00009); a seventh positive cDNA could not be examined. The V segments of four of these cDNA matched known germline genes and were, therefore, unmutated. Two others closely matched V in families whose members have not all been characterized, hence, it is not known whether the mutations observed are somatic or germline in origin. Sequences of 35 cDNA clones, containing the same V segment but differing in D, J and junctional nucleotides, revealed no mutations. These results indicate that the A substitution generated at codon 95 is most likely a product of V-DJ joining...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of advanced components for the future wideband side band separating and / or multipixel receivers for radio-astronomy with ultimate sensitivity. In this thesis, a novel frequency multiplier based on distributed superconducting tunnel (SIS) junctions has been demonstrated for the first time, taking advantage of the extreme inherent nonlinearity of such device. This practical demonstration is the result of an extensive theoretical exploration and modelling, showing the importance of the reactive quasi-particle tunnel current {{and its impact on the}} SIS tunnel <b>junction</b> <b>frequency</b> multiplier. In addition, a novel technique was suggested that allows for the first time direct measurement of the reactive quasi-particle tunnel current. This work comprehends the analysis, design and characterisation of the first frequency multiplier using distributed SIS junctions. The measured output power generated by the distributed SIS junction at the second harmonic of the input frequency were in good agreement with the model. Furthermore, the distributed SIS junction as a frequency multiplier were for the first time able to pump an SIS mixer. An efficiency of the distributed SIS junction multiplier of 15 - 30 % for a fractional bandwidth of 10 % with excellent spectral line purity were demonstrated. The - 3 dB line width of the multiplied signal is better than 1 Hz, which were the lowest resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyser. Consequently, the results attained in this work show that the distributed SIS <b>junction</b> <b>frequency</b> multiplier has considerable future potential, and could possibly be used in LO source in single-ended and multi-pixel SIS mixer layouts. Furthermore, in order to improve the sideband rejection ratio of cryogenically cooled sideband separating receivers for radio astronomy receivers to more than 15 dB over a wide RF and IF bandwidth, novel wideband RF and IF hybrid couplers have been developed and demonstrated with very low imbalances. More specifically, a 4 - 8 GHz IF assembly comprising a compact 90 ° hybrid chip, two bias-T circuits and two transmission line circuits was designed and characterised. The compact size of the hybrid chip allows it to be integrated into virtually any sideband separating (2 SB) mixer operating at cryogenic temperatures and is furthermore especially advantageous for multi-pixel 2 SB receivers or low noise balanced amplifier layouts. The characterisation of the hybrid assembly was performed at a cryogenic temperature of 4 K and sophisticated calibration and fixture de-embedding procedures were used. To further improve the sideband rejection ratio, a novel design for a RF 90 ° waveguide hybrid with very low amplitude imbalance over a fractional bandwidth of 30 % (159 - 216 GHz) was demonstrated. Both Hybrids are currently implemented in the ALMA Band 5 receivers, which represent the state-of-the-art for ultra-low noise sideband separated receivers. In order to allow complete characterisation of the ALMA Band 5 cartridge a highly versatile measurement setup has been built. The measurement setup includes all necessary hardware and achieves automatic measurements for the system noise and sideband rejection with in-built optimisation procedures. The measurement setup additionally comprises measurements of the receiver saturation, phase and amplitude stability, as well as optical beam characterisation...|$|E
40|$|The rate of DNA {{mutation}} {{is known}} to fluctuate across the genome but the patterns of mutation rate variation and molecular causes are poorly defined. It {{is important to understand}} these patterns of mutation as they influence where deleterious mutations are likely to arise and how rapidly sequences are likely to accumulate change between species, a measure often used as a proxy for functional constraint. In this work I investigate the relationship between DNA replication and apparent mutation hotspots adjacent to transcription factor binding sites. In eukaryotes both DNA strands are replicated simultaneously, the leading strand as a continuous stretch and the lagging strand as a series of discrete Okazaki fragments that are subsequently ligated together. Some transcription factors are able to bind the DNA lagging strand during replication and act as a partial barrier to DNA polymerase, resulting in the accumulation of Okazaki fragment junctions adjacent to these sites. I find that mutation rate is correlated genome wide with Okazaki <b>junction</b> <b>frequency,</b> suggesting that Okazaki junction processing may be error-prone. We present a mechanistic hypothesis to explain this locally elevated mutation rate and propose a role for lagging strand replication and its error-prone Pol α tract retention in the formation of these hotspots. I test this hypothesis using Okazaki fragment sequencing data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify peaks in Okazaki junctions. When these peaks are aligned and orientated, so that the direction of lagging strand replication is uniform, I find a peak in substitution rate immediately downstream of Okazaki junctions, precisely where Pol α tract retention is predicted to occur. Novel binding motifs are identified within the underlying DNA of these junctions that can be assigned to known strong and fast-binding transcription factors, previously implicated in the phasing of nucleosomes, such as Reb 1. I show that mutation hotspots adjacent to transcription factor binding sites are a conserved feature of eukaryotic genomes. In the human genome I predict sites of preferential Pol α retention using DNase I hypersensitivity footprint data. We observe that those footprints predicted as germline-specific manifest an elevated mutation signature. I propose that the rapid binding of some transcription factors to DNA following replication is required for nucleosome positioning or other important functions, however this incurs a cost in terms of locally elevated mutation rate adjacent to and within the sequence specific binding site. As a consequence these binding sites are biologically important mutational hotspots whose functional significance has been systematically underestimated by standard measures of sequence constraint...|$|E
