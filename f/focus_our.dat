Bourguiba saw in this case a victory that could rally the bourgeois class, considered to be collaborating with France, and unify the country around nationalism.

2500|$|The {{sheer volume}} of {{political}} propaganda cartoons featuring Bryan {{is a testament to}} the amusement and fear he caused among conservatives. Bryan campaigned tirelessly, championing the ideas of the farmers and workers, using his skills as a famed orator to ultimately reshape the Democratic Party into a more progressive one. These political cartoons attacked just about every facet of Bryan’s character and policy. They mocked his religious fervor, his campaign slogans, and even his ability to unify parties for a common cause. As Keen puts it, [...] "The art of propaganda is to create a portrait that incarnates the idea of what we wish to destroy so we will react rather than think, and automatically <b>focus</b> <b>our</b> free-floating hostility, indistinct frustrations, and unnamed fears". Bryan embodied these fears of the Republican Party of the time, which is clearly evident in the lengths they went to deface his character in these cartoons.|$|E

I don't think we want to open up another front there and nor do the Yemenis want us to do that. So we have to find other ways of doing these things and in the meantime making sure Afghanistan doesn't revert to becoming, if you like, a 'second Yemen' – that is the Army's primary duty at the moment.

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) can be {{isolated}} from bone marrow and can differentiate {{in a variety}} of cell types, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myoblasts, hepatocytes, and neural cells. For this reason, MSCs are very promising for the development of cell-based therapy for degenerative diseases. Understanding the mechanisms behind MSC cell fate determination is not easy, since the molecular processes that drive differentiation are complex and poorly understood. Even though in the recent years many improvements have been done, many mechanism need to be elucidated. We planned to investigate on differentiation mechanisms of MSC and, in particular, we <b>focused</b> <b>our</b> activities towards osteoblast differentiation; at this aim, we have silenced specific mRNAs using a mouse shRNA library in a 96 well plate-based screening strategy. With this methodology we identified sevral genes that are possible candidates for a role in osteoblast differentiation. Among the candidate genes, a consistent fraction was represented by genes whose function is still unknown: we <b>focused</b> <b>our</b> attention on a short number of these genes that we named ObI (Osteoblast inducer). In this thesis project we <b>focused</b> <b>our</b> experiments on a particular gene, that we named ObI- 1. We also considered genes identified during the screening with a known function but an unknown role during the osteogenic differentiation process. Among these genes we <b>focused</b> <b>our</b> attention on Angiotensin receptor 1 (AT 1 R), whose role in osteogenic differentiation had been previously suggested. For both candidates that we analyzed for this project we confirmed the effects of silencing on osteogenic differentiation and we analyzed expression in tissues and in our cell culture system. Furthermore, we characterized function and mechanism of action in osteoblastogenesis for both genes...|$|R
