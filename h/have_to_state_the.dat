To define, so that our definition shall have any scientific value, requires no small portion of that sagacity by which truth is detected.... When it has been clearly seen what ought to be our definition, it must be pretty well known what truth we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> definition, as well as the discovery, supposes a decided step in our knowledge to have been made. The writers on Logic, in the Middle Ages, made Definition the last stage in the progress of knowledge; and in this arrangement at least, the history of science, and the philosophy derived from the history, confirm their speculative views.” For in order to judge finally how the name which denotes a class may best be defined, we must know all the properties common to the class, and all the relations of causation or dependence among those properties.|$|E

5000|$|I {{am sorry}} that I suspect Lord Reading of {{complicity}} in the plot to unman India for eternity. A friend has suggested an alternative. Hesays that whilst Lord Reading must {{be held responsible for}} the threats used by him in his recent utterances, he might be quite unaware of thelawlessness of the subordinate officials or that he must have become helpless, the subordinate officials having simply disregarded hiswishes to be strictly within the law. I must reject both the interpretations. Lord Reading, if he is trying legitimately to suppress popular lawlessness, must study and regulate the development of his campaign which he will not even allow to be called repression. If hissubordinates being interested parties have gone out of hand, he must forthwith resign, at least publicly disown and condemn such illegalitiesand assaults and not attempt to excuse them on the flimsy plea of”trying times”. I have myself suggested a possible explanation. HisExcellency sympathizes with our aspirations, and knowing his own countrymen, realizes that we have got to be severely tried before theythink of coming to terms; he is, therefore, trying and directing repression to see how far we are capable of bearing it and, therefore,sincere in our desire for freedom, and then having made out a case for us his clients, desires to compel a settlement. I am afraid, however, thatI <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> case only to be rejected. Human nature does not work quite that way. Lord Reading is not so entirely selfless, and if heis, he cannot possibly remain in charge of a Government which under its present constitution can give no relief to the people. It is, therefore,with the greatest reluctance that [...] I am forced to conclude that Lord Reading is trying to emasculate India by forcibly making free speechand popular organization impossible. I am prepared to believe that in all this he thinks that he is doing good to us and that we are not yet fit to be called men and women. He will soon have his eyes opened. We must not quarrel with his belief. Nor need we feel anxious about it. Let us acquit ourselves like men and women and we shall find that everything and everybody become favourable to us." ...|$|E

40|$|The general {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is to develop software to support the handling of the increased complexity of architectural design. In this paper we describe a system providing general support during the whole process. Instead of only developing design tools we are also addressing the problem of the operating environment of these tools. We conclude that design tools have to be integrated in an open, modular, distributed, user friendly and efficient environment. Two major fields have to be addressed - the development of design tools and the realisation of an integrated system as their operation environment. We will briefly focus on the latter by discussing known technologies in the field of information technology and other design disciplines {{that can be used to}} realise such an environment. Regarding the first subject we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> need of a detailed tool specification. As a solution we suggest a strategy where the tool functions are specified on the basis of a transformation, where a hierarchical process model is mapped into specifications of different design tools realising appropriate support for all sub-processes of architectural design. Using this strategy the main steps to develop such a support system are: implementation of a framework as basis for the integrated design system decision whether the tool specification are already implemented in available tools in this case these tools can be integrated using known methods for tool coupling otherwise new design tools have to be developed according to the framewor...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we discuss the}} {{different}} methods for the solution of hermitian and complex one matrix models with special emphasis on the collective field theory for the corresponding eigenvalue model and the moment method which we apply to the complex matrix model. Following an introduction to matrix models in which we describe their connection to quantum gravity and the coupling of conformal matter to gravity we present briefly two well known methods for their solution. While the saddle point method is only capable to give the planar result {{we can use the}} orthogonal polynomial method to determine also the topological expansion, although it becomes non tractable for generic potential and higher genera. In the first main part of the thesis we then investigate the collective field theory for the eigenvalue model as another proposed method for solving matrix models. Changing variables from the finite number of matrix eigenvalues to a continuous eigenvalue density the model can be reformulated as an one dimensional field theory with two scalar fields. For the free energy in the semiclassical expansion we get contributions from the classical saddle point configuration, the 1 -loop determinant and the Feynman diagrams which are obtained from the interactions terms using the free propagators. In the course of the calculation we are faced with difficulties - mainly due to singularities - of technical kind as well as of principle nature. Thus we are not able to obtain a systematic 1 /N expansion of the free energy and so <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> collective field method as being inferior to the orthogonal polynomial method and the moment method.
