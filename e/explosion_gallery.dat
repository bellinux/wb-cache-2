40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent research}} to evaluate Gypsum plaster seal designs in the full-scale pressure test facility at Londonderry, NSW. After the Moura Number 2 Mine explosion {{a review of}} the safety of coal mine operations resulted in changes to mining legislation where ventilation control devices (VCDs) were required to be tested in an internationally recognised mine testing <b>explosion</b> <b>gallery</b> to achieve over pressure ratings of 14, 35, 70, 140 or 345 kPa. Since this disaster, Minova has live tested all VCD designs to provide validation test data for design purposes. In recent years validation and certification of seal designs has been undertaken by Queensland Registered Professional Engineers (RPEQs) using laboratory measured seal material properties as input to 3 -dimensional numerical models. As an engineering material, mining plaster has properties that approximate to those of a low-strength concrete. Unlike concrete, mining plaster gains strength extremely rapidly and this makes it ideal for constructing seals where downtime while waiting for material strength literally costs money. As a result of these properties, Sprayplast UW VCDs can be rapidly brought into service as explosion rated and/or water holding seals and stoppings. Previous full-scale explosion testing carried out in Australia at Testsafe’s Londonderry <b>Explosion</b> <b>Gallery</b> (Pearson, 1999) has shown that mining plaster stoppings can resist significant blast pressures. This paper describes a recent series of full-scale explosion tests carried out at the Londonderry Testing facility in NSW, which were intended to build on experience gained from earlier tests carried out at the Lake Lynn experimental mine in the USA and at Londonderry, NSW in 1999. The testing process and instrumentation layout will be described in which each seal design was subjected to a series of explosions progressively increasing in intensity until seal failure resulted. Two seal designs at 100 and 150 mm nominal thickness were constructed and instrumented to provide time-related overpressure and wall deflection response during the controlled series of explosions in separate test programs. Suppliers worked to develop reliable engineering designs, with results of the testing used to calibrate a numerical engineering model for Sprayplast UW mining plaster {{that can be used to}} design seals for overpressures up to the maximum currently legislated in Australia. The model can also be used to design bulkhead thicknesses for water retention. In addition to theoretical analysis, this paper also considers some of the practicalities of seal location, design, construction and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of RETIMET metal foam as a flame arrester on explosion-proof enclosures was {{investigated by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines both in laboratory tests and at the U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA's) Approval and Certification Center, Triadelphia, WV. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a permissible pressure vent for use on lightweight, vented, explosion- proof enclosures. In laboratory tests, four grades of RETIMET, a stainless steel foam material, were evaluated: (1) 45 NC- 7, (2) 45 NC- 13, (3) 80 NC- 7, and (4) 80 NC- 13. Explosive gas mixtures were prepared by a dynamic flow system. Ignition was by a low-voltage arc. Each grade of RETIMET metal foam successfully arrested the flame front in all methane-air tests. To evaluate RETIMET metal foam on large, commercial size enclosures, a multicompartmented enclosure was designed and tested in MSHA's <b>explosion</b> <b>gallery</b> in Triadelphia, WV. Extensive explosion testing revealed that a minimum vent-area-to-enclosure-volume ratio of 11. 33 in 2 /ft 3 is required to keep internal pressure rises below 3 psig. The RETIMET metal foam functioned satisfactorily in all tests as evidenced by the absence of external ignitions...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{challenges}} arising from changes to regulations covering ventilation control devices in Queensland. There is a paucity of information on the appropriate selection and use of stopping and seals in mines. Compounding this until recently there was no prospect of the development of a full-scale test facility within Australia. The paper describes recent research undertaken to both develop, evaluate and calibrate a full-scale pressure test facility for ventilation control devices (VCD) within Australia, and examine a number of important aspects of stopping and seal performance, usage, design and application for the coal mining industry. A review of the safety of coal mining operations after the Moura Number 2 explosion resulted in changes to mining regulations in Queensland. Under the new regulations, ventilation control devices are required to be tested at “an internationally recognised mine testing <b>explosion</b> <b>gallery</b> ” to achieve pressure ratings of 14, 35, 70, 140 or 345 kPa. These changes have highlighted the lack of information of the appropriate selection and use of stopping seals in mines and the strategic need {{for the development of a}} full-scale test facility within Australia. A combination of computational fluid dynamics (to model the methane/air explosion through time an...|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises an {{evaluation}} of an existing Australian explosion research facility {{in order to examine}} its suitability for determining the explosion resistance of ventilation control devices (VCDs). A combination of computational fluid dynamics (to model the methane/air explosion through time and space), finite element analysis (to model the structure’s response to the pressure impulse) and measurements from full-scale tests were used in this study. Comparisons were made between the theoretically predicted, practically measured results and those found for the same designs tested at an established experimental mine, namely the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM). This paper also summarises the results of a survey of current Australian coalmine ventilation practices. Information was obtained of practices {{both before and after the}} introduction of new QLD coalmine ventilation regulations. The research has shown that the TestSafe Australia <b>Explosions</b> <b>Gallery</b> is acceptable for testing of VCDs up to 70 kPa. This facility proved unsatisfactory for high-pressure tests on seals. Options for the verification of the explosion resistances of high-pressure seals are given...|$|R
50|$|In 1932 five of six miners {{working on}} a {{ventilation}} fan at Mawstone Mine were killed after an <b>explosion</b> filled the <b>gallery</b> with carbon monoxide. The sixth miner was able to reach the surface and raise the alarm. A rescue party of two workers and the mine manager descended into the mine, but were themselves killed by the fumes. Although Mawstone Mine was eventually closed, a water supply for the village is still obtained from this site.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to receiving recognition, Arnold Mikelson was also big on giving it. He taught at several local schools, sharing his gift {{and his love}} of art with all who showed interest, and he was especially concerned with helping children develop appreciation for art. School children visiting the Mind and Matter Gallery would hear a talk from Mary Mikelson, Arnold’s loving wife, and he would demonstrate carving to the students, showing them, explaining, and allowing them to touch, feel, and try their own small hands at carving. Mary continues to this day, years after Arnold’s untimely death, with the parade of wide-eyed children through the <b>Gallery’s</b> <b>explosion</b> of beauty and finery, a perfect tribute to Arnold’s memory.|$|R
50|$|Originally opened as a {{cooperative}} gallery in 1963 near Park Place in Lower Manhattan, in 1965 it {{moved to a}} new and larger location at 542 West Broadway. The gallery was a large open exhibition space with an office and second showing space in the back. In general there were two-person exhibitions each featuring a painter and a sculptor in the larger front room, and a small selection of artists work in the back room. The first director of Park Place Gallery was John Gibson who later opened his own gallery in the early 1970s. He was succeeded by Paula Cooper who after Park Place Gallery closed in the late 1960s opened the Paula Cooper Gallery in SoHo. She became a pioneer of the contemporary art scene and a forerunner of the population <b>explosion</b> of art <b>galleries</b> in New York City during the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Questions {{have been}} raised about the {{effectiveness}} of ventilation control devices (VCDs) to safely resist explosions during their intended life. This functionality depends on the ability of the VCDs and in particular seals to withstand changes in the behaviour of the strata, particularly where longwall abutments influence the stress regime in and around the chain pillars. As a consequence of an explosion impact on a seal, the surrounding strata could experience increased loads possibly resulting in permanent deformation and requiring grout consolidation. These aspects of seal design have been investigated using advanced numerical analysis. Globally since the early 20 th century, to protect underground personnel, ventilation seal designs have been required to be tested at an internationally recognized <b>explosion</b> test <b>gallery</b> to achieve pressure ratings required by legislation. The last two decades has seen advances in materials technology and engineering of structures. It has become accepted practice to use numerical methods to provide engineering ratings for mine seals in line with other industries where the elimination of prototype testing provides more rapid product introduction to the market. Before presenting the results of numerical analysis, structural aspects of seal design are simply explained including arching behaviour and the contribution of dynamic magnification due to impact loads. High-fidelity physics-based computer simulations using software LS-DYNA were able to predict the results from physical testing of mine based seals in a most realistic way. Test data from live gas/coal dust deflagration explosions at Lake Lynn, PA, USDA along with pressure-time curves recently developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health {{as a result of the}} study of explosive atmospheres, were used to simulate a realistic loading environment caused by 138 kPa (20 - psi) and 345 kPa (50 -psi) explosions in physics-based models of seals...|$|R
