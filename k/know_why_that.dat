On {{the lyric}} side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> is. People quite often say, 'oh, you write these sad lyrics but you're not a sad person' - and I'm not... I don't think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side." ...|$|E
2500|$|November 9 [...] Following John Kerry's {{loss in the}} 2004 election, Cameron Kerry, John Kerry's {{brother and}} {{political}} confidante states in regards to another presidential run [...] "That's conceivable... I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> [...] should necessarily be it. I think it's too early to assess. But I {{think that he is}} going to continue to fight on for the values, ideals, and issues this campaign is about." ...|$|E
6000|$|Do you <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> man that's got a cropped head [...] Rubbed it {{just now}} {{as if he}} felt a fly? [...] Could it be, Bobby, {{something}} that I dropped? [...] And is that why? ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Varden {{began to}} think (she {{scarcely}} <b>knew</b> <b>why)</b> <b>that</b> the young Mr Chester {{must be in the}} wrong and the old Mr Chester must be in the right.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I only <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> satan√© Englishman throws so much {{calligraphy}} about," [...] he said, [...] "I {{would be}} easier in my mind. Now this senseless rhyme ... I don't see...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps!" [...] {{interrupted}} Lingard. [...] "But you needn't feel hopeless. I am not {{at liberty}} to give up my life for your own. Mrs. Travers <b>knows</b> <b>why.</b> <b>That,</b> too, is engaged." ...|$|R
60|$|I felt, but I am sure I don't <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> <b>that</b> {{this was}} self-denying and devoted in Mrs. Micawber, and I uttered a murmur to that effect. Traddles, {{who took his}} tone from me, did likewise, still looking at the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Mr. Thurnall,--My {{father would}} have written himself, but he thought, I don't <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> <b>that</b> I could tell you better than he. Your father is quite well in health,"--Thurnall {{breathes}} freely again--"but he has had heavy trials since your poor brother William's death." ...|$|E
60|$|Good heavens! And {{was this}} {{the era of the}} Conquest that I had hoped to see! I had always taken for granted, I do not <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> <b>that</b> {{humanity}} was destined to move forward. This picture of what seemed desolation on the ruins of our civilisation rendered me almost speechless.|$|E
60|$|Mentally I {{had named}} them Bones and Johnson. I do not <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> except <b>that</b> {{they seemed to}} deserve it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{place where}} the clash of the Nazis [...] "marching for Berlin" [...] with the Bavarian police was filmed bears no {{resemblance}} {{at all to the}} Odeonsplatz in Munich where the actual clash took place. Odeonsplatz still looks very much as it did back then and it is not <b>known</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> clash was not filmed on location there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still keeping silence, I {{looked out}} over the sea. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> except <b>that</b> I instinctively looked {{anywhere}} rather than look at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{wife was}} astounded--wounded beyond measure. She thought me--filthy. All her pride raged at me. One {{particularly}} humiliating thing came out--humiliating for me. There {{was a second}} co-respondent. I hadn't heard of him before the trial. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> should be so acutely humiliating. There's no logic in these things. It was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> should be," [...] she answered. [...] "I have {{certainly}} {{done nothing to}} make you so much my friend. If you were {{to tell me you}} intended to leave us to-morrow, I am afraid that I should not venture to ask you to stay. But whether you go or stay, let us not talk of Roderick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, yes, quite right," [...] said Mr. H., taking from {{a pigeon}} {{hole in the}} desk a large pocket book, and {{beginning}} to turn it over; and, as before, abstractedly repeating, [...] "Quite right, quite right?" [...] till the little boy became reassured, and began to think, although he didn't <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> <b>that</b> his mother had done something quite meritorious.|$|E
5000|$|But it wasn't until a {{year later}} it that finally got the name it is known by today. Another American whaler, John D. Sampson named it after his vessel, the Nassau. It is not <b>known</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> name finally stuck, {{especially}} as another whale ship which sighted the island the following year tried to rename it [...] "New-Port Island". (Information verified from academic research in the Cook Islands Library and Museum) ...|$|R
60|$|Heaven only <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> {{entrapped}} female {{had declined}} the proffered assistance of her species-why she had elected to ruin her boots in preference to having them removed from her feet. Upon {{that day when}} the grave shall give up its dead, and the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed, I shall know all about it; but I want to know now. A Tale of Two Feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Craig," [...] he continued, [...] "you're {{coming with}} us. You {{know the way}} to Port Said and we want you--you <b>know</b> <b>why.</b> Untie <b>that</b> sash from your waist. Quickly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not altogether. I {{hate the}} Chefe at San Roque. You <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> is natural, and, after all, {{it was you}} who had him sent there. Apart from that, is it not clear that he and the trader Herrero and Domingo play into each other's hands up yonder? The traffic they are engaged in is authorized, but {{the way in which it}} is carried out is an iniquity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've heard strange tales o' husbands in my time," [...] {{observed}} the widow in a lowered voice. [...] "They {{say that when}} the saints were upon the earth devils used to take husbands' forms o' nights, and get poor women into all sorts of trouble. But I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> should come into my head, for {{it is only a}} tale... What a wind and rain it is to-night! Well--don't be in a hurry to alter things, my dear. Think it over." ...|$|E
60|$|She uttered some faint cries (it was {{the only}} moment in which I have known Grizel to be hysterical), and then she ran {{to her room and}} locked herself in--herself and it. Do you <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> look of elation had come {{suddenly}} to her face? It was because he had not even written the address in a disguised hand to deceive the postmistress. So much of the old Grizel was gone that the pathos of her elation over this was lost to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true; but {{how could}} your father owe such a sum as that, and no one <b>know</b> it? <b>Why,</b> <b>that</b> must be four or five {{thousand}} pounds?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Changing others behavior, {{without letting}} them <b>know</b> <b>why</b> or even <b>that</b> {{you are doing}} it.|$|R
500|$|In 2012, he rebutted two longstanding rumors: {{one that}} he {{appeared}} as a soldier on a train in Biloxi Blues (1988), saying, [...] "No. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that's</b> on IMDb, but I never was in that", and the other that he is related to dancer Lacey Schwimmer, saying, [...] "No, not at all. Please set the record straight. I guess it's a natural assumption {{because we have the}} same last name, but no. I've never even met her".|$|R
6000|$|... "And I just {{beginning}} to enjoy it! There's contrariness!--To say? Well, now, a good deal, my dear. I thought of writing. But it's better--safer to talk. The first thing is this. While you have been malingering down here I have {{had to face the}} whole Monnerie orchestra. It hasn't been playing quite in tune; and you <b>know</b> <b>why.</b> <b>That</b> lovesick Susan, now, and her nice young man. But since you seem to be quite yourself again--more of yourself than ever, in fact: listen." [...] I gazed, almost hypnotized, through the sunshine into her shady face.|$|E
60|$|The fog was {{as close}} as ever, but the swell almost down. They had laid the brig to, not knowing {{precisely}} where they were, and the wind (what little there was of it) not serving well for their true course. Some of the hands were still hearkening for breakers; but the captain and the two officers were in the waist with their heads together. It struck me (I don't <b>know</b> <b>why)</b> <b>that</b> they were after no good; and the first word I heard, as I drew softly near, more than confirmed me.|$|E
60|$|He {{could have}} killed them all. He thought how jolly {{it would be to}} jab a chisel (he didn't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> {{particular}} instrument came into his mind) into their necks. What beasts men were! He wished he could believe in hell so as to comfort himself with the thought of the horrible tortures which would be theirs. Mr. Jacobs turned his attention to treatment. He talked partly to the boy's father and partly to the students. Philip put on his sock and laced his boot. At last the surgeon finished. But he seemed to have an afterthought and turned to Philip.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Torfrida. [...] "I {{have read}} {{of such things}} in books of the ancients, and I have watched them making continually,--I little <b>knew</b> <b>why,</b> or <b>that</b> I should ever turn engineer." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{followed}} him, I don't quite <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> except <b>that</b> we {{wished to}} breathe freely outside, also {{we knew that}} the sepulchre and its contents would be as safe as they had been for--well, how long? ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course they}} all <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> it was <b>that</b> {{the conduct of}} the Squire was so like the conduct of a madman.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may not be}} safe {{to venture}} {{anything}} of the kind," [...] and Horry looked around {{in the hope that}} some of the Britishers might be near at hand. [...] "Of course when there are three to one, I cannot expect to hold my ground; but let me warn you of this, Saul Ogden: Whatever you do to me while the odds are in your favor, shall be paid back an hundred fold before you are outside these lines! Now I <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> little French sneak claimed that there was a short cut through the woods from the York road to the Hamilton plantation. You fellows were hiding somewhere nearabout, and he counted on joining you without my knowledge." ...|$|E
60|$|The widow {{hardly knew}} what answer to make. She was quite aware {{that her father}} would not be at all thankful to Mr. Slope; she had a strong wish to share her father's feelings; and yet she could not but {{acknowledge}} that Mr. Slope was very kind. Her father, who was generally so charitable to all men, who seldom spoke ill of anyone, had warned her against Mr. Slope, and yet {{she did not know}} how to abstain from thanking him. What interest could he have in the matter but that which he professed? Nevertheless there was that in his manner which even she distrusted. She felt, she did not <b>know</b> <b>why,</b> <b>that</b> there was something about him which ought to put her on her guard.|$|E
60|$|But I {{must return}} to the Generalizations, Psychologizings, Deductions. When M. Bourget is {{exploiting}} these arts, it is then that he is peculiarly and particularly himself. His ways are wholly original when he encounters a trait or a custom which is new to him. Another person would merely examine the find, verify it, estimate its value, and let it go; {{but that is not}} sufficient for M. Bourget: he always wants to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> thing exists, he wants to know how it came to happen; and he will not let go of it until he has found out. And in every instance he will find that reason where no one but himself would have thought of looking for it. He does not seem to care for a reason that is not picturesquely located; one might almost say picturesquely and impossibly located.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not worthy}} of such an honour, madam. I shall study to deserve it." [...] And he bowed himself out, the same sturdy, self-confident Tom, doing right, he hardly <b>knew</b> <b>why,</b> save <b>that</b> {{it was all in}} the way of business.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{were they}} unpleasant? Why were they unpleasant? She wouldn't let {{you come and}} dine with me in London. I never <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> was. When she did what was wrong, of course I had to tell her. Who else should tell her but her husband? If you had been her husband, and I only an acquaintance, then I might have said what I pleased. They rebel against the yoke {{because it is a}} yoke. And yet they accept the yoke, knowing it to be a yoke. It comes of the devil. You think a priest can put {{everything}} right." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary came home; {{and if she}} <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> <b>that</b> {{long walk}} had been urged on her, she gave no sign. She saw her mother worn and tired, and she {{restrained}} all perception that she was conscious {{that there had been}} agitation. She spoke quietly of the spring flowers that she had seen, and of the people whom she had met; she gave her mother her tea, and moved about with almost an increase of the studied quietness of the sick-room. Only, when Mrs. Frost came in for an hour, Mary drew back into a corner with her knitting, and did not speak.|$|R
