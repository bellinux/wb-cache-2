40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness of single embryo transfer <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional frozen thawed single embryo transfer, if more embryos are available, {{as compared to}} double embryo transfer in relation to female age. Study design: We used a decision tree model to {{evaluate the}} costs from a healthcare provider perspective and the pregnancy rates of two embryo transfer policies: one fresh single embryo transfer <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer, if more embryos are available (strategy I), and double embryo transfer (strategy II). The analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the robustness of our model and to identify which model parameters had the strongest impact on the results. Results: SET <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer if available was dominant, less costly and more effective, over DET in women under 32 years. In women aged 32 or older DET was more effective than SET <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer if available but also more costly. Conclusion: SET <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer should be the preferred strategy in women under 32 undergoing IVF. The choice for SET <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer or DET in women aged 32 or older depends on individual patient preferences and on how much society {{is willing to pay}} for an extra child. There is a strong need for a randomized clinical trial comparing the cost and effects of SET <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer and DET in the latter category of women.
