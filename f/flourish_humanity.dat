40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore the {{narrative}} catechesis and elements of religious pedagogy in C. S. Lewis’ “The Chronicles of Narnia” and to critically ponder on the following questions: To what extent is the message of faith conveyed to the reader by Lewis’ story-telling? In which way is a narrative approach to theology and catechesis articulated and realised? Why is the narrative catechesis useful and what is {{its role in the}} context of the overall mission of the Church i. e. the preaching of the Gospel? In order to provide answers to these questions the first part of this paper outlines a Christian allegory of the Narnian stories. The second part deals with the formalistic approach as using allegory, allusion, and symbolism to interpret Lewis’ narrative. The third part outlines the need for a critical awareness and the role of theological narrative in <b>flourishing</b> <b>humanity</b> and human wholeness. The concluding section presents an overall assessment of Lewis’s Christian fantasy and its faith-shaping impact...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{my study}} is to augment the ideas that are {{associated}} with sustainability. A particular aim is to link <b>flourishing</b> <b>humanity</b> and <b>flourishing</b> nature together in this concept. To achieve this, I discuss some beliefs, values and institutions that appear to hinder and some that appear capable of facilitating a shift towards ecological sustainability based on human well-being. Key to this discussion is the concept of 2 ̆ 7 dematerialization 2 ̆ 7 or the process of adjusting the economy and way of life to the shrinking access to natural resources; 2 ̆ 7 dematerialization 2 ̆ 7 demonstrates the need to challenge many of the fundamental aspects of the dominant capitalist approach to our economy on social and environmental grounds. Ultimately these explorations lead to the final conclusion for this study: that rather than 2 ̆ 7 market mechanisms 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 planning 2 ̆ 7 based on research, analysis, and policy is the most effective organizing method for achieving ecological sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Professor Whitehead is a Living Educational Theorist {{based in}} the UK. Previously at the University of Bath, {{he is now a}} Visiting Professor at the University of Cumbria, UK and Ningxia Teachers University in Ningxia, China. He {{originated}} the idea that individuals could create their own explanations of their educational influences in their own learning, in the learning of others and in the learning of the social formations in which their inquiries are located, as their living-educational-theories. He pioneered the use of digital, multi-media narratives for clarifying and evolving the meanings of the expression of embodied values in explanations of educational influence, in research degrees. The resources on his website [URL] are an international resource for action researchers who are generating their own living-theories with values that carry hope for the <b>flourishing</b> of <b>humanity.</b> These theories are generated from inquiries of the kind, “How do I improve what I am doing?

Bankim’s Dharmatattva presents a form of Vaiṣṇavism which has strong this-worldly emphases, and which promotes the <b>flourishing</b> of our <b>humanity</b> in which all natural propensities are perfectly harmonised. These themes also run throughout Bhudeb’s Sāmājika Prabandha and Chandranath’s Hindutva which defend certain Advaitically-tinged forms of Hindu dharma which {{are said to be}} superior to western religions such as Christianity, promote this-worldly modes of living, and provide integrative frameworks for diverse aspects of Hindu thought and practice.|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ What are the {{implications}} for education of the emergent global challenges of sustainability? Various studies suggest that major changes are required in predominant human values {{during the next two}} generations, to ensure politically and environmentally sustainable societies and a sustainable global order. Three required moves, according to The Earth Charter and the Great Transition study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (Earth Charter Commission; Raskin et al. 2002), are the following: from pursuit of human fulfilment predominantly through consumerism, to a focus on quality of life above quantity of commercial activity; from the predominance of possessive individualism, towards more human solidarity; and from a stance of human domination and exploitation of nature, towards an ecological sensitivity. This essay considers such a neo-Stoic project—covering, broadly speaking, the cultivation of <b>humanity’s</b> <b>flourishing</b> as individuals, as collectivity, and in and towards our natural environment, each of them as desirable in themselves and in order to preserve humankind...|$|R

The aim is to forge a new path to resolving ancient issues that developed with the separation of two once closely related disciplines, law and religion. In answering the question 2 ̆ 2 Why should law {{have the power to}} command obedience of those subject to the law? 2 ̆ 2 this essay will reflect on religious, aesthetic, and other answers, arguing for aesthetics as the approach that can bridge the long separation of law and religion in the West. Aesthetics is a compelling common source of insight to support the <b>flourishing</b> of <b>humanity</b> in community and in the natural world. 2 ̆ 2 (p. 113 - 114) In the book, leading scholars in ethics, theology, and social science sum up three years of study and conversation regarding the value of interdisciplinary theological inquiry.

40|$|The {{original}} idea {{for this book}} came to me {{from a series of}} lectures that I deliver to final year undergraduate students. The purpose of these lectures was (and is) to use ideas about community to understand how social policy is formulated and implemented across a wide spectrum of issues. Much, if not most, social policy literature tends to assume that social reality consists of what appear to be almost two dimensions: on the one hand, structures, processes, institutions, systems, etc, and on the other hand, perspectives, ideologies, values, etc. In fact, however, these two dimensions are inextricably intertwined, and a focus on community as both idea and practice serves to reveal this. Having decided, then, to focus on community and signed a contract with the publishers, I had already written a few chapters before I stumbled upon what appeared to have the potential to be the unifying theme that I was looking for – one that embodied both the ideal and potential realisation of community as meaningful interconnectedness. This was the idea of a beloved community, derived from Martin Luther King. According to this idea, the ideal of community can only be achieved through the actual flourishing of all of its individual members. I then used this deceptively simple idea to evaluate a range of policies and practices and indeed a variety of kinds of community. I leave the reader to judge how successful (or not) I have been in making this evaluation. The reader should also be forewarned that, in the concluding chapter, I attempt to explain the spiritual meaning of community (as conveyed in the expression ‘community spirit’) as an imagined wellspring of social action. Following what is perhaps now the mainstream literature on spirituality, I make an important distinction between desire and attachment: desire is an attribute of the ego (or soul), while attachment is to do with connections that exist {{even in the absence of}} desire. To try and make more sense of this, I have used concepts from Buddhism, since the Buddha’s teachings reflect my own concerns with achieving meaningful interconnectedness through the cessation of desire. The <b>flourishing</b> of <b>humanity</b> as a whole occurs precisely through this free (that is, free from desire) communion among all human beings. And lest this seem impossibly utopian, I also argue that it is no more utopian than what is currently expected by governments from their citizens...|$|R
40|$|This project aims {{to bring}} artistic methods of inquiry {{to bear on}} current debates about the ontological {{distinction}} between persons and things that have emerged {{in the face of}} ecological crises. My dissertation presents an experimental ethnography that traces material and immaterial encounters around the Bancroft Ranch House Museum in East County San Diego. An obscure national and state historical landmark, the small museum is housed in an adobe that was built by white settlers on former Kumeyaay land and then bought by the historian Hubert Howe Bancroft in the late 19 th century. A historically contested site, the museum also acts as a social hub and market place for a medley of things ranging from artifacts to discarded goods. My work takes its cue from the museum’s unorthodox archive––where the historical and the personal gather in relics as much as in refuse––to revisit matters that have shaped California’s social landscape, such as first contact, missionization, colonial settlement, water rights, and urban development. By following the daily routines of the site’s caretaker, I unravel how eccentric practices and unruly objects destabilize the official settler narrative. At the same time, the site becomes a probing ground to assess current discourses about object agency <b>flourishing</b> within the <b>humanities,</b> social sciences, and science studies. While it is important to reconsider who or what participates in the assembly of a social collective, as scholars such as Bruno Latour or Jane Bennett ask us to do, my fieldwork suggests that decentering the privileged space of the human subject cannot be at the expense of attending to repressed histories and social inequalities that remain unsolved...|$|R
