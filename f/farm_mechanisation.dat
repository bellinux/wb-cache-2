500|$|By {{the time}} of the First World War, the Suffolk Punch had become a popular work horse on large farms in East Anglia due to its good {{temperament}} and excellent work ethic. It remained popular until the Second World War, when a combination of the need for increased wartime food production (which resulted in many horses being sent to the slaughterhouse), and increased <b>farm</b> <b>mechanisation</b> which followed the war decimated population numbers. Only nine foals were registered with the Suffolk Horse Society in 1966, but there has been a revival of interest in the breed since the late 1960s and numbers have risen continuously. The breed did remain rare, and in 1998 there were only 80 breeding mares in Britain, producing around 40 foals per year. [...] In the United States, the American Suffolk Horse Association became inactive after the war and remained so for 15years, but restarted in May 1961 as the draught horse market began to recover. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American registry allowed some Belgians to be bred to Suffolk Punches, but only the fillies from these crosses were permitted registry with the American Suffolk Horse Association.|$|E

40|$|It is {{considered}} that New Zealand {{has the greatest}} rate of land-use change in the Western world (Penman 2008 pers. comm.). Although New Zealand’s land-use changes may be dynamic, reflecting overseas market needs in a business-agile way, the increase in agricultural intensification and in the diversity of crops grown {{over the last four}} decades is compounding the strain on the provision of ecosystem (nature’s) services (Costanza 1997, Daily et al 1997) that are necessary for long-term sustainable and profitable production. Higher animal stocking rates and yields, conversion to more intensive forms of agriculture, conversion to forestry and deer <b>farming,</b> increased <b>mechanisation</b> and increased use of fertilizers, pesticides and feedstock inputs are all indications of this steady trend (MacLeod et al 2006). In particular, the last decade has seen a rise in conversion from sheep and beef to dairy farming, a much more intensive activity. The dairy industry is currently striving to increase productivity by 4 % per annum, to achieve a 50 % increase in production by 2015 (MacLeod et al 2006). This policy depends increasingly on subsidies; more fertilizer, water, supplemental feeding – which may not be sourced from within the farm, or even from within New Zealand. This current trend for intensification may not be ecologically viable for the long term. Increased carbon dioxide emissions from higher fossil fuel use in mechanised intensive farming practices cannot be easily offset (Rhodes et al 2007). Conversion of rough grassland to ‘improved pasture’ has seen losses in biodiversity. Biodiversity is very valuable to agriculture, although the exact figure is difficult to ascertain (Costanza et al 1997, Sandhu et al 2007, Tilman et al 1996). New Zealand agriculture is diversifying as well as changing, examples being an increase in land use for vines and other specialty crops. Seed crops such as radish, have seen areas such as the Canterbury plains change markedly (MacLeod et al 2006). Forest plantations have seen a 110 % increase in land area since 1980 (Brockerhoff et al 2008). This increase in forestry (mainly Pinus radiata) may have some biodiversity benefits...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisation {{background}} and scope Farm production and rural transport require power. There are three main options: human work, animal {{power and the}} use of motors. The choice depends on local circumstances. Human, animal and machine power can complement each other in the same household, farm and village. Agricultural mechanisation involves the use of tools, implements and machines to improve the efficiency of human time and labour. The most appropriate machinery and power source for any operation depends on the work to be done and the relative desirability, affordability, availability and technical efficiency of the options. A hand hoe may be the best tool for intensive vegetable production. However, if much work needs to be done, human power alone is generally slow and tiring. Mechanisation, using animal or motor power, can significantly increase the productivity of human labour and {{improve the quality of life}} for women, men and children. Agricultural mechanisation is not an end in itself, but a means of development. The goal is sustainable and socially-beneficial agricultural production. The hardware is just one component of very complex farming systems. A wide range of social, economic and ecological factors determine whether a technology is practicable, beneficial and sustainable in an area. Sometimes mechanisation is confused with motorisation and tractorisation. Tractor power is just one option. In sub-Saharan Africa, some of the most successful mechanisation introductions have used animal power. In the CTA seminar and in this report, mechanisation is understood to encompass a range of technologies, using human, animal or motor power. The present levels of the various forms of agricultural mechanisation in Africa can only be estimated. It is widely acknowledged that most agricultural work (perhaps 80 %) depends entirely on human labour. Animals may perform up to 20 % of the operations, while in tropical Africa tractors contribute only a small proportion of the total agricultural work. During the last decade, structural adjustment programmes have changed the economic environment of African agriculture. Changing prices, currency values, government services and policies have affected the profitability of agriculture in both smallholder and large-scale production systems. The conditions for profitable distributing and repairing agricultural equipment have also changed. In many countries, farmers have appealed to development programmes and governments for assistance with <b>farm</b> power and <b>mechanisation.</b> In some areas, farmers have demonstrated there is a clear economic demand for animal power tractors. In other areas, such mechanisation remains a dream, being economically unsustainable in present circumstances. Government services involved in the development of agricultural mechanisation have suffered from cuts in the national budgets. Some of their activities have been criticised for not generating sustainable effects. Although 6 Integrating mechanisation into strategies for sustainable agriculture mechanisation can clearly influence production and the evolution of agricultural systems, its role in national development strategies has often been poorly defined. In 1996,CTA commissioned a study of mechanisation experiences in Africa that was undertaken in association with FAO by Dominique Bordet and Rabezandrina. The analysis started with the following key observations: Public-sector tractor hire services have failed throughout Africa. Private sector tractors have been profitable on large landholdings: tractors have seldom proved viable for the smallholder sector, whether in individual or group ownership or in private hire services. The devaluation of currencies has dramatically increased the price of tractors relative to the value of harvested produce. Tractors and machinery supplied under aid programmes have often been unhelpful, being inappropriate unsustainable. They have diverted the work of agricultural engineering departments from more appropriate, sustainable technologies. Artisans (blacksmiths) have been largely ignored as agricultural machinery (such as animal-drawn plows and cultivators) has been imported or made in centralised workshops. Supply of equipment has been determined largely by public sector organisations and not by the genuine demand of farmers. Research has been top-down and given insufficient consideration to the social, economic and environmental realities of African <b>farming</b> systems. <b>Mechanisation</b> {{background and}} scope Farm production and rural transport require power...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{trend in}} {{demographic}} changes occuring in administrative provinces of Central Poland is {{reduction in the}} number of agricultural population.

An exception here is the industrial urban province of Łódź in which the agricultural population represented only 4. 5 p er cent of the total population. Changes in the number of the population making its livelihood in the agriculture were reflected in the manpower supply measured by the number of the professionally active people per 100 ha of arable land.

To measure the regression of various growth factors including MGNREGS on the use of farm machineries, regressions is computed using panel data with fixed effects models. The descriptive analysis of the study shows that the machine labour cost in real value (which is used as a proxy variable to reflect the level of <b>farm</b> <b>mechanisation)</b> incurred for cultivating both paddy and wheat has increased considerably during post MGNREGS period in almost all the states selected for the analysis. The machine labour cost incurred for cultivating paddy has increased substantially in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh after the implementation of MGNREGS, while the same increase was found very high in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab in wheat cultivation. In most states where the machine labour cost has increased substantially, the use of human labour in man-hours has declined sharply in both paddy and wheat, confirming the fact that farm machineries are used to substitute the human labour especially after implementing MGNREGS. The regression results computed using panel data suggest that the factors determining the use of farm machineries is not the same between the two major crops selected for the study. Besides MGNREGS dummy, the factors such as coverage of irrigation, yield enhancing inputs cost, land-labour ratio and human labour use in man-hours have significantly influenced the use of machine labour in paddy cultivation. But, in the case of wheat crop, irrigation coverage and land-labour ratio has not significantly influenced the use of machineries.

With less than ten per cent of the world’s arable land and only seven per cent of its potable water, China must feed 20 per cent of the world’s population. China is presently 95 per cent self-sufficient in food. Demand, however, will rise until at least 2030, when China’s population will peak. Demand will also be influenced by a rising middle class, who will demand more nutritious food.

40|$|Costs and {{benefits}} {{associated with the use}} of farm machinery are difficult to calculate. A research programme was established to highlight the area of machinery costs and to provide information on which to base mechanisation decisions. A machinery cost survey was the central part of the programme which collected detailed machinery cost information from 40 arable farms over a period of three years. Costing methods were developed to provide an annual per-hectare cost for each machine over its ownership period. An average annual machinery cost figure of £ 194 /ha, excluding labour, was recorded. Costs varied from £ 93 /ha to £ 340 /ha between farms. Depreciation and interest accounted for almost 60 % of the total costs figure. Larger farms (> 160 ha) had lower costs and less cost variation than smaller- and medium-sized farms. They were more machinery efficient, with lower levels of machinery investment per hectare. Smaller- and medium-sized farms had much greater cost variation with many farms being over-mechanised, resulting in excessive machinery costs. The importance of selecting an appropriate mechanisation policy for individual farm situations was evident. Using information from the survey to select appropriate costing methodology from other research, a simple cost-prediction computer program was developed. This allows costs for an individual machine at any use level to be estimated. This program was used to evaluate various mechanisation options on 40, 100 and 240 ha farms. The program was then redeveloped for use by the advisory service. It is a decisionsupport type program which requires input from a trained operator with experience of mechanisation. It should prove useful in determining <b>farm</b> <b>mechanisation</b> policies against a background of changing mechanisation technology, farm labour supply and potential price-support reductions.

Oat grain {{has always been an}} important form of livestock feed. They are a good source of protein, fibre, and minerals but world oat grain declined as <b>farm</b> <b>mechanisation</b> increased between 1930 to 1950. Oats remain an important grain crop for people in marginal ecologies throughout the developing world, and in developed economies for specialist uses. In {{many parts of the world}} oats are grown for use as grain as well as for forage and fodder, straw for bedding, hay, haylage, silage and chaff. Livestock grain feed is still the primary use of oat crops, accounting for an average of around 74 % of the world’s total usage in 1991 to 1992 (Welch 1995). Oats are better adapted to variable soil types and can perform better on acid soils than other small grain cereals crops. They are mostly grown in cool moist climates and they can be sensitive to hot, dry weather from head emergence through to maturity. For these reasons, world oat production is generally concentrated between latitudes 35 – 65 °N, including Finland and Norway, and 20 to 46 °S. Most of the world’s production comes from spring sown cultivars, but autumn sowing is practised along the higher altitude regions, including the Himalayan Hindu Kush range and in regions where summers are hot and dry. Where winters are severe, such as in Scandinavia, northern states of the US, Canada, and higher altitude regions in the tropics, short season to mid maturing oat cultivars are generally sown. In regions with temperate climates, oats are variously spring, winter and/or autumn sown depending on regional climatic conditions, crop rotation requirements, end use and other farming practices.

The increased labour shortage and redced profitability are growing concerns to the farmers. Keeping this, the paper written {{with the following}} objectives: i) To assess the profitability among different cropping systems in the semi-arid tropics; ii) To assess the labour use pattern among different cropping systems and farm size; iii) To determine the resource use efficiency of the different cropping systems in the SAT India; and finally iv) To assess the influence of regional/local factors on incomes of farmers in the SAT India. The study used plot wise data collected from 16 villages from four states namely Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat for the crop year 2010 for an in-depth analysis of the profitability and labour use among different cropping systems in semi-arid tropics of India. And it also estimated the resource use efficiency especially labour across different farm size groups in the SAT India and finally to assess the influence of regional/local factors on profitability of farmers. The study shows that input intensive cropping systems like cotton, paddy, wheat, fruits and vegetables based cropping systems are more profitable across many of the SAT villages compared to coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds based cropping systems. Moreover, the area under these cropping systems is increased in the dry lands due {{to the introduction of}} Bt cotton varieties, short duration varieties, price incentives and subsidies. Although pulses based cropping systems remain attractive due to higher prices and less labour requirement, needs to provide incentives to increase area given its environmental benefits in enriching the soil. Most of the villages are experiencing the shortage of labour as indicated by higher marginal productivity of labour and increasing trend of mechanisation.

40|$|The lack of {{economic}} analysis on export-led shrimp farming in India has become of major national importance {{as a result}} of the Indian Supreme Court's December 1996 decision to ban the shrimp farming sector. The ban was a direct result of concerns over the impact of shrimp farming-in terms of its degradation of the environment and marginalization of local people from coastal resources. In addition to questions raised with respect to the nature and extent of environmental and socio-economic externalities of this sector, recent parliamentary debate raised equally important questions regarding the sustainability of shrimp farming under a variety of production methods. However, assessment of the productive efficiency of shrimp farms under increasingly intensive production methods is lacking. Parametric and non-parametric approaches to measuring the productive efficiency of shrimp farms are applied to farm-level data collected from the Kandaleru region in India. First, technical efficiency is modelled, measured and explained by estimating a restricted translog stochastic frontier production function using maximum-likelihood methods. The variation of technical efficiency indices across the shrimp farm sample is explained using farm specific characteristics and managerial variables. <b>Farm</b> <b>mechanisation,</b> location and size are found to be significant factors explaining total inefficiency. Second, scale effects are extracted from the total efficiency index by applying Data Envelopment Analysis techniques. An inverse relationship is found to exist between farm size and efficiency. Next, social and environmental impacts facing rural inhabitants {{as a result of}} the shrimp farming sector's growth and development are assessed using primary survey data collected from twenty-six villages located adjacent to shrimp farms. The most frequently cited problem by local inhabitants is blocked access to public areas. This is followed by problems of agricultural land salinity, well water salinity, unemployment, fodder & fuelwood collection problems and health problems, respectively. The immediate policy direction is clear: larger farmers could reduce the intensity of production to maximise efficiency and minimise input slacks to reduce the risk of environmental degradation both within the aquatic pond environment and to the natural ecosystem. Similarly, they could enable free but supervised access through their farms to public areas such as the Bay of Bengal, Kandaleru creek or public pasture lands...|$|E
