25|$|Digital audio uses pulse-code {{modulation}} {{and digital}} signals for sound reproduction. This includes analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), storage, and transmission. In effect, the system {{commonly referred to}} as digital is in fact a discrete-time, discrete-level analog of a previous electrical analog. While modern systems can be quite subtle in their methods, the primary usefulness of a <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> is the ability to store, retrieve and transmit signals without any loss of quality.|$|E
25|$|The key to {{the ability}} of a {{frequency}} synthesizer to generate multiple frequencies is the divider placed between the output and the feedback input. This is usually {{in the form of a}} digital counter, with the output signal acting as a clock signal. The counter is preset to some initial count value, and counts down at each cycle of the clock signal. When it reaches zero, the counter output changes state and the count value is reloaded. This circuit is straightforward to implement using flip-flops, and because it is digital in nature, is very easy to interface to other digital components or a microprocessor. This allows the frequency output by the synthesizer to be easily controlled by a <b>digital</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a <b>digital</b> <b>system.</b> Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} with manual typesetting, {{the problem of}} justification is easy to solve with a <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> such as TeX, which, provided that good points for line breaking have been defined, can automatically spread the spaces between words {{to fill in the}} line. The problem is thus to find the set of breakpoints that will give the most visually pleasing result. Many line breaking algorithms use a first-fit approach, where the breakpoints for each line are determined one after the other, and no breakpoint is changed after it has been chosen. Such a system is not able to define a breakpoint depending on the effect that it will have on the following lines. In comparison, the total-fit line breaking algorithm used by TeX and developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass considers all the possible breakpoints in a paragraph, and finds the combination of line breaks that will produce the most globally pleasing arrangement.|$|E

The group demoed and made rough outlines for new songs. When they felt they had made a good start, Garbage took the work they made in Washington back to their Madison, Wisconsin, base at Smart Studios and begin fleshing out the ideas and rough sketches over the following year. The group recorded all of their work for the second album through a 48-track <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> digitally, direct to hard drives utilizing a 24-bit Pro Tools rig. While only one recorder {{was up in the}} early sessions, eventually another was installed to edit, and ultimately a third so Manson could record vocals while the other members fiddled with recordings. Vig estimated that the sample collage approach led to [...] "probably have five albums' worth of music", and songs featuring up to 120 audio tracks.

2500|$|A sonomicrometer device {{measures}} distance {{by performing}} a timing {{measurement of the}} sound transmitted by one crystal and received by one (or more) adjacent crystals. [...] The ability to resolve small differences in this transit-time (or [...] "time-of-flight") directly correlates {{with the ability to}} resolve small changes in the distances between crystals. [...] The first generation of sonomicrometer devices were analog devices that integrated the time-of-flight as a voltage ramp function. [...] Their resolution was a function of the slope of the ramp and the electrical noise of system components. [...] Those systems output the length measurements as an analog voltage. [...] The second generation of sonomicrometer devices were digital—they measure time-of-flight by incrementing high-speed digital counters. [...] Typically these are 12 to 16-bit counters operating from 32 to 128MHz. [...] A <b>digital</b> <b>system</b> will output length measurements in form of a digital number (the time-of-flight count value). [...] Because of their digital nature, the resolution can be exactly specified as a function of counter clock frequency. [...] For example, when making measurements in biological tissue at body temperature (velocity = 1,590m/s), a digital sonomicrometer operating with a clock speed of 128MHz will have a spatial resolution of 12 micrometres.|$|E
