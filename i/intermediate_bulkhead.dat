50|$|In mid-December 1961, Atlas 121D and Agena 6003 {{arrived at}} Cape Canaveral and were erected on LC-12. On January 18, 1962, Ranger 3 was stacked atop the booster, but the {{following}} day attempted fueling of the Atlas went awry when a tear {{was found in the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> separating the LOX and RP-1 tanks. This would mean that the launch vehicle would have to be taken down from the pad for repairs, delaying the launch an entire month. However, Air Force and Convair officials instead suggested the novel solution of doing the repairs right there on LC-12. The Atlas's sustainer engine was removed and lowered into the flame deflector pit and a wooden scaffolding installed so that technicians could go up into the RP-1 tank, remove the damaged <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> and replace it. By January 26, repairs were completed.|$|E
50|$|Missile 5C (February 20) {{performed}} well until BECO, {{at which point}} the fuel staging disconnect valve failed, causing a gradual fuel leak and decay in tank pressures. When propellant levels in the tank dropped low enough, the open staging disconnect valve allowed helium pressure gas to escape, causing a more rapid pressure loss. At approximately T+168 seconds, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> reversed, followed by explosion of the missile at T+172 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Mercury {{vehicles}} up to MA-6 had {{foam insulation}} in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> {{to prevent the}} super-chilled LOX from causing the RP-1 to freeze. During repairs to MA-6 prior to John Glenn's flight, {{it was decided to}} remove the insulation for being unnecessary and an impediment during servicing of the boosters in the field. NASA sent out a memo to GD/A requesting that subsequent Mercury-Atlas vehicles not include bulkhead insulation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>intermediate</b> tank <b>bulkhead</b> {{showed signs}} of losing {{structural}} integrity ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the hull varies depending on the vessel type. In a typical modern steel ship, the structure consists of watertight and non-tight decks, major transverse and watertight (and also sometimes non-tight or longitudinal) members called <b>bulkheads,</b> <b>intermediate</b> members such as girders, s and webs, and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the structural arrangement. The uppermost continuous deck may be called the [...] "upper deck", [...] "weather deck", [...] "spar deck", [...] "main deck", or simply [...] "deck". The particular name given depends on the context—the type of ship or boat, the arrangement, or even where it sails. Not all hulls are decked (for instance a dinghy).|$|R
50|$|Missiles 63D and 84D on September 9 and 11 lost thrust {{and tumbled}} during the {{sustainer}} phase, {{in the first}} case due to a ruptured vernier hydraulic line, in the second due to thrust section overheating. On October 7, Missile 163D exploded at T+75 seconds when the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> reversed. Postflight investigation found that launch crews had loaded the helium bottles with insufficiently chilled gas, resulting in a lack of helium flow to the propellant tanks, which lost pressure during ascent.|$|E
50|$|The first Atlas-Centaur, Vehicle F-1 (Atlas 104D and Centaur F-1), {{arrived at}} Cape Canaveral in October 1961 and was erected at the newly {{completed}} LC-36A, a pad built specifically for A/C flights. Flight plans amounted {{to little more}} than a single burn with a partially fueled Centaur, just to verify that the launch vehicle combination would actually fly. However, technical problems and other delays caused it to sit there for seven months, the most serious being leakage of liquid hydrogen through the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> separating the propellant tanks, and numerous lesser maladies with the guidance and propulsion systems. The mission at last got under way on 8 May 1962. All went well until about T+53 seconds when the Centaur stage ruptured and disintegrated, taking the Atlas with it in a matter of seconds.|$|E
50|$|The Alas C {{test program}} {{began with the}} {{successful}} flight of 3C on December 24, 1958. All systems performed well and the extended booster burn time was carried out with no ill effects. On January 27, Missile 4C experienced a complete Mod III GE guidance system failure at T+80 seconds. The propellant utilization system operated fuel rich, resulting in low sustainer thrust following BECO, and LOX depletion caused simultaneous sustainer/vernier cutoff 5 seconds earlier than the planned SECO. In addition, a malfunction of the pneumatic system caused decay of fuel tank pressure starting at T+120 seconds. Tank pressure remained high enough to maintain structural integrity through powered flight, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> possibly ruptured at T+320 seconds, at which point tank pressures had dropped below a safe limit. Because of the guidance system failure, no separation signal was received by the reeentry vehicle. Impact occurred about 40 miles short of the target point in the South Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|Atlas D {{tests on}} the West Coast hit a series of snags in the {{following}} months as well. Atlas 25D had flown successfully on April 22 from 576B-1, a coffin silo. The next attempt, 23D (May 6) began experiencing abnormal pitch gyrations within 10 seconds of launch. After about 20 seconds, the missile started tumbling out of control upon which the RSO sent the destruct command. This failure was attributed to wiring in the pitch gyro contacting the casing and shorting out the gyro motor. Atlas 74D (July 22) broke up 70 seconds into launch due to {{a failure of the}} pitch gyro either due to an improper motor speed setting or torquing signals. Missile 47D (September 12) lost sustainer thrust due to a leak in the vernier helium supply system. Missile 33D (September 29) failed to stage its booster section when the staging electrical disconnect plug pulled out at T+125 seconds. 81D (October 13) failed when the LOX quick disconnect pressure sensor malfunctioned due to the loss of a heat shield at liftoff, causing the pneumatic system to overpressurize the LOX tank with helium until it ruptured the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and destroyed the missile at T+72 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Atlas 5D {{lifted from}} LC-13 on June 6. The flight went {{perfectly}} until booster separation, {{at which point}} a fuel leak started. Tank pressure decreased until the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> reversed at T+157 seconds and the missile exploded. This incident was similar in nature to an Atlas C failure {{earlier in the year}} and it resulted in a major investigation and redesign effort. The failure point was either the fuel staging disconnect valve or associated plumbing, and modifications were made to the disconnect valve, plumbing, booster separation system, jettison tracks, and even the launcher mechanism, all of which were possible causes of the malfunction. On July 29, Missile 11D was launched with a series of modifications designed to correct problems on previous Atlas launches. The flight was mostly successful and booster section separation was performed successfully on a D-series Atlas for the first time, but some difficulties with the hydraulic system occurred due to low engine compartment temperatures caused by a probable LOX leak. Missile 14D launched from LC-13 on August 11, at which point the Air Force somewhat reluctantly declared the Atlas to be operational as a missile system. On September 9, Missile 12D launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, marking the first Atlas flight from the West Coast. Eight more D-series ICBM tests were conducted in 1959, as well as two space launches using Atlas D vehicles. Although assorted minor failures and hardware bugs affected these flights, the overall success rate was a major improvement over {{the first half of the}} year.|$|E
5000|$|On May 18, Atlas 7D was {{prepared}} for a night launch of an RVX-2 reentry vehicle from LC-14, the second attempt to fly one after the launch of a C-series Atlas had miscarried two months earlier. The test was conducted with the Mercury astronauts in attendance in order to showcase the vehicle that would take them into orbit, but 64 seconds of flight ended in another explosion, prompting Gus Grissom to remark [...] "Are we really {{going to get on}} top of one of those things?". This failure was traced to improper separation of the right launcher hold-down pin, which damaged the B-2 nacelle structure and caused helium pressurization gas to escape during ascent. At 62 seconds into the launch, the pressure in the LOX tank exceeded the pressure in the RP-1 tank, which reversed the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> Two seconds later, the missile exploded. Film review confirmed that the hold-down pin on the right launcher arm failed to retract at liftoff and was jerked from the missile. The resultant force caused a four-inch gap in the B-2 nacelle structure which also damaged low pressure helium lines. The hold-down pin had not retracted due to a sheared retaining bolt in the bell crank pulley system in the right launcher arm. Once again, all other systems in the Atlas functioned well and there were no problems not directly attributable to the launcher malfunction. The flight of 7D resulted in improved maintenance procedures for the launcher equipment at CCAS and use of higher heat steel in the bell crank retaining bolts.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, the Atlas was {{prepared}} for a planned 12-minute PFRT (Pre-Flight Readiness Test). The satellite {{was not on the}} launch vehicle, the third stage was a dummy, and the second stage was unfueled. After 2.5 seconds of engine operation, a fire erupted in the Atlas's thrust section. Fed by leaking liquid oxygen, it proved impossible to put out with pad extinguishers and soon a huge inferno was raging on LC-12. Thirty-seven seconds after the fire began, the Atlas toppled over in a massive fireball, the biggest explosion seen at Cape Canaveral up to that point. The pad was severely damaged, with both umbilical towers totally destroyed, the concrete launch stand caved in, and the service tower knocked over. It would take months of repairs to get it back online. The final explosion was believed {{to be the result of}} loss of tank pressure. Engine shutdown caused the propellant valves to snap shut, causing overpressurization of the propellant tanks. Ground operators in the blockhouse flipped manual override switches to lower RP-1 pressure and increase LOX pressure, but the missile did not respond, possibly due to fire-induced damage to the control wiring on the pad. The pneumatic control system automatically threw open the LOX boil-off valve to vent tank pressure, which apparently continued until the tanks lost support pressure to the point where their structural integrity failed. At around 35 seconds, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> collapsed, causing the LOX to fall into the RP-1 tank and mix. The propellants turned into a gel that detonated with the force of 20,000 pounds (9070 kg) of TNT and resulted in an extremely powerful explosion that caused extensive pad damage.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} unveil the {{challenges}} of deep-water PIP installation and provide a trustworthy simulation of PIP installation processes by using advanced analysis tool – “Simulator”, an ABAQUS based JP Kenny in-house Finite Element Analysis (FEA) engine. “Simulator ” allows the PIP pipes being modeled individually with realistic interaction between the pipes as PIP being at the normal lay process of S-Lay, J-Lay or Reel-Lay installation.

40|$|The Thermal Protection System (TPS) for the Shuttle/Centaur had {{to provide}} {{fail-safe}} thermal protection during prelaunch, launch ascent, and on-orbit operations {{as well as}} during potential abort where the Shuttle and Centaur would return to earth. The TPS selected used a helium-purged polyimide foam beneath three radiation shields for the liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tank and radiation shields only for the liquid oxygen (LO 2) tank (three shields on the tank sidewall and four on the aft bulkhead). An evacuated common <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulkhead</b> separated the two tanks. The LH 2 tank had one 1. 9 -cm thick layer of foam on the forward bulkhead and two layers on the larger area side-wall. Full scale tests of the flight vehicle in a simulated Shuttle cargo bay, that was purged with gaseous nitrogen, gave total prelaunch heating rates of 25. 9 kW and 12. 9 kW for LH 2 and LO 2 tanks, respectively. Calorimeter tests on a representative LH 2 tank sidewall TPS sample indicated that the measured unit heating rate would rapidly decrease from the prelaunch rate of 300 W/sq m to a desired rate of less than 4 W/sq m once on-orbit...|$|E
