After fierce fighting, in which mustard gas was used by the Soviet Union at the Battle of Tutung, Ma Zhongying retreated and Zhang committed suicide to avoid capture. During the battle, the chinese Muslims reportedly <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> sheepskins and stormed Soviet machine guns posts with swords. Ma encountered a Red Army column at the Battle of Dawan Cheng and wiped out the entire column, his Muslim troops rolled the wrecked Soviet armored cars off the mountainside.

500|$|With their {{defeat at}} Lewes still fresh in memory, the royalists fought {{with a strong}} sense of {{bitterness}} and resentment. As a result, and despite attempts to surrender, most of the baronial rebels were killed on the battlefield rather than taken prisoner and ransomed, as was the common custom and practice. In what has been referred to as [...] "an episode of noble bloodletting unprecedented since the Conquest", Montfort's son Henry was killed first, then Simon himself lost his horse and died fighting. His body was mutilated; his head, hands, feet and testicles cut off. King Henry himself, {{who had been in the}} custody of Montfort and <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his colours, was barely rescued from the mêlée by Roger de Leybourne, a converted rebel.|$|E

She stated, [...] "But it was always sort of built in that the peak of 'Diwali' would be this incredibly romantic overture [...]" [...] Kaling was pleased that much of [...] "Diwali" [...] took place at Stamford, especially as she was able to explore the contrasts between the two offices. She also liked that the episode contained [...] "romance, people getting <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> costumes, lots of food, smooching and making out ... and little girls making fun of B.J.

500|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{lips are}} thin and tightly pursed {{and his mouth}} is broad and down-turned, yet his {{features}} are those of a handsome man. Marcel Brion described him as appearing [...] "mild and thoughtful", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting. This view {{is reinforced by the}} relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes, which seem intended to convey a reserved, ascetic piousness. Dürer presents his father more like a low-ranking [...] ecclesiastic than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his best, albeit modest, clothes. After his father's death in 1502, Dürer wrote that Albrecht the Elder [...] "passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man." ...|$|E

500|$|Now homeless, Sylvester {{spent much}} of the next decade staying with friends and relatives, in particular, his {{grandmother}} Julia, who expressed no disapproval of his homosexuality, having been a friend of a number of gay men in the 1930s. On occasion, he [...] returned to his mother and step-father's house for a few days at a time, particularly to spend time with his younger sisters, Bernadette and Bernadine. Aged 15, he began frequenting local gay clubs and built up a group of friends from the local gay black community, eventually forming themselves into a group which they called the Disquotays. Sylvester's best friend among the Disquotays was a trans woman named Duchess, who earned her money as a prostitute, a job that Sylvester refused to engage in. The group held lavish house parties, sometimes (without permission) at the home of their friend, rhythm and blues singer Etta James, in which they <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> female clothing and wigs, constantly trying to outdo one another in appearance.|$|E
500|$|Mileena was {{extensively}} used {{to promote}} the Mortal Kombat reboot game in 2011-2012. She {{was one of the}} only four playable characters in the demo version and was [...] featured in several trailers, including [...] "A Night Out With Mileena" [...] in which several NetherRealm Studios employees tongue-in-cheek-style answered the question where they would take her on a date. As part of this promotional campaign, fitness model Danni Levy portrayed Mileena in the live-action trailer [...] "Kasting" [...] and a photo session, attending The Gadget Show: World Tour for the European 2011 championship in Mortal Kombat. Levy also portrayed Mileena in the 2012 live-action commercial for the PlayStation Vita version of the game; first in a teaser trailer, and then in the full trailer together with Kitana. Playboy model Jo Garcia <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Mileena's colors to play as her in a sponsored photo session and video in 2011. Another model dressed as Mileena also promoted the 2011 game in Brazil for Warner Bros. and Saraiva Mega Store.

500|$|Paolini and {{his family}} toured across the United States {{promoting}} the book. Over 135 talks were given at bookshops, libraries, and schools, many with Paolini <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a medieval costume; but the book did not receive much attention. Paolini said he [...] "would stand behind a table in my costume talking all day without a break– and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if I did really well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. I couldn't have gone on for very much longer." [...] In the summer of 2002, American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on vacation {{in one of the}} cities that Paolini gave a talk in. While there, Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of Eragon that he [...] "immediately loved". He showed it to Hiaasen, who brought the book {{to the attention of the}} publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini {{and his family}} to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon. The answer was yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published Eragon in August 2003, with a new cover, drawn by John Jude Palencar.|$|E

500|$|A bid of £1m {{offered by}} Damien Hirst {{for the entire}} {{collection}} had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers, and the owners sued Bonhams, arguing that this offer should have been accepted. Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying [...] "You can see he {{knew very little about}} anatomy and musculature, because some of the taxidermy is terrible—there's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher" [...] He also showed appreciation for the displays: [...] "My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's not the point. There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows. And a group of hamsters playing cricket." [...] About the auction, Hirst said, [...] "I've offered £1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue – just for them to take it off the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently, the auction has to go ahead. It is a tragedy." ...|$|E

[...] Hodgetts said that both Firth and Johansson gave [...] "excellent" [...] performances who did [...] "... a grand job of expressing feelings and emotions {{without the use of}} much dialogue, and the picture is the better for it." [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times called the film an [...] "... earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh." [...] Mitchell did however laud its cinematography, production design, and musical score, as did the Film Journal Internationals Erica Abeel. Despite praising its visuals, Abeel criticized Girl with a Pearl Earring for being [...] "... a chick flick <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Old Master clothes ..." [...] and for failing [...] "... to render Griet's growing artistic sensibility dramatically credible." [...] She cited its melodramatic villains as another failing, but concluded that it was [...] "... to Johansson's credit that she alone pulls something plausible out of her character." ...|$|E
