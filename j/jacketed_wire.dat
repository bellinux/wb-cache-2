40|$|The {{critical}} current {{of an internal}} tin Nb 3 Sn wire developed by Oxford Instruments, Superconducting Technology for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) (OST type-I, billet No. 7567) has been studied under axial strain at fields between 12 and 19 T at 4. 2 K. Simulating the situation in a cable in conduit, where thermally induced compressive strain is important, a single wire (strand) was jacketed with AISI 316 L stainless steel. The reinforced wire shows an important increase in ɛm, the applied strain where Ic reaches its maximum, from 0. 25 % to 0. 57 %. In addition the irreversibility limit, ɛirr, is improved from 0. 50 % applied strain to > 1. 10 %. It could also be shown that the Ic at zero intrinsic strain is almost identical. This demonstrates that jacketing does not influence the physical parameters of the original wire. Experimental data of the bare wire has been well fitted by different strain functions. However, {{it was not possible}} to model the data of the <b>jacketed</b> <b>wire.</b> There are indications that only models which take into account the multidimensional character of strain are able to describe the behavior but further development is require...|$|E
40|$|The full-matrix set of {{combined}} temperature (4. 2 – 14 K) {{and applied}} axial strain (εa) {{data for the}} bulk pinning force of a technological Nb 3 Sn wire (OST type-I) has been studied at fields up to 19 T by combining transport (variable εa) and magnetic (variable T) measurements. Some length of the wire was also jacketed with AISI 316 L stainless steel, in order to apply a radial strain and to simulate the thermally induced axial compressive strain that the Nb 3 Sn wires experience in a cable-in-conduit-conductor (CICC). Within {{the framework of the}} unified scaling law, raw scaling data for the effective upper critical field B*c 2 (T, ɛ), have been used in order to experimentally determine the strain function, s(ε), of both the bare and the jacketed wires. A direct testing of the various proposed models for s(ε) has been carried out, including the power law, the deviatoric description and the polynomial form. All models adequately fit to the s(ε) of the bare wire, but in the <b>jacketed</b> <b>wire</b> none of them is able to describe the tensile strain region above the Ic maximum, where the enhanced radial compression cannot be neglected. The origin of the onset of a reduced Bc 2 is also discussed...|$|E
