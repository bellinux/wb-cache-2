500|$|Brownlee campaigned vigorously {{during the}} 1930 election, and was re-elected with a {{slightly}} diminished majority. [...] However, the Great Depression was making itself felt in Alberta. [...] The price of wheat, Alberta's major export, declined {{from a high of}} $1.78 per bushel in the summer of 1929, to $1.00 in the following March, to $0.45 by the end of 1930. [...] The Alberta Wheat Pool (AWP) guaranteed its members a minimum price of $1.00 per bushel (itself not enough for many farmers to earn a living), and it found itself facing ruination. [...] Banks denied credit to it and to individual farmers, which in turn made it difficult for the latter to afford seed for the 1931 crop. [...] The provincial government faced calls to provide loan guarantees. [...] Brownlee was concerned that such guarantees would encourage lenders to make loans at higher interest rates, with the knowledge that the provincial government would pay them if the farmers defaulted.

500|$|In February 1930 Brownlee {{advocated}} a federally <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> to farmers of $0.70 per bushel of wheat. [...] In November he asked new Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, {{with whom he}} had practiced law in Calgary nearly twenty years previous, to stabilize wheat [...] "at some reasonable price". [...] Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable {{in the face of a}} global oversupply of 400 million bushels. [...] Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks' increasing reluctance to loan money to farmers, many of whom would not be able to purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans. [...] Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance, but only quietly and only in the last resort; he was concerned that a well-publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to loan money under predatory terms, knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would. [...] When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks' loans to farmers for binder twine, he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government. [...] To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans, he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter. [...] As he had hoped, this threat enhanced lenders' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating foreclosures and to initiate them only where farmers' payments did not even cover interest. [...] Despite these minor successes, Brownlee's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished. [...] It was not enhanced when he supported unpopular federal legislation requiring farmers to plant less wheat, part of an international agreement aimed at addressing worldwide oversupply.|$|E

For small photovoltaic installations(less than 1 MW) it was reduced from 330 EUR per MWh to 250 EUR per MWh by January 2012 with the goal of reaching renewable energy targets at a reasonable cost.

50|$|A Maize Control Board {{was formed}} in 1947.

To {{cover the cost of}} a country-wide network, the Board fixed a very low buying price and sold maize at double this price. These low prices discouraged farmers from growing maize commercially, and inhibited the development of grain markets. The quantities of maize available for the home market dropped significantly at a time of growing demand caused by poor harvests in the run up to the major famine in 1949. After the 1949 famine, the MCB promoted maize production, but when world prices fell in the 1950s, it abandoned the import and export trade, and the Nyasaland administration discouraged maize production in agriculturally unsuitable areas.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{arguments}} against the Fair Trade scheme is that the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> tends to depress world prices and thus the incomes of non-participating farmers (e. g.

The model suggests that the claims against Fair Trade might not be correct. The introduction of a Fair Trade market may increase the incomes of both participating and non-participating farmers. The minimum contracting price as part of Fair Trade standards, however, precludes the full realization of the program’s potential benefits. The minimum price also paradoxically increases the profits of the middlemen whose local monopsony power the Fair Trade scheme originally aimed to retrench. Furthermore, the total surplus generated by Fair Trade cooperatives declines as the guaranteed price increases. Certification, regulation, price setting, coffee, Fair Trade, monopsony...|$|E
40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a {{production}} aid per tonne of unginned cotton within national guaranteed quantities. Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to final agricultural output in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, Sterea Ellada and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of ginned cotton and is a major net exporter of ginned cotton. The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of ginned cotton per annum. Comment: The <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of ginned cotton). This demonstrates the extent to which production and trade in cotton in the EU is insulated from developments on world markets. The EU support regime is centred on a production aid per tonne of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies two {{quality assurance}} mechanisms know from markets with unobservable quality characteristics-certification and self-regulation. Certification is a mechanism {{based on a}} third party who tests producers and issues, for a fee, a certificate to those who meet the required quality standard. Self-regulation is a mechanism, where producers, {{rather than relying on}} a certifier, form a club, set standards, and monitor each other. In the first chapter, I compare certification and self-regulation. I show that if the testing technology is perfect and costless, the choice of standards and fees by the certifying organization (CO) is welfare inferior, while the self-regulatory organization (SRO) chooses a welfare optimal fee, and I identify conditions under which the SRO also chooses optimal standards. If the testing technology is costly and imperfect, this result is not necessarily valid and depends on the difference between the costs of the testing technology available to the CO and SRO. In the second chapter, Tomáš Konečný and I study an example of certification system - Fair Trade scheme. One of the arguments against the Fair Trade scheme is that the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> tends to depress world prices and thus the incomes of non-participating farmers (e. g.

Subsequent legislation, in particular the Statute of Apprentices of 1563, legislated for a particular day when the high constables of the shire would proclaim the stipulated rates of pay and conditions of employment for the following year. Because so many people gathered at a fair, it quickly turned into the major place for matching workers and employers. Hiring fairs continued well into the 20th century, up to the Second World War in some places but their function as employment exchanges was diminished by the Corn Production Act 1917.

Their model's ability to yield blended value depends on its financial viability. Blended value suggests that all 3 components (social, financial, and environmental) must be integrated into any value assessment.Another example is a social enterprise such as Aravind Eye Hospital. Aravind offers high quality eye care on a sliding scale fee model—which means that those who cannot afford medical care are treated for free, and those who can pay, do. Even after having served over 32 million patients (the majority of the surgeries being free or subsidized for impoverished people); they have still managed to be a highly lucrative hospital.
