40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that treating diet-induced obese (DIO) mice with the vasopeptidase inhibitor <b>ilepatril</b> improved neural function. Vasopeptidase inhibitors block angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity. We propose that increased activity of ACE and NEP contributes to pathophysiology of DIO. To address this issue C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice or mice deficient in NEP were fed a high-fat diet and treated with <b>ilepatril,</b> enalapril, ACE inhibitor, or candoxatril, NEP inhibitor, using both prevention and intervention protocols. Endpoints included glucose utilization and neural function determination. In the prevention study glucose tolerance was impaired in DIO C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice and improved with <b>ilepatril</b> or enalapril. Sensory nerve conduction velocity, thermal nociception, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were impaired in DIO C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice and improved with <b>ilepatril</b> or candoxatril. In the intervention study only enalapril improved glucose tolerance. Sensory nerve conduction velocity and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were improved by all three treatments, whereas thermal nociception was improved by <b>ilepatril</b> or candoxatril. In NEP-deficient mice DIO impaired glucose utilization and this was improved with enalapril. Nerve function was not impaired by DIO in NEP-deficient mice.
