5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

McClennehan reduced the sentence to a $100 fine, which so pleased Morrison that he attempted to make a speech thanking the judge. McClennehan pounded his fist {{on his desk and}} admonished Morrison. “I don’t think any more of you, sir, than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> damn desk,” he shouted.|$|E

500|$|Jack McGee {{was cast}} as Bob Damfuse—referred to colloquially as [...] "Angry Bob"—the {{father of the}} half-sisters with a severe anger issue. During rehearsals for his scene, McGee {{purposely}} kept his voice down to prevent a severe headache. He recalled, [...] "I remember the director , {{he wanted me to}} scream during rehearsal, and I was, like, 'Look, you don’t understand: If <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> I’m gonna have a headache in 30 fucking seconds.'" [...] The scenes were rehearsed about five or six times before the actual scene was filmed.|$|E

So <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|One day, whilst {{working on}} On the 6, Jennifer Lopez [...] "happened to be" [...] {{recording}} {{at the same}} recording studio where American recording artist Marc Anthony was recording. Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), came into her studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at that time I called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. So can you force him to sign something, so he has to do a record with me? If <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E
500|$|Suppose one accepts, as <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>this</b> line of {{reasoning}} as justifying governmental action to alleviate poverty; to set, as it were, a floor under the standard of life of {{every person in the}} community. [...] arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is a negative income tax.... The advantages of this arrangement are clear. It is directed specifically at the problem of poverty. It gives help in the form most useful to the individual, namely, cash. It is general and could be substituted for the host of special measures now in effect. It makes explicit the cost borne by society. It operates outside the market. Like any other measures to alleviate poverty, it reduces the incentives of those helped to help themselves, but it does not eliminate that incentive entirely, as a system of supplementing incomes up to some fixed minimum would. An extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure.|$|E

500|$|On September 22, 2011, an 18-year-old Melanie Amaro {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on {{the second}} day of the opening week of first season of The X Factor in the US. As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> People like you inspire me. You made a believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A. Reid declared: [...] "Melanie, you are truly amazing.

500|$|HeartGold and SoulSilver were {{released}} in 2009, {{ten years after}} Gold and Silvers release for the Game Boy Color. Shigeki Morimoto, the games' director, commented {{on the development of}} the remakes: [...] "The first thing that I knew I needed to bear in mind was to respect the feelings of those people who'd played Gold and Silver ten years before. I think that players have very strong memories of the game, so they'd think things like 'Ah, this trainer is still strong' and 'If <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> here, this is going to happen'. I knew I needed to respect these feelings." [...] However, Morimoto also needed to make sure that the games would feel as new games to players who began playing Pokémon in recent years on the Game Boy Advance or the Nintendo DS. An in-game author surrogate of Game Freak's President in Celadon City states that the team strove to make a game that would appeal to players with fond memories without [...] "redoing the same thing". He also states that making the game was a [...] "rewarding challenge". HeartGold and SoulSilver introduced many new features that were absent in the original Gold and Silver. Several of these features came from the previously released Nintendo DS Pokémon games, such as Diamond (2006), Pearl (2006), and Platinum (2008).|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, American singer Alicia Keys {{confirmed}} that {{she worked on}} Madonna's upcoming studio album, saying [...] "It was good. I was in here doing a meeting or something and [...] was working with Diplo. They were like, 'Oh, maybe you can play some piano on this thing'. And I was like, 'Alright. I'll try. If you hate it, {{you can take it}} off'. It was just like that, casual and cool." [...] Annie from the London Community Gospel Choir provided the female background vocals throughout the song. Madonna also mentioned that new versions would be [...] "coming out, but just not yet". Describing the song as [...] "one of [...] more mellow productions", Madonna composed [...] "Living for Love" [...] as a break-up song, commenting, [...] "lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable. But nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards. So I thought, how can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> I didn't want to share the sentiment of being a victim. This scenario devastated me, but it just made me stronger". She complemented saying that [...] "Living for Love" [...] was [...] "kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together".|$|E

[...] The death of his father and the death of Poul Møller also played a part in his decision.|$|E

2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> time around. The way that Jessie and I {{like to think of}} it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E

[...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big deal for my character — she had no idea what was coming.|$|E
