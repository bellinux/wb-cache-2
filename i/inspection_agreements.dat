Argentina continues to use nuclear power in non-military roles, and is noted as an exporter of civilian use nuclear technology.|$|R
40|$|Data {{from the}} 2006 CCGA {{national}} survey once again {{indicate that the}} American public is much more multilateralist than U. S. foreign policy officials. Large majorities of Americans favor several specific steps to strengthen the UN, support Security Council intervention for peacekeeping and human rights, and favor working more within the UN even if it constrains U.

40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} registration of MRI and CT datasets post permanent prostate implant {{by the use of}} mutual information. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five patients who underwent permanent 125 I implant for prostate carcinoma were studied. Two weeks postimplant an axial CT, T 2 -weighted-axial, sagittal and coronal MRI, and T 1 -fat-saturation MRI scans were obtained. Registrations of MRI to CT and MRI to MRI datasets were performed by mutual information, an automated process of data registration matching all information in specified dataset regions of interest. Registration quality was evaluated by visual <b>inspection,</b> <b>agreement</b> with seed- to-seed registration, and histogram analysis. RESULTS: Rapid registration (� 30 minutes) of CT and MRI datasets can be accomplished through the use of mutual information. All methods of registration evaluation confirmed excellent registration quality. Although D 90 and V 100 for the prostate were comparable between MRI- and CT-based dosimetry, dose to critical structures/microenvironments (anterior base, posterior base, bladder outlet, lower sphincter, bulbar urethra) defined on MRI varied widely. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient and accurate registration of MRI and CT datasets following prostate implant is possible, and improves the accuracy of postimplant dosimetry by superior definition of the prostate. Definition of critical microenvironments and adjacent structures will improve dose and toxicity correlation and ultimately improve planning strategies. � 2004 American Brachytherap...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: High intercoder {{reliability}} (ICR) {{is required}} in qualitative content analysis for assuring quality when more than one coder is involved in data analysis. The literature is short of standardized procedures for ICR procedures in qualitative content analysis. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how ICR assessment {{can be used to}} improve codings in qualitative content analysis. METHODS: Key steps of the procedure are presented, drawing on data from a qualitative study on patients' perspectives on low back pain. RESULTS: First, a coding scheme was developed using a comprehensive inductive and deductive approach. Second, 10 transcripts were coded independently by two researchers, and ICR was calculated. A resulting kappa value of. 67 can be regarded as satisfactory to solid. Moreover, varying agreement rates helped to identify problems in the coding scheme. Low agreement rates, for instance, indicated that respective codes were defined too broadly and would need clarification. In a third step, the results of the analysis were used to improve the coding scheme, leading to consistent and high-quality results. DISCUSSION: The quantitative approach of ICR assessment is a viable instrument for quality assurance in qualitative content analysis. Kappa values and close <b>inspection</b> of <b>agreement</b> rates help to estimate and increase quality of codings. This approach facilitates good practice in coding and enhances credibility of analysis, especially when large samples are interviewed, different coders are involved, and quantitative results are presented...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{non-destructive}} methods utilising the Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) and Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) phenomena {{are widely}} used {{in the evaluation of}} the structural integrity of steel components. The MFL method is effectively applied for in-service flaw monitoring of oil and gas pipelines, fuel storage tank floors and rails; whereas the MBN method, due to high sensitivity of Barkhausen emission to residual and applied stress, {{has become one of the}} most popular NDE tools for investigating this condition of steels. Despite the affirming research and successful applications, which helped these methods to gain acceptance as a viable non-destructive tools, there is still a requirement for establishing a quantitative links between magnetic and mechanical properties of steel which would enable their further understanding and optimisation. In this thesis the applications of MFL and MBN methods for flaw and stress detection are analysed via analytical and numerical modelling. A new model relating the MBN amplitude and stress for materials having different magnetostrictive behaviour under load is proposed and validated in the quantitative stress evaluation of different grades of steel. Moreover, a new method for determining depth dependence of stress from measured magnetic Barkhausen signals is presented. A complete set of newly derived equations describing the detected Barkhausen signals in terms of the actual emissions that are generated inside the material and how these appear when they propagate to the surface is given. The results from finite element modelling of magnetic flux leakage signals above unflawed and flawed rails energised in various directions are presented.

50|$|A {{dispute in}} {{relation}} to whether the defendants {{should be allowed to}} have <b>inspection</b> of an <b>agreement</b> made between the Claimants and a third party, in this case a policy issued by an After The Event Insurer. The High Court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Civil Procedure Rules (the “CPR”) to compel the Claimants to produce the Agreement. In addition to this, the Court found that the document was not relevant for the purpose of disclosure, and that, in any event, it attracted litigation privilege as it was individually negotiated between the solicitors for the Claimants and the Insurer. The disclosure of the agreement was likely to prejudice the Claimants in the conduct of the litigation. Citing the Government’s conclusions following its consultation in 2000 on “Conditional Fees: Sharing the Risks of Litigation”, the Senior Master reiterated that in privately funded litigation there is no obligation on either party to disclose how a case is being funded. However, in spite of this, the CPR does ensure that a losing party who may be subject to additional costs {{as a result of a}} funding arrangement should have access to certain specific information about that arrangement. The Court held that these requirements of the CPR balanced the “interests of the parties with funding arrangements and the interests of those who face the claims for additional costs which result from them” and should therefore be considered sufficient without the necessity to disclose the entire agreement.|$|R

That same spring of 1963, however, Kennedy had sent antinuclear activist Norman Cousins to Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, where he explained that the political situation in the US made it very difficult for Kennedy agree to a comprehensive ban with Khrushchev's required terms.

40|$|<b>Inspections</b> under {{international}} <b>agreements</b> related to nonproliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons place sensitive commercial and national-defense information at risk. Facility operators can control risk to sensitive information by denying physical access to inspectors and providing alternative means of inspection. Similarly, exposure of inspectors and facility personnel to radiation or hazardous environments can be reduced, and damage to sensitive processing environments {{can be avoided}} if inspection objectives can be achieved {{without the need for}} direct physical access by inspectors. A system developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) enables inspectors to achieve inspection objectives in sensitive or hazardous areas by providing virtual presence at an inspection location in place of physical presence. The system has two parts, a mobile unit operated by facility personnel and a stationary base station operated by inspectors. The mobile and stationary units are connected by a fiber-optic communications link. The mobile unit is equipped with two video cameras, a global positioning system (GPS) with dead-reckoning capability, distance measuring equipment (DME), and a theodolite. Five unused channels of RS- 232 are available to accommodate data transfer from and control of additional sensor modules. The base station is equipped with monitors for video signals and a notebook computer for analysis and display of sensor data. Inspectors can direct inspection activities through two-way voice communication with the operators of the mobile unit; the real-time response to interactions between inspectors and operators enhances the credibility of the inspection process. Applications involving international inspections for arms control and nonproliferation as well as other applications, such as As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) and two-person-rule implementation, are discussed.

40|$|Adaptations to {{strength}} training are usually divided in two broad categories: morphological (peripheral) and neural (central) adaptations. The {{purpose of this}} thesis {{was to investigate the}} chronic neural adaptations in response to various {{strength training}} interventions (Paper I-III), and the acute neural adjustments that occur after heavy resistance exercise (Paper IV and V). Improved understanding of the mechanisms should allow better prescription of exercise to athletic, clinical, and the general population. The principal measurement techniques employed to assess neural changes were surface electromyogram (EMG) activity and evoked spinal reflexes, namely H-reflex and V-wave responses. Paper I investigated whether maximal functional multiple-joint leg press training could induce neural adaptations to the plantar flexor muscles in a single-joint contraction task. In accordance with the hypothesis, significant “carry-over” effects of neural drive and muscle strength were observed. Paper II assessed the effects of unilateral, maximal strength training on neural adaptations of the untrained contralateral limb. It is extensively documented that “cross-education” of muscle strength occurs, but the mechanisms require further <b>inspection.</b> In <b>agreement</b> with the hypothesis, the findings reinforced the concept that enhanced neural drive to the contralateral agonist muscles is the underlying mechanism for cross-education of strength. Paper III investigated the effects of lower limb strength training on neural drive to the muscle in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. MS-patients are not able to fully activate motor units (recruitment and/or firing frequency) in the lower limbs, and therefore suffer from reduced leg strength compared to healthy individuals. Conversely, strength training induces opposite neural effects, but has never been assessed in this population. Neural drive and muscle strength was enhanced in response to strength training with no negative interactions, in accordance with the hypothesis. Central neural fatigue occurs after resistive exercise. In paper IV it was investigated whether caffeine supplementation could enhance the recovery of efferent neural drive after maximal fatiguing contractions. Contrary to our hypothesis, caffeine did not influence neural recovery and thus did not affect muscle strength. However, this study established a significant relationship between the two measures of efferent neural drive, namely EMG activity and Vwave responses. In contrast to muscle fatigue - the most obvious effect of contractile history, paper V investigated post-activation potentiation (PAP) which is a transient enhancement of power/strength performance after heavy muscle work. This study established the time-courses of the muscular and neural mechanisms proposed being responsible for PAP. Opposite to our hypothesis, strength/power performance was not enhanced at the arbitrarily chosen timepoint. Collectively, increased EMG activity and V-wave responses after strength training demonstrated adaptive changes in the central nervous system leading to increased muscle strength. H-reflex responses remained unchanged in response to the heavy strength training, indicating that adaptations of this pathway were not underlying the present strength gains. Transient changes in the central nervous activation of muscle was observed after acute resistance exercise, although no effects of caffeine were observed, nor were there any evidence of PAP despite the occurrence of the proposed underlying mechanisms.

40|$|This {{work has}} been carried out at the "Laboratoire de Modélisation et Simulation en mécanique des Fluides" of CEA during a stage of 6 months. The main subject of this work {{involves}} jets in cross ﬂow, which are of fundamental industrial importance and {{play an important role in}} the validation of turbulence models. Two jet conﬁgurations are investigated with the TrioCFD code: • a tee junction of circular tubes where a hot jet discharges into a cold main ﬂow. • a rectangular channel discharging a jet marked by a scalar into a main channel ﬂow. The tee-junction conﬁguration is very important for the phenomena of thermal fatigue. The OECD/NEA benchmark on the Vattenfall tee junction ﬂow is analyzed. This test case is selected because, beside the experimental results, various calculations with several turbulence modeling approaches have been published. A Large Eddie Simulation (LES) modeling and calculation strategy is developed and validated on these data for jets in crossﬂow under thermal fatigue conditions. The rectangular jet conﬁguration is important for basic physical understanding and modeling and has been analysed experimentally at CEA by previous studies. Such work was focused on the turbulent mixing between a rectangular channel ﬂow with grid turbulence exiting a heated jet into a conﬁned grid turbulent crossﬂow, with both kinematic and passive scalar high quality measurements in order to characterize its statistical properties (energy spectra, Reynolds stresses anisotropy and PdF). These experiments are analyzed for the ﬁrst time with LES by applying the strategy developed for the ﬁrst conﬁguration. The turbulent inlet boundary conditions are well controlled in both experiment and calculation (grid turbulence). Structured and unstructured grids are used to predict the measured mean values and turbulent ﬂuctuations (velocity and scalars) as well as the Reynolds stresses. The activities aimed also to test the capabilities of the TrioCFD code results through the <b>inspection</b> of their <b>agreement</b> with the experimental datas obtained for T-junctions mixing ducts for a preliminary analysis of TrioCFD performances and to get a balanced compliance of the code’s capabilities...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveMales {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are {{at increased risk}} for developing osteoporosis (OP) with subsequent vertebral compression fractures. Such fractures with resultant increased thoracic kyphotic angle (TKA) may interfere with these patients' already compromised pulmonary function. A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the recognition and treatment of vertebral fractures in male patients with COPD. MethodsThe study population included male patients with COPD aged 55 years and older who had a lateral chest X-ray (index film) performed between January 1, 2001 and July 5, 2005. Vertebral fractures and the TKA were determined independently by two different radiologists. One radiologist (reviewer # 1) used direct measurement including quantitative morphometric analysis to determine fractures and the TKA, whereas the second radiologist (reviewer # 2) used visual <b>inspection</b> only. Inter-reader <b>agreement</b> for vertebral fractures and TKA was assessed. The computerized charts were reviewed to determine the initial recognition of vertebral fractures and the subsequent therapy. Logistic regression was employed to determine significant risk factors for vertebral fractures in this male population. ResultsThree hundred and fifty male study subjects and their index lateral chest X-rays were reviewed. Ages ranged from 52 to 90 and 9 / 350 (2. 6 %) of the study subjects had vertebral fractures identified on the initial radiology report. None of these nine patients were subsequently treated with anti-osteoporotic agents other than calcium and vitamin D, and two of them had a follow-up central bone density. Reviewer # 1 measured 361 fractures in 181 subjects and determined the mean TKA to be 31. 43 (± 8. 62) degrees. Reviewer # 2 identified 27 fractures in 19 subjects and with an estimated mean TKA of 24. 84 (± 8. 53) degrees. There was little inter-observer agreement with vertebral fractures (kappa= 0. 07), but there was a strong positive correlation with the TKA (r= 0. 79). There was a weak to moderate correlation with the TKA and the presence of vertebral fractures (r= 0. 26). Significant risk factors for vertebral fractures included smoking status (odds ratio 1. 84 [1. 08 – 3. 15]) and age (odds ratio 1. 06 [1. 03 – 1. 09] for each year increase in age). ConclusionA large number of vertebral fractures in males with COPD goes undiagnosed. In those patients with diagnosed vertebral fractures, follow-up therapy is under-utilized. When analyzing lateral chest X-rays for vertebral fractures, visual inspection alone without direct measurement may not be an adequate technique for identifying fractures...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Measuring colour {{discrimination}} {{of people who}} carry out tasks where colour is used to convey information and accurate colour judgments are essential for safe and efficient performance of the task is important {{in order to ensure}} that they can carry out the tasks. Individuals with congenital colour vision deficiencies are at a greater risk in making an error in colour judgment and this is the primary reason for colour vision testing in industry. Today, there are a large number of colour vision tests to detect colour vision deficiencies and/or estimate one’s ability to discriminate colours. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the validity and repeatability of new colour vision test “Colour Vision Reaction Time” (CVRT) for screening for colour vision defect. The study will also determine the repeatability of a selection of clinical colour vision tests, which are currently in use. Material and methods: The test series was administrated to 75 colour normal subjects and 47 participants with red-green defects. Colour vision was classified based on Nagel anomaloscope. In the pseudoisochromatic tests, the Hardy, Rand, Rittler 4 th edition (HRR), Ishihara 38 plate edition and Pseudoisochromatic Plates Ishihara Compatible (PIPC) tests subjects are required to identify coloured figure within background of a different colour. For the Colour Vision Reaction Time (CVRT) test, subjects need to locate a coloured Square on a computer’s screen using a mouse. The Cone Contrast Sensitivity Test (CCST) requires individuals to identify coloured letters that may appear in a gray background on the computer’s screen. A prototype of the ColorDx (pColorDx) test is similar to the printed pseudoisochromatic plates except that the plates are displayed on a computer screen. The Farnsworth-Munsell D 15 (D 15) test requires subjects to arrange coloured caps in order according to colour starting from a fixed cap. Results: The agreement of the printed pseudoisochromatic tests with anomaloscope in terms of screening for red-green defect was good with kappa (κ) coefficient of agreement value of 0. 96 or more on all three tests. The repeatability of the three tests was good with κ coefficient of 0. 96 or more on the three tests. Both HRR and PIPC tests can screen for blue-yellow defects. There were 2 deuteranomalous subjects at the first visit and a different deuteranomalous individual at the second visit who made a single blue-yellow error in the HRR test. In the PIPC test, only one deuteranomalous subject failed the blue-yellow screening plates at the first visit with two errors. In terms of the classification as either protan or deutan, the agreement with the Nagel anomaloscope was perfect with the HRR test and acceptable with the Ishihara, but only fair for the PIPC test. The agreement of the repeatability of the classification was perfect at the HRR test and good at the Ishihara test whereas it was reasonable at the PIPC test. The HRR test was designed to classify the severity of the defect and there was a reasonable correlation between the HRR severity and the Nagel anomaloscope matching ranges. The agreement of the three computerized colour vision tests with anomaloscope was good with κ coefficients ≥ 0. 91. The repeatability of these three tests was good with κ coefficients ≥ 0. 98. All the three tests can screen for blue-yellow defects. In the CVRT test, the response times of most subjects to the blue-yellow test figures were within 1. 0 standard deviation of the white control value. The single exception was deuteranomalous subject who did not fail any other blue-yellow screening test. Ten subjects failed the pColorDx blue-yellow test, whereas 3 subjects failed the CCST S-cone portion. The CCST and pColorDx computer test can classify the defect as protan or deutan. Both tests showed a good-to-perfect agreement with anomaloscope. The pColorDx test can grade the severity of the defect in terms of mild, moderate to severe. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient with the Nagel matching ranges was only moderate. The Farnsworth D 15 test was included to determine whether there was a difference in the pass rate using the results from the first trial or requiring the subjects to pass on 2 of 3 trials. There was a marginal improvement in the pass rate using the 2 out of 3 rule. The repeatability of the 2 out of 3 trails in the D 15 test showed that there was a good agreement between sessions with κ coefficient of 0. 87. In terms of classifying the defect as protan or deutan, based on the visual inspection, there was a good agreement with κ coefficient = 0. 83. However, based on the Colour Difference Vector (CDV) angle parameter, all the colour defective subjects was correctly classified. The repeatability of classifying the type of the defect based on the CDV showed perfect agreement between the first and second visit. The D 15 can classify the defect as mild versus moderate-to-severe. As expected, the majority of individuals who failed the D 15 were classified as having moderate to severe classification on the HRR and pColorDx tests. Discussion and Conclusion: The current study confirms that the three pseudoisochromatic tests are effective in screening for red-green colour vision defect. The HRR test may be preferred over the Ishihara and PIPC because the sensitivity was marginally higher than the other two tests. Agreement of the diagnostic plates with the Nagel anomaloscope as to whether the colour vision defect was protan or deutan varied across tests. The results from this study agreed with the Birch’s (1997) results for the Ishihara in that approximately 85 % of the colour defectives were classified correctly as either protan or deutan. However, HRR classification results were slightly better than Cole, et al’s. In terms of the severity, our results were similar to Cole et al in that there were a reasonable correlation between the HRR severity and the Nagel anomaloscope matching ranges. The three computerized colour vision tests are effective in terms of screening for red-green defects. The CCST had the highest agreement with anomaloscope, but it was not significantly different from the other two tests. However, the pColorDx ability to grade the severity was moderate, but it was slightly lower than the HRR plates. All three tests are capable of screening tritan defects. Our results suggest that a small number of deutans are likely to fail this portion of these tests. The D 15 test showed a reasonable repeatability on terms of pass/fail when we used 2 out of 3 rule and marginally better than performing only one trail on separate days. In terms of the repeatability of classification, the study showed that there was a good agreement between sessions based on the visual <b>inspection</b> and perfect <b>agreement</b> between sessions based on Colour Difference Vector parameters...|$|R
40|$|On the {{occasion}} of {{the annual meeting of the}} “Foreign Policy Association” in New York on 7 May 2003, US Secretary of State Colin Powell said in a both humorous and serious address that the transatlantic alliance had left the differences of opinion over the Iraq War behind, and now it was time to ensure together a place in the world for the Iraqi people as a free, stable and self-governing country. None of the members should think that they could handle the major global challenges alone. The easing of the tension sworn to by Colin Powell may have been helped by the fact that neither the optimistic supporters nor the pessimistic critics were right on the course or outcome of the Iraq War. While one might speak of a kind of freeing of the Iraqis, the ambivalence in the Iraqi people towards this freedom by war and occupation has been underestimated by the “liberators”. Peace is still a long way off. This applies not only to the difficult material and political reconstruction in Iraq. Popularity ratings for the USA have waned since 1992, in the Muslim world they are ultimately “in the basement”. Here, support for the western fight against terrorism has also waned. To date, there has been no evidence of the given reasons for the war, the lack of credibility, perhaps even open manipulation of their own as well as the global public by the leading western power and her coalition partners may lead to further immense strain. If the project to stabilise Iraq in human terms fails, not only those directly affected but, due to the global implications, many other countries will also suffer irrespective of whether they were for or against the war. In this respect, Colin Powell is doubtless right: even those among the USA’s allies who were against the war have no choice but to accept the task of supporting post-war Iraq; not least because the historical balance of US policy of democratization through intervention is negative overall. The appeal to common values and the requirement of a partnership of convenience of course cannot hide longer-lasting ill feelings: “USA bashing” is popular in Europe, and “Europe bashing” is popular in the USA. Anti-Americanism is nothing new in Europe, it is as old as the founding of the “New World”. American reservations towards Europe extend on their part to the time of the physical and political separation from the “Old (European) World”, in this respect too, such reservations have time and again assumed different forms in the historical process. These frequently ritualised, habitual antiattitudes are full of projections and can easily be refuted empirically. More interesting than the simple fact of animosity is the question of how deep it runs and whether it impacts the substance of the transatlantic relationship. The controversy over the dealings with Saddam Hussein and his disarmament obligations are part of a larger picture in which the USA’s foreign policy goals and strategies play a part or are put up for discussion. More important than anti-American sentiment which has always been present in Germany and Europe as a whole, is the fact that a lot of basically pro-American politicians, journalists and intellectuals in Europe are increasingly concerned about a long-term trend of US global policy which has reached new heights with the Bush government: militant nationalism and unilateralism combined with militarised power politics. The following are particularly striking examples of this trend: the rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, originally an accepted return service for II the unlimited extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1995; the strong reactions by the USA to the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the associated pressure on countries who signed up to this statute; the refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of worldwide CO 2 emissions, combined with an energy policy promoting a drastic increase in the use of fossil fuels; and – in retrospect particularly piquant in the light of the war waged by the USA on Saddam Hussein for assumed non-compliance with the conditions concerning the destruction of his weapons of mass destruction – the relaxation of the <b>inspections</b> contrary to <b>agreement,</b> which the radical conservative Republicans demanded from the Clinton Administration for the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and by which they have undermined the effectiveness of this exemplary convention in terms of world order politics. The question is, therefore, whether the transatlantic “ill feeling” in connection with the Iraq crisis is in fact part of a larger crisis in European-American relations. In addition to the central dimensions of relations between Europe and the USA, this report therefore gives special attention to the foreign and security policy “grand strategy” of the United States. There is (as yet) no question of irreparable harm done to European-American relations. The general public on both sides of the Atlantic are still a lot closer than the differences on the diplomatic level would suggest. Although the mutual popularity ratings of the USA and Europe have dropped compared to 2002, the have somewhat recovered from their lowest point shortly before the Iraq War. The reservations of critics of the USA are based less on the American people than on the politics of the Bush Administration. Majorities in several European NATO countries are calling for more independence from the USA, yet more important is the findings that public opinion in the USA is no less multilaterally disposed than in Europe; on the other hand, Europeans do not vote as antimilitarily as many hardliners in the USA think. However, American citizens feel (in a very much similar order) altogether more threatened by perceived problematic international developments than Europeans. This difference was already visible before 11 September 2001, but it has intensified since the attacks. And Europeans want to cooperate with the USA equally on the security policy level, but are far more critical of military expenditures than Americans. There are furthermore some differences in long-term attitudes: Americans are clearly more nationalistic than most Europeans, and for them religion plays a much stronger role, privately and in the political arena. Economic relations between the USA and Europe house a series of systematic problems and current conflicts, in no way untypical of partners who are also competitors. Nonetheless, the majority of experts do not expect that this will result in a comparable addition of divisions as in security policy or international law. The US and EU economies are deeply integrated and intermeshed, and this intermeshing has clearly increased in recent years. Transatlantic economic relations form the most closely-knit trade and investment system in the world. Economic policy integration does trail behind the development of material processes of exchange, but these are more heavily regulated than ever, in particular owing to the dispute settlement mechanism, which was substantitally improved with the foundation of the WTO. In addition to the mode of power, the mode of compromise characterises transatlantic economic relations. This balance could of course be put under pressure, if poor global economic trends and structural economic problems on III both sides of the Atlantic were to further diminish the readiness to compromise and adapt in favour of global agreements (for example in the agricultural sector or in the area of regulating international financial markets). However, decisive changes now characterise relations between the USA and her allies on the level of the “grand strategy” in foreign policy, primarily in security policy and international law. The USA has gradually revoked the liberal-institutionalist basis of its hegemonial global order policy, which dominated the period after the Second World War. The conservative revolution and the Republican majority in Congress introduced this Uturn in the mid- 1990 s, and it is now being continued on the neoconservative line with support from large parts of the Bush jr. Administration. The majority of relevant decision- makers among the Republicans in Congress and in the administration comprise three groups: old hardliners from the Cold War period, who are oriented towards categories of power, especially military power, Christian fundamentalists, and neoconservatives. In the fight against terror and rogue states, the three groups have found their mission around which they are redefining themselves. The new “grand strategy” has neoimperial traits: The USA will do everything she can to maintain her military advantage; no other power or group of powers should be given the opportunity to catch up with her. The new global strategy includes a dramatisation of new threats, which can no longer be suppressed with deterrence; potential threats ought to or must be fought anticipatively i. e. preventively. International rules, treaties and alliances are experiencing a clear debasement in the face of the primacy of freedom of action. The result of these ideological shifts in the USA is a long list of acts in the international arena, in which the United States reject, sabotage or do not support joint solutions in ways equal to her importance and economic capacity. How can we explain the differences in basic global ideas and their legal and specific political shaping between large parts of the ruling political elites in the USA and Europe? The “personae” in the transatlantic drama are not important for structural realism, they just act out roles prescribed by the division of power. The USA is a leading super power and she behaves accordingly. It was only under the protective shield of the USA, that Europe could unite at all, and today places the accent on the “soft” methods of power policy. The USA cannot and ought not to adopt the policy of “be nice to and get along with each|$|R
