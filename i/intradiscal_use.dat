40|$|Nucleus pulposus {{replacement}} therapy could offer a less invasive alternative {{to restore the}} function of moderately degenerated intervertebral discs than current potentially destructive surgical procedures. Numerous nucleus pulposus substitutes have already been investigated, to assess their applicability for <b>intradiscal</b> <b>use.</b> Still, the current choice of testing methods often {{does not lead to}} efficient translation into clinical application. In this paper, we present the evaluation of a novel nucleus pulposus substitute, consisting of a hydromed core and an electrospun envelope. We performed three mechanical evaluations and an in vivo pilot experiment. Initially, the swelling pressure of the implant was assessed in confined compression. Next, we incorporated the implant into mechanically damaged caprine lumbar intervertebral discs to determine biomechanical segment behaviour in bending and torsion. Subsequently, segments were serially tested in native, damaged and repaired conditions under dynamic axial compressive loading regimes in a loaded disc culture system. Finally, nucleus pulposus substitutes were implanted in a live goat spine using a transpedicular approach. In confined compression, nucleus pulposus samples as well as implants showed some load-bearing capacity, but the implant exhibited a much lower absolute pressure. In bending and torsion, we found that the nucleus pulposus substitute could partly restore the mechanical response of the disc. During dynamic axial compression in the loaded disc culture system, on the other hand, the implant was not able to recover axial compressive behaviour towards the healthy situation. Moreover, the nucleus pulposus substitutes did not remain in place in the in vivo situation but migrated out of the disc area. From these results, we conclude that implants may mimic native disc behaviour in simple mechanical tests, yet fail in other, more realistic set-ups. Therefore, we recommend that biomaterials for nucleus pulposus replacement be tested in testing modalities of increasing complexity and in their relevant anatomical surroundings, for a more reliable prediction of clinical potentia...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} chemonucleolysis in 48 {{patients}} with lumbar disc disease revealed marked improvement in 58 %, slight improvement in 23 %, and no improvement in 19 %. Serious anaphylactic reactions occurred in two patients. These results {{and those of}} other neurosurgical and orthopaedic studies are summarized and compared with the 70 % improvement rate obtained with a placebo in a recent double blind controlled cooperative study. Only those few investigators participating in the double blind study are now permitted to <b>use</b> <b>intradiscal</b> chymopapain. It is concluded that the ultimate place of chemonucleolysis, if any, in the treatment of ruptured lumbar discs remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|LBP {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for visiting a doctor and is the most common cause of {{disability}} under age 45. Amongst a variety of etiologies, internal disc disruption (IDD) has been postulated as an important cause of low back pain. Treating discogenic low back pain continues to be a challenge to physicians. Inflammation, either from direct chemical irritation or secondary to an autoimmune response to the nucleus pulposus has been implicated as the primary pain source. Both steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have partial effectiveness in treating pain associated with inflammation. Therefore, the rationale for <b>using</b> <b>intradiscal</b> steroids is to suppress the inflammation within the disc, thereby alleviating the patient’s symptoms. The goal of this article is to review the literature regarding the efficacy of intradiscal steroids to treat low back pain of discogenic origin...|$|R
40|$|Pre-clinical {{in vitro}} tests {{are needed to}} {{evaluate}} the biomechanical performance of new spinal implants. For such experiments large animal models are frequently used. Whether these models allow any conclusions concerning the implant’s performance in humans is difficult to answer. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether calf, pig or sheep spine specimens may be used to replace human specimens in in vitro flexibility and cyclic loading tests with two different implant types. First, a dynamic and a rigid fixator were tested using six human, six calf, six pig and six sheep thoracolumbar spine specimens. Standard flexibility tests were carried out in a spine tester in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation in the intact state, after nucleotomy and after implantation. Then, the Coflex interspinous implant was tested for flexibility and <b>intradiscal</b> pressure <b>using</b> another six human and six calf lumbar spine segments. Loading was carried out as described above in the intact condition, after creation of a defect and after implantation. The fixators were most easily implantable into the calf. Qualitatively, they had similar effects on ROM in all species, however, the degree of stability achieved differed. Especially in axial rotation, the ROM of sheep, pig and calf was partially less than half the human ROM. Similarly, implantation of the Coflex interspinous implant caused the ROM to either increase in both species or to decrease in both of them, however, quantitatively, differences were observed. This was also the case for the intradiscal pressure. In conclusion, animal species, especially the calf, may be used to get a first idea of how a new pedicle screw system or an interspinous implant behaves in in vitro flexibility tests. However, the effects on ROM and intradiscal pressure have to be expected to differ in magnitude between animal and human. Therefore, the last step in pre-clinical implant testing should always be an experiment with human specimens...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Currently, {{no studies}} exist, which attest the {{suitability}} of the ovine intervertebral disc as a biomechanical in vivo model for preclinical tests of new therapeutic strategies of the human disc. By measuring the intradiscal pressure in vivo, the current study attempts to characterize an essential biomechanical parameter {{to provide a more}} comprehensive physiological understanding of the ovine intervertebral disc. METHODS: Intradiscal pressure (IDP) was measured for 24 hours within the discs L 2 -L 3 and L 4 -L 5 via a piezo-resistive pressure sensor in one merino sheep. The data were divided into an activity and a recovery phase and the corresponding average pressures for both phases were determined. Additionally, IDPs for different static and dynamic activities were analyzed and juxtaposed to human data published previously. After sacrificing the sheep, the forces corresponding to the measured IDPs were examined ex vivo in an axial compression test. RESULTS: The temporal patterns of IDP where pressure decreased during activity and increased during rest were comparable between humans and sheep. However, large differences were observed for different dynamic activities such as standing up or walking. Here, IDPs averaged 3. 73  MPa and 1. 60  MPa respectively, approximately two to four times higher in the ovine disc compared to human. These IDPs correspond to lower ex vivo derived axial compressive forces for the ovine disc in comparison to the human disc. For activity and rest, average ovine forces were 130  N and 58  N, compared to human forces of 400 - 600  N and 100  N, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo IDPs were found to be higher in the ovine than in the human disc. In contrast, axial forces derived ex vivo were markedly lower in comparison to humans. Both should be considered in future preclinical tests of <b>intradiscal</b> therapies <b>using</b> the sheep. The techniques used in the current study may serve as a protocol for measuring IDP in a variety of large animal models...|$|R
40|$|Publicado em "Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine", vol. 7, supp. 1 (2013) Hydrogels offer unique {{opportunities}} for regenerative {{strategies of the}} intervertebral disc. A nucleotomy necessary for the implantation of hydrogels, however, disrupts the annulus integrity and destroys natural interfaces in the disc. To clarify whether hydrogels can restore the mechanical competence of the disc an experimental testwas <b>used.</b> <b>Intradiscal</b> pressure(IDP) in an ovine disc was measured in vivo for 24 h and adapted to an axial compressive test consisting of three cycles 15 -min diurnal and 30 -min night load. To study the fluid mechanics, 30 motion segments in different defect conditions were used: (i) INTACT; (ii) DEFANN: isolated annulus defect; (iii) DEF-NUC: re-implanted nucleus; (iv) DDAHA and (v) iGG-MA: two hydrogels. DEF-ANN showed {{no significant difference in}} disc height loss or IDP compared to INTACT, while DEF-NUC reduced the IDP by ~ 30 %(p = 0. 03) and tended to increase the height loss(p = 0. 2). Both DDAHA and iGG-MA better reflected the height loss of INTACT, but caused an even stronger loss in IDP than DEF-NUC(~ 34 %). Neither the hydrogels nor the re-implanted nucleus, assumed to be the ideal implant, could restore the mechanical functionality of the disc. Hydrogels designed to mimic the mechanical behavior of the native nucleus may fail in restoring IDP due to the destruction of natural interfaces and an inappropriate annulus closure. To regain a biomechanical equivalent of the natural nucleus, more attention needs to be paid to the anchoring of the substitute inside the disc...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to deter-mine if the Disc Unloader brace was {{effective}} in reducing intradiscal pressure. There is a strong correlation between lumbar paraspinal activity and <b>intradiscal</b> pressure. We <b>used</b> ten healthy volunteers to measure lumbar paraspinal activ-ity at L 5 using a quantitative EMG system. Af-ter doing reliability and reproducibility testing which showed margin of error of 7 %, ten volun-teers were measured for quantitative EMG ac-tivity at the L 5 paraspinal level in full lumbar flexion without the Disc Unloader brace three times and averaged. The same quantitative EMG testing was done in full flexion with the Disc Unloader brace on at the L 5 paraspinal level three times and averaged. For five of the ten patients, we performed the test first with the Disc Unloader brace on whereas for the rest of the five, the test was performed first without the brace on. There were 7 females and 3 males with average age of 39 (range 26 - 46). The average area under the curve score was 173 ± 27. 1 microvolts at the L 5 paraspi-nal for the ten healthy subjects without the Disc Unloader brace on. The average area un-der the curve score was 102 ± 19. 6 microvolts at the L 5 paraspinal for ten healthy subjects with the Disc Unloader brace on. There was a statis-tically significant (p< 0. 05) reduction in quanti-tative paraspinal activity of 41 % with the Disc Unloader brace on. We conclude that the Disc Unloader brace is effective in reducing quanti-tative EMG lumbar paraspinal myoelectric ac-tivity and therefore intradiscal pressures...|$|R
