40|$|ABSTRACT The wave shape, intensity, {{and time}} {{course of the}} flash were {{examined}} {{with the aid of}} electronic operations in order to characterize the luminescence response and examine the in vivo dynamics of the light reaction. The most,prominent single component of the flash shape is its exponential decay, beginning several milliseconds after the intensity maximum, with a mean rate constantat 23 °C of [...] 0. 088 msec- 1. Earlier components of the <b>flash</b> <b>curve</b> are more complex, exhibiting no pure exponentials with time. As predicted from previous observations, the time course of the flash triggered by a propagated action potential, and therefore influenced by the conduction time of the triggering potential, is measurably slower than that of the synchronously triggered flash. The time course of emission from individual specimens is otherwise quite stable, undergoing only limited slowing with short-interval fatigue or specimen deterioration in spite of marked changes in the amplitude of the wave form. Relative stability of amplitude is obtained when flashes are elicited at regular intervals greater than 10 sec. On the basis of an analogue computer simulation (Appendix) the dynamics of the luminescence wave shape were found to be compatible with a short sequence of first order processes acting on an initial brief transient...|$|E

40|$|Most {{examples}} of linear friction weld process models {{have focused on}} joining two identically shaped workpieces. This article reports {{on the development of}} a 2 D model, using the DEFORM finite element package, to investigate the joining of a rectangular Ti- 6 Al- 4 V workpiece to a plate of the same material. The work focuses on how this geometry affects the material flow, thermal fields and interface contaminant removal. The results showed that the material flow and thermal fields were not even across the two workpieces. This resulted in more material expulsion being required to remove the interface contaminants from the weld line when compared to joining two identically shaped workpieces. The model also showed that the <b>flash</b> <b>curves</b> away from the weld due to the rectangular upstand "burrowing" into the base plate. Understanding these critical relationships between the geometry and process outputs is crucial for further industrial implementation of the LFW process. EPSRC, The Welding Institut...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In Experiment 1, pigeons were {{presented}} with a sequence of light flashes and cued to peck a key for reward either after a fixed time or after a fixed number of <b>flashes.</b> <b>Curves</b> that showed the rate of key pecking over time within trials indicated that peak rates of response were reached near the fixed time on timing-cued trials and near the fixed number of flashes on counting-cued trials. In Experi-ment 2, the key cue was shifted from timing to counting or from counting to timing midway through a trial. The peak times reached after the cue change indicated that pigeons kept track of time while cued to count but did not count while cued to time. These findings suggest a basic asymmetry in the dual-mode model of timing and counting. Accumulating evidence indicates that animals can readily {{keep track of the}} passage of time and the frequency of an event occurring within a period of time. Meck and Church (1983) trained rats to press a lever {{on the left side of}} an operant chamber for reward after hearing two 0. 5 -s bursts of white noise played over a 2 -s period and to press a lever on the right for reward after hearing eight bursts of white noise played over an 8 -s period. W. A. Roberts and Mitchell (1994) used the same design with pigeons by training them to peck different keys following either two flashes of a 200 -ms light presented over 2 s or eight flashes of the light presented over 8 s. In both experiments, the confound between time and number was removed in tests that held time constant at 4 s and varied number from two to eight bursts or flashes and other tests that held number constant at four bursts or flashes and varied time duration from 2 to 8 s. These tests yielded equivalent psychophysical functions that showed a continuous in-crease in choice of the long (many) response as either time or number increased. It was concluded from these findings that both rats and pigeons are able to record time and number simultaneously (Broad...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{characterisation}} of 85 rear-line-contacted silicon concentrator {{solar cells}} on one single wafer requires a fast, automated measurement system. In this paper an {{easy to use}} needle array measurement system is presented, which allows an automated sequential measurement of dark and light IV curves of all cells on one wafer. For acquiring IV curves under high illumination levels (up to 500 suns), a flash tester is presented, which permits measurements of cell parameters of high lifetime silicon concentrator solar cells without suffering from transient errors. This is achieved through a nearly constant voltage at the cell during one <b>flash.</b> The IV <b>curves</b> acquired with this new flash tester are in very good agreement with the ones acquired with a standard steady-state measurement setup...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthetic energy {{conversion}} {{was investigated in}} five species of marine unicellular algae, (Dunaliella tertiolecta, Thalassiosira pseudonana, T. weisflogii, Skeletorema costatum, Isochrysis galbana) representing three phylogenetic classes, which were grown under steady state conditions with either light or inorganic nitrogen as a limiting factor. Using a pump and probe fluorescence technique we measured the maximum change in variable fluorescence yields, the <b>flash</b> intensity saturation <b>curves</b> for the change in fluorescence yields and the kinetics of the decay in fluorescence yields. Under all growth irradiance levels nutrient replete cells exhibited approximately the same changes in fluorescence yields and similar fluorescence decay kinetics. The apparent relative absorption cross-section of photosystem II, calculated from {{the slope of the}} <b>flash</b> intensity saturation <b>curves,</b> generally increased as cells shade adapted. The decay kinetics of the fluorescence yield following a saturating pump flash can be expressed as the sum of three exponential components, with half-times of 160 and 600 microseconds and 30 to 300 milliseconds. The relative contribution of each component did not change significantly with growth irradiance. As cells became more nitrogen limited, however, the maximum change in fluorescence yield decreased, and was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of a 160 microsecond fluorescence decay component, which corresponds to the transfer of electrons from Qa− to Qb. Changes in fluorescence yields were also accompanied by changes in the levels of D 1, a protein which is integral in reaction center II, and CP 47, a chlorophyll protein forming part of the core of photosystem II. These results are consistent with a loss of functional photosystem II reaction centers. Moreover, in spite of losses of total cellular chlorophyll, which invariably accompanied nitrogen limitation, the apparent absorption cross-sections of photosystem II increased. Our results suggest that nitrogen limitation leads to substantial decreases in photosynthetic {{energy conversion}} efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{amplitude}} versus <b>flash</b> strength <b>curve</b> of 15 Hz electroretinograms (ERGs) shows two minima. The minima {{are caused}} by interactions between the primary and the secondary rod pathways (first minimum), and the secondary rod pathway and the cone-driven pathway (second minimum). Furthermore, cone pathway contributions cause higher-order harmonics {{to occur in the}} responses. We measured 15 Hz ERGs in 20 healthy subjects to determine normal ranges and in patients to verify our hypotheses on the contributions of the different pathways and to investigate the clinical application. We analyzed the amplitudes and phases of the 15, 30, and 45 Hz components in the ERGs. The overall shape of the 15 Hz amplitude curves was similar in all normal subjects and showed two minima. The 30 and 45 Hz amplitude curves increased for stimuli of high flash strengths indicating cone pathway contributions. The 15 Hz amplitude curve of the responses of an achromat was {{similar to that of the}} normal subjects for low flash strengths and showed a minimum, indicating normal primary and secondary rod pathway function. There was no second minimum, and there were no higher-order harmonics, consistent with absent cone pathway function. The 15 Hz ERGs in CSNB 1 and CSNB 2 patients were similar and of low amplitude for flash strengths just above where the first minimum normally occurs. We could determine that in the CSNB 1 patients, the responses originate from the cone pathway, while in the CSNB 2 patients, the responses originate from the secondary rod pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} {{high temperature}} resistance of silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) based ceramics makes them suitable for tribological applications above room temperature or in high speed unlubricated sliding. There are some published {{works on the}} wear behaviour of Si 3 N 4 /metal alloys. However, experimental data are shown {{in a form that}} is not of direct use for engineers involved in materials selection. In the present work, Si 3 N 4 pins were tested against tool steel and grey cast iron on a pin-on-disc tribometer. Ceramics were produced by hot-pressing and tested without lubrication at variable temperature and sliding speed. SEM/EDS and XRD analysis were used for chemical and microstructural characterisation of worn surfaces and wear debris. At low speeds (0. 05 - 0. 5 m s-I) and room temperature, Si 3 N 4 surfaces are polished-like due to a combination of humidity-assisted tribo-oxidation and abrasive action of very fine wear debris. At high sliding speeds (2 - 3. 5 m S-I), as well as for temperatures in the range 400 - 600 °C, an extensive coherent tribolayer mainly composed by iron oxides spreads over the ceramic surfaces. Polishing and protection by adherent tribolayers are the mechanisms responsible for observed severe and mild wear regimes, respectively. Wear maps are constructed showing the transition of wear regimes in Si 3 N 4 /iron alloys contacts determined by constant <b>flash</b> temperature <b>curves.</b> Equations for calculation of bulk and flash contact temperatures in tribocontacts between dissimilar materials are deduced...|$|R
40|$|The minimum in the {{amplitude}} versus <b>flash</b> strength <b>curve</b> of dark-adapted 15 Hz electroretinograms (ERGs) {{has been}} attributed to interactions between the primary and secondary rod pathways. The 15 Hz ERGs can be used to examine the two rod pathways in patients. However, previous studies suggested that the cone-driven pathway also contributes to the 15 Hz ERGs for flash strengths just above that of the minimum. We investigated cone pathway contributions to improve upon the interpretation of (abnormal) 15 Hz ERGs measured in patients. We recorded 15 Hz ERGs in five healthy volunteers, using a range of flash strengths that we extended to high values. The stimuli were varied in both colour (blue, green, amber, and red) and flash duration (short flash and square wave) in order to stimulate rods and cones in various ways. The differences in the responses to the four colours could be fully explained by the spectral sensitivity of rods for flash strengths up to approximately 12. 5 log quanta·deg− 2. At higher flash strengths, higher-order harmonics appeared in the responses which could be attributed to cones being more sensitive than rods to higher frequencies. Furthermore, the amplitude curves of the blue and green responses showed a second minimum suggesting rod to cone interactions. We present a descriptive model of the contributions of the rod and cone pathways. In clinical application, we would advise using the short flash flicker instead of the square wave flicker, as the responses are of larger amplitude, and cone pathway contributions can be recognized from large higher-order harmonics...|$|R
40|$|Photoreceptor {{currents}} of the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri {{were analyzed using}} a dissolver mutant. The photocurrents are restricted to the eyespot region of somatic cells. Photocurrents are detectable from intact cells and excised eyes. The rhodopsin action spectrum suggests that the currents are induced by Volvox rhodopsin. Flash-induced photocurrents are a composition of a fast Ca 2 +-carried current (PF) and a slower current (PS), which is carried by H+. PF is a high-intensity response that appears with a delay of less than 50 micros after <b>flash.</b> The stimulus-response <b>curve</b> of its initial rise is fit by a single exponential and parallels the rhodopsin bleaching. These two observations suggest that the responsible channel is closely connected to the rhodopsin, both forming a tight complex. At low flash energies PS is dominating. The current delay increases up to 10 ms, and the PS amplitude saturates when only a few percent of the rhodopsin is bleached. The data {{are in favor of}} a second signaling system, which includes a signal transducer mediating between rhodopsin and the channel.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of Saturn's central flash obtained from Palomar and McDonald Observatories during the 3 July 1989 occultation of 28 Sgr. As the star passed {{close to the}} geometric center of Saturn's shadow, the focusing of the incident starlight by the planet's atmosphere formed multiple stellar images along the limb which were detected in infrared images obtained at wavelengths of 3. 9 (Palomar) and 2. 1 microns (McDonald). These are the first reported {{observations of}} a central flash due to Saturn, and the first of any planet in which the signal flash from each stellar image could be determined separately, permitting a comparison of both intensity and position for each image with model predictions. Four separate flashes were observed from each observatory, corresponding to points on the limb where the starlight passed through the Cassini Division and the relatively transparent C Ring, with maximum brightness reaching 1 - 2 % of the unocculted stellar intensity. The timing of the flashes is quite sensitive {{to the shape of}} Saturn's limb, which depends in turn on the planet's zonal gravity harmonics and on the zonal wind profile in the lower stratosphere, near the 2. 5 -mbar pressure level. The locations of the images along the limb, as well as the timing, shapes, and amplitudes of the individual <b>flash</b> light <b>curves,</b> are well matched by a smoothed model based on a tropospheric zonal wind profile obtained from tracking cloud features in Voyager images and the Saturn ring optical depth profile obtained from the Voyager Photopolarimeter experiment. The smoothing required to give the best match to the data exceeds that attributable to the finite angular extent of the occulted star and may be due to refractive scattering by turbulence or wave structure in Saturn's atmosphere. There is no evidence of significant atmospheric absorption at the observed wavelengths, which correspond to spectral regions of weak methane absorption...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn open {{question}} regarding the changes of energy distribution between Photosystems (PS) I and II following protein phosphorylation and thylakoid destacking {{is whether or}} not excitation energy redirected from PS II antenna is effectively trapped by PS I reaction centers. In this report, we measured the effects in spinach thylakoids of Mg 2 +-depletion and of phosphorylation at 5 and 1 mM MgCl 2 on: (1) the effective absorption cross-sections (σ) of both PS II and PS I determined simultaneously from single-turnover <b>flash</b> saturation <b>curves</b> of Ch 1 a fluorescence and of the absorbance change at 820 nm, respectively; (2) the absolute changes in 77 K fluorescence yields emitted by PS II and PS I; and (3) the quenching of room temperature Ch 1 a fluorescence. In all experiments, we observed complementary changes between σPS I and σPS II, σPS I consistently increasing at the expense of σPS II. ATP-induced decreases of σPS II were 6. 9 % and 11. 2 % at 5 and 1 mM MgCl 2, respectively, whereas σPS I increased by 12 % and 18. 6 % under these conditions. In absence of Mg 2 +, σPS II and σPS I changed respectively by − 26. 2 % and + 38. 9 % relative to thylakoids resuspended in presence of 5 mM MgCl 2. These relative increases of σPS I are larger than the relative decreases of σPS II by a factor of 1. 5 – 1. 7, probably due to the stoichiometry between PS II and PS I complexes typically found in sun-adapted spinach leaves. Also, we observed that the increases of σPS I correspond closely to the increases of 77 K fluorescence yields emitted at 735 nm by PS I. However, no clear relationship could be detected between the changes of σPS II and the quenching of both room temperature and 77 K PS II fluorescence. The reasons for such discrepancy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increasing}} number of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) discovered the question of their origin remains open and causes heated debates in the supernova community. Currently, there are three proposed mechanisms for SLSNe: (1) pair-instability supernovae (PISN), (2) magnetar-driven supernovae, and (3) models in which the supernova ejecta interacts with a circumstellar material ejected before the explosion. Based on current observations of SLSNe, the PISN origin has been disfavoured for a number of reasons. Many PISN models provide overly broad light curves and too reddened spectra, because of massive ejecta and a high amount of nickel. In the current study we re-examine PISN properties using progenitor models computed with the GENEC code. We calculate supernova explosions with <b>FLASH</b> and light <b>curve</b> evolution with the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. We find that high-mass models (200 and 250 solar masses) at relatively high metallicity (Z= 0. 001) do not retain hydrogen in the outer layers and produce relatively fast evolving PISNe Type I and might be suitable to explain some SLSNe. We also investigate uncertainties in light curve modelling due to codes, opacities, the nickel-bubble effect and progenitor structure and composition. Comment: 14 pages, 1 table, 19 figures.

Fluid inclusions have very low salinities between 1. 7 and 0 wt. % NaCl and a wide range of temperatures from ~ 360 to 160 °C. There was extensive boiling and "flashing" of the hydrothermal fluids which initiated mineral deposition. The range of temperatures is consistent with emplacement of the veins at ~ 700 m depth, with the pressure decreasing from near lithostatic to near hydrostatic and a decrease in temperature to ~ 250 °C due to adiabatic expansion of the fluids. There is evidence of a limited amount of boiling, but the temperature and pressure decrease was close to the liquid-vapour <b>curve.</b> <b>Flashing</b> of the fluids was caused by sudden drops to sub-hydrostatic pressures and even lower temperatures. Mineralization was caused by these pressure related temperature decreases as there is no evidence of cooling and dilution of the ore-fluids. δ 34 S values of sulphides indicate a magmatic source but the more negative than usual values also suggest boiling affected isotopes. δD and δ 18 O of the fluids indicate a mixing between meteoric waters and magmatic fluids, with the large range of δD due to boiling.

40|$|AbstractIn whole {{algae and}} {{isolated}} thylakoids, the maximum yield of Chla fluorescence induced by a saturating single turnover flash {{is about half}} of the maximum yield observed under continuous illumination. The origins of this low fluorescence yield were investigated by measuring in fresh spinach thylakoids incubated under different conditions the fluorescence yield induced by a weak non-actinic flash fired alone (Fo) or 50 μs after a saturating laser flash (Fm) and also the PSII effective absorption cross-section (σPSII) derived from the <b>flash</b> energy saturation <b>curves</b> of Fv (Fv = Fm − Fo). We observed that: (1) In the presence of a background blue light or after the chemical reduction of the primary quinone electron acceptor QA, a saturating single turnover flash induced high fluorescence yields comparable to the maximum yield observed under continuous illumination. (2) Addition of carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) in the assay medium increased the variable fluorescence (Fv = Fm − Fo) by 24 % relative to the control and abolished its period-four oscillation under repetitive flashes. (3) After dark incubation of thylakoids under reducing conditions where most of the plastoquinone pool was chemically reduced, large increases of both FvσPSII were observed. (4) In thylakoids treated with the inhibitor DCMU, both Fo and Fm were increased by 30 % relative to the control but no significant change of σPSII was observed. In contrast to intact thylakoids, Fm increased significantly under repititive flashes in DCMU-treated thylakoids. Moreover, the enhancements of σPSII following the plastoquinone chemical reduction were largely abolished in DCMU-treated thylakoids. From these observations, we conclude that although some limitations of the PSII donor side contribute to the low fluorescence yield after a single turnover flash, most of the fluorescence quenching present after a single turnover flash originates from the oxidized plastoquinone pool and/or from a unidentified component, possibly the putative quencher Q 2...|$|R
