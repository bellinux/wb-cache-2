40|$|McLean County, Illinois {{farmers were}} {{surveyed}} {{in order to}} explore and analyze their perceptions of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops and their <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> cropping decisions. Questionnaires were mailed to 400 randomly selected farmers, and 156 were returned. The 134 respondents who reported that they planned to plant crops in 2003 {{were asked to provide}} information about gender, age, education, and number of tillable acres farmed. Respondents were also asked if they had previously planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops and if they planned to plant either <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> corn or <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> soybeans in 2003. Finally, respondents were presented with 40 statements that pertained to biotechnology and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops, and they were asked to record their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement using a 5 -point Likert scale. Factor analysis was used to construct four factors from responses to the 40 statements that pertained to biotechnology and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Items that loaded into the first factor indicated that McLean county farmers perceived agricultural biotechnology to be acceptable and beneficial, and their perspectives of biotechnology were much broader than the economic impacts on their own farms. The second factor revealed that McLean County farmers' cropping decisions had been affected to some degree by events such as the StarLink corn case that had cast a negative shadow over biotechnology. The third factor reflected direct benefits of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops to farm operations, specifically higher yields and profits. The fourth factor included increased regulation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in international markets and lower prices for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops, which were potentially negative factors in the marketing of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to classify respondents according to past and planned experiences with <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. When weighted factor scores from the four factors were used as independent variables, 100 % of farmers who had planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, 98. 4 % of farmers who planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and 100 % of farmers who had not discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops were correctly classified. On the other hand, only 62. 5 % of farmers who had not planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, 60. 0 % of farmers who planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and 60. 0 % of farmers who had discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops were correctly classified. When the highest loading items from each of the four factors were used as independent variables, classification of farmers who had planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, farmers who planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and farmers who had not discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops were little changed. However, correct classification of farmers who had not planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past dropped from 62. 5 % to 50 %, correct classification of farmers who had planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003 dropped from 60. 0 % to 20. 0 %, and correct classification of farmers who had discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops dropped from 60 % to 0 %. Additional information about farmers' age, education, and farm size increased the explanatory power of models only modestly. Inspection of regression coefficients revealed that increases in Factor 1 scores, which were dominated by positive aspects of biotechnology from a macro perspective, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and having continued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Alternatively, increases in Factor 2 scores, which were dominated by negative perceptions of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> seeds and crops, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and having discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Factor 3 scores, which were dominated by micro benefits to farmers, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and having continued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Results for two individual items that were significant, namely "as a consumer, I am satisfied with the benefits of biotechnology," and "restrictions on saving GM seed affect my GM crop planting decisions," were consistent with results for weighted factor scores. Greater agreement with the former statement was associated with increases in odds ratios for having planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, and having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003. Greater agreement with the latter statement was associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003 and having discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. biotechnology, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified,</b> corn, soybeans, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Q 16,...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Over {{the recent}} years, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food in {{varieties}} of corn, soybeans, canola and cotton {{have been introduced}} to the global market. This study reviews the health and nutritional value of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods {{in the past two}} decades. Results and Conclusions: Contrary to the present biotechnological claims, transgenic products did not prove to be so flawless, and actually failed to maintain social satisfaction. <b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods could not gain an increase in the yield potential. Planting natural products and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products in parallel lines will absolutely result in genetic infection from the side of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods. One of the major anxieties of the anti- <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods activism is the claim that <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops would alter the consumable parts of the plant quality and safety. <b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods have shown to have inadequate efficiency and potential adverse effects in both fields of health and biodiversity. This review has presented studies of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods performances in the past two decades, and concludes that the wide application and the over generalization of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods are not fundamentally recommended.

However, their safety, potential risks and ethical concerns are still being debated. Laws to regulate labeling of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> agri-foods vary. The publics perception of the risk of new technology is critical to its acceptance.

With the growing of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products (GMP) levels, it becomes important to examine the situation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products. According to various studies on Lithuanian public opinion on genetic modification, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms and their products, we can provide {{for the future of}} GMOs in the Lithuanian market. Although there are different opinions about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products not only in Lithuania, but also throughout the world, the level of development in this area increases every year. This {{is one of the reasons}} for which it is necessary to know and explore the Lithuanian population, as the buyer of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> products, and to examine the Lithuanian market of these products.

In some cases teacher is the only source of information about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. That is what I decided to investigate in my diploma thesis: how knowledge and interest influence the position that students take towards the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms.

40|$|The <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food {{industry}} {{may contribute to}} environmental protection and sustainable development. Nevertheless, many consumers are skeptical about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods and fear that their diffusion may have {{detrimental effects on the}} environment and public health. Given this situation, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food producers may benefit from understanding how to address such concerns through appropriate corporate social responsibility initiatives. However, there is scarce research investigating this issue. This paper contributes to this research stream by studying how consumers' perceptions about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food producers' corporate social responsibility initiatives impact said consumers' attitudes toward and intentions to buy such products. This research builds on the well established model of corporate social responsibility proposed by Carroll (1979) and investigates this issue through a survey study of 260 Italian consumers. The results show that perceptions about producers' philanthropic and legal responsibilities favorably impact Italian consumers' attitudes toward <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> foods and their intentions to buy such products, respectively.
