40|$|Background: Decision making by <b>proxy</b> {{regarding}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{treatment for}} family members is often accompanied by uncertainty and distress, especially considering the tube feeding treatment in cases of advanced dementia. Objective: To develop a deep understanding {{about what is going}} on during surrogate decision making. Methods: The analysis of weighty decision making by proxy for residents with dementia was conducted using the grounded theory approach, retrospective design as well as nursing process documents and overall 31 interviews with authorized family members, physicians and nursing staff. Results: According to the findings, there is commonly a lack in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>proxies</b> area of competence and a lack of knowledge about the tube feeding treatment. Family members do not know how to determine the individual preferences of their relative. Normally, there is no informed consent. Proxies perceive the process as deciding over the life and death of their loved one. In addition, family members are greatly affected by the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> staff`s influence, especially when they are under serious time pressure. Conclusion: Family members require competences in decision making, otherwise the notion of the patient in question starving to death strengthens the moral aspect and further raises the taboo regarding death, in this case regarding perceived neglect...|$|R

40|$|This study {{sought to}} address the {{significant}} paucity in the medical decision making literature regarding the knowledge and attitudes of emerging adults toward advance care planning. Using a mostly qualitative approach, we attempted to document several dimensions of preferences and perspectives within a population well known for risk-taking behaviors, which may result in death, serious injury, and states of decisional incapacitation. Fifty-six undergraduates from two Pittsburgh universities took part in six focus group interviews between February-April 2007. Using a semi-structured focus group guide, participants were led through discussions on hypothetical end-of-life care scenarios, eliciting their views on Living Wills, <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Proxies,</b> preferences for surrogates and their behaviors, and for life-sustaining treatment. Content analysis revealed inter-subject variability and intra-subject inconsistency among participants within all domains analyzed. Fifty-six percent of our sample had correct knowledge of advance directives, while only 10 % understood that they offer proxy designation. Themes related to age-mediated invincibility, decreased risk perception, and an inexperience with morbidity and mortality relative to their elders emerged from the data. The findings of our study underscore {{the need for a}} through, quantitative effort to examine this volatile population's familiarity and attitudes regarding decisional incapacitation and the legal provisions in place to ensure autonomous and/or shared decision making.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{majority}} of scales to measure family member distress in dementia {{are designed for}} community settings and do not capture the unique burdens of the nursing home (NH) environment. We report {{the psychometric properties of}} a new Family Distress in Advanced Dementia Scale for use in the NH setting. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional questionnaire of 130 family member <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>proxies</b> of NH residents with advanced dementia in 31 Boston-area NHs. METHODS: Thirty-one initial items were evaluated, measuring the frequency over the past 3 months of sources of distress. Exploratory factor analysis identified domains of distress; Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha was computed for each domain. Associations between the domains and other measures were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients, including measures of depression (PHQ- 9), satisfaction with care (Satisfaction with Care at the End-of-Life in Dementia [SWC-EOLD]), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview short version). RESULTS: Factor analysis suggested 3 domains: emotional distress (9 items), dementia preparedness (5 items), and NH relations (7 items). Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha coefficients were 0. 82, 0. 75, and 0. 83 respectively. The PHQ- 9 correlated most strongly with the emotional distress factor (r = 0. 34), the SWC-EOWD correlated most strongly with the NH relations factor (r = 0. 35), as did the Zarit Burden Scale (r = 0. 50). CONCLUSIONS: The Family Distress in Advanced Dementia Scale encompasses 3 domains of distress. This scale represents a much needed tool to assess distress among family members of NH residents with advanced dementia and provides a metric to evaluate interventions in the population...|$|R

5000|$|Related to {{the health}} care power of {{attorney}} is a separate document known as an advance health care directive, also called a [...] "living will". A living will is a written statement of a person's health care and medical wishes but does not appoint another person to make health care decisions. Depending upon the jurisdiction, a health care power of attorney may or may not appear with an advance health care directive in a single, physical document. For example, the California legislature has adopted a standard power of attorney for health care and advance health care directive form that meets all of that state's legal wording requirements for a power of attorney and advance health care directive in a single document.

50|$|When {{drafting}} a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>proxy,</b> {{it is best}} to consult a physician and attorney. The forms are available through lawyers, hospitals, and websites dedicated to health care ethics. The proxy must identify the client and the client's agent, also including all contact information. The advance directive must state that the designated agent has authority to make health care decisions on the patient’s behalf and what limitations, if any, are imposed on the agent’s authority. The document should clearly state that the agent's authority begins only when the patent is unable to make health care decisions. When the document is finished, it must be signed and have been witnessed by two individuals who are not the agents, caregivers, or relatives to the patient. The completed document should be signed by the witnesses and the client of the advance directive. The document should be given to the patent’s physician, lawyer, spouse/partner, and family. The advance directive should be reviewed regularly and reflect changes in the client's current marital situation (e.g. marriage or divorce). For the agent to view the medical records of the client, the client should sign a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) release form.|$|E

Several studies reported discrepancy between patient and proxy ratings, though the literature is sparse on changes over time of these ratings. Our goals in this 12 -month study were to compare patient and proxy reports on functioning, cognition, and everyday executive function, and to further elucidate correlates of patient–proxy discrepancy. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of individuals older than 70 years who ranged from having no cognitive impairment to having moderate dementia who had a proxy available to complete instruments at baseline (N= 76). Measurements included Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study–Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADLI), Neuro-QOL Executive Function, PROMIS Applied Cognition (PROMIS-Cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale. Results: Patient- and proxy-rated ADCS-ADLI were correlated at baseline and at 1 -year follow-up. Patient and proxy ratings were discrepant on Neuro-QOL Executive Function and PROMIS-Cog. Greater patient–proxy discrepancy on PROMIS-Cog was associated with younger age and less depression, and greater patient–proxy discrepancy on Neuro-QOL Executive Function was associated with less depression and worse cognitive impairment. Patient–proxy discrepancy increased over time for everyday executive function. Changes in proxy-rated but not patient-rated ADCS-ADLI correlated with MMSE changes. Conclusion: Patients and proxies generally agree in reporting on activities of daily living. Patient and proxy reports differ in their respective evaluation of cognitive functioning and everyday executive function. Ratings from both sources may be preferred for these two domains, though studies using gold standard measures are necessary. It is important that clinicians are aware of the differences between patient and proxy perspective to create an accurate clinical picture and guide treatment.

Using the utilization of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services {{as a proxy for}} symptoms, the present study seeks to determine when early symptoms of childhood cancer are seen in general practice. Methods: A population-based matched comparative study was conducted using nationwide registry data. As cases, all children in Denmark below 16 years of age (N = 1, 278) diagnosed with cancer (Jan 2002 -Dec 2008) were included.
