40|$|CD 79, a key {{component}} of the B cell antigen receptor complex, is composed of CD 79 alpha(Ig alpha) and CD 79 beta(Ig beta) encoded by mb- 1 and B 29 respectively, and {{plays an important role in}} B cell signaling. In this study, we isolated and characterized mb- 1 and B 29 from <b>humphead</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus sanguineus). Their tissue distribution and expression profiles after stimulations in vitro and in vivo were also investigated. The <b>humphead</b> <b>snapper</b> mb- 1 and B 29 contain open reading frames of 684 bp and 606 bp, encoding 227 amino acids and 201 amino acids, respectively. Both CD 79 alpha and CD 79 beta possess signal peptide, extracellular Ig domain, transmembrane region and immunoreceptor tyrosine kinase activation motif (ITAM). Mb- 1 is highly expressed in lymphoid organs (thymus, posterior kidney and spleen) and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (gill and intestine), while B 29 is mainly detected in posterior kidney, spleen, gill and skin. Furthermore, transcription of mb- 1 and B 29 in head kidney leucocytes was up-regulated following lipopolysaccharide (LPS), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) stimulation, respectively, and their expression level in anterior kidney and spleen was also increased after challenged with formalin-inactived Vibrio harveyi. These results indicated that <b>humphead</b> <b>snapper</b> CD 79 molecule might play an important role in immune response to pathogen infection...|$|E
