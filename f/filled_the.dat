Shortly after the Music City Bowl matchup was announced, rumors spread that quarterbacks coach Charlie Stubbs or tight ends coach Ronnie Cottrell were {{being considered for}} other jobs. One departure rumor became reality when defensive line coach Jackie Shipp resigned to take the same position at the University of Oklahoma. Shipp's departure left the Crimson Tide without a defensive line coach, and Alabama head coach Mike DuBose <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> vacancy for the Music City Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Muhanna was {{succeeded by}} his son Musa, and his {{descendants}} <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> office of amir al-ʿarab {{for the next seven}} decades with minor interruption. Throughout his reign, Muhanna was granted numerous iqtaʿat (fiefs) by an-Nasir, including Palmyra, Salamiyah, Sarmin and Douma. Muhanna later criticized an-Nasir's generous iqtaʿ distribution to the Bedouin tribes, believing it would ultimately degrade the character of the Bedouin and in turn, weaken the Muslim armies.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus behaved as a {{sovereign}} monarch; outside his kingdom, {{he had an}} overall administrative and military authority over the provincial governors of the Roman eastern provinces.
