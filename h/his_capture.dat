5|$|Madison {{was freed}} from prison {{a year after}} <b>his</b> <b>capture,</b> {{as part of a}} {{prisoner}} exchange. He returned to Kentucky following his release and was honored at a public dinner on September 6, 1814. In 1816, he resigned as auditor of public accounts due to failing health. But, submitting to public demand, he became a candidate for governor later that year. James Johnson, the other candidate for office, withdrew from the race due to Madison's popularity, thus the latter was elected without opposition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mengele {{sightings}} {{were reported}} {{all over the}} world. Wiesenthal claimed to have information that placed Mengele on the Greek island of Kythnos in 1960, Cairo in 1961, in Spain in 1971, and in Paraguay in 1978, eighteen years after he had left. He insisted as late as 1985—six years after Mengele's death—that he was still alive, in 1982 offering a reward of $100,000 for <b>his</b> <b>capture.</b> Worldwide interest in the case was raised by a mock trial held in Jerusalem in February 1985 featuring the testimony of over a hundred victims of Mengele's experiments. Shortly afterwards, the governments of West Germany, Israel, and the United States launched a coordinated effort to determine Mengele's whereabouts. Rewards for <b>his</b> <b>capture</b> were offered by the Israeli and West German governments, The Washington Times, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.|$|E

5|$|After this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was forced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia.

Events after <b>his</b> <b>capture</b> are unclear, but Đurišić, Vasić, Ostojić, and Baćović were subsequently killed along with othersincluding some Serbian Orthodox priests. According to Pajović, the Ustaše executed Đurišić in late April 1945 at the Jasenovac concentration camp.

5|$|Born {{in rural}} Connecticut, Allen had a {{frontier}} upbringing but also received an education that included some philosophical teachings. In the late 1760s he {{became interested in}} the New Hampshire Grants, buying land there and becoming embroiled in the legal disputes surrounding the territory. Legal setbacks {{led to the formation of}} the Green Mountain Boys, whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from the Grants. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Allen and the Boys seized the initiative and captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. In September 1775 Allen led a failed attempt on Montreal that resulted in <b>his</b> <b>capture</b> by British authorities. First imprisoned aboard Royal Navy ships, he was paroled in New York City, and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778.|$|E

Many Shepton men joined the cause, but Monmouth failed to take Bath or Bristol and had to return to Shepton on 30 June. Following the Battle of Sedgemoor, the Duke fled and spent the night of 6 July at Downside, a mile north of Shepton, before continuing his flight for two more days before <b>his</b> <b>capture.</b> Following the Bloody Assizes, twelve local supporters of Monmouth were hanged and quartered in the Market Place of the town.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses {{that had been set}} up by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his {{identity}} was double-checked and confirmed. During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for <b>his</b> <b>capture</b> had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made the decision not to pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>his</b> <b>capture</b> Noriega was {{transferred}} to a cell in the Miami federal courthouse, where he was arraigned on the ten charges which the Miami grand jury had returned 2 years earlier.

The trial ended in April 1992, when Noriega was convicted on eight of the ten charges of drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering.|$|E
