40|$|The tourism {{industry}} of Viet Nam has developed rapidly {{over the last}} two decades. However, more attention must be given to <b>destination</b> <b>marketing,</b> especially joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing,</b> if the sector is to continue to expand. To date there has been little research on joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing,</b> especially in developing countries and transitional economies like Viet Nam. This study attempts to fulfil this gap by examining the joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> activities of the eight South Central Coast provinces of Viet Nam. The study has three objectives: (1) to examine {{the nature and extent of}} current joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> activities, (2) to analyze the factors that influence joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> decision-making, and (3) to investigate the <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> relationships between local <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> organizations(DMOs) of the eight provinces. The South Central Coast was chosen as the study site as it is the most dynamic tourism development region of Viet Nam. The study triangulated both primary and secondary data. The primary data was collected mainly from semi-structured in-depth interviews with DMO representatives. This was complemented by the content analysis of official tourism websites. Four sets of key findings result from this research. First, the South Central Coast provinces currently conduct <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> more individually than jointly. However, all provinces of the region practise a certain mix of both individual and joint marketing activities. Local DMOs also develop competitive and cooperative relationships with other counterpart DMOs. Second, joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> is an emerging and increasingly common trend in the region and is characterized by different patterns of cooperative behaviour and levels of involvement. Third, joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> decision-making is influenced by various factors, including preconditions, benefits, drawbacks, motives and barriers. These factors are inter-related, which in turn creates tensions for DMO in their joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> decision-making. Fourth, in the South Central Coast region, joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> activities occur more commonly at a sub-regional scale than at the scale of the whole region. Furthermore, these sub-region cooperative models involve provinces located in other regions. Decisive factors in <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> partnership formation include proximity, convenient transportation, mutual benefits, similar target markets and compatibility of tourism products. The study concludes by highlighting the need to establish a regional tourism coordinating organization to facilitate joint actions and cooperative interrelationships between provinces. There is also much room left in for further joint <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> research...|$|R

40|$|Marketing is {{critical}} to any industry and the central purpose of marketing is to understand customer needs and wants and to create satisfaction. This is also true for destinations. Destinations however, can be much more complex than a single product or organisation {{and more difficult to}} manage. As destinations must be promoted on a holistic level. Demand for <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> is increasing due to rising customer expectations and growing competition. As a result of this destinations must use strong marketing techniques in order to be successful. Purpose – This dissertation aims to explore ‘The effects of <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> on the cruise industry in the peripheral region of Orkney’. This study explores <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> focusing particularly on peripheral regions. There is absence of literature on this subject area which has provided room for further research and academic input. The study also looks at the cruise industry and the main marketing incentives that attract the cruise industry to a destination. This research was conducted from the perspective stakeholders in Orkney who work towards <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> and attracting the cruise industry. Methodology – The research adopted a qualitative approach with the use of in-depth interviews. A total of eight interviews were undertaken with stakeholders in Orkney who work towards promoting the region as a destination. The participants all came from different faculties in Orkney and all worked towards the promotion of Orkney and <b>destination</b> <b>marketing.</b> Eight interviews were an appropriate sample size due to the small population of Orkney. Findings – The results proved that the popularity of Orkney as a cruise destination is down to the strong <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> platforms and strategies used. <b>Destination</b> <b>marketing</b> is very important in Orkney and has had a huge impact when attracting cruise liners to the region. The findings revealed that the success of Orkney as a cruise destination and the success of <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> strategies is down to the teamwork of the stakeholders. Orkneys stakeholders work together to create a quality destination with an excellent on shore experience. Current literature states that <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> in peripheral areas is extremely challenging. However, Orkney has worked as a team and overcame these challenges. The region has created a marketing platform that is ‘envied throughout Scotland’. Implications – The research has provided both practical and theoretical implications as well as recommendations for future research in peripheral <b>destination</b> <b>marketing.</b> The results could be used for other peripheral or cruise destinations to help improve current marketing platforms and strategies. This study can aid future researchers, academics and <b>destination</b> <b>marketing</b> organisations (DMOs).

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} {{on the role of}} spillovers through vertical linkages in service firms' internationalisation process. We combine input-output coefficients with region-level information on downstream manufacturing sector exports to build a measure of spillovers through backward linkages, which we assess as a systematic determinant of Italian BS firms' export status. Once considered firm and sector specificities, export spillovers especially matter for exporting to high-income economies outside Europe. This finding originates from higher sunk costs stemming from greater distance to the <b>destination</b> <b>market</b> and tougher competition within the <b>destination</b> <b>market.</b> Furthermore, the spillovers' geographical scope is mainly local. We thus contribute to international business theory by generalising existing evidence from case studies on the importance of buyer-supplier relationships for service firms' internationalisation across several BS sectors.
