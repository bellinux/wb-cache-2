The higher cost of providing services to NESB clients was influenced by four factors: increased consultation time, group attendance to an appointment, increased <b>interpreting</b> <b>costs</b> and the type of service provider.

40|$|Colonial {{breeding}} {{in birds}} {{is widely considered}} to benefit individuals through enhanced protection against predators or transfer of information about foraging sites. This view, however, is largely based on studies of seabirds carried out under favourable conditions. Recent breeding failures at many seabird colonies in the UK {{provide an opportunity to}} re-examine costs and benefits of coloniality under adverse conditions. Common guillemots Uria aalge are highly colonial cliff-nesting seabirds with very flexible parental care. Although the single chick is normally never left alone, more than 50 per cent of offspring were left unattended at a North Sea colony in 2007, apparently because poor conditions forced both parents to forage simultaneously. Contrary to expectation, unattended chicks were not killed by avian predators. Rather, although non-breeders and failed breeders sometimes provided alloparental care, unattended chicks were frequently attacked by breeding guillemots at neighbouring sites, often with fatal consequences. These results highlight a previously unsuspected trade-off between provisioning chicks and avoiding conspecific attacks, and indicate that understanding how environmental conditions affect social dynamics is crucial to <b>interpreting</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits of colonial breeding...|$|E

Eva Alexander Chair: Civil Law Date (final draft) : 30 June 2014 Key words: costs of legal proceedings, reimbursement of legal fees, small claims The thesis analyzes the Czech legal rules {{relating to the}} costs of civil judicial proceedings, in particular the attorneys' fees. In the first part, the costs of civil judicial proceedings are described in general, including out-of-pocket expenses of parties and their representatives and counsel, court fees, lost wages, evidence and <b>interpreting</b> <b>costs</b> and notarial fees. The first part further focuses on payment and reimbursement of costs. Under Czech law, the losing party must reimburse the successful party at the rate determined by the statutory rules. The second part deals with the reimbursement attorney's fees, which, until April 2013, took place according to flat rates set forth in a decree. However, the Constitutional Court cancelled that decree due to its effects in small claims cases. As a result, the general statutory schedule for attorney's fees is currently used also for determination of reimbursement of counterparty's fees in civil disputes.

40|$|One of {{the common}} criticisms of poverty {{alleviation}} programs is that the high share of administrative (nontransfer) costs substantially reduces the programs' impact on poverty. But very little empirical evidence exists on program costs. For example, a recent extensive international review of targeted poverty alleviation programs in developing countries could find data on costs for only 32 out of the 111 programs reviewed. Even then, the numbers available were not always comparable. In this paper, we present {{a detailed analysis of}} the cost structure of a program recently introduced in Mexico, called PROGRESA. Our analysis shows how cost data can be used as the basis for an evaluation of the cost efficiency of anti-poverty programs. It cautions, however, that one must be very careful when <b>interpreting</b> <b>cost</b> numbers or undertaking comparisons across programs in order to avoid misleading conclusions. Any credible analysis of a program's cost efficiency must involve a detailed analysis of cost structure and not simply provide aggregate cost information. We also highlight the importance of not neglecting private costs incurred by households in taking up transfers.

40|$|In this study, both Bayesian {{classifiers}} {{and mutual}} information classifiers are examined for binary classifications {{with or without}} a reject option. The general decision rules in terms of distinctions on error types and reject types are derived for Bayesian classifiers. A formal analysis is conducted to reveal the parameter redundancy of cost terms when abstaining classifications are enforced. The redundancy implies an intrinsic problem of "non-consistency" for <b>interpreting</b> <b>cost</b> terms. If no data is given to the cost terms, we demonstrate the weakness of Bayesian classifiers in class-imbalanced classifications. On the contrary, mutual-information classifiers are able to provide an objective solution from the given data, which shows a reasonable balance among error types and reject types. Numerical examples of using two types of classifiers are given for confirming the theoretical differences, including the extremely-class-imbalanced cases. Finally, we briefly summarize the Bayesian classifiers and mutual-information classifiers in terms of their application advantages, respectively.

40|$|The {{selection}} of a suitable location for infectious waste disposal {{is one of the}} major problems in waste management. Determining the location of infectious waste disposal centers is a difficult and complex process because it requires combining social and environmental factors that are hard to <b>interpret,</b> and <b>cost</b> factors that require the allocation of resources. Additionally, it depends on several regulations. Based on the actual conditions of a case study, forty hospitals and three candidate municipalities in the sub-Northeast region of Thailand, we considered multiple factors such as infrastructure, geological and social & environmental factors, calculating global priority weights using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). After that, a new multi-objective facility location problem model which combines FAHP and goal programming (GP), namely the FAHP-GP model, was tested. The proposed model can lead to selecting new suitable locations for infectious waste disposal by considering both total cost and final priority weight objectives. The novelty of the proposed model is the simultaneous combination of relevant factors that are difficult to <b>interpret</b> and <b>cost</b> factors, which require the allocation of resources.

Life cycle impacts are not stationary and will change over the years based on both past and prospective technologies, evolving forest management procedures and population demands.

MRSA typing is {{an essential component of}} an effective surveillance system to describe epidemiological trends and infection control strategies. Current challenges for MRSA typing are focused on selecting the most appropriate technique in terms of efficiency, reliability, ease of performance and cost involved. This review summarises the available information on application, potential and problems of various typing techniques in discriminating the strains and understanding the epidemiology of MRSA strains. The phenotypic methods in general are easier to perform, easier to <b>interpret,</b> <b>cost</b> effective and are widely available, however less discriminatory. The genotypic methods are expensive and technically demanding, however more discriminatory. Newer technologies involving sequencing of various genes are coming up as broadly applicable and high throughput typing systems. Still there is no consensus regarding the single best method for typing of MRSA strains. Phage typing is recommended as first line approach in epidemiological investigation of MRSA strains. PFGE remains the gold standard for characterisation of outbreak strains. DNA sequencing methods including MLST, spa typing, SCCmec typing and toxin gene profile typing are more practical methods for detecting evolutionary changes and transmission events. The choice of typing technique further depends on the purpose of the study, the facilities available and the utility of data generated to answer a desirable research question. A need for harmonisation of typing techniques by following standard protocols is emphasised to establish surveillance networks and facilitate global MRSA control...|$|R

The bits-back coding allows <b>interpreting</b> the <b>cost</b> function used in the variational Bayesian method called ensemble learning as a code length {{in addition to the}} Bayesian view of misfit of the posterior approximation and a lower bound of model evidence. Combining these two viewpoints provides interesting insights to the learning process and the functions of different parts of the model.

The code-length interpretation provides new views to many parts of the problem such as model comparison and pruning and helps explain many phenomena occurring in learning.

In parallel, additional information is specified in a natural-language document called a building specification. 1 As not all details are present in the model these specifications have to be <b>interpreted</b> whenever <b>costs</b> are estimated or other analyses are performed. In this paper, we argue that building specifications contain cross-cutting concerns. We also argue that domain experts should be given the ability to formulate building specifications using a domain-specific aspect language so that the corresponding details can automatically be integrated into the model. The language needs to support a multitude of domain-specific abstractions that are absent in the building meta-model. Therefore we propose to allow the domain experts to extend the language iteratively by defining interpretation patterns [1]. Such a model enriching specification will improve tasks requiring detailed information and will allow for earlier or even concurrent development of the building specification along with the model.
