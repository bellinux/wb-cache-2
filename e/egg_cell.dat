5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis.

5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation.

The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E

To determine how [Ca 2 +]cyt oscillation in mature <b>egg</b> <b>cells</b> is generated, <b>egg</b> <b>cells</b> were incubated in thapsigargin, which proved to be a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2 +-ATPase in wheat <b>egg</b> <b>cells.</b> In unfertilized <b>egg</b> <b>cells,</b> the addition of thapsigargin caused an abrupt transient increase in [Ca 2 +]cyt in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, suggesting that an influx pathway for Ca 2 + is activated by thapsigargin. The [Ca 2 +]cyt oscillation seemed to require the filling of an intracellular calcium store for the onset of which, calcium influx through the plasma membrane appeared essential. This was demonstrated by omitting extracellular calcium from (or adding GdCl 3 to) the fusion medium, which prevented [Ca 2 +]cyt oscillation in mature <b>egg</b> <b>cells</b> fused with the sperm. Combined, these data permit the hypothesis that the first sperm-induced transient increase in [Ca 2 +]cyt depletes an intracellular Ca 2 + store, triggering an increase in plasma membrane Ca 2 + permeability, and this enhanced Ca 2 + influx results in [Ca 2 +]cyt oscillation...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle of}} the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephantâ€“mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of preserved soft tissue remains and DNA of woolly mammoths {{has led to}} the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this. Cloning would involve removal of the DNA-containing nucleus of the <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and implanted on a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth, although its fetal environment would be different. Most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo.|$|E
5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E

25|$|Parthenogenesis is {{distinct}} from artificial animal cloning, a process where the new organism is necessarily genetically identical to the cell donor. In cloning, the nucleus of a diploid cell from a donor organism is inserted into an enucleated <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> and the cell is then stimulated to undergo continued mitosis, resulting in an organism that is genetically identical to the donor.

It is concluded that the extension of the 3 rd cleavage cycle is to be attributed to a prolongation of the S phase, which is not caused by an inhibition by caffeÃ¯ne of the initiation of the DNA synthesis. The results point to an effect of caffeÃ¯ne on the post-replication mode of repair; lesions in the DNA are not rendered innocuous in the presence of caffeÃ¯ne. At the beginning of the next cleavage cycle these lesions still have an inhibiting effect on the progression of DNA synthesis. Morphogenesis was reduced by increasing UV doses; with caffeÃ¯ne less than 7...|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} somatic cell nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor <b>egg</b> <b>cell</b> is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an unnucleated <b>egg</b> <b>cell.</b> These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host <b>egg</b> <b>cell.</b> The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning {{or in the case of}} reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|E
