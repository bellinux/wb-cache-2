5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the <b>edge</b> <b>set</b> of H.|$|E
5|$|Important {{polynomial}} time computational problems on DAGs include topological sorting (finding a topological ordering), {{construction of the}} transitive closure and transitive reduction (the largest and smallest DAGs with the same reachability relation, respectively), and the closure problem, in which {{the goal is to}} find a minimum-weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them {{to the rest of the}} graph. Transforming a directed graph with cycles into a DAG by deleting as few vertices or edges as possible (the feedback vertex set and feedback <b>edge</b> <b>set</b> problem, respectively) is NP-hard, but any directed graph can be made into a DAG (its condensation) by contracting each strongly connected component into a single supervertex. The problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on DAGs in linear time, in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are NP-hard.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} was between Edge and John Cena for the WWE Championship. In this match, the {{stipulation}} {{was that if}} Edge got disqualified, he would lose the title to Cena. During the match, Cena used several blows and slams on Edge. He also performed a belly-to-belly suplex on Edge and {{kept an eye on}} Edge's valet, the WWE Women's Champion Lita. Edge took advantage and connected with chokeholds and a flying clothesline, but Cena was able to recover. Lita tried to interfere, but Edge warned her not to get him disqualified. Lita threw a steel chair into the ring, but Edge threw it back outside the ring, and Cena took advantage. Cena then applied the STFU on Edge. Lita tried to interfere again, but Edge warned her once again. Edge made it to the ropes, and while the referee told Cena to break the hold, Lita handed Edge a pair of brass knuckles. As Cena broke the hold, Cena put Edge on his shoulders again for the FU, but this time Lita jumped on Edge's back when Cena had <b>Edge</b> <b>set</b> up for the FU, and Lita was the recipient of the FU instead of Edge.

25|$|The variable-opt {{method is}} related to, and a {{generalization}} of the k-opt method. Whereas the k-opt methods remove a fixed number (k) of edges {{from the original}} tour, the variable-opt methods do not fix {{the size of the}} <b>edge</b> <b>set</b> to remove. Instead they grow the set as the search process continues. The best known method in this family is the Lin–Kernighan method (mentioned above as a misnomer for 2-opt). Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan first published their method in 1972, and it was the most reliable heuristic for solving travelling salesman problems for nearly two decades. More advanced variable-opt methods were developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s by David Johnson and his research team. These methods (sometimes called Lin–Kernighan–Johnson) build on the Lin–Kernighan method, adding ideas from tabu search and evolutionary computing. The basic Lin–Kernighan technique gives results that are guaranteed to be at least 3-opt. The Lin–Kernighan–Johnson methods compute a Lin–Kernighan tour, and then perturb the tour by what {{has been described as a}} mutation that removes at least four edges and reconnecting the tour in a different way, then V-opting the new tour. The mutation is often enough to move the tour from the local minimum identified by Lin–Kernighan. V-opt methods are widely considered the most powerful heuristics for the problem, and are able to address special cases, such as the Hamilton Cycle Problem and other non-metric TSPs that other heuristics fail on. For many years Lin–Kernighan–Johnson had identified optimal solutions for all TSPs where an optimal solution was known and had identified the best known solutions for all other TSPs on which the method had been tried.|$|E
