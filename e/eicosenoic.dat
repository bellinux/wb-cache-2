The study sample comprised 80 neuroleptic-naïve UHR individuals aged 13 - 25 years. Associations among erythrocyte membrane fatty acid levels, measured by gas chromatography, and cognitive functioning were investigated in UHR patients. Subjects were divided into terciles based on their scores on the cognitive factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The Zahlen-Verbindungs Test (ZVT) (the number-combination test) was also used {{as a measure of}} information-processing speed. Exploratory analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between membrane fatty acid levels with the size of the intracranial area (ICA), a neurodevelopmental measure relevant to schizophrenia, in half of subjects (n= 40) using magnetic resonance imaging. The adjusted analysis revealed that omega- 9 <b>eicosenoic</b> and erucic acid levels were significantly higher, but omega- 3 docosahexaenoic acid levels were significantly lower, in the cognitively impaired than in the cognitively intact group.

Cigarette smoking accelerates the age-related forced expiratory volume in 1  s (FEV 1) decline, an {{important}} determinant for the genesis of COPD. Hispanic smokers have lower COPD prevalence and FEV 1 decline than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Patients and methods: A nutritional epidemiological study was conducted in the Lovelace Smokers cohort (LSC; n= 1, 829) and the Veterans Smokers cohort (n= 508) to identify dietary nutrients (n= 139) associated with average FEV 1 and its decline and to assess whether nutrient intakes could explain ethnic disparity in FEV 1 decline between Hispanics and NHW smokers. Results: Nutrients discovered and replicated to be significantly associated with better average FEV 1 included magnesium, folate, niacin, vitamins A and D, <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty acid (20 : 1 n 9), eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n 3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22 : 5 n 3), docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n 3), and fiber. In addition, greater intakes of <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty acid and DPA were associated with slower FEV 1 decline in the LSC. Among omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, DPA is the most potent nutrient associated with better average FEV 1 and slower FEV 1 decline. Adverse effect of continuous current smoking on FEV 1 decline was completely negated in LSC members with high DPA intake (> 20  mg/day). Slower FEV 1 decline in Hispanics compared to NHWs {{may be due to the}} greater protection of <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty acid and DPA for FEV 1 decline rather than greater intake of protective nutrients in this ethnic group. Conclusion: The protective nutrients for the preservation of FEV 1 in ever smokers could lay foundation for designing individualized nutritional intervention targeting “optimal physiological levels” in human to improve lung function in ever smokers. Ethnic disparity in FEV 1 decline may be explained by difference in magnitude of protection of dietary intakes of <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty acid and DPA between Hispanics and NHWs.

This may affect progress of a breeding program by causing inappropriate breeding methods to be chosen. The objectives of this study were to determine the significance of epistasis in inheritance of protein and oil contents and oil quality parameters, and to estimate additive and dominance variances for the traits not influenced by epistasis. Three testers, Chico (L 1), ICGV 8 6300 (L 2), and their F 1 hybrid (L 3), were each crossed to 15 cultigens. The experiment was conducted in the 1992 - 1993 postrainy and 1993 rainy environments at the ICRISATC Center, Patancheru, India.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of photoperiod on seed quality traits. The experiment was conducted for three seasons in a three replicate split-plot randomized complete block design with three photoperiods (ND = Normal day, 12 h; SD = Short day, 8 h; LD = Long day, 16 h) as main plots and 10 genotypes as subplots. The SD and LD conditions were created artificially. Pooled analysis of variance, based on a mixed linear model with season (S) as random and photoperiod (Ph) and genotype (G) as fixed effects, indicated significant S and G differences for most of the traits studied. Ph differences were significant only for shelling percentage and palmitic and <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty acids. The interactions S x Ph, S x G, Ph x G, and S x Ph x G were significant for several traits. When SD and LD treatments were compared with ND, shelling percentage increased under SD. Oil content, oleic (O) and linolenic (L) fatty acids, and O/L ratio were not affected due to variation in photoperiod. However, palmitic acid increased and <b>eicosenoic</b> acid decreased under SD. The SD conditions were more interactive with seasons and genotypes for fatty acids. High performing and photoperiod insensitive genotypes were identified for various seed quality traits.

The genotypes {{were subjected to}} mid-season and the end-of-season drought in field experiments at ICRISAT Asia Center, Patancheru, India, conducted during the 1991 / 92 and 1992 / 93 post-rainy (November-April) seasons. Mid-season drought was imposed between 40 and 80 days after sowing (DAS). The crop received normal irrigation, 50 mm at 10 day intervals, {{before and after the}} imposition of mid-season drought until harvest. Using the line-source sprinkler technique, end-of-season drought of varying intensity was imposed from 80 DAS until harvest. Mid-season drought had no significant effect on the content of oil, protein and fatty acids other than <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty acid. End-of-season drought significantly reduced total oil, and linoleic and behenic fatty acid content, and significantly increased total protein and stearic and oleic fatty acid content. However, genotype by treatment interactions were found. In ICGVs 88369, 88371, 88381, 88382 and 88403, total oil content remained unaffected while oleic fatty acid content increased under end-of-season drought. These were identified as desirable parents for a breeding program to develop cultivars suitable for rainfed cultivatio...|$|E
40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a severe}} mental {{disorder}} that affects 0. 5 – 1 % {{of the population}} worldwide. Current diagnostic methods are based on psychiatric interviews, which are subjective in nature. The lack of disease biomarkers to support objective laboratory tests has been a long-standing bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis and evaluation of schizophrenia. Here we report a global metabolic profiling study involving 112 schizophrenic patients and 110 healthy subjects, who were divided into a training set and a test set, designed to identify metabolite markers. A panel of serum markers consisting of glycerate, <b>eicosenoic</b> acid, b-hydroxybuty-rate, pyruvate and cystine was identified as an effective diagnostic tool, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0. 945 in the training samples (62 patients and 62 controls) and 0. 895 in the test samples (50 patients and 48 controls). Furthermore, a composite panel {{by the addition of}} urine b-hydroxybutyrate to the serum panel achieved a more satisfactory accuracy, which reached an AUC of 1 in both the training set and the test set. Multiple fatty acids and ketone bodies were found significantly (P< 0. 01) elevate...|$|E
30|$|Sesame oil {{is derived}} from sesame seeds. The main {{constituents}} of sesame seed oil include fatty acids, and lignans. The fatty acids in sesame seed oil included palmitic acid (16 : 0; 7.0 - 12.0 %), palmitoleic acid (16 : 1; less than 0.5 %), stearic acid (18 : 0; 3.5 - 6.0 %), oleic acid (18 : 1; 35 - 50 %), linoleic acid (18 : 2; 35 - 50 %), linolenic acid (18 : 3; less than 1 %), and <b>eicosenoic</b> (20 : 1; less than 1 %). The nonfat portion (1 – 2  wt%) of this oil contains ligans such as sesamin, sesamol, sesamolin, sesaminol, and episesamin. Sesame oil is unique due to its unusually high oxidative stability and anti-inflammatory property as compared to other edible oils (Kamal-Eldin et al. 1994). Sesame oil is rich with anti-oxidant, including sesamin, sesamolin, sesamol, and α-tocopherol. This strong antioxidant activity has been attributed mainly {{to the presence of}} α-tocopherol and antioxidative sesame lignans such as sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol (Chavali et al. 2001). Although sesame oil has been reported to protect many organ injuries models (Hsu et al. 2009; Hsu et al. 2011; Periasamy et al. 2013), it is the first study investigating the effect of sesame oil on gout model.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} sub-chronic soybean oil (SO) treatment on the insulin secretion and fatty acid composition of islets of Langerhans obtained from Goto-Kakizaki (GK), a model of type 2 diabetes, and normal Wistar rats. We observed that soybean-treated Wistar rats present insulin resistance and defective islet insulin secretion when compared with untreated Wistar rats. The decrease in insulin secretion occurred at all concentrations of glucose and arginine tested. Furthermore we observed that soybean-treated normal islets present {{a significant decrease in}} two saturated fatty acids, myristic and heneicosanoic acids, and one monounsaturated <b>eicosenoic</b> acid, and the appearance of the monounsaturated erucic acid. Concerning diabetic animals, we observed that soybean-treated diabetic rats, when compared with untreated GK rats, present an increase in plasma non-fasting free fatty acids, an exacerbation of islet insulin secretion impairment in all conditions tested and a significant decrease in the monounsaturated palmitoleic acid. Altogether our results show that SO treatment results in a decrease of insulin secretion and alterations on fatty acid composition in normal and diabetic islets. Furthermore, the impairment of insulin secretion, islet erucic acid and fasting plasma insulin levels are similar in treated normal and untreated diabetic rats, suggesting that SO could have a deleterious effect on ß-cell function and insulin sensitivity.

40|$|Fatty acids C 20 -C 26 are {{important}} for use in oleo-chemical industry whereas they also allow assessing chemotaxonomic relationships among plant taxa. There are however, comparatively few common vegetable fats which contain them in appreciable amounts. Using gas chromatography this type of very long-chain fatty acids was analyzed in oils from Pentaclethra macrophylla (Fabaceae), Millettia dura (Fabaceae), Tephrosia vogelii (Fabaceae),Cardiospermum halicacabum (Sapindaceae), Maesopsis eminii (Rhamnaceae), Podocarpus usambarensis (Podocarpaceae) and Myrianthus arboreus and M. holstii (Moraceae),wild plant species from Kahuzi-Biega National Park and adjacent areas in D. R. Congo. These plants are used by the local population mainly for nutrition and medical purposes. The percentage of very-long chain fatty acids in the analyzed oils ranged from 1. 2 to 21. 3 %. P. macrophylla revealed the highest rate and M. holstii showed the lowest rate. These acids consist of arachidic, <b>eicosenoic,</b> eicosadienoic, eicosapentaenoic, erucic, behenic and lignoceric acids. Traces of non-methylene interrupted fatty acids were identified (0. 1 – 0. 2 %) {{in three of the}} analyzed species and at a significant level (7. 4 %) in P. usambarensis. Some species had an arachidic acid content similar to that of groundnut oil and could be used as an alternative source of this acid...|$|E
40|$|The lipids from gonads and polyhydroxynaphthoquinone {{pigments}} from body {{walls of}} sea urchins are intensively studied. However, {{little is known}} about the body wall (BW) lipids. Ethanol extract (55 °C) contained about equal amounts of saturated (SaFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) representing 60 % of total fatty acids, with myristic, palmitic and <b>eicosenoic</b> acids as major SaFAs and MUFAs, respectively. Non-methylene-interrupted dienes (13 %) were composed of eicosadienoic and docosadienoic acids. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) included two main components, n 6 arachidonic and n 3 eicosapentaenoic acids, even with equal concentrations (15 μg/mg) and a balanced n 6 /n 3 PUFA ratio (0. 86). The UPLC-ELSD analysis showed that a great majority of the lipids (80 %) in the ethanolic extract were phosphatidylcholine (60 μg/mg) and phosphatidylethanolamine (40 μg/mg), while the proportion of neutral lipids remained lower than 20 %. In addition, alkoxyglycerol derivatives—chimyl, selachyl, and batyl alcohols—were quantified. We have assumed that the mechanism of action of body wall lipids in the present study is via the inhibition of MAPK p 38, COX- 1, and COX- 2. Our findings open the prospective to utilize this lipid fraction as a source for the development of drugs with anti-inflammatory activity...|$|E
40|$|A cDNA {{encoding}} the oleate 12 -hydroxylase from {{castor bean}} (Ricinus communis L.) {{has previously been}} shown to direct the synthesis of small amounts of ricinoleic acid (12 -hydroxyoctadec-cis- 9 -enoic acid) in seeds of transgenic tobacco plants. Expression of the cDNA under control of the Brassica napus napin promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants resulted in the accumulation of up to 17 % of seed fatty acids as ricinoleate and two novel fatty acids that have been identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as lesquerolic (14 -hydroxyeicos-cis- 11 -enoic acid) and densipolic (12 -hydroxyoctadec-cis- 9, 15 -dienoic acid) acids. Traces of auricolic acid were also observed. These results suggest that either the castor hydroxylase can utilize oleic acid and <b>eicosenoic</b> acid as substrates for ricinoleic and lesquerolic acid biosynthesis, respectively, or Arabidopsis contains an elongase that accepts ricinoleic acid as a substrate. These observations are also consistent with indirect biochemical evidence that an n- 3 desaturase is capable of converting ricinoleic acid to densipolic acid. Expression of the castor hydroxylase also caused enhanced accumulation of oleic acid and a corresponding decrease in the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Since the steady-state level of mRNA for the oleate- 12 desaturase was not affected, {{it appears that the}} presence of the hydroxylase, directly or indirectly, causes posttranscriptional inhibition of desaturation...|$|E
40|$|Objective This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify and evaluate the effective single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for fat deposition in the longissimus dorsi muscles of pigs using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) approach. Methods Sixty-four selective primer combinations were used to identify the AFLP markers in the 20 highest- and 20 lowest-intramuscular fat (IMF) content phenotypes. Five AFLP fragments were converted into simple codominant SNP markers. These SNP markers were tested in terms of their association with IMF content and fatty acid (FA) composition traits in 620 commercially crossbred pigs. Results The SSC 7 g. 4937240 C>G marker showed an association with IMF content (p A marker revealed an association with palmitoleic and ω 9 FA levels (p T marker showed a significant association with IMF content and FA levels of palmitoleic, <b>eicosenoic,</b> arachidonic, monounsaturated fatty acids, and ω 9 FA levels. However, no significant association of SSC 8 g. 47338181 G>A was observed with any IMF and FA levels in this study. Conclusion Four SNP markers (SSC 7 g. 4937240 C>G, SSC 9 g. 5496647 _ 5496662 insdel, SSC 10 g. 71225134 G>A, and SSC 17 g. 61976696 G>T) were found to be associated with IMF and/or FA content traits in commercially crossbred pigs. These findings provide evidence of the novel SNP markers as being potentially useful for selecting pigs with the desirable IMF content and FA composition...|$|E
40|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} (NIRS) {{was used}} as a rapid and nondestructive method to determine the fatty acid composition in intact seed samples of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). A total of 349 samples (about 2 g of intact seeds) were scanned in the reflectance mode of a scanning monochro-mator, and the reference values for fatty acid composition were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. Calibration equations for individual fatty acids were developed using the regression method of modified partial least-squares with internal cross validation (n = 249). The equations had low SECV (standard errors of cross-validation), and high R 2 (coefficient of determination in calibration) values (> 0. 8) except for palmitic and <b>eicosenoic</b> acid. Prediction of an external validation set (n = 100) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS esti-mated values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), r 2 (coefficient of determination in prediction), and the ratio of standard deviation (SD) of reference data to SEP. The models developed in this study had relatively higher values (> 3. 0 and 0. 9, respectively) of SD/SEP(C) and r 2 for oleic, linoleic, and erucic acid, characterizing those equations as having good quantitative information. The results indicated that NIRS could be used to rapidly determine the fatty acid composition in rapeseed seeds in the breeding programs for high quality rapeseed oil.

40|$|International audienceACETATE NON-UTILIZING 1 (ACN 1) is a short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, which {{activates}} acetate to acetyl-CoA in peroxisomes of Arabidopsis. Pulse-chase [2 - 13 C]acetate {{feeding of}} the mutant acn 1 - 2 revealed that acetate accumulation and assimilation were no different {{to that of}} wild-type, Col- 7. However, the lack of acn 1 - 2 led to a decrease of nearly 50 % in 13 C-labelling of glutamine, a major carbon sink in seedlings, and large decreases in primary metabolite levels. In contrast, acetyl-CoA levels were higher in acn 1 - 2 compared to Col- 7. The disappearance of <b>eicosenoic</b> acid was slightly delayed in acn 1 - 2 indicating only a small effect on the rate of lipid breakdown. A comparison of transcript levels in acn 1 - 2 and col- 7 showed that induced genes included a number of metabolic genes and also {{a large number of}} signaling-related genes. Genes repressed in the mutant were represented primarily by embryogenesis related genes. Transcript levels of glyoxylate cycle genes also were lower in acn 1 - 2 than in Col- 7. We conclude that deficiency in peroxisomal acetate assimilation comprises only a small proportion of total acetate use, but this affects both primary metabolism and gene expression. We discuss the possibility that ACN 1 safeguards against the loss of carbon as acetate from peroxisomes during lipid mobilization...|$|E
