5|$|Sure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, {{but having}} Max and Igor {{performing}} on {{record for the}} first time in a dozen years <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> we'll ever get, and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you'll ever come across, and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.|$|E

I-90 continues onward into Genesee County, intersecting with NY98 at exit48 north of Batavia and NY77 at exit48A in Pembroke. The latter exit {{provides access to}} Darien Lake, a large amusement park located {{in the town of}} Darien. I-90 and the Thruway continue into Erie County and the Buffalo area.

25|$|After {{losing the}} World Series the Astros {{prepared}} for the offseason by signing Preston Wilson and moving Lance Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure by Jeff Bagwell. The Astros resigned pitcher Roger Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for left-handed hitter Aubrey Huff and cash. In August 2006, Preston Wilson said that he wasn't getting enough playing time since Luke Scott returned from AAA ball with the Round Rock Express. In response the Astros released Wilson and the division rival Cardinals signed him {{for the rest of}} the season. After a dramatic last two weeks of the season, including a four-game sweep of the Cardinals, the Astros did not get to the playoffs losing their last game to the Braves, 3–1. The Astros had managed to win 10 of their last 12 games of the season, and all but erased what had been an 8½ game lead by the front running St. Louis Cardinals. The Astros were within a ½ game of the Cardinals on Thursday September 28, but that <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> the 2005 NL Champions would get.|$|E

A. L. Rowse (2013), for instance, insisted that the statement in Shakespeare's Will shows a conformist position to Protestant religion. Kastan discusses how some might see the phrase [...] "through thonlie merittes of Jesus Christe" [...] as a reference to the doctrine of solus Christus, {{but at the same time}} he argues that the expression [...] "might have become merely conventional by 1616, and have little or any theological import". Thus, he asserts that this can hardly be considered as an ultimate evidence to define Shakespeare's religious affiliation, since the preamble was formulaic in the epoch.|$|E
