50|$|While {{extremely}} {{useful as}} a food packaging agent, the major disadvantage of polyvinylidene chloride {{is that it will}} undergo thermally induced <b>dehydrochlorination</b> at temperatures very near to processing temperatures. This degradation easily propagates, leaving polyene sequences long enough to absorb visible light, and change the color of the material from colorless to an undesirable transparent brown (unacceptable for one of polyvinylidene chloride chief applications: food packaging). Therefore, there is a significant amount of product loss in the manufacturing process, which increases production and consumer costs.|$|E
50|$|Chlorine adds to 1,3-butadiene {{to afford}} a mixture of 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene and 1,4-dichlorobut-2-ene. The 1,4-dichloro isomer is {{subsequently}} isomerized to 3,4 isomer, {{which in turn is}} treated with base to induce <b>dehydrochlorination</b> to 2-chlorobuta-1,3-diene. This dehydrohalogenation entails loss of a hydrogen atom in the 3 position and the chlorine atom in the 4 position thereby forming a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. In 1983, approximately 2,000,000 kg was produced in this manner. The chief impurity in chloroprene prepared in this way is1-chlorobuta-1,3-diene, which is usually separated by distillation.|$|E
50|$|Chloroprene is a monomer for the {{production}} of synthetic rubbers such as Neoprene. It is produced from butadiene in a three-step process. The first step is the liquid- or vapour-phase chlorination of butadiene to a mixture of 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene and 1,4-dichlorobut-2-ene (both isomers). In the second step, the mixture of 1,4-dichlorobut-2-ene and 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene is isomerized to pure 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene by heating to temperatures of 60-120 °C {{in the presence of a}} catalyst. Finally, <b>dehydrochlorination</b> (elimination of hydrogen chloride) of 3,4-dichlorobut-1-ene with dilute sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of polymerization inhibitors gives crude chloroprene.|$|E

50|$|While polyesters {{dominate}} {{both the}} research and industrial focus on synthetic biodegradable polymers, other classes of polymers are also of interest. Polyanhydrides are an active area of research in drug delivery because they only degrade from the surface and so are able to release the drug they carry at a constant rate. Polyanhydrides can be made via {{a variety of methods}} also used in the synthesis of other polymers, including condensation, <b>dehydrochlorination,</b> dehydrative coupling, and ROP. Polyurethanes and poly(ester amide)s are used in biomaterials. Polyurethanes were initially used for their biocompatibility, durability, resilience, but are more recently being investigated for their biodegradability. Polyurethanes are typically synthesized using a diisocyanate, a diol, and a polymer chain extender. The initial reaction is carried out between the diisocyanate and the diol, with the diisocyanate in excess to ensure that the ends of the new polymer chain are isocyanate groups. This polymer can then be reacted with either a diol or a diamine to form urethane or urethane-urea end groups, respectively. The choice of terminal groups affects the properties of the resulting polymer. Additionally, the use of vegetable oil and biomass in the formation of polyurethanes, as well as the conversion of polyurethanes to polyols, is an active area of research.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{method for}} calculating {{degradation}} kinetics is presented. The method {{has been applied}} to the thermal <b>dehydrochlorination</b> of two different samples of PVC. It has been observed that this <b>dehydrochlorination</b> is complex and involves two different processes. A model that accounts for the entire <b>dehydrochlorination</b> is proposed. This model involves nucleation and growth and diffusion controlled mechanisms. The kinetic parameters are obtained from linear heating rate, isothermal and sample controlled thermal analysis experiments. Kinetic results obtained from the macroscopic thermal analysis measurements demonstrate the correlation between the kinetics of the thermal <b>dehydrochlorination</b> of PVC and the structure of this macromolecule. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{novel model}} for calculating <b>dehydrochlorination</b> {{kinetics}} {{at a lower}} temperature of chlorinated natural rubber (CNR) is presented. It has been observed that <b>dehydrochlorination</b> is complex and involves three different stages. A model that accounts for <b>dehydrochlorination</b> at lower temperature is proposed. The kinetic parameters are obtained from <b>dehydrochlorination</b> experiments at 60 - 90 °C. The results of the kinetic calculation show that the apparent activation energy decreases with an increment of chlorine content. Higher chlorine content CNR {{makes it easier to}} remove hydrochloric acid when heated, but its <b>dehydrochlorination</b> rate affected by temperature is significantly less than that of the sample with a lower chlorine content. The thermogravimetric/derivative thermogravimetry results show that the beginning temperature of thermo-oxidative degradation rises with the increment of chlorine content. During the heating process, the higher chlorine content CNR is more stable than the lower one. The results suggest the storage conditions and basis for selection of appropriate temperature for the preparation of CNR from latex...|$|E
40|$|Factors which {{affect the}} {{selectivity}} of the chlorination of 1, 2 -dichloroethane {{and the associated}} <b>dehydrochlorination</b> reactions have been examined using approximate thermodynamic calculations, equilibrium measurements, and a continuous flow micro-reactor. There is a balance between surface and gas-phase chemistry within the system. Heterogeneous catalysis {{is not necessary to}} effect <b>dehydrochlorination</b> of 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane to trichloroethene but an attapulgite-supported copper(II) chloride catalyst favours formation of pentachloroethane and its <b>dehydrochlorination</b> product, tetrachloroethene. The latter is the thermodynamic minimum of the system. Below 473 K and with long reaction times (2 h, batch reactor), radical chlorination to form pentachloroethane is dominant. Above 573 K and under flow conditions, free radical <b>dehydrochlorination</b> to form trichloroethene becomes dominant. Heterogeneous chlorination under flow conditions provides a route to pentachloroethane and thence tetrachloroethene. High conversions favour the formation of oligomeric products...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of polypropylene is accelerated {{when it is}} heated in mixtures with a fire retardant chlorinated paraffin (Cl 70 %) whose <b>dehydrochlorination</b> rate is simultaneously reduced.

The kinetic chain length of the <b>dehydrochlorination</b> is decreased {{and the rate of}} evolution of HCl is lowered, while the radicals formed on the polypropylene chain lead to its scission and volatilisation.
