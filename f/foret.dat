5|$|This {{species is}} {{considered}} critically endangered by the IUCN because it underwent a 90% population decrease over twenty years. In 1977, {{there were an}} estimated 5600 birds in <b>Forêt</b> du Day, which was the only known location for the species at the time. By 1986, this number had dropped to 1500 individuals. The species was discovered at its second site in the Mabla Mountains in 1986. While {{the population in the}} Mabla Mountains has yet to be surveyed, numbers in the <b>Forêt</b> du Day continued to drop, with 5001000 Djibouti francolins recorded in 1998 and only 115135 in 2004. The total world population in 2006 was estimated to be between 612 and 723 adults.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} Miniopterus mahafaliensis extends through southwestern Madagascar in the spiny forest and dry forest, often {{but not always}} near caves; {{it has been found}} on the Mahafaly Plateau, in the <b>Forêt</b> des Mikea, and the Kirindy Mitea National Park. Further inland, it has been found in {{disturbed}} gallery forest in Isalo National Park, in a cave in savanna habitat near Ihosy, and in unspecified habitat at Betroka. Little is known of the ecology of M.mahafaliensis, but species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects, breed seasonally, and roost in large colonies in caves.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} because of habitat destruction. At the <b>Forêt</b> du Day site, 95% of its preferred juniper habitat is dead or dying and {{is unable to}} support this bird. While an overarching reason behind this destruction remains unknown, overgrazing by cattle, camels, and goats {{is believed to have}} been a significant contributor, along with rain, climate change, and a fungal disease. Hunting, the gathering of firewood, egg collecting, and general human disturbance are also believed to be threats. At the Mabla Mountains site, the habitat is also being degraded by the collection of firewood and overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{continued}} in the British and Canadian sectors {{until the end of}} the month. On 25 August, the U.S. 2nd Armored Division fought its way into Elbeuf, making contact with British and Canadian armoured divisions. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division advanced into the <b>Forêt</b> de la Londe on the morning of 27 August. The area was strongly held; the 4th and 6th Canadian brigades suffered many casualties over the course of three days as the Germans fought a delaying action in terrain well suited to defence. The Germans pulled back on 29 August, withdrawing over the Seine the next day. On the afternoon of 30 August, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division crossed the Seine near Elbeuf and entered Rouen to a jubilant welcome.|$|E

5|$|The 44th Infantry Division {{landed in}} France via Omaha Beach on September 15, 1944. It trained {{for a month}} before {{entering}} combat on October 18, 1944, when it relieved the US 79th Infantry Division {{in the vicinity of}} <b>Foret</b> de Parroy, east of Luneville, {{to take part in the}} Seventh United States Army drive to secure several passes in the Vosges Mountains. The division was hit by a heavy counterattack by forces of Nazi Germany on October 25–26. The attack was repulsed and the 44th remained in the sector for several weeks. On November 13, 1944, it attacked northeast, advancing through the Vosges Mountains east of Leintrey to Dossenheim, and capturing Avricourt, on November 17. The division then pushed on to liberate Strasbourg with the French 2nd Armored Division. After regrouping, the 44th Infantry Division returned to the attack, taking Ratzwiller and entering the Ensemble de Bitche along the Maginot Line.|$|E

25|$|On the Bresle, German troops {{did little}} {{while they waited}} for the panzer {{divisions}} to envelop the southern flank of the IX Corps defence line. The 4th Border and 1st/5th Forester continued their attempts to expel the Germans from positions in the Haute <b>forêt</b> d'Eu but only managed to prevent the Germans from taking more ground and there was skirmishing around Beauchamps. At dawn, the German panzer divisions resumed their attack towards Rouen. By this time the 51st (Highland) Division and the reinforcement of A Brigade from the Beauman Division was holding the line of the Bresle from Gamaches to Eu under the command of the divisional headquarters. The 1st Armoured Division had been broken up as soon as it arrived in France and without the detachments to Calais had taken part in the Allied offensive against the German bridgeheads south of the Somme. Since then, a Composite Regiment from the 2nd Armoured Brigade had remained with the 51st (Highland) Division and was covering the Haute <b>forêt</b> d'Eu. The rest of the 2nd and 3rd Armoured brigades had been reduced by losses to improvised units and held part of the Andelle line from Nolleval to Serqueux and the remnants of the Support Group was in the Basse <b>forêt</b> d'Eu under the command of the 51st (Highland) Division. B and C brigades of the Beauman Division were defending the Béthune–Andelle line from the Seine to Dieppe.|$|E
