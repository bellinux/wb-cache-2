25|$|The alley scene {{had to use}} a lot of computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed. The entire alley had to be tracked by the computer in order {{to make sure that the}} digital raindrops hit all the objects in the frame, including dumpsters that were visible. In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V.

[...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what I’ve seen so far.

Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E

Despite this, Handlen criticized the series for not following through on its tale of alien war, noting that the premise [...] "never really --at least [...] I've never heard anyone refer to [...] as 'the seasons when The X-Files mythology finally paid off.'" [...] Handlen, however noted that [...] "The Red and the Black" [...] worked because [...] "the performances are great as always, and because {{the second part of}} this two parter rarely feels bogged down or draggy." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five.

Jackman said of his work on the film, [...] "it’s 50% production and all the tricks I’ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it’s also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece". He described the film as aesthetically [...] "way closer to something like Dark Knight Rises than it is to say the Richard Donner's Superman, or the traditional, nostalgic superhero film." [...] Some of Silvestri's work from the first film is tracked into the opening of the sequel, which Jackman said [...] "reminds everyone where we left off. This character <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurled into a completely different environment, so it’s a nice way to tie the two films together." ...|$|E
