Flows through rockfill embankments can be used in some cases to reduce the peak flow as discussed in the article. There are however other applications of seepage flows through rockfill structures. 1 - Flow through a rockfill dam is a type of flood water release (i. e. spillway use). It can occur with concrete-faced rockfill (CFR) dams or with in-built spillway dam (fig. 1). Several researchers (e. g. PARKIN et al. 1966, OLIVIER 1967) discussed the interactions between the seepage flow through the rockfill and the overflow. In Australia, rockfill dams with in-built spillways have been used since the 1950 's. ALLEN (1984) and LAWSON (1987) described several prototype experiences. 2 - Flow through a rockfill embankment might occur also during the construction of a rockfill structure (e. g. a dam). The main concern becomes then the stability of the structure. Provided that the downstream slope of the structure is undamaged, LAWSON (1987) showed from prototype experiences that large flood flows can be passed through (and over) the partly-completed embankment. The downstream slope can be reinforced with bars and anchors to improve the downstream slope stability. 3 - Further rockfill structures are used as debris barriers.

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} {{constructing}} breakwater {{project is a}} course of <b>dumping</b> <b>rockfill.</b> And the slit is squeezed out. The simulation of <b>dumping</b> <b>rockfill</b> is mainly by Lagrange or Euler algorithm. But these two algorithms have disadvantages {{in the process of}} simulating. The course of extruding slitl is a dynamic contact process of rockfill, seawater and silt. This paper studies the basic principle of Coupled Euler Lagrange algorithms (CEL). The course of extruding slit is simulated by CEL with ABAQUS. This paper studies the course of extruding slit by <b>dumping</b> <b>rockfill</b> in the project of Haiyang harbor. The size effect of rockfill on extruding depth is put forward. The research results can be used be used for reference in other engineering...|$|R
40|$|A way to {{equalize}} granular <b>rockfill</b> <b>dumps</b> at a sea or river bed {{is the use}} of a plough. A plough can be modeled as a set of straight blades in sequence. Several cutting models for dry and saturated sand are present in the literature. In cutting coarse material, the increase in pore water pressures caused by dilatancy of the grain structure play a minor role. This results in a different shape of the layer cut than for traditional cutting methods in fine soils. The layer cut has a limited surface slope resulting in grains rolling down under the angle of repose ?. Failure of the grain structure in coarse material depends mainly on the gravitational, shear and inertial forces between grains. This master thesis gives an analytical model for cutting rockfill larger than medium coarse sand with straight cutting blades (Chapter 4. 2). A description is given of the important processes involved in equalizing with a plough and the different stages of filling. The analytical model is realized by use of models made by S. Miedema for cutting saturated sand and models for cutting dry sand by Hettiaratchi, and Reece (1966). The analytical model is verified by performing a physical scale model. The scale model is used to attempt to simulate the process in a discrete element computer model EDEM.
