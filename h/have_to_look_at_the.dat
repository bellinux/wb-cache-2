5|$|Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service {{announced}} on 1 October 1993 {{that the two}} companies would merge from 1 January 1994. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi would be paid with NOK225 million in Helikopter Service shares. The Norwegian Competition Authority stated they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> merger, since the new company would have an almost-monopoly on offshore flights. However, the ministry stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on 14 December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received 14% of the shares in the merged company. They were immediately sold, giving Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi a NOK170 million profit on the five-year venture.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Norway {{decided to}} allow any airline from the European Economic Area to operate {{helicopter}} services in Norway from 1995. This meant that companies like Bristow Group, KLM and Maersk Air could start operation in Norway. This would be coordinated through common technical rules for helicopters through the Joint Aviation Authorities. Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on 1 October 1993 {{that the two}} companies would merge from 1 January 1994. Ludvig G.

2500|$|Monaghan {{argued the}} main {{conflict}} in the novel is Price’s struggle to assert herself and save the values represented by Mansfield Park from corruption. In {{the first part of}} the novel Price is passive, a character generally ignored by the other characters. In the conversation about the value of improvement to an estate, Price’s conservatism emerges when she objects to Rushworth’s plans to destroy the trees at Sotherton as she values what has emerged naturally over the centuries. The materialist Mary Crawford says she is willing to accept any improvements money can buy just as long she does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> work while Henry is only interested in the work of improvement, not the finished product, which reflects their bad sense of time; Henry lives in the present, Mary thinks only of the future and only Fanny can think of the past, present and the future. At the visit to Sotherton, only Price is able to appreciate the charm of this great house, “built in Elizabeth’s time”, despite its neglected condition, as a symbol of traditions going far back in time while everyone dismisses Sotherton as “a dismal old prison”. [...] When Edmund chooses to go into the “serpentine course” in the woods with Mary and abandons Price, this reflects her general powerlessness against Mary’s charm.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Gifted, a {{novel by}} New Zealand {{academic}} and former Frame biographer Patrick Evans, was published and subsequently shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. The story is a fictionalised account {{of the relationship between}} Janet Frame and Frank Sargeson during her time living as a guest on his Takapuna property in 1955–56 – an era recounted in a number of works by Frame and her contemporaries and dramatised in Campion's film, An Angel At My Table (1990). In 2013, Evans' novel was adapted for the stage, premiering at the Christchurch Arts Festival on 22 August 2013, followed by extended tour of New Zealand's north and south islands. While garnering positive critical reviews, the promotion and staging of the production drew fierce criticism from Frame's literary executor and niece, Pamela Gordon, who maintained it [...] "was designed to demean Frame." [...] Gordon, who has also criticised Campion's film for inaccuracies in its portrayal of Frame, asserted that Evans' theatrical adaptation presented an unfaithful view of her famous relative. Festival organiser Philip Tremewan, defended the play, while director Conrad Newport maintained that Gordon was [...] "overprotective of [...] legacy." [...] Evans generally avoided the controversy, stating, [...] "I have publicised her work and popularised it for two to three generations of students. In Gifted, the play and novel, you only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> title to see what my attitude is. I really don't think I have anything to apologise for." ...|$|E
