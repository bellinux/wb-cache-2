50|$|Nutritional iron {{deficiency}} {{is common in}} developing nations. An estimated two-thirds of children and of {{women of childbearing age}} in most developing nations are estimated to suffer from irondeficiency; one-third of them have the more severe form of the disorder, anemia. Iron deficiency from nutritional causes is rare in men and postmenopausal women. The diagnosis of {{iron deficiency}} mandates a search for potential sources of loss, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate,</b> or ferrous gluconate. When taking iron supplements, stomach upset or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced. The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed. Vitamin C aids in the body's ability to absorb iron, so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit. In anemias of chronic disease, associated with chemotherapy, or associated with renal disease, some clinicians prescribe recombinant erythropoietin or epoetin alfa, to stimulate RBC production, although since there is also concurrent iron deficiency and inflammation present, parenteral iron is advised to be taken concurrently.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> is {{currently}} recommended {{for use in}} the fortification of foods for infants and young children. This recommendation is based on the compound's good sensory properties and on results from isotope studies in adults that reported similar iron absorption values for <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> and ferrous sulphate (relative bioavailability [RBV] of <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate,</b> 100). However, later isotope studies conducted on both iron-replete and iron-deficient young children found that iron absorption from <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> was only about 30 % of that achieved from ferrous sulphate (RBV, 30). The reasons for the differences observed in adults compared with children are unclear but could be related to the following factors: lower iron status in children resulting in greater iron absorption via upregulation from ferrous sulphate but not from ferrous fumarate; reduced gastric acid secretion in children leading to retarded dissolution of ferrous fumarate; or an influence of added ascorbic acid on RBV. Ferrous fumarate-fortified complementary foods have been demonstrated to improve iron status in iron-deficient infants and, more recently, to prevent iron deficiency equally as well as ferrous sulphate in iron-replete infants.

Objective: The present {{study was designed to}} compare the efficacy, tolerability, and cost, of three oral iron preparations among the anaemic pregnant women (n= 6 o) of gestation (12 - 24 weeks). Methodology: The patients were divided into 3 groups (n= 20) and treated with ferrous fumarate(100 mg), ferrous bisglycinate (100 mg),and carbonyl iron(100 mg) respectively. Follow-up was done for 3 months. Haemoglobin gm%, mean corpuscular volume and reticulocyte count were assessed at 0, 1, 2, 3 months and serum ferritin at 0 and 3 months. Adverse effects were monitored and cost analysis was done at end of three months.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Nutrition)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Background: The high {{prevalence}} of iron deficiency and anaemia among South African children highlights {{the need for}} iron fortification, especially with a highly bioavailable iron compound. Fortification of staple foods is an adequate strategy to provide additional iron to populations at risk. In South Africa it is mandatory to fortify maize meal and wheat flour with iron, {{as well as other}} micronutrients. Elemental iron, specifically electrolytic iron, is currently the preferred choice but other compounds that might be more effective in alleviating iron deficiency are under consideration. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} provide information about the bioavailability of <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> and NaFeEDTA from maize meal porridge in young children, which would assist in selecting a bioavailable alternative to electrolytic iron in the South African National Food Fortification Programme, Methods: A randomized parallel study design was used, with each of the 2 groups further randomised to receive either one of two test regimens in a crossover design in which each child acted as his/her own control. Iron bioavailability was measured with a stable-isotope technique based on erythrocyte incorporation 15 days after intake. Results: The mean absorption of iron from NaFeEDTA and <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> from the maize porridge meal was 11. 5 % and 9. 29 % respectively. NaFeEDTA and <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> are both sufficiently bioavailable from a maize based meal rich in phytates. Conclusion: Both NaFeEDTA and <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> would provide a physiologically important amount of iron should they replace electrolytic iron as fortificant in maize flour fortification. The final choice between <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> and NaFeEDTA as when it comes to finding the alternative iron fortificant will depend on factors such as technical compatibility, bioavailability, relative cost and organoleptic characteristics.

40|$|Background: Nonheme-iron {{absorption}} {{requires an}} acidic milieu. Reduced gastric acid output {{as a consequence}} of Helicobacter pylori infection could be an important limiting factor for iron absorption. Objective: We measured gastric acid output and iron absorption from a non-water-soluble iron compound (<b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate)</b> and a water-soluble iron compound (ferrous sulfate) in children with and without H. pylori infection. Design: Gastric acid output was quantified before (basal acid output, or BAO) and after pentagastrin stimulation (stimulated acid output, or SAO) in 2 – 5 -y-old children with iron deficiency anemia who were (n 13) or were not (n 12) infected with H. pylori. Iron absorption was measured by using a double-stable-isotope technique. H. pylori–infected children were studied before and after eradication therapy. Results: BAO and SAO were significantly lower in the H. pylori– infected children (0. 2 0. 2 and 1. 6 0. 9 mmol/h, respectively) than in the uninfected children (0. 9 0. 7 and 3. 1 0. 9 mmol/h, respectively; P 0. 01 and P 0. 005). BAO and SAO improved to 0. 8 1. 3 and 3. 3 2. 4 mmol/h, respectively, after therapy. Iron absorption from ferrous sulfate was significantly greater than that from <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> both before (geometric x: 19. 7 % compared with 5. 3 %; P 0. 0001) and after (22. 5 % compared with 6. 4 %; P 0. 0001) treatment in H. pylori–infected children. Corresponding values for uninfected children were 15. 6 % and 5. 4 %, respectively (P 0. 001; n 12). Conclusions: Iron absorption from <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> was signifi-cantly lower than that from ferrous sulfate in both H. pylori–infected and uninfected Bangladeshi children.

Mean Fe absorption from wheat, wheat-soyabean and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) infant cereals fortified with FeSO 4 or <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> ranged from 0 · 6 to 2 · 2 %. For each infant cereal, mean Fe absorption from <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> {{was similar to that}} from FeSO 4 (absorption ratio 0 · 91 - 1 · 28). Mean Fe absorption from FeSO 4 -fortified bread rolls was 1 · 0 % when made from high-extraction wheat flour and 5 · 7 % when made from low-extraction wheat flour. Fe absorption from infant cereals and bread rolls fortified with NaFeEDTA was 1 · 9 - 3 · 9 times greater than when the same product was fortified with FeSO 4. Both high phytate content and consumption of tea decreased Fe absorption from the NaFeEDTA-fortified rolls. When Na 2 EDTA up to a 1 : 1 molar ratio (EDTA:Fe) was added to FeSO 4 -fortified wheat cereal and wheat-soyabean cereal mean Fe absorption from the wheat cereal increased from 1 · 0 % to a maximum of 5 · 7 % at a molar ratio of 0 · 67 : 1, and from the wheat-soyabean cereal from 0 · 7 % to a maximum of 2 · 9 % at a molar ratio of 1 : 1.

40|$|Introduction: Home {{fortification}} powders containing {{iron and}} other micronutrients have been recommended by World Health Organisation to prevent {{iron deficiency anaemia}} in areas of high prevalence. There is evidence, however, that home fortification at this iron dose may cause gastrointestinal adverse events including diarrhoea. Providing a low dose of highly absorbable iron (3  mg iron as NaFeEDTA) may be safer because the decreased amount of iron in the gut lumen can possibly reduce the burden of these adverse effects whilst resulting in similar or higher amounts of absorbed iron. Objective: To show non-inferiority of home fortification with 3  mg iron as NaFeEDTA compared with 12. 5  mg iron as encapsulated <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate,</b> with haemoglobin response as the primary outcome. Design: 338 Kenyan children aged 12 – 36 months will be randomly allocated to daily home fortification with either: a) 3  mg iron as NaFeEDTA (experimental treatment), b) 12. 5  mg iron as encapsulated <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> (reference), or c) placebo. At baseline, after 30 days of intervention and within 100 days post-intervention, blood samples will be assessed for primary outcome (haemoglobin concentration), iron status markers, Plasmodium parasitaemia and inflammation markers. Urine and stool samples will be assessed for hepcidin concentrations and inflammation, respectively.

At 4 mo, 3 infants had ID anemia and were excluded. Ninety-five infants were randomized at 4 mo, and 69 (36 Cereal L, 33 Cereal M) completed the intervention at 9 mo. From 4 to 9 mo, they consumed daily one of the study cereals. With each cereal, 2 infants had mild ID, a prevalence of 4. 2 %, but no infant developed ID anemia. There were no differences in iron status between study groups. Iron intake from the study cereals was (mean ± SD) 1. 21 ± 0. 31 mg⋅kg− 1 ⋅d− 1 from Cereal L and 1. 07 ± 0. 40 mg⋅kg− 1 ⋅d− 1 from Cereal M. Eleven infants had low birth iron endowment (plasma ferritin < 55 μg/L at 2 mo) and 54 % of these infants had ID with or without anemia by 4 mo. We conclude that electrolytic iron and <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> were equally efficacious as fortificants of this infant cereal...|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} show the non-inferiority of home {{fortification}} with a daily dose of 3 mg iron {{in the form of}} iron as ferric sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (NaFeEDTA) compared with 12. 5 mg iron as encapsulated <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> in Kenyan children aged 12 - 36 months. In addition, we updated a recent meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of home fortification with iron-containing powders, with a view to examining diversity in trial results. Methods: We gave chemoprevention by dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, albendazole and praziquantel to 338 afebrile children with haemoglobin concentration ≥ 70 g/L. We randomly allocated them to daily home fortification for 30 days with either placebo, 3 mg iron as NaFeEDTA or 12. 5 mg iron as encapsulated <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate.</b> We assessed haemoglobin concentration (primary outcome), plasma iron markers, plasma inflammation markers and Plasmodium infection in samples collected at baseline and after 30 days of intervention. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in pre-school children to assess the effect of home fortification with iron-containing powders on anaemia and haemoglobin concentration at end of intervention. Results: A total of 315 children completed the 30 -day intervention period. At baseline, 66. 9 % of children had inflammation (plasma C-reactive protein concentration > 5 mg/L or plasma α 1 -acid glycoprotein concentration > 1. 0 g/L); in those without inflammation, 42. 5 % were iron deficient. There was no evidence, either in per protocol analysis or intention-to-treat analysis, that home fortification with either of the iron interventions improved haemoglobin concentration, plasma ferritin concentration, plasma transferrin receptor concentration or erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-haem ratio. We also found no evidence of effect modification by iron status, anaemia status and inflammation status at baseline. In the meta-analysis, the effect on haemoglobin concentration was highly heterogeneous between trials (I 2 : 84. 1 %; p value for test of heterogeneity: < 0. 0001). Conclusions: In this population, home fortification with either 3 mg iron as NaFeEDTA or 12. 5 mg iron as encapsulated <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate</b> was insufficiently efficacious to assess non-inferiority of 3 mg iron as NaFeEDTA compared to 12. 5 mg iron as encapsulated <b>ferrous</b> <b>fumarate.</b> Our finding of heterogeneity between trial results should stimulate subgroup analysis or meta-regression to identify population-specific factors that determine efficacy. Trial Registration: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 02073149) on 25 February 2014. </p...|$|E
