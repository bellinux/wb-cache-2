5|$|Bush {{initially}} {{wanted to}} nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan, who stepped down in 1990, but he then decided that Thomas {{had not yet}} <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> experience as a judge after only months on the federal bench. Bush therefore nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge David Souter instead. The selection of Thomas to instead replace Marshall preserved the existing racial composition of the court.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{the category of}} comodules over a flat Hopf algebroid is abelian but typically fails to <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> projectives, and more generally, the category of graded comodules over a graded flat Hopf algebroid is abelian but typically fails to <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> projectives. In this short paper we prove that the category of connective graded comodules over a connective, graded, flat, finite-type Hopf algebroid <b>has</b> <b>enough</b> projectives. Applications in algebraic topology are given: the Hopf algebroids of stable co-operations in complex bordism, Brown-Peterson homology, and classical mod $p$ homology all have the property that their categories of connective graded comodules <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> projectives...|$|R

After the success of Halloween, he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri on an estimated budget of $6 million. Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying Michael Myers in Halloween.|$|E
5|$|Green Wing {{had some}} plot lines {{that were never}} used. Unused storylines {{included}} Alan having an 80-year-old wife and step-grandchildren as old as him, and Guy suffering from impotence. Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but also porters, car park attendants and kitchen staff. However, she eventually decided that they <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.|$|E

The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival.

5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} weaponry.

On 1 August 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of rest and recovery, Zita found herself {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided {{to move back to}} the continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age of}} 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E

They also rented a helicopter, and—with the assistance of the Spanish authorities, who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation—filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the siege}} began, Skanderbeg exited Krujë with 8,000 men—among whom were many Slavs, Italians, Frenchmen and Germans. 2,000 {{of these were}} {{infantry}} and 6,000 were cavalry. Skanderbeg found Mount Tumenishta (now known as Mount Skënderbeu) to be a suitable position from which to attack the Ottomans. Krujë was left with a garrison of 4,000 men {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. Vrana had under his command several Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, to whom he emphasized the importance of the siege and also ordered them to their positions. Krujë <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> supplies for a sixteen-month siege. The women and children of Krujë were sent for protection to Venetian possessed cities, whereas the others were ordered to burn their crops and move into the mountains and fortresses.|$|E

Pirates based in the Caribbean were chased from the seas by a new British squadron based at Port Royal, Jamaica, and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the Spanish Main, known as the Guarda de Costa, or simply the Guarda.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{believed}} that he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him {{the chance to be}} president.|$|E

A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E

She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had <b>had</b> <b>enough,</b> and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas.|$|E
