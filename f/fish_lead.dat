50|$|In its {{invasive}} range, few predators of the lionfish {{have been}} documented. Most larger Atlantic and Caribbean fish and sharks {{that should be}} able to eat the lionfish have not recognized them as prey, likely due to the novelty of the fish in the invaded areas. Lionfish have, however, been found in the stomachs of Nassau and tiger groupers in the Bahamas. The lionfish themselves are voracious feeders and have outcompeted and filled the niche of the overfished snapper and grouper. When hunting, they corner prey using their large fins, then use their quick reflexes to swallow the prey whole. They hunt primarily from late afternoon to dawn. High rates of prey consumption, a wide variety of prey, and increasing abundance of the <b>fish</b> <b>lead</b> to concerns the fish may have a very active role in the already declining trend of fish densities. As the fish become more abundant, they are becoming a threat to the fragile ecosystems they have invaded. Between outcompeting similar fish and having a varied diet, the lionfish is drastically changing and disrupting the food chains holding the marine ecosystems together. As these chains are disrupted, declining densities of other fish populations are found, as well as declines in the overall diversity of coral reef areas.|$|E

The {{traditional methods of}} protecting marine structures have been the use of toxic antifoulants, such as lead, mercury and tributyltin compounds (TBT). Such heavy metals {{have proven to be}} effective in deed, but severe shellfish deformities and the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in ducks, seals and <b>fish</b> <b>lead</b> to the global ban of toxic antifoulants. Therefore, our antifouling strategy is to develop minimally adhesive, mechanically stable and nontoxic fouling release coatings which degrade fouling an organism’s ability to adhere to surfaces. Herein we report on the synthesis and characterization of a novel cross-linkable copolymer grafted a semifluorinated aromatic side chain which was prepared by copolymerization with methyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate. Bulk and surface properties were assessed through 1 H NMR and 19 F NMR spectra, contact angle measurement. The cross-linkable copolymer was rationally designed for use as coating to prevent marine bioufouling. Apart from the use of methyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate which contained epoxide ring serving as a cross-linked group, the other important monomer―a semifluorinated group substituted styrene monomer was selected to construct a low surface energy material.

40|$|The authors {{characterized}} global cytosine methylation {{levels in}} two different genotypes of the ecotoxicological model organism Daphnia magna after exposure to {{a wide array of}} biotic and abiotic environmental stressors. The study aimed to improve the authors' understanding of the role of cytosine methylation in the organism‘s response to environmental conditions. The authors observed a significant genotype effect, an environment effect and a genotype x environment effect. In particular, global cytosine methylation levels were significantly altered after exposure to Triops predation cues, Microcystis and sodium chloride compared to control conditions. Significant differences between the two genotypes were observed when animals were exposed to Triops predation cues, Microcystis, Cryptomonas and sodium chloride. Despite the low global methylation rate under control conditions (0. 49 - 0. 52 %), global cytosine methylation levels upon exposure to Triops demonstrated a five-fold difference between the genotypes (0. 21 % versus 1. 02 %). No effects were found in response to arsenic, cadmium, <b>fish,</b> <b>lead,</b> pH of 5. 5, pH of 8, temperature, hypoxia and white fat cell disease.

30|$|The {{chemical}} analyses indicated a toxic burden with micropollutants in fish and sediments {{at both of}} the investigated sampling sites. With regard to the investigated PAHs, the concentrations for naphthalene exceeded the environmental quality standards (EQS) defined by the European Parliament [26]. The exceedance of the EQS should be alarming since PAHs {{are known to have}} genotoxic and carcinogenic effects on <b>fish,</b> <b>lead</b> to morphological abnormalities in fish larvae, and also cause oxidative stress in the organs of exposed fish [7, 29 – 32]. Besides the aforementioned PAHs, PCBs and PBDEs were also detected in fish from the Argen River, with the measured concentrations for the sum of PBDEs also exceeding the EQS of the European Parliament [26]. PBDEs have a similar structure and similar properties, and may exert similar toxic effects like PCBs, but their C–Br bond makes them more susceptible to environmental degradation than PCBs with their much more stable C–Cl bond [33 – 35]. Due to their high hydrophobicity, both substance groups tend to accumulate and biomagnify in organisms where they can reach concentrations that are far higher than those in water [36, 37]. Especially problematic is the metabolic debromination of higher brominated PBDE congeners, as reported by Roberts et al. [38]. Taking this into account, the concentrations of lower brominated PBDEs, and thus presumably also their toxicity, may be enhanced due to the metabolic debromination of higher brominated congeners, as shown by Tomy et al. [39]. Investigations of Brown and Peake [40] showed that road debris represents the main source of PAHs in road runoff and storm water discharges. Benfenati et al. [41] reported that traffic represents the main source of roadside pollution with PAHs, PCBs, and other organic pollutants. Hence, in this case the analyzed substances like PAHs and PCBs are strongly supposed to originate from the road traffic near the Argen River.|$|E

40|$|In aquatic {{ecosystems}} zinc is both {{an essential}} micronutrient and a toxicant of considerable significance. Biological roles of zinc are mediated by its structural and/or functional importance in more than 300 enzymes and other proteins (Vallee and Falchuk, 1993). Consequently, zinc deficiency in <b>fish</b> <b>leads</b> to physiological perturbation of growth, reproduction, vision and immunity (Watanabe et al., 1997). Conversely, excessive environmental zinc can have severe impacts upon the survival of aquatic organisms (Eisler, 1993). Two major routes for zinc uptake exist in fish (Hogstrand and Wood, 1996). Waterborne zinc is absorbed mainly via the gill, while the gut assimilates particulate zinc from diet and imbibed water.

40|$|Abstract—Heavy metals are {{considered}} as a major pollutant causing environmental cytotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in animals and aquatic organisms. Pollution caused by these substances can arise from many sources and the major problem associated with its persistence is its potential for bioaccumulation. Heavy metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) {{are the most common}} toxicant that {{can be found in the}} marine environment including fish. Fish is a common table food consumed by humans for protein nourishment and its use to study heavy metal contamination would benefit majority of individuals living in a country surrounded by bodies of water, such as the Philippines. The study aims to analyze the presence of lead, cadmium and chromium using qualitative and quantitative tests in the head, meat and internals of selected fish samples sold in wet markets located at Metro Manila, Philippines. Quantitative analysis confirmed the presence of lead, cadmium and chromium in all fish samples. Results were reinforced by the Flame Atomic Absorbance Spectroscopy, wherein most of the fish samples exceeded the standard limits set by US-EPA and FDA for lead, cadmium and chromium i. e. 0. 5, 0. 05 and 0. 1 ppm respectively. Single factor ANOVA have shown that there is no significance among the levels of lead, cadmium and chromium with p values of 0. 3679, 0. 8858 and 0. 9593 respectively in the head, meat and internal organs of the fish samples. Therefore, a person will acquire the same amount and effect of the heavy metals regardless of the part of the fish to be consumed. This study would be useful for the creation of guidelines to protect the public from the harmful effects of the toxicants present in fish that is consumed by the public.

40|$|Sensory {{systems have}} been shaped by {{evolution}} to extract information that is relevant for decision making. In {{order to understand the}} mechanisms used by sensory systems for filtering the incoming stream of sensory input, {{it is important to have}} a quantitative understanding of the natural sensory scenes that are to be processed. Weakly electric <b>fish</b> <b>lead</b> a rather cryptic nocturnal life in often turbid tropical rainforest streams. They produce electric discharges and sense perturbations of their selfgenerated electric field for prey detection and navigation, and also use their active sense for communication in the context of courtship and aggression. The fact that they produce their electric signals throughout day and night permits the use of electrode arrays to track the movements of multiple individual fish and monitor their communication interactions, thus offering a window into their electrosensory world. This approach yields unprecedented access to information on the biology of these fishes and also on the statistical properties of the sensory scenes that are to be processed by their electrosensory system. The electrosensory system shares many organizational features with other sensory systems, in particular, the use of multiple topographic maps. In fact, the sensory surface (the skin) is represented in three parallel maps in the hindbrain, with each map covering the receptor organ array with six different cell types that project to the next higher level of processing. Thus, the electroreceptive body surface is represented a total of 18 times in the hindbrain, with each representation having its specific filter properties and degree of response plasticity. Thus, the access to the sensory world of these fish as well as the manifold filtering of the sensory input makes these fish an excellent model system for exploring the cell-intrinsic and network characteristics underlying the extraction of behaviourally relevant sensory information...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Electrofishing is a {{sampling}} tool commonly used by fisheries researchers. While much {{is known about the}} effects of electroshock on fish physiology, consequences to the immune system and disease progression have not received attention. To understand the effects of electroshock on immune function we undertook a comparison of electroshock and handling stress in regards to selected immune functions and disease progression in juvenile spring chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The handling stress treatment was included to insure the responsiveness of the fish. Our objectives were {{to determine the effects of}} electroshock on immune function, determine the mechanism of any observed alteration, and to determine the effects of electroshock on disease progression. Skin mucous lysozyme concentrations were not affected by exposure to electroshock. Respiratory burst activity may be enhanced in leukocytes immediately after an in vitro electroshock. Any effect in vivo, however, appears to be brief given the lack of differences observed 3 h after exposure. The specific immune response, measured as the ability of anterior kidney leukocytes to generate antibody producing cells (APC), was suppressed 3 h after electroshock, but recovered within 24 h. This response was similar in timing and magnitude to that of fish subjected to an acute handling stress. The mechanism of suppression is hypothesized to be via elevation of plasma cortisol concentrations. The ability to generate APC may be suppressed 7 d after electroshock, but it is not evident what mechanism is responsible for this suppression. There was some evidence that the progression of a Renibacterium salmoninarum (RS) infection was altered after exposure to an electroshock. Exposure to electroshock did not have a clear affect on the severity of infection or the number of mortalities, but may have accelerated the time to death in infected fish that died. The limited duration of specific immune suppression and lack of effect on mortality in RS infected <b>fish</b> <b>lead</b> us to conclude that electrofishing under the conditions we tested is a safe procedure in regards to immunity and disease...|$|E
