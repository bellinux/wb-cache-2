Bello also defended the military's action saying that the prisoners were determined not to be taken alive.|$|E

According to a psychiatric exam given while she was in custody, her story has alternated between claiming that the two youngest children were dead and that they were with her sister Fowzia. She told one FBI agent that pursuing the cause of jihad had to take priority. Khan said he believed that the missing children were in Karachi, either with or in contact with Siddiqui's family, and not in US detention. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were seen in her sister's house in Karachi and in Islamabad since 2003.|$|E

25|$|The KP3T {{consisted}} {{mainly of}} political {{figures from the}} previous regime, including former prosecutor general Djoko Sugianto. The resulting report, released in early June 2000, found {{that there had been}} no systematic massacre in the incident. This was not well received by the general public. On 23 June 2000, approximately 300 members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) attacked the headquarters of Komnas HAM while dressed in white Islamic clothing and green scarves. They broke windows with stones and rattan sticks, outnumbering and overwhelming the security forces. The FPI was upset at the commission's report on the massacre and perceived collusion with the military, arguing that it had ignored actions by the military; it insisted that the commission be abolished. Meanwhile, Minister of Law and Human Rights Yusril Ihza Mahendra wrote that Komnas HAM had seemingly applied double standards when investigating the issue; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> seemed more reluctant to investigate the Tanjung Priok incident then they had been in investigating the 1999 East Timorese crisis. Crescent Star Party leader Ahmad Sumargono called the verdict a disappointment to Muslims everywhere.|$|E
25|$|Saint Augustine of Hippo {{reminded}} Romans of otium philosophandi, {{a positive}} element, {{that life was}} happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that otium was the prerequisite for contemplation. It was because of otium that Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described Christianae vita otium as the Christian life of leisure. Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of otium as the deadly sin of acedia (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated otium as meaning to serve God through deep thought. Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify otium. These same Christian writers also showed otium ruris (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic propositum. Augustine describes the monastic life as otium sanctum (sanctified leisure or approved leisure). In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - negotium) {{and the other to}} be a worthy friend of God (devotion - otium).|$|E
