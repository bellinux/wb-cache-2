40|$|<b>Fluosol</b> (Alpha Therapeutic Corporation, Los Angeles, CA) an {{emulsion}} of perfluorocarbons {{with a high}} oxygen-carrying capacity, {{was approved}} {{as an adjunct to}} alleviate myocardial ischemia during coronary angioplasty. This drug also significantly enhances myocardial salvage presumably related to an action on the neutrophil. The mechanism by which <b>fluosol</b> and its individual components, including the detergent Pluronic F- 68, affected neutrophil function was examined. During the incubation of neutrophils with <b>fluosol,</b> a rapid stimulation of superoxide anion production and degranulation which progressively increased over a 30 -minute period was detected. Neutrophils incubated with only Pluronic F- 68 produced similar amounts of superoxide anion. Cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of phagocytosis, significantly inhibited this superoxide anion generation. As shown previously, neutrophils incubated with <b>fluosol</b> for 30 minutes and then subsequently stimulated manifested a reduction in lysozyme release as compared with untreated cells. Results of an electron microscopic examination confirmed the cellular uptake of the <b>fluosol</b> within phagocytic vacuoles. Neutrophil viability determined by trypan blue was unaffected after <b>fluosol</b> treatment.

40|$|<b>Fluosol,</b> {{a complex}} mixture of O 2 {{carrying}} perfluorocarbons (PFCs) emulsified by the detergent pluronic F- 68 {{and a variety}} of lipids, significantly reduces myocardial reperfusion injury (RI) in animals and humans as shown in some initial clinical trials. Potential mechanisms for <b>Fluosol</b> include enhanced O 2 delivery to the reperfused tissue and modulation of various neutrophil (PMNs) functions. Recent studies in dogs and man demonstrate the same beneficial effect for treatment of Rl with the detergent component alone, RheothRx, which is currently undergoing clinical trials. We have shown that the effect of <b>Fluosol</b> on PMNs is related to this detergent. However, prolonged infusion (48 hrs) of detergent is required to reduce Rl to the same extent as <b>Fluosol</b> given over only 1 hr. Possible mechanisms for the beneficial effects of <b>Fluosol</b> (O 2 delivery vs effects on PMNs) were investigated in a model of regional ischemia utilizing rabbits undergoing 30 mins of circumflex occlusion and 48 hrs of reperfusion. Infarct size (area of necrosis, AN) was determined histologically and expressed as percent of risk region (area at risk, AR). Animals received <b>Fluosol</b> (30 cc/kg) with or without O 2 or saline over the first 60 mins of reperfusion. AR was similar in all groups. (Mean±SEM of AN/AR (%), n= 11 for all groups). The treatment with <b>Fluosol</b> with or without O 2 (44 ± 3 and 40;± 3, respectively) was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced compared to control (63 ± 4). Another group received F-I 08, a larger size pluronic detergent found to be 2. 5 -fold more potent in suppressing PMN function in vitrocompared to F- 68, during the first 3 hrs of reperfusion. This treatment did not alter the infarct size (63 ± 5). RheothRx was found to form 4 nm micelles in solution whereas <b>Fluosol</b> formed particles approximately 100 times larger. Similar sized particles were formed by substituting the perfluorocarbons with mineral oil. The in vitroactivity of this pluronic/mineral oil micelle on PMN function was similar to <b>Fluosol.</b> Infusion of these larger oil micelles was tolerated by rabbits and used in further infarct studies. ConclusionsThese studies suggest that (1) reduction of RI by <b>Fluosol</b> is not due to enhanced O 2 delivery by the PFCs to reperfused myocardium and (2) since the <b>Fluosol</b> emulsion markedly reduces the clearance of the detergent F- 68 (t½: <b>Fluosol</b> ≅ 8 hrs vs RheothRx ≅ 1. 5 hrs). prolonged PMN suppression rather than potency of suppression is the mechanism whereby <b>Fluosol</b> ameliorates RI. Fluosol's clinical efficacy may be enhanced by prolonging its infusion to ensure an adequate blood level to suppress PMN function beyond the time of reperfusion injury. RheothRx's clinical usefulness may be facilitated by decreasing its renal clearance by delivering larger micelles of the detergent in order to produce prolonged PMN suppression with a shorter infusion time...|$|E

The effect of a clinically tolerable dose of <b>Fluosol</b> on infarct size after a prolonged period of reperfusion and its mechanism of action on neutrophils remain unknown. Twenty-one anesthetized closed chest dogs were subjected to 90 min of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 72 h of reperfusion. An additional five dogs that did not undergo regional myocardial ischemia were utilized to explore the mechanism of action of <b>Fluosol</b> on neutrophil function. In the infarct study, animals were randomized to receive either intravenous <b>Fluosol</b> (n = 10) or an equivalent volume of Ringer's lactate solution (control; n = 11) at 15 ml/kg body weight during the last 30 min of occlusion and for the 1 st 30 min of reperfusionFluosol significantly reduced infarct size when expressed as percent area at risk 72 h aller reperfusion (13. 7 ± 2. 7 % vs. 38. 3 ± 4. 5 %, respectively, p < 0. 001). This reduction was associated with significant improvement in regional wall motion (18. 4 ± 2. 3 % vs. 5. 5 ± 2 %, p < 0. 001). Endocardial blood fiow in the ischemic bed was significantly higher 3 h after reperfusion in Fluosol-treated dogs (0. 63 ± 0. 08 vs. 0. 34 ± 0. 07 ml/min per g, p = 0. 01). Reduced capillary plugging by neutrophils with relative preservation of endothelial cell structure was observed in Fluosol-treated animals. Infusion of <b>Fluosol</b> produced a marked transient decrease in peripheral neutrophil and platelet counts in both ischemic and nonischemic dogs and was associated with a significant reduction in total hemolytic complement levels.

The effect of the perfluorochemical, Fluosol-DA, and its various components on neutrophil adherence, cytotoxicity, and proteolytic enzyme release was examined on sheep large and small vessel endothelial cells in vitro. Cells were studied under normoxic (N) and anoxic conditions (A). Various concentrations of <b>Fluosol</b> (10 %, 25 %, and 50 %) significantly reduced neutrophil adherence under both experimental conditions [mean 22 +/- 3. 25 % versus 7 +/- 0. 8 % (N) and 20 +/- 3. 2 % versus 7. 5 +/- 0. 9 % (A); P less than 0. 01]. The perfluorocarbons, perfluorodecalin (PFD), and perfluoro-tripropylamine (PFTP) in a 50 volume/percent concentration exhibited profound effects on adherence, particularly on cells subjected to anoxia (51 % and 69 % reduction in adherence, respectively; P less than 0. 01). No effect on adherence was observed with other components, including the detergent, pluronic F 68. A 25 % reduction (P less than 0. 02) in endothelial cytotoxicity was noted when neutrophils were preincubated with <b>Fluosol.</b> However, pretreatment of endothelial cells with <b>Fluosol</b> did not inhibit neutrophil adherence.

The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether hyperoxic reperfusion {{contributes}} to the efficacy of <b>Fluosol</b> 20 % or poloxamer 188 for infarct size reduction and whether suppression of polymorphonuclear leukocyte function is responsible for cardioprotection. Background. The perfluorochemical <b>Fluosol</b> and its detergent component poloxamer 188 limit myocardial reperfusion-induced injury; however, the underlying mechanism(s) are uncertain. Methods. A series of in vivo and ex vivo studies were performed in a 30 -min temporary coronary occlusion rabbit model. Before reperfusion, rabbits received a 25 -ml/kg infusion of 1) Fluosol; 2) poloxamer 188 (equivalent % w/v to <b>Fluosol,</b> 675 mg/kg body weight); or 3) 5 % dextrose (control). In protocol A, animals were subjected to either normoxic or hyperoxic reperfusion; in protocols B and C, hyperoxic reperfusion was studied. In protocol B, myocardial blood flow was assessed. In protocol C, polymorphonuclear leukocyte function and myocardial myeloperoxidase were determined. Results. In rabbits subjected to normoxic reperfusion, infarct size (normalized to risk region weight) was not significantly different among groups. In rabbits subjected to hyperoxic reperfusion, infarcts were significantly reduced with both poloxamer 188 and <b>Fluosol</b> treatment compared with control animals (p = 0. 05 and p = 0. 0004, respectively). Blood flow at 3 h of reperfusion within the ischemic endocardium was greater in the <b>Fluosol</b> and poloxamer 188 groups than in the control group (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 08, respectively).

Prolonged balloon inflation has been proposed to improve immediate and long-term results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, but it requires protection against myocardial ischemia. Methods. A 30 -min balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending artery was performed in three groups of closed chest anesthetized dogs: 1) control (no distal coronary perfusion, n = 13), 2) passive distal coronary perfusion (autoperfusion catheter, n = 10), and 3) active distal coronary perfusion (infusion of the perfluorochemical <b>Fluosol</b> at 30 ml/min, n = 11). Results. At 10 min of balloon inflation, echocardiographic wall motion indexes (scored from 1 [normal] to 5 [dyskinesia]) in the autoperfusion catheter and <b>Fluosol</b> groups (2. 4 ± 1. 2 and 2. 0 ± 0. 9, respectively) were significantly better than {{in the control group}} (3. 6 ± 0. 4, p = 0. 001), but at 25 min this improvement in wall motion had attenuated and became statistically insignificant when compared with values in the control group. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at peak inflation in the <b>Fluosol</b> group (19. 5 ± 5. 5 mm Hg) was higher than in the control (7. 6 ± 3. 6) and autoperfusion catheter (5. 3 ± 1. 4, p ≤ 0. 01) groups. Pathologic evidence of infarction by tetrazolium staining was seen in three control dogs and in none of the other groups (p = 0. 07). Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were less frequent in the autoperfusion catheter group (p = 0. 02). Three deaths were observed in the control dogs, two in the <b>Fluosol</b> group and none in the dogs with an autoperfusion catheter (p = NS). Conclusions. Passive (the autoperfusion balloon catheter) and active (<b>Fluosol)</b> distal coronary perfusion methods are comparable and better than no perfusion im protecting the myocardium against ischemia produced by prolonged coronary balloon inflation in an experimental canine model.

40|$|AbstractReperfusion {{may limit}} the amount of {{potentially}} salvageable myocardium through the introduction of cellular elements into previously ischemic but viable myocardium (reperfusion injury). It has been demonstrated that intracoronary infusion of a 20 % intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion (<b>Fluosol)</b> significantly reduces infarct size and results in improved left ventricular function in the canine model. This pilot study was performed to explore the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans. Utilizing <b>Fluosol</b> as a probe in conjunction with emergency coronary angioplasty, 26 patients presenting within 4 h with a first anterior myocardial infarction were randomized to emergency angioplasty or angioplasty followed by a 30 -min intracoronary infusion of <b>Fluosol</b> at 40 ml/min. Global and regional ventricular function were assessed immediately and a mean of 12 days after successful angioplasty with contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was semiquantitated with thallium- 201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images before discharge. Twelve patients (six undergoing angioplasty alone, six treated with angioplasty and <b>Fluosol)</b> had an occluded infarct-related vessel (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 0 to 1) at the time of emergency catheterization and were included in the final analysis. At 12 days after successful angioplasty, the improvement in regional ventricular function was greater in patients receiving adjunctive therapy with intracoronary <b>Fluosol</b> versus those undergoing angioplasty alone utilizing both the radial shortening and centerline method, respectively (23 ± 3. 1 % vs. 8 ± 2. 3 %, p < 0. 02; and − 1. 6 ± 0. 4 vs. − 2. 9 ± 0. 2 SD/chord, p < 0. 05). Tomographic infarct size expressed as a percent of the left ventricle was also reduced in Fluosol-treated patients (3. 5 ± 2. 2 % vs. 18. 3 ± 4. 7 %, p < 0. 05). No significant differences in collateral blood flow, extent of coronary artery disease or residual stenosis after angioplasty were observed. This preliminary study suggests that myocardial reperfusion injury may be an important factor in limiting myocardial salvage in patients undergoing reperfusion.

Only 2 of 15 (13. 3 %) FDA-transfused rats were alive at 312 h compared with 11 of 15 (73. 3 %) concurrently studied sham-transfused control rats (P = 0. 0016).

We have purified plasminogen from Sprague-Dawley rat plasma and have raised a monospecific antiserum against it in rabbits. Isolated rat liver perfusions were performed with an oxygenated recycling perfusate consisting of a perfluorotributylamine/Pluronic F- 68 emulsion (<b>Fluosol</b> 43) free of plasma proteins and blood cells. The system was shown to be capable of synthesizing albumin and transferrin. The cumulative appearance of plasminogen in the perfusate was measured by a sensitive, specific radioimmunoassay.

Exposure of the perfused liver to 18 microM cycloheximide inhibited additional increase in the titer of plasminogen. Evidence for de novo synthesis was provided by the incorporation of 14 C-labeled leucine into specific immunoprecipitates of plasminogen and the inhibition of this incorporation by cycloheximide.

The rate of increase in the perfusate pool of HF during the final 4 h of perfusion yielded a mean synthetic rate of 3. 5 micrograms/h per 100 g body wt, which was approximately 0. 2 % of the synthetic rate of albumin in the same system.

40|$|The {{effect of}} energy {{metabolism}} on intracellular pH was studied in boar spermatozoa using {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy and confocal microscopy with the pH-sensitive dye seminaphthorhodafluor (SNARF- 1). Freshly ejaculated spermatozoa had a high adenylate energy charge (AEC= 0. 8), which decreased to 0. 6 under aerobic conditions and to 0. 2 under anaerobic conditions. Correspondingly, no ATP resonances but high AMP reso-nance were visible in 31 P-NMR-spectra of the sperma-tozoa. When an artificial oxygen buffer (<b>Fluosol)</b> and a purpose-built air supply system were used during 31 P-NMRdata acquisition, ATP resonances reappearedwhereas the AMP resonance disappeared. Boar spermatozoa kept under aerobic conditions have intracellular compartments that differ markedly in pH, as demonstrated by both 31 P-NMR spectroscopy and confocal microscopy. Using confocal microscopy, the midpiece of the flagellum in which all mitochondria are located was identified as an acidic compartment (pHi-mp 6. 7). The intracellular pH of both the head (pHi-h) and the long principal piece of the flagellum (pHi-pp) were 7. 2 and, thus, only slightly below the extracellular pH (pHe 7. 3). Storage of spermatozoa in a glucose-free medium at 15 ◦C when they are immotile slowly shifted the pHi-mp from 6. 7 to 6. 9 within 20 h, whereas pHi-h and pHi-pp remained unchanged (pH 7. 1 – 7. 2). When glucose was present in the medium, all visible compartments of the spermatozoa {{as well as the}} medium were acidified to pH 6. 2 within 20 h. Under these conditions a resonance at 4. 8 ppm appeared representing glycerol 3 -phosphate...|$|E
40|$|Because {{myocardial}} reperfusion injury may {{be caused}} by various blood constituents, a transient period of blood-free reperfusion was evaluated in closed chest dogs subjected to a 90 min angioplasty balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In the treated group (n = 13), the balloon remained inflated for an additional 15 min while the infarct vessel was perfused with an acellular oxygenated perfluorochemical emulsion (<b>Fluosol).</b> The balloon was then deflated, permitting blood reperfusion. In the control group (n = 13), the balloon was deflated after 90 min of coronary occlusion. One week after infarction, the area at risk was defined in vivo by monastral blue dye staining, and the area of myocardial necrosis was assessed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining with histologic confirmation. Major determinants of infarct size, including rate-pressure product, area at risk and severity of myocardial ischemia (assessed by the extent of ST segment elevation during coronary occlusion), were not significantly different in the two groups. Treated dogs demonstrated a 47 % reduction in infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk compared with control dogs (27. 0 ± 4. 4 % versus 50. 8 ± 4. 4 %, p < 0. 01). Treated dogs also demonstrated a superior global left ventricular ejection fraction (57. 5 ± 2. 5 % versus 51. 0 ± 2. 2 %, p < 0. 05) and anterolateral (regional) ejection fraction (32. 6 ± 3. 6 % versus 19. 8 ± 3. 9 %, p < 0. 05) compared with values in control dogs assessed by contrast ventriculography after 1 week of reperfusion. It is concluded that a transient period of blood-free reperfusion with an oxygenated perfluorochemical reduces reperfusion injury in a canine model of myocardial infarction...|$|E
