5000|$|ENGLISH FIRE. All {{the songs}} on this album have been redone in English by the band <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber</b> American. Instead of simply being English {{versions}} of <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber</b> songs, the makers of Macross have created an English version of the band <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber.</b> In the Macross universe, <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber</b> American is a band on the English-speaking fleet Macross 11 that claims that the Macross 7 <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber</b> is a rip-off of it. The singers for this band are also different.http://macross.anime.net/wiki/Fire_Bomber_American According to the fictional Macross continuity Lynn Kaifun, a character from the first TV series from 1982 (who was Lynn Minmay's cousin and also her former manager) is the creator and manager of <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber</b> American.|$|E

5000|$|Basara {{is a very}} emotionally driven pacifist who fanatically {{believes}} {{in the power of}} music and emotion over physical might. He cares little for anything other than his music, and seems oblivious to events around him; in particular he does not notice the feelings women have for him, including Mylene and female biker Rex. The only emotions he ever expresses to any degree are wild enthusiasm for his concerts and angry frustration at those who fail to [...] "understand" [...] his songs; {{the rest of the time}} he maintains a nonchalant, almost contemptuous air, addressing everyone in casual Japanese language. A free spirit, he goes wherever he pleases and frequently arrives late at <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber's</b> concerts (often making his entrance by parachute), believing they cannot start without him. However, when alone he sings songs expressive of his moods, the only way he can cope with his emotions.|$|R

5000|$|The Falcon was {{the first}} {{operational}} guided air-to-air missile of the U.S. Air Force.

50|$|Eventually {{the enemy}} infiltrates City 7 and begins extracting Spiritia from civilians. Due to the secretive {{nature of the}} infiltrators {{and the state of}} their victims, they are dubbed 'vampires' by the public forum. One of the 'vampires' is {{captured}} and revealed to be a human from an earlier lost space mission. A brainwashing mechanism found inside the helmet of the 'vampire' is used to control them. The captured prisoner is exposed to <b>Fire</b> <b>Bomber's</b> music and regains his memories. The prisoner, now revealed to be a Blue Rhinoceros elite squadron pilot, Irana Hayakawa, tells his story. Harakawa stated that the Blue Rhinoceros was a team sent to investigate the fourth planet of the Varautan system, which apparently holds Protoculture secrets, or even descendants of the Protoculture themselves. They were supposed to rendezvous with the United Forces Advisor Ivano Gunther, only to find that Gunther was possessed by an alien entity called the Protodeviln. The entire mission force is taken by the Protodeviln and used to assemble the new Supervision Army that is attacking the Macross 7 fleet.|$|R

A study of use of the aircraft as a forest <b>fire</b> water <b>bomber</b> has also been mentioned, one that would utilize a large carbon composite water tank that could be quickly replenished to make repeat runs over fires.|$|R
