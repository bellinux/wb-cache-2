5|$|Like other banksias, Banksia spinulosa plays host to a {{wide variety}} of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. Banksias have been the subject of many studies about their pollination; B.spinulosa is no exception. A 1998 study in Bungawalbin National Park in Northern New South Wales found that B.spinulosa var.collina inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, {{including}} marsupials such as Antechinus flavipes (yellow-footed antechinus), which carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectar-eating birds, making them effective pollinators. The same study noted that, unlike other banksias studied, B.spinulosa var.collina was visited predominantly by native bees rather than the introduced Apis mellifera (<b>European</b> <b>honeybee).</b>|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} visiting the flowers of B.telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced <b>European</b> <b>honeybee</b> (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by nectarivorous mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their scats have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B.telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed {{in the morning and}} evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day.|$|E
25|$|On the Californian Coast, {{many species}} of animals and plants can be found. The raccoon, skunk, opossum, and rat are 4 of the species. Large predators include the red fox, bobcat, coyote, American black bear, and the cougar. Wasps, the <b>European</b> <b>honeybee,</b> yellowjackets, flies, moths, and many other insects also live on the Californian coast. Marine life {{includes}} orcas and great white sharks.

50|$|Varroa mites {{originally}} only {{occurred in}} Asia, on the Asian honeybee, Apis cerana, but this species {{has been introduced}} to many other countries on several continents, resulting in disastrous infestations of <b>European</b> <b>honeybees.</b>|$|R
500|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus, {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis, forage exclusively on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of the subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus also feed only on Persoonia flowers but {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Recorded species include the longtongue bees Leioproctus (Cladocerapis) carinatifrons, L.incanescens, and L.speculiferus, as well as Leioproctus filamentosa and Exoneura species. The <b>European</b> <b>honeybee</b> (Apis mellifera) is a common visitor to flowers, although its effectiveness as a pollinator is unclear. Persoonia lanceolata is an obligate outcrosser, that is, flowers need to be pollinated by pollen from other plants, and honeybees tend to forage more on different flowers of the same plant than between plants, as native bees do. Their abundance might be impacting the pollination success of native bees in this and other Persoonia species.|$|E
500|$|Like other banksias, B.ericifolia plays host to a {{wide variety}} of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. It has been the subject of a number of studies on pollination. A 1998 study in Bundjalung National Park in Northern New South Wales found that B.ericifolia inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, {{including}} marsupials such as Antechinus flavipes (yellow-footed antechinus), and rodents such as Rattus tunneyi (pale field rat) and Melomys burtoni (grassland mosaic-tailed rat). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators.

50|$|Honey is {{emerging}} {{as one of the}} leading export products of Nepal and has a growing market. Nepal produces 864 metric tons of honey. Honey from the hill mountain region offers an exotic taste. Beekeeping in Nepal is regarded as a very rewarding occupation for many people. Nepal is host to five species of honeybee, but only the Asian hive bee (Ampis cerana) and the <b>European</b> <b>honeybee</b> (Apis mellifera) are kept in hives to manage for honey production. Communities who do not practice traditional beekeeping techniques called ‘honey hunters’, collect honey from the nests of wild species. Wild (organic) honey produced by Apis dorsata contains large amounts of enzymes and amino acids, attributing a good price in international markets.|$|E

40|$|Pathogens and parasites {{represent}} significant {{threats to}} {{the health and well-being of}} honeybee species that are key pollinators of agricultural crops and flowers worldwide. We conducted a nationwide survey to determine the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens and parasites in Asian honeybees, Apis cerana, in China. Our study provides evidence of infections of A. cerana by pathogenic Deformed wing virus (DWV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Nosema ceranae, and C. bombi species that have been linked to population declines of <b>European</b> <b>honeybees,</b> A. mellifera, and bumble bees. However, the prevalence of DWV, a virus that causes widespread infection in A. mellifera, was low, arguably a result of the greater ability of A. cerana to resist the ectoprasitic mite Varroa destructor, an efficient vector of DWV. Analyses of microbial communities from the A. cerana digestive tract showed that Nosema infection could have detrimental effects on the gut microbiota. Workers infected by N. ceranae tended to have lower bacterial quantities, with these differences being significant for the Bifidobacterium and Pasteurellaceae bacteria groups.

5000|$|Beekeepers in Japan {{attempted}} to introduce <b>European</b> <b>honeybees</b> (Apis mellifera) {{for the sake}} of their high productivity. <b>European</b> <b>honeybees</b> have no innate defense against the hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies.Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the uncoordinated defenses of a honeybee colony, the Japanese honeybee (Apis cerana japonica) has an effective strategy. When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honeybee hive, she emits specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the Japanese honeybees detect these pheromones, a hundred or so gather near the entrance of the nest and set up a trap, keeping the entrance open. This permits the hornet to enter the hive. As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles {{in much the same way}} as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of [...] In addition, the exertions of the honeybees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ball. At that concentration of CO2, they can tolerate up to , but the hornet cannot survive the combination of high a temperature and high carbon dioxide level. Some bees do die along with the intruder, much as happens when they attack other intruders with their stings, but by killing the hornet scout, they prevent it from summoning reinforcements that would wipe out the entire colony.|$|R
