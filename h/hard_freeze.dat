25|$|The 1993 Superstorm brought {{blizzard}} {{conditions to}} the panhandle, while heavy rain and tornadoes beset the peninsula. The storm {{is believed to}} have been similar in composition to a hurricane, some Gulf coast regions even seeing storm surges of six feet or more. More recently, traces of snow and sleet fell across central and southern Florida during a <b>hard</b> <b>freeze</b> event in January, 2010. There was some slight accumulation north of the I-4 corridor, mostly in the form of sleet.|$|E
25|$|As Chardonnay buds early, it can {{be highly}} {{susceptible}} to spring time frost. However, it is a relatively hardy vine that can sustain cold winter temperatures unless they become extreme such as the <b>hard</b> <b>freeze</b> that devastated the 1985 vintage with temperatures dropping to -27°C (-16.6°F) in the winter, killing off {{a large portion of}} vines. As both Pinot noir and Chardonnay were affected on the hill of Corton, one long lasting result of this vintage is that the cépage of many lieu-dits on the hill changed with some producers replanting their previously Chardonnay vineyards with Pinot noir to make Corton AOC and vice versa. Also many new clones and rootstocks were introduced.|$|E

2500|$|The Linton {{settlers}} {{began to}} achieve success, with truck farming of winter vegetables {{for the northern}} market. A <b>hard</b> <b>freeze</b> in 1898 was a setback, {{and many of the}} settlers left, including William Linton. Partly in an attempt to change the community's luck, or to leave behind a bad reputation, the settlement's name was changed in 1901 to Delray, after the Detroit neighborhood of Delray ("Delray" [...] being the anglicized spelling of [...] "Del Rey", which is Spanish for [...] "of the king"), which in turn was named after the Mexican-American War's Battle of Molino del Rey.|$|E

The most widespread snowfall in Florida history occurred on January 19, 1977, when snow fell over much of the state, with flurries as far south as Homestead. Snow flurries also fell on Miami Beach for the only time in recorded history. A <b>hard</b> <b>freeze</b> in 2003 brought [...] "ocean-effect" [...] snow flurries to the Atlantic coast as far south as Cape Canaveral.|$|E

2500|$|Several events {{caused the}} {{downfall}} of the local sugarcane business. Sugarcane required an enormous amount of manual labor to cut and load into wagons. Since the local population could not meet the demand for workers, the planters leased convicts from the Texas penitentiary system. In 1898 about 700 prisoners were harvesting sugarcane. Mutinies among the convict crews occurred because of the harsh conditions in the cane fields. Molasses imported from abroad and sugar beets grown in the United States proved to be cheaper to convert into sugar. In 1910 the Texas legislature passed a law forbidding the leasing of convicts on humanitarian grounds. In December 1911 there was a <b>hard</b> <b>freeze</b> which destroyed half of the sugarcane crop. The Lakeside sugarcane refinery closed in 1911 and in 1918 its machinery was sold to a producer in Jamaica. By the 1920s the local sugarcane crop dwindled to insignificance.|$|E
2500|$|Muscadet {{is a white}} French wine. It is made at {{the western}} end of the Loire Valley, near the city of Nantes in the Pays de la Loire region {{neighboring}} the Brittany Region. More Muscadet is produced than any other Loire wine. It is made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape, often referred to simply as melon. As a rule in France, Appellation d'origine contrôlée wines are named either after their growing region or after their variety (the latter in Alsace only). The name Muscadet is therefore an exception. The name seems to refer to a characteristic of the wine produced by the melon grape variety: vin qui a un goût musqué - 'wine with a musk-like taste,' though wine expert Tom Stevenson notes that Muscadet wines do not have much, if any, [...] "muskiness" [...] or Muscat-like flavors or aromas. The sole variety used to produce Muscadet, Melon de Bourgogne, was initially planted in the region sometime in or before the 17th century. It became dominant after a <b>hard</b> <b>freeze</b> in 1709 killed most of the region's vines. Dutch traders who were major actors in the local wine trade encouraged the planting of this variety and distilled much of the wine produced into eau de vie for sale in Northern Europe.|$|E

50|$|The {{climatology}} of Florida {{varies from}} region to region {{due to its}} proximity to the equator. From central Florida to the Georgia border, the climate is generally humid subtropical, while South Florida fosters a tropical climate. The end of spring to mid-fall {{is characterized by a}} significant rainy season, subjecting Florida to hurricanes, thunderstorms, and tropical cyclones. The winter and spring is significantly drier, leading to brushfires and strict no-fire laws. While very uncommon, snow has been recorded in northern Florida; orange groves are damaged by <b>hard</b> <b>freezes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Located in {{southwest}} Florida on the Gulf Coast, the weather usually stays relatively mild. In the summer, {{it is common}} for temperatures to reach the low to mid-90s, however, this is tempered by sea breezes from the Gulf. At night in the summer, temperatures quickly drop to the low to mid 70s. In the winter, <b>hard</b> <b>freezes</b> are extremely rare. It is more common to have frost on the ground briefly in pre-dawn hours in the winter season, however it quickly melts shortly after sunrise. Temperatures average 50 - 70 degrees during the winter.|$|R
50|$|Some {{plants are}} {{considered}} weeds by some farmers and crops by others. Charlock, a common weed {{in the southeastern}} US, are weeds according to row crop growers, but are valued by beekeepers, who seek out places where it blooms all winter, thus providing pollen for honeybees and other pollinators. Its bloom resists all but a very <b>hard</b> <b>freeze,</b> and recovers once the freeze ends.|$|E

50|$|A <b>hard</b> <b>freeze</b> in 1895 devastated most of {{the small}} {{pineapple}} plantations. Two fires, in 1908 and 1910, destroyed most of Jensen Beach and its remaining pineapple farms.

The pineapple has become a symbol of Jensen Beach. The fruit legacy is celebrated annually during the Jensen Beach Pineapple Festival.|$|E
50|$|People can {{stock up}} on food, water, and other necessities before a cold wave. Some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates, at least during the winter. Suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for {{livestock}}, and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered. Smudge pots can bring smoke that prevents <b>hard</b> <b>freezes</b> on a farm or grove. Vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding air.|$|R
50|$|T. cyanocrocus is hardy in USDA Zones 9-10; in {{essentially}} frost-free mild climate areas (e.g. New Zealand, Ireland, much {{of northern}} California) Tecophilaea cyanocrocus may be successfully grown in open rock gardens {{exposed to the}} weather. However, tecophilaea is somewhat frost-tender and cannot withstand <b>hard</b> <b>freezes.</b> Where winter freezes may occur, such as the Pacific Northwest, tecophilaea is best grown in containers that can be protected from very cold weather.

5000|$|There {{were two}} freezes in Florida during this catastrophic season, {{the first in}} December 1894 and the second in February 1895.

So, when the second, <b>harder</b> <b>freeze</b> came a few months later, the effects were even more devastating.
