25|$|The {{refusal of}} Hadrian II to ordain a {{candidate}} approved by Boris exhausted {{the patience of}} the Bulgarian prince. After a three-month stay in Bulgaria Silvester returned to Rome with {{a letter to the}} Pope in which for the last time Boris I insisted that either Formosus or Marinus be ordained, but the Pope declined the proposal once again. During that time the Bulgarian ruler had already started negotiations with the Patriarch of Constantinople Ignatius, who was trying to improve the relations with Rome, which had been strained after the mutual anathemas made in 863 by his predecessor Photios I and Pope Nicolas <b>I.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> Photios, however, Ignatius did not want to allow a permanent establishment of the Roman Church in Bulgaria. In order to settle {{the differences between the two}} Churches, the Eighth Ecumenical Council was planned to be held in Constantinople in 869. After a long stay in Rome (868–869), Peter returned to Bulgaria and was immediately sent to participate in the council.|$|E

Montgomery commented on how simple the song's video was but noted that wasn't a negative, he commented, [...] "like {{pretty much everything}} 3OH!3 do, there's an undeniable charm to both the song and the video.

500|$|A finalist in {{the same}} talent quest was seven-year-old Tommy Dawes, who Appleroth chose to appear as the [...] "whistling boy" [...] {{on the front of}} the jelly packets and advertising. According to Dawes, as a finalist he {{received}} 10 guineas and an onyx inkstand, but has received no other compensation for the use of his image or his recorded version of the jingle. Dawes said, [...] "It was absolutely fantastic; I loved seeing my picture and singing the song and all my friends were very impressed...

500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in your life that ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

The song was originally recorded on the Tour Bus in Europe in 2010, {{and was later}} remixed at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California by Trevor Muzzy. Gaga said that the song was inspired {{after a night of}} partying at the Laboratory nightclub in Berlin, Germany. The next day, she wrote [...] "Scheiße", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song is really about wanting to be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along with. Anything that gets in your way from being brave.

[...] In Fall 2008 Mullen left the church, joining a group of Chanology protesters across the street. Church of Scientology Manhattan President John Carmichael issued a response the following week, stating [...] "Mandy Mullen's story about Scientology... is all lies {{in the service of}} Anonymous, a hate group that targets our Church, or even anyone who just falls onto their radar." [...] On November 13, 2009, Independent Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used parliamentary privilege to accuse the Church of Scientology of being a criminal organisation.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> to dance and I know when I like what I see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E
500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence.

Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I will be in the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left." [...] Goodman described the couch gag as [...] "lovely".|$|E
