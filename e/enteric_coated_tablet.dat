40|$|Introduction: Rabeprazole, {{a member}} of {{substituted}} benzimidazoles, inhibits the final step in gastric acid secretions. This drug claims to cause fastest acid separation (due to higher pKa), and more rapidly converts to the active species to aid gastric mucin synthesis. The most significant pharmacological action of Rabeprazole is dose dependent suppression of gastric acid secretion; without anticholinergic or H 2 -blocking action. It completely abolishes the hydrochloric acid secretion as it is powerful inhibitor of gastric acid. Rabeprazole is acid labile and hence commonly formulated as an <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablet.</b> The absorption of rabeprazole occurs rapidly as soon as tablet leaves the stomach. Aim: In the present study {{an attempt was made}} to formulate and evaluate Rabeprazole sustained release matrix tablet using wet granulation technique incorporating various polymers like HPMC-E 15, Carbopol 934, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Materials and Methods: The Formulated tablets were evaluated for different physicochemical properties like rheological properties, weight variation, thickness, hardness, % friability, in vitro release studies and drug content. Results: Studies revealed that all the physicochemical parameters comply with the official standards. The in vitro release studies exhibits the release up to 90 %, over a prolonged period of time which confirms the extended release profile of formulation, having better bioavailability as well as decreased dosing frequency with reduced doses.

DS microcapsules were successfully prepared using a system of ethylcellulose (EC) -toluene-petroleum ether. The system was optimized by {{the construction of the}} phase diagram and determination of the amount of EC precipitated under different solvent:non-solvent ratios to determine the most appropriate conditions for preparing good microcapsules. Microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and lactose were mixed with DS powder and converted into spherical cores by the wet agglomeration technique which facilitated coacervation and formation of thin and uniform microcapsule walls. Diethylphthalate (DEP) and Polyethyleneglycol 600 (PEG) in different concentrations (20 or 40 % w/w) were used as plasticizers to impart better elasticity to the microcapsules. The microcapsules were evaluated for DS released against crushed commercial DS <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablet</b> (Voltaren). The prepared microcapsules were taste evaluated by a taste panel of 10 volunteers. The results revealed that the optimum solvent:non-solvent ratio required for microcapsule formation was 1 : 2. Microcapsules containing PEG 20 % or DEP 40 % showed a faster rate of DS release compared to that obtained from other microcapsules and crushed commercial enteric coated tablets (Voltaren). The palatability and the taste of DS were significantly improved by microencapsulation. The extent of taste masking was influenced by the microcapsule core:wall ratio, the presence of additives within the core, the type and concentration of plasticizer and initial core size.

The disperse forms release the active substance more uniformly and behave in this aspect more like slow or extended release products.

Accordingly, appropriate pharmaceutical development is needed to maximize absorption of the protein fraction in the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo stability assays were performed to study {{the stability of the}} {{bioactive protein}} fraction in gastric conditions. The bioactive protein fraction DLBS 1033 was found to be unstable at low pH and in gastric fluid. The “enteric coating” formulation showed no leakage in gastric fluid–like medium and possessed a good release profile in simulated intestinal medium. DLBS 1033 was absorbed through the small intestine in an intact protein form, confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) analysis. This result confirmed that an enteric coating formula using methacrylic acid copolymer could protect DLBS 1033 from the acidic condition of the stomach by preventing the release of DLBS 1033 in the stomach, while promoting its release when reaching the intestine. From the blood concentration–versus-time curve, 99 mTc-DLBS 1033 showed a circulation half-life of 70 minutes. This relatively long biological half-life supports its function as a thrombolytic protein. Thus, an enteric delivery system is considered the best approach for DLBS 1033 as an oral thrombolytic agent.

40|$|Controlled and {{localized}} {{release of}} drugs in the intestine {{can be achieved by}} <b>enteric</b> <b>coating.</b> The design of enteric-coated tablets has so far remained empirical, {{in part because of the}} lack of a quantitative description of the drug release kinetics. In this paper, a mathematical model is presented that describes the dissolution of the polymer coating and release kinetics of weakly acidic drugs from enteric-coated tablets in buffered media. This model can also be used to predict the time of onset of core disintegration. The model assumes that the release rate is limited by diffusion, and furthermore, all the reactions are considered as reversible and instantaneous. Dissolution and reaction are assumed to take place in the polymer layer and a hypothetical stagnant liquid film adjacent to the polymer layer (the classical film theory approach). The dissolution of the <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> is found to depend on the intrinsic solubilities and p K a 's of the drug and polymer and the medium properties. The release rate of the drug is found to depend on the intrinsic solubilities and p K a 's of drug and polymer, the medium properties, i. e., pH and buffer capacity, and a mass transfer coefficient.

The release profiles of the reported method revealed that okra mucilage, when used as a matrix tablet, does not protect the drug from being released in the upper parts of the gastro intestinal tract. In the present work the tablets were prepared with okra mucilage and <b>coated</b> with <b>enteric</b> materials to retard the drug release in the upper GI tract. Okra polysaccharide was isolated from Abelmoschus esculentus and used for tablet formulation with ibuprofen as model drug. The matrix tablets of okra polysaccharide were prepared by wet granulation method using ibuprofen as a model drug. These prepared matrix <b>tablets</b> were <b>coated</b> with <b>enteric</b> materials by pan coating technique. The in vitro release profile was performed with and without rat cecal content, revealed that the <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> formulations completely protected the drug from being released in the upper parts of the gastro intestinal tract. Among the <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets,</b> the 3 % double layer <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> exhibited zero in vitro release profiles at 2 nd and 5 th hours. Hence, this tablet was subjected for further pharmacokinetic estimations and was compared with control tablet. At 5. 5 h the ibuprofen appeared first in the blood; this showed the tablet was intact throughout the upper GI. The Tmax and AUC estimates showed that the drug {{was released from the}} tablet to colon by bacterial degradation of mucilage. This article can be downloaded from www. ijpbs. ne...|$|R
40|$|Aspirin {{is apt to}} hydrolyze. In {{order to}} improve its stability, a new method has been {{developed}} involving the application of hot-melt sub- and outercoating combined with <b>enteric</b> aqueous <b>coating.</b> The main aim {{was to investigate the}} influence of these factors on the stability of ASA and understand how they work. Satisfactory storage stability were obtained when the aspirin <b>tablet</b> core <b>coated</b> with Eudragit L 30 D 55 film was combined with glycerin monostearate (GMS) as an outercoat. Hygroscopicity testing indicated that the moisture penetrating into the tablet may result in a significant change in the physical properties of the coating film observed by scanning electron microscopy. Investigation of the compatibility between the drug and film excipients shows that the talc and methacrylic acid had a significant catalytic effect on ASA. A hypothesis was proposed that the hydrolysis of ASA <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> (ASA-ECT) was mostly concentrated in the internal film and the interfaces between the film and tablet core. In conclusion, hot-melt coating technology is an alternative to subcoating or outercoating. Also, GMS sub-coating was a better choice for forming a stable barrier between the tablet core and the polymer coating layer, and increases the structure and chemical stability...|$|R

Mucoadhesive <b>tablets</b> are <b>coated</b> with respective polymer and prepared them <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> by <b>coated</b> with Eudragit L 100. Tablets were evaluated in three mediums like 0. 1 N HCl for 2 hr, pH 6. 5 phosphate buffer solution for 10 hr. and 7. 8 phosphate buffer solution for 12 hr. Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose showed above 90 % release for 10 hr. where carbopol 934 p provided slow release 100 % {{over a period of}} 12 hr. but Ethyl cellulose containing tablets showed less than 68 % release and release was diffusion and erosion controlled and followed Zero order kinetics. Thus, the present study concluded that, Carbopol 934 p containing mucoadhesive tablets of Omeprazole pellets and Di-Omeprazole magnesium powder can be used for local action in the intestine as well as for Ora...|$|R
40|$|Tanacetum parthenium (feverfew) is an herb that is commercialized {{worldwide}} as {{a therapeutic}} treatment for migraine. Its pharmacological effect is mainly {{due to the}} presence of the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide as well as of flavonoids. So far, there are no studies on standardization of pre-formulations or phytomedicines containing this herb. The present study aimed at developing a pre-formulation using a standardized spray-dried extract of feverfew and further designing and standardizing <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets.</b> In this work, the spray-dried extract of feverfew was evaluated for its parthenolide, santin and total flavonoid content, parthenolide solubility, particle size, tapped density, hygroscopicity, angle of repose and moisture content. Tablets containing the spray-dried extract were tested for their average weight, friability, hardness, and disintegration time. The total flavonoid and parthenolide contents in the spray-dried extract were 1. 31 % and 0. 76 % w/w, respectively. The spray-dried extract presented consistent pharmacotechnical properties and allowed its tableting by direct compression. Tablet properties were in accordance with the proposed specifications. The procedures described herein can be used to prepare and evaluate pre-formulations of feverfew with adequate properties {{for the development of a}} high-quality phytomedicine...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Tinidazole {{is used in}} {{treatment}} of amoebiasis and other protozoal infections in doses of 2. 0 g/ day (60 mg/kg) for three days. In the present paper, controlled release formulation of tinidazole was developed with an objective to achieve colon specific drug delivery with reduced frequency of dosing, to minimize gastric side effects and thus to increase patient compliance. Methods: Matrix systems of tinidazole (500 mg) were prepared by using swellable and pH dependent polymers like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K 4 M and K 15 M) and eudragit (eudragit L- 100 and S- 100). Prepared <b>tablets</b> were <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> in order to overcome variability in gastric emptying time and delay in the release, to reduce gastric side effects and to provide prolonged localized action in colon. Process of manufacture was optimized during the scale up studies. Bioavailability study (using parallel group design) was carried of on conventional marketed, developed uncoated and <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> in healthy human volunteers. Results: Bioavailability study showed that greater portion of tinidazole was released in the large intestine and drug level in plasma was above 4 mg/mL in blood for 24 hours. Conclusion: From {{the results of this}} study it appears that, the proposed single <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> tinidazole (500 mg) tablet per day could be used in place of 3 - 4 doses of 500 mg tinidazole conventional tablet with better control of drug release for targeted drug delivery. In addition developed colon-specific drug delivery system (CDDS) was relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture using conventional pharmaceutical coating technique...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{bioavailability}} of well permeable drugs administered as single-unit {{modified release}} tablet is markedly {{dependent on the}} gastric emptying time of such tablet, especially when taken in fasted stomach state. The influence of pH on drug release can be evaluated in vitro. On the other hand, the vector of tablets gastric emptying times is a random variable and can be generated from Weibull distribution function [1, 2]. The purpose {{was to develop a}} link model consisting of the kinetics of drug release and the kinetics of gastric emptying of tablets under fasting conditions. With such model an in vivo drug release can be predicted. Methods: In vitro release experiments were performed on <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> Voltaren <b>tablets</b> containing 50 mg of diclofenac sodium (Novartis Farma, Italy) using paddle method (USP Apparatus 2). The tablets were placed into simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH = 1), which was replaced by simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH = 6. 8) after 2, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150, or 200 minutes in order to mimic several gastric residence times. The amount of diclofenac released was measured in 10 minutes intervals. Each in vitro experiment was performed in triplicates, resulting in total 30 diclofenac release profiles. Due to <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> and low diclofenac solubility in acid medium, the diclofenac release in SGF was extremely limited, whereas in SIF the release was rapid and complete. Modelling of diclofenac release data was performed in NONMEM IV. Results: Thediclofenac release data were described by the Weibull model with lag-time and inter-tablet variability on all model parameters. Additionally, a linear relationship between the tablets gastric residence time and the variability inlag-time parameter of the Weibull model was found to adequately describe a link between in vitro diclofenac release and gastric residence time. On the basis of Weibull distribution function with values of 70. 2 min for shape parameter and 1. 4 for scale parameter, 100 individual tablets gastric emptying times were generated in R environment. The shape and scale parameter values were previously estimated {{on the basis of the}} data collected from several studies evaluating the gastric emptying of tablets in healthy subjects under fasting conditions [1]. The generated tablets gastric emptying times were applied to the developed link model using NONMEM simulation step. The results consisted of 100 individual predicted in vivo release profiles. Additionally, the mean predicted in vivo diclofenac release profile was compared to the in vivo diclofenac absorption profile obtained by deconvolution of mean diclofenac plasma concentration profile. Conclusions: The link between diclofenac release from <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> and tablets gastric emptying time was estimated allowing prediction of in vivo diclofenac release profiles. Additionally, a good correlation between the mean predicted in vivo release profile and mean absorption profile was established...|$|R

Micromeritics properties: bulk density (BD) and tapped density (TD), compressibility index (Carr’s index), Hauser’s ratio (H), and sieve analysis were performed {{in order to determine the}} best excipients to be used in the formulation development of omeprazole magnesium <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> <b>tablets.</b> Results show that omeprazole magnesium has fair flow and compressibility properties (BD 0. 4 [*]g/mL, TD 0. 485 [*]g/mL, Carr’s index 17. 5 %, Hauser’s ratio 1. 2, and sieve analysis time 5 minutes). There were no significant drug excipient interactions except change in colour in all three conditions in the mixture of omeprazole and aerosil 200. Moisture content loss on drying in all three conditions was not constant and the changes were attributed to surrounding environment during the test time. Changes in the absorption spectra were noted in the mixture of omeprazole and water aerosil only in the visible region of 350 – 2500 [*]nm. Omeprazole magnesium alone and with all excipients showed no significant changes in omeprazole concentration for a 30 -day period.
