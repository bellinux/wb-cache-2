25|$|Direct reuse projects. According to one estimate, 1,500 ha were {{irrigated}} with reclaimed {{water in}} the vicinity of treatment plants as of 2009 in 15 locations, of which the biggest are near As-Samra (510 ha), Aqaba (208 ha), Ramtha (121 ha) and Wadi Musa (107 ha). Crops irrigated are forage crops and tree crops. One of the first pilot projects for direct reuse was implemented in Wadi Musa with support from USAID. Water was first used to irrigate a <b>demonstration</b> <b>farm,</b> and then the fields of nearby farmers. Another pilot project was initiated using wastewater from the small Wadi Hassan treatment plant to irrigate green spaces {{on the campus of the}} University of Irbid, and commercial fruit plantations. In most cases of direct reuse, the Water Authority of Jordan, the operator of most municipal wastewater treatment plants in Jordan, has concluded contracts with farmers. The total area irrigated under contracts with WAJ is 760 ha, or about half the total irrigated area. It is thus about 12 times smaller than the area irrigated with indirectly reclaimed water from the As-Samra plant in the Jordan Valley.|$|E

2500|$|The American Revolution, 1775–1783, and its {{attendant}} food decline resulted in 3100hectares cleared in Newfoundland. In the early 19th century Irish immigrants began arriving who cultivated the land in Newfoundland. [...] A {{very small percentage of}} the land is suitable in Newfoundland and Labrador for horticultural or crop production because {{there is a lot of}} forested and tundra geography. The province has some dairy production and farming concerns. Following World War II, farm training was available at the Government <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Farm.</b> Bonuses were paid for such things as the purchase of pure-bred sires, land clearing, and agriculture exhibition assistance to name a few. The industry of fish processing for food is the largest agricultural contribution from Newfoundland. Newfoundland fisheries, supply cod for the most part, followed closely by herring, haddock, lobster, rose fish, seals, and whales. The fishing industry depends very heavily upon exports and world conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Wheat was the {{dominant}} crop and the tall grain elevator alongside the railway tracks became a crucial {{element of the}} Albertan grain trade after 1890. It boosted [...] "King Wheat" [...] to regional dominance by integrating the province's economy {{with the rest of}} Canada. Used to efficiently load grain into railroad cars, grain elevators came to be clustered in [...] "lines" [...] and their ownership tended to concentrate in the hands of increasingly fewer companies, many controlled by Americans. The main commercial entities involved in the trade were the Canadian Pacific Railway and the powerful grain syndicates. Many newcomers were unfamiliar with the dry farming techniques need to handle a wheat crop, so The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) set up a <b>demonstration</b> <b>farm</b> at Strathmore, in 1908. It sold irrigable land and advised settlers in the best farming and irrigation methods. Dramatic changes in the Albertan grain trade took place in the 1940s, notably the amalgamation of grain elevator companies.|$|E
