25|$|In October 2013, Somalia's federal Cabinet {{endorsed}} {{an agreement}} with the Turkish firm Al-Bayrak to manage the Port of Mogadishu for a 20-year period. According to the Prime Minister's Office, the deal was secured by the Ministry of Ports and Public Works, and also assigns Al-Bayrak responsibility for rebuilding and modernizing the port. In September 2014, the Federal Government of Somalia officially <b>delegated</b> <b>management</b> of the Mogadishu Port to Al-Bayrak. The Turkish company's head Ahmed Salim indicated that {{under the terms of the}} agreement, 55% of revenue generated at the seaport will go to the Somalian authorities and the remaining 45% is earmarked for the firm. The majority of Al-Bayrak's revenue share will in turn be re-invested in the seaport through additional port-based trade and new docks, construction materials and machinery. According to Somalia's Minister for Transports and Seaport Yussuf Maolim Amin, the management transfer is expected to double the federal authorities' income from the Port. Al-Bayrak's modernization project will cost $80 million.|$|E

50|$|The typical form of <b>delegated</b> <b>management</b> (Gestion Déléguée) {{from the}} public {{to the private sector}} is through a lease {{contract}} (Affermage) or a concession contract. A lease contract is of shorter duration (10-15 years) and the responsibility to finance most of the infrastructure remains with the municipality. A concession contract is of longer duration (20-30 years) and the Concessionnaire is in charge of mobilizing financial resources. In both cases, the municipality or the Intermunicipal utility fixes the water and sanitation tariff and remains the owner of the infrastructure. Other forms of <b>delegated</b> <b>management</b> include the Régie intéressée and the Gérance, less common forms of private sector participation under which the private sector takes less risks.|$|E

50|$|Attempts by Soviet {{authorities}} {{to influence the}} activities of scientific institutions affected Lipsky's fate too. In order to examine {{the work of the}} Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, a commission of the Ukrainian People's Commissariat of Education was formed. In its findings the commission accused the management of the Academy, and first of all the Presidium headed by Lipsky, of failure to comply with Soviet laws, and charged them with political violations. The commission suggested immediate re-election of the President of the Academy, rerunning the procedure of confirming membership in the Academy, and establishing a rigid structure and personnel pool for the Academy. Communist Party leaders thought Vladimir Lipsky to be a 'politically inert' President, who <b>delegated</b> <b>management</b> of the Academy to Serhiy Yefremov and Ahatanhel Krymsky. In 1928 Vladimir sent in his resignation from the position of the President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a selective {{review of the}} theoretical literature on <b>delegated</b> portfolio <b>management</b> as a principal-agent relationship. The main focus of the paper is to review the analytical {{issues raised by the}} peculiar nature of the <b>delegated</b> portfolio <b>management</b> relationship within the broader class of principal-agent models. In particular, the paper discusses the performance of linear versus nonlinear compensation contracts in a single-period setting, the possible effects of limited liability of portfolio managers, the role of reputational concerns in a multiperiod framework, and the incentives to noise trading. In addition, the paper deals with some general equilibrium dimensions and asset pricing implications of <b>delegated</b> portfolio <b>management.</b> The paper also suggests some directions for future research.
