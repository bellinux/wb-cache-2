5|$|Actinium oxide (Ac2O3) can be {{obtained}} by <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> hydroxide at 500°C or the oxalate at 1100°C, in vacuum. Its crystal lattice is isotypic with the oxides of most trivalent rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. <b>Heating</b> <b>the</b> nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. <b>Heating</b> <b>the</b> product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E

40|$|The system {{eliminates}} {{the necessity of}} shielding an aircraft airframe constructed of material such as aluminum. Cooling is accomplished by passing a coolant through the aircraft airframe, the coolant acting as a carrier to remove <b>heat</b> from <b>the</b> airframe. The coolant is circulated through a heat pump and a heat exchanger which together extract essentially all of <b>the</b> added <b>heat</b> from <b>the</b> coolant. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> is transferred to the aircraft fuel system via <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger and <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> pump. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> extracted from <b>the</b> coolant is utilized to power <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> pump. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> pump has associated therewith power turbine mechanism which is also driven by <b>the</b> extracted <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> power turbines are utilized to drive various aircraft subsystems, the compressor of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> pump, and provide engine cooling...|$|R

These elements are heated by electric current. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> is then transferred into the mold by convection. As <b>the</b> electrical energy <b>heats</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> elements that then <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> mold in a secondary manner, the process is called indirect resistance heating.|$|R
5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} americium chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum {{which is similar to}} that of AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium. <b>Heating</b> <b>the</b> Am(IV) solution to 90°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin {{received}} {{samples of}} crocoite ore. He produced chromium trioxide (CrO3) by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid. In 1798, Vauquelin {{discovered that he}} could isolate metallic chromium by <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> oxide in a charcoal oven, {{for which he is}} credited as the discoverer of the element. Vauquelin was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones, such as ruby or emerald.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to tidal <b>heating,</b> <b>the</b> interior of Europa {{could also be}} heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle. But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone, thus implying that tidal heating has {{a leading role in}} Europa.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} save energy, the Volt will {{sometimes}} heat the seats instead of blowing heated air through HVAC system, as <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's cabin draws significant power, and can even exceed {{what is needed to}} move the vehicle on occasions. A power-saving stereo system uses amplifiers that switch on and off rapidly to save power. It uses 50 percent less energy.

5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is insoluble {{in water}} {{and can be used}} as a qualitative test for the presence of La3+. The heavier halides are all very soluble deliquescent compounds.

5|$|Polonium shows {{nonmetallic}} {{character in}} its halides, {{and by the}} existence of polonides. The halides have properties generally characteristic of nonmetal halides (being volatile, easily hydrolyzed, and soluble in organic solvents). Many metal polonides, obtained by <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> elements together at 500–1,000°C, and containing the Po2− anion, are also known.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> steel {{to create}} the austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of such transients are also {{closely related to the}} formation of the Icelandic and Aleutian Low — the two most prominent general circulation features in the mid- to sub-polar northern latitudes.

5|$|Unlike the nitrate, the oxide {{is similar}} to the {{corresponding}} samarium salt and not the neodymium salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure. This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600°C. Further annealing at 800°C and then at 1750°C irreversibly transforms it to a monoclinic and hexagonal phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is {{separated}} from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam. In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium-mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb3+. The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by <b>heating.</b> <b>The</b> oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum, aluminium, cerium or zirconium in high vacuum.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, and only then did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal <b>heating.</b> <b>The</b> wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.|$|E
