40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} mapping and monitoring ecological quality and environmental change using an ecological evaluation model (EEM), {{which is based on}} remote sensing data of the Pearl River Delta region in Guangdong, China. Five <b>geographical</b> <b>indices</b> were selected: Impervious Surface, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Land Surface Temperature, and Greenness and Brightness generated from the Tasseled Cap Transformation. These <b>geographical</b> <b>indices</b> are of ecological significance and they were used as variables to build the EEM through factor analysis. In addition, land use maps derived from remote sensing data were overlaid on these five index maps to analyze the effects of land use change on ecological status. Based on the EEM values, five levels of ecological zones were identified using a standarddeviation segmenting method. The results showed that the areas of the first and second levels decreased significantly, those of the third and fourth levels increased, and the area of the fifth level remained unchanged. It was established that the remote sensing method is practical for the analysis of ecological change, thus this work could be considered a case study for other ecological monitoring research...|$|R

40|$|In part 1 we have {{discussed}} {{the role played by}} geographical and historical conditions. Here we wish to test our model and to estimate its parameters. Ti this effect two indexes are introduced. The <b>geographical</b> <b>index</b> is aimed at characterizing the degree of separateness of a given region with respect to the national state to which it belongs. This index turns out to be closely connected to the number of minority-speakers; it is also correlated with the level of separatist disturbances, at least for samples having the same historical background. The purpose of the second index is precisely to specify the role of past episodes in shaping current separatist outbreaks. To a large extent, current episodes are modeled on former ones; typically this process of semi-replication appears to be characterized by a "memory" that extends over at least one and a half century. Note that this study concentrates on the occurrence and forms of separatist struggles rather than on their short-term political causes. In so doing, it follows a methodological track that has been pioneered by Stanley Lieberson (1985, the "stardom" paradigm) and Charles Tilly (1993, the "traffic jam" paradigm).

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis {{selected}} bibliography on {{the migration of}} women in Latin America and the Caribbean in search of work forms part of {{the activities of the}} ECLAC/GTZ project "Gender oriented labour market policy", whose main objective is to promote the implementation of measures in favour of equality in employment and labour market policies. In recent decades, a large number of the region's inhabitants have emigrated to more economically developed countries. More recently still, we have seen the phenomenon of intraregional migration flows, which, from the 1980 s onwards, have increasingly come to be dominated by women. This {{selected bibliography}} on the international migration of the region's women in search of work focuses on the labour market, {{which is one of the}} spheres where inequality and discrimination affecting women is most starkly on display. Women's migration differs from that of men in terms of its features and implications; for instance, women find themselves confined to precarious jobs characterized by a high degree of exploitation, such as sex work and domestic service, and are more vulnerable during the migration process, especially where trafficking in persons is involved. The increasing feminization of migration processes and the ensuing policy challenges for both countries of origin and destination make analysis from a gender perspective imperative, and call for it to be considered in public-policy making. This bibliography seeks to set out methodically the information available on the subject and facilitate access to it. The documents selected, their methodical arrangement and analysis reveal the current state of the literature, their contributions and subjects of interest; however, they also point to gaps and challenges for future research projects and, crucially, for the adoption of public policies that respect the women migrants' rights. Three indexes are included to make consultation easier: an alphabetical index of authors, a subject index and a <b>geographical</b> <b>index.</b> In addition, three lists are provided giving access to new sources of information on related international agreements, central national instruments and web sites of interest...|$|E
40|$|This study {{calls for}} a re-evaluation of {{contemporary}} regionalist literary theory. It argues that traditional models of the discourse have been too heavily influenced by nineteenth century realist aesthetics and political ideologies. Because most scholars continue to interpret regionalist texts according to a resolutely empirical reading of geography, literary regionalism has fallen {{out of touch with}} the new kinds of "unrealistic," generic landscapes that now dominate North American culture in the postindustrial era. Drawing heavily on recent work by postmodern geographers such as Edward Soja, David Harvey, Michael Dear and Derek Gregory, this project updates regionalist theory by "re-placing" the artificially stabilized reading of geography that dominated the nineteenth century with a more self-consciously spatialized reading of what Soja calls our contemporary "real-and-imagined" places. By grafting together traditional regionalism and postmodern spatial theory we improve on both contributing discourses. In a "postmodern-regionalist" literary criticism, traditional regionalism sheds its reputation for theoretical naivete, while the elusive abstractions of postmodern theory gain a real-world referent, and a specific <b>geographical</b> <b>index.</b> When we "read postmodernism regionally" - - when we aggressively interrogate where this kind of fiction comes from and the places it represents - - we realize that the canons of postmodern fiction in Canada and the United States have been influenced by two very different spatial epistemologies. Rather than being "determined" by their real geographies, Canadian and American postmodernism have been more directly influenced by two different readings of geography. Works by Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, and Don DeLillo demonstrate that American postmodernism often interprets social space according to what Henri Lefebvre calls the idealistic "the illusion of transparency," while texts by Canadian postmodernists such as Robert Kroetsch, Wayne Johnston and Guy Vanderhaeghe tend to fall under Lefebvre's more materialistic "illusion of opacity. " The ambiguous figure of Douglas Coupland - - a Canadian writer most critics treat as an American - - puts the spatial conventions of postmodernism in both countries in sharp relief. In an American postmodernism, dominated by generic suburban settings, regions will almost always be seen as imaginary projections, while in a Canadian postmodernism, dominated by the Prairies, regions will almost always retain some sense of their material reality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Geographical {{information}} {{exists in}} multiple forms such as cartographical maps, images, and texts. Effective retrieval systems for geographical information are currently studied by both geospatial information scientists and library/information scientists. The two groups take quite different approaches which have rarely been explicitly compared and connected. This paper discusses {{the advantages and}} limitations of current geographical information retrieval (GIR) and textual information retrieval (IR) systems in dealing with multimedia geographical information, and proposes a new retrieval model, called GeoVSM (Geographical + Vector Space Model), which integrates coordinate-based <b>geographical</b> <b>indexing</b> with keyword-based vector space model in representing information space. Document ranking by relevance is supported by document-query similarity measure taking into account degree of relevance in both spatial domain and thematic domain. To support visual query and browsing, GeoVSM model recognizes the fundamental differences in the dimensionality and configuration of geographical space and thematic space, and demands multi-view visual interfaces based on a ‚Äúworld ‚Äù metaphor and a ‚Äúdesktop ‚Äù metaphor. As an example of such interfaces, GeoVIBE is presented that supports a coordinated GeoView and a VibeView for smooth integration of two browsing strategies using geographic clues as well as thematic clues provided by users. 1...|$|R

40|$|NoAccording to leading sociological theorists we {{have now}} entered a `late modern¬ø epoch of `de-traditionalisation¬ø and `individualisation¬ø. Families are crucial in this vision, where the social ties of kinship and {{marriage}} are weakened, increasingly replaced by the project of self. In this paper we take three <b>geographical</b> <b>indices</b> of central elements of the individualisation thesis, examining the distribution in Britain of same sex couples, births to cohabitants, and mothers¬ø withdrawal from the worker role. Analysis of all three indices give support to two levels of criticism of individualisation theory. First, pre-existing social structures have not gone away; the prevalence {{and the effect of}} the components of family form and change examined here seem deeply influenced by pre-existing local structural conditions. Secondly, the analysis supports the criticism that while people might indeed have more room for manoeuvre in late modern society, and may well be less constrained by older traditions, this does not necessarily mean individualisation. The behavioural components of individualisation theory may be a non-sequitor from the observation of changing family forms. We conclude that it seems likely that individualisation may be better conceptualised as one part of pre-existing social and structural processes, and that its behavioural assumptions are unjustified...|$|R
