25|$|Multiple {{conflicting}} {{theories have}} been proposed regarding {{the economic impact of}} income taxes. Income taxes are widely viewed as a progressive tax (the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> increases as income increases).|$|E
50|$|Most markets {{fall between}} these two extremes, and {{ultimately}} the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> is shared between producers and consumers in varying proportions. In this example, the consumers pay more than the producers, {{but not all of}} the tax. The area paid by consumers is obvious as the change in equilibrium price (between P without tax and P with tax); the remainder, being the difference between the new price and the cost of production at that quantity, is paid by the producers.|$|E

Third, consumption of certain items follows life-cycle patterns independent of changes in income.

5000|$|Another {{critic of}} [...] "Islamization" [...] of the economy, Feisal Khan, argues {{that one reason}} for the failure of the equity {{investment}} proposed by Islamic finance proponents to catch on is the [...] "long established consensus" [...] that debt finance is superior to equity investment because accurately determining the credit-worthiness of the borrower/investee is both time consuming and expensive, and much more crucial for equity investors than debt lenders. The quality and quantity of such information is particularly problematic when tax evasion is high and the underground economy large.

5000|$|Almost {{all states}} operate a {{collection}} {{system for taxation}} revenues within a framework of law, and enforced through independent courts. Enabling statutes must be strictly applied, and it is generally against public policy to allow the tax administration to agree {{to reduce the amount}} of tax payable by any one individual. Like criminal law where agreements by the policing authorities to exempt a criminal are prohibited, tax law has a special status as being essential to an organised society in maintaining public trust through the policy of equal treatment in the legal system. Nevertheless, if a tax payer organises his or her affairs so as to exploit a loophole in the law and avoid the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> liability, this will usually be permitted. It is not for the courts to legislate and plug the gaps left by the legislature. The test of avoidance will be whether there is a legitimate purpose for the given behaviour. Many states adopt a [...] "business purpose" [...] test, decomposing the transaction into its component steps to determine the true purpose of the transaction(s) (see tax avoidance/evasion).|$|E

The paper also determined the effectiveness and efficiency of the accounting system of this industry which is assumed will reduce the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance by oil companies. The researcher employed ex-post facto design since the data collected were already available without any manipulation to text three hypotheses. Chi-square analysis was used to analyze the data collected for the study. Findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between the effectiveness of accounting procedure in enhancing performance, accuracy and reliability of accounting records in the industry. Also, the effectiveness of the accounting system will not reduce the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance by oil companies.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} concepts, methods, and results {{of studies that}} analyze the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> such studies is to {{determine}} how the burden <b>of</b> a particular <b>tax</b> is allocated among consumers through higher product prices, workers through a lower wage rate, or other factors of production through lower rates of return to those factors. The methods might involve simple partial equilibrium models, analytical general equilibrium models, or computable general equilibrium models. We review partial equilibrium models, where the burden <b>of</b> a <b>tax</b> is shown to depend on the elasticity of supply relative to the elasticity of demand. In particular, we consider partial equilibrium models with imperfect competition. Turning to a general equilibrium setting, we review the classic model of Harberger (1962) and illustrate its generality by applying it to a number of different contexts. We also use this model to demonstrate the practicality of analytical general equilibrium modeling through the use of log linearization techniques. We then turn to dynamic models to show how a tax on capital affects capital accumulation, future wage rates, and overall burdens. Such models might also provide analytical results or computational results. We also focus on relatively recent models that calculate the lifetime <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxes,</b> with both intratemporal and intertemporal redistribution. Finally, the chapter reviews the use <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> methods and results in the policy process. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: For a {{considerable}} number of years, business income tax returns attested by a certified public accountant (CPA) have enjoyed special tax incentives. There has, however, been no documentary evidence to justify the existing tax incentive policy. This study, which uses a Tobit model to undertake an analysis of business income tax return data, empirically demonstrates that CPA attested tax returns are more compliant with the tax law than non-attested tax returns. This finding suggests that tax authorities should continue to promote the use of CPA attested tax returns. As well, this finding recommends the auditing of a greater proportion of non-attested returns {{in order to reduce the}} <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion...|$|E

The protracted controversy, now restated as whether government bonds are considered as net wealth, goes back to Ricardo's proposition that the method of financing any particular level of government expenditure is irrelevant. As a matter of fact, it is only at the turn of this century that we get a critical evaluation of that proposition and its assumptions, which remained implicit in Ricardo's work. This was accomplished by the Italian school of public finance. That remarkable contribution has largerly been neglected by the subsequent Anglo-Saxon literature and even the current views seem to be essentially anticipated by those earlier studies...|$|E
