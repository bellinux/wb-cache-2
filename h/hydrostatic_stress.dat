30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{development}} of a mathematical model for description of experimentally observed viscoelastic and time-dependent behaviours of the PDL. In particular, the analysis is focused on the evolution of translational displacements of the tooth root in the PDL under the vertical load (intrusion). The calculated tooth- root displacement with time at a constant load allowed comparing the behaviour of the viscoelastic model with the fractional exponential kernel with that of the known nonlinear viscoelastic model of the tooth-root movement developed in the studies (Qian et al. 2009; Slomka et al. 2008). The model was used to determine the level of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stresses</b> in the PDL under the constant intrusive load. The analysis showed that these stresses in the PDL remained practically constant along the surface of the tooth root, except for the region near the root apex. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>stresses</b> in this region were significantly higher, indicating potential bone resorption during the orthodontic motion.|$|R

40|$|A {{previously}} developed analytical formulation {{has been}} modified {{in order to}} more accurately account {{for the effects of}} <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stresses</b> on the nonlinear, strain rate dependent deformation of polymer matrix composites. State variable constitutive equations originally developed for metals have been modified in order to model the nonlinear, strain rate dependent deformation of polymeric materials. To account for the effects of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stresses,</b> which are significant in polymers, the classical J 2 plasticity theory definitions of effective stress and effective inelastic strain, along with the equations used to compute the components of the inelastic strain rate tensor, are appropriately modified. To verify the revised formulation, the shear and tensile deformation of two representative polymers are computed across a wide range of strain rates. Results computed using the developed constitutive equations correlate well with experimental data. The polymer constitutive equations are implemented within a strength of materials based micromechanics method to predict the nonlinear, strain rate dependent deformation of polymer matrix composites. The composite mechanics are verified by analyzing the deformation of a representative polymer matrix composite for several fiber orientation angles across a variety of strain rates. The computed values compare well to experimentally obtained results...|$|R

5000|$|In {{amorphous}} materials, {{the discussion}} of “dislocations” is inapplicable, since the entire material lacks long range order. These materials can still undergo plastic deformation. Since amorphous materials, like polymers, are not well-ordered, they contain {{a large amount of}} free volume, or wasted space. Pulling these materials in tension opens up these regions and can give materials a hazy appearance. This haziness is the result of crazing, where fibrils are formed within the material in regions of high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stress.</b> The material may go from an ordered appearance to a [...] "crazy" [...] pattern of strain and stretch marks.|$|E
50|$|Design {{of mining}} and civil {{structures}} in rock typically involves a failure criterion that is cohesive-frictional. The failure criterion {{is used to}} determine whether a state of stress in the rock will lead to inelastic behavior, including brittle failure. For rocks under high hydrostatic stresses, brittle failure is preceded by plastic deformation and the failure criterion is used to determine the onset of plastic deformation. Typically, perfect plasticity is assumed beyond the yield point. However strain hardening and softening relations with nonlocal inelasticity and damage have also been used. Failure criteria and yield surfaces are also often augmented with a cap to avoid unphysical situations where extreme <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stress</b> states do not lead to failure or plastic deformation.|$|E
5000|$|Also, in general, volume {{change is}} governed by {{considerations}} from elasticity and, this assumption being largely untrue for real soils, results in very poor matches of these models to volume changes or pore pressure changes. Further, elasto-plastic models describe the entire element {{as a whole and}} not specifically conditions directly on the failure plane, as a consequence of which, they do not model the stress-strain curve post failure, particularly for soils that exhibit strain-softening post peak. Finally, most models separate out the effects of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stress</b> and shear stress, with each assumed to cause only volume change and shear change respectively. In reality, soil structure, being analogous to a [...] "house of cards," [...] shows both shear deformations on the application of pure compression, and volume changes on the application of pure shear.|$|E
