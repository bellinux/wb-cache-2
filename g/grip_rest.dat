50|$|Thibault {{described}} a unique method of gripping the sword {{which allows for}} many of his other innovations. Whereas Thibault's contemporaries tended to grasp a sword {{with one or two}} fingers wrapped around the fore quillon, inside the finger ring aligned with the sword's true edge, Thibault's <b>grip</b> involves <b>resting</b> the ricasso on the index finger, with the tip of the thumb resting on the rear quillon. The blade is thus aligned horizontally when the arm is extended. Thibault's system does not rely entirely upon this grip, sometimes dropping the thumb beneath the quillon with the index finger wrapped around the fore quillon. This latter curved or bent arm grip is similar, if not identical, to the grip for which most of Thibault's contemporaries advocated. Thibault uses this grip for cutting and for defending at close range.|$|R

50|$|The Abashevo {{culture was}} already marked by endemic intertribal warfare; {{intensified}} by ecological stress and competition for {{resources in the}} Sintashta period, this drove the construction of fortifications on an unprecedented scale and innovations in military technique such as {{the invention of the}} war chariot. Increased competition between tribal groups may also explain the extravagant sacrifices seen in Sintashta burials, as rivals sought to outdo one another in acts of conspicuous consumption analogous to the North American potlatch tradition. Sintashta artefact types such as spearheads, trilobed arrowheads, chisels, and large shaft-hole axes were taken east. Many Sintashta graves are furnished with weapons, although the composite bow associated later with chariotry does not appear.

There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived.

The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|R

Out of 24 subjects only 10 reduced BW by 4. 68 % during the camp and weight reduction indicated a gradual pattern. Comparison before and after weight reduction revealed increase in resting pulse rate, resting blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and BF%. However, only resting diastolic blood pressure indicated significant (p< 0. 05) increase. A non-significant decline in grip strength, grip endurance and FFM was observed after weight reduction. Thus, gradual weight reduction up to 5 % of BW to compete on the top of lower weight category may not affect grip strength and endurance...|$|R

During active lefthand grip, high (vs. low) -intensity TMS led to activity increases in contralateral right PMd and M 1, whereas activity decreases there due to TMS were observed during no-grip rest. Analyses of condition-dependent functional coupling confirmed topographically specific stronger coupling between left PMd and right PMd (and right M 1), when high-intensity TMS was applied to left PMd during left-hand grip. We conclude that left PMd can exert statedependent interhemispheric influences on contralateral cortical motor areas relevant for a current motor task...|$|R

40|$|Thrombosis-associated pathologies, such as {{myocardial}} infarction and stroke, are major causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Because platelets are necessary for hemostasis and thrombosis, platelet directed therapies must balance inhibiting platelet function with bleeding risk. Glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP 1) is a large scaffolding protein that localizes and organizes interacting proteins in other cells, such as neurons. We have investigated the role of GRIP 1 in platelet function to determine its role as a molecular scaffold in thrombus formation. Platelet-specific GRIP 1 -/- mice were used to determine the role of GRIP 1 in platelets. GRIP 1 -/- mice had normal platelet counts, but a prolonged bleeding time and delayed thrombus formation in a FeCl 3 -induced vessel injury model. In vitro stimulation of WT and GRIP 1 -/- platelets with multiple agonists showed no difference in platelet activation. However, in vivo platelet rolling velocity after endothelial stimulation was significantly greater in GRIP 1 -/- platelets compared to WT platelets, indicating a potential platelet adhesion defect. Mass spectrometry analysis of GRIP 1 platelet immunoprecipitation revealed enrichment of GRIP 1 binding to GPIb-IX complex proteins. Western blots confirmed the mass spectrometry findings that GRIP 1 interacts with GPIbα, GPIbβ, and 14 - 3 - 3. Additionally, in <b>resting</b> <b>GRIP</b> 1 -/- platelets, GPIbα and 14 - 3 - 3 have increased interaction compared to WT platelets.

40|$|Abstract Background Prior {{research}} has revealed large differences {{in health and}} mortality across countries, socioeconomic groups, and individuals. Russia experiences one of the world's highest levels of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, great mortality differences within the population, and a heavy burden of ill health. Psychological stress has been suggested as a likely explanation of health loss and premature death in Russia and Eastern Europe. However, physiological mechanisms connecting stress with health in Russia remain unclear since existing epidemiological data are scarce and limited to conventional risk factors. Method and Design The survey on Stress Aging and Health in Russia (SAHR) is addressing this knowledge gap by collecting an unusually rich database that includes {{a wide range of}} reported information, physical and cognitive health outcomes, and biomarkers in a sample of Muscovite men and women aged 55 and older. The total planned sample size is 2, 000 individuals. The sample was randomly selected from epidemiological cohorts formed in Moscow between the mid- 1970 s and the 1990 s and from medical population registers. The baseline data collection was carried out from December 2006 to June 2009. Interviews and medical tests were administered at hospital or at home according to standardized protocol. Questionnaire information includes health, socio-demographic characteristics, economic well-being, cognitive functioning, and batteries on stress and depression. Biomarkers include anthropometry, <b>grip</b> strength, <b>resting</b> ECG, conventional cardiovascular factors of risk such as lipid profile and blood pressure, and other biochemical parameters such as those related to inflammation, glucose and insulin resistance, coagulation, fibrinolysis, and stress hormones. In addition to these measurements, SAHR includes dynamic biomarkers provided by 24 -hour ECG (Holter) monitoring. This method continuously registers the beat-to-beat heart rate in naturalistic conditions without restrictions on normal daily activities. It provides information about heart functioning, including heart rate variability and ischemic and arrhythmic events. Re-examination of the study subjects will be conducted in 2009 – 2011 and will focus on health, functional status, economic conditions, behaviors, and attitudes towards aging. The subjects are also followed up for mortality and non-fatal health events. Discussion The SAHR will produce a valuable set of established and novel biomarkers combined with self-reported data for the international research community and will provide important insights into factors and biological mechanisms of mortality and health losses in Russia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated a task-related modulation of postsynaptic intracortical inhibition within primary motor cortex for tasks requiring isolated (abduction) or synergistic (precision grip) muscle activation. The current study sought to investigate task-related changes in pre- and postsynaptic intracortical inhibition in motor cortex. In 13 young adults (22. 5 ± 3. 5 yr), paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) {{was used to measure}} short (SICI) - and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) (i. e., postsynaptic motor cortex inhibition) in first dorsal interosseous muscle, and triple-pulse TMS was used to investigate changes in SICI-LICI interactions (i. e., presynaptic motor cortex inhibition). These measurements were obtained at rest and during muscle activation involving isolated abduction of the index finger and during a precision grip using the index finger and thumb. SICI was reduced during abduction and precision <b>grip</b> compared with <b>rest,</b> with greater reductions during precision grip. The modulation of LICI during muscle activation depended on the interstimulus interval (ISI; 100 and 150 ms) but was not different between abduction and precision grip. For triple-pulse TMS, SICI was reduced in the presence of LICI at both ISIs in resting muscle (reflecting presynaptic motor cortex inhibition) but was only modulated at the 150 -ms ISI during index finger abduction. Results suggest that synergistic contractions are accompanied by greater reductions in postsynaptic motor cortex inhibition than isolated contractions, but the contribution of presynaptic mechanisms to this disinhibition is limited. Furthermore, timing-dependent variations in LICI provide additional evidence that measurements using different ISIs may not represent activation of the same cortical process. George M.

40|$|The primary {{motor cortex}} (M 1) {{presents}} a somatotopic organization of body parts, but with overlap between muscle/movement representations. This distinct but overlapping M 1 organization {{is believed to}} be important for individuated control and movement coordination, respectively. Discrete peaks of greater excitability observed within M 1 might underpin organization of cortical motor control. This study aimed to examine interactions between M 1 representations of synergist and antagonist forearm muscles, compare regions of greater excitability during different functional tasks, and compare characteristics of M 1 representation recorded using surface and fine-wire (fw) electrodes. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over M 1 for mapping the representation of 4 forearm muscles (extensor carpi radialis brevis [ECRB], extensor digitorum communis, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor digitorum superficialis) during three tasks: <b>rest,</b> <b>grip,</b> and wrist extension in 14 participants. There are three main findings. First, discrete areas of peak excitability within the M 1 representation of ECRBfw were identified during grip and wrist extension suggesting that different M 1 areas are involved in different motor functions. Second, M 1 representations of synergist muscles presented with greater overlap of M 1 representations than muscles with mainly antagonist actions, which suggests a role in muscle coordination. Third, as larger normalized map volume and overlap were observed using surface than fine-wire electrodes, data suggest that cross-talk from adjacent muscles compromised interpretation of recordings made with surface electrodes in response to TMS. These results provide a novel understanding of the spatial organization of M 1 with evidence of "functional somatotopy. " This has important implications for cortical control of movement.

40|$|J. Koltveit 2 ̆ 6 L. F. Stegall Hamline University, St. Paul, MN Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death in the United States. High {{cholesterol}} is a key risk factor in developing CVD. Statins are widely prescribed pharmaceuticals that effectively lower cholesterol levels, yet many studies have demonstrated significant muscle dysfunction as a side effect. Symptoms include myalgia, muscle cramps, weakness, and in worst cases, rhabdomyolysis. Few studies have investigated the impact of statins on highly physically active individuals such as Masters swimmers. PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the effects of statin therapy on indicators of muscular strength in trained Masters Swimmers aged 55 - 75 y. METHODS: 16 participants (63. 6 + 6. 1 y, 11 male, 5 females), 7 on statins (S), and 9 not on statins (NS), were recruited through the Minnesota Masters Swimmers Organization. Questionnaires were used during the screening process to gain information about health history and muscle symptoms. Fasting blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were measured at <b>rest.</b> <b>Grip</b> strength was measured with a hand grip dynomometer. Leg strength was assessed using a custom built Isometric Leg Strength System. A series of 8 arm and leg strength tests were performed and recorded using a manual muscle testing device. Data was analyzed using one-tailed t-tests. Effect sizes were also calculated. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between S and NS in any muscle strength measure. The muscle tests with the highest effect sizes included left elbow flexion (67. 54 ± 22. 91 (S), 81. 15 ± 16. 62 (NS), p= 0. 103, d= 0. 68, r= 0. 32) and left elbow extension (55. 00 ± 15. 13 (S), 61. 88 ± 7. 18 (NS), p= 0. 135, d= 0. 58, r= 0. 27), both with medium effect sizes. Data from the screening questionnaire demonstrated that of those who experienced muscle symptoms, statin users experienced significantly more interference with physical activity compared with NS (p= 0. 017, d= 4. 06, r= 0. 9). CONCLUSION: We conclude that even though there was no significant difference in muscle strength between the groups, statin users may experience significantly more interference with physical activity due to muscle symptoms compared to non-statin users. Future research should apply a more direct muscle assessment to determine if muscle damage due to statin use is apparent in highly active, trained populations with or without myopathy.

40|$|Fatigue at the {{workplace}} {{has been described}} as a multidimensional construct, affecting the overall state of the whole organism, which may be a consequence of prolonged work and various psychological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. In the short term, fatigue may lead to discomfort, diminished motor control, reduced proprioception, increased force variability, and reduced strength capability, resulting in reduced performance, lowered productivity, deficits in work quality, and increased incidence of accidents and human errors. Fatigue may also lead to longer-term adverse health outcomes such as chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgia, and burnout syndromes, and may be a precursor to WMSDs – work-related musculoskeletal disorders. If indeed fatigue is a precursor to WMSDs and other long-term health outcomes, it may then be a relevant biomarker for cumulative exposure to repetitive and/or sustained work, and thus a useful risk indicator and/or a design and evaluation tool. However, little is known of the temporal pattern of fatigue development and its relationships with disorder risks and work performance. The objective of this thesis was to identify and evaluate a battery of fatigue measures for both laboratory and field-based research, and provide insight into fatigue development in work-relevant task conditions. Six studies were designed to address these objectives. In the first study, measures and analysis methods that detect fatigue-related changes were identified by a group of expert fatigue researchers. The second was an exploratory study focused on the responsiveness of a select number of measures during a workday and multiple workdays in realistic physically demanding residential plumbing work. In the third study, a selected number of conventional and novel measures were evaluated for their reliability and sensitivity in a controlled laboratory setting. This study also addressed the responsiveness of measures during a test battery or during the fatiguing activity (i. e., continuously), and the time between cessation of activity and test battery in which measures remain responsive. The fourth study reported on whether circadian effects were detectable by selected measures, providing insight towards the daylong reliability of these measures. In the fifth study, measures were evaluated in four fatiguing conditions, representing changes in type of contraction, intensity, and body segment. Furthermore, the pattern of fatigue development and the temporal responsiveness of measures were described. Finally, measures were assessed over an 8 -hour light precision micropipetting task to investigate temporal responsiveness of measures and fatigue development. Errors were quantified and the effects of scheduled work breaks were reported. In study 1, fifty-seven measures were identified based on outcomes and/or effects of fatigue in {{the workplace}}. Based on the perceived validity, reliability, and practicality in laboratory and field investigations, four measures were recommended for both settings: maximum voluntary contractions, questionnaires and fatigue scales, Borg’s rating of perceived exercise or discomfort, and visual analog scales. On the other hand, twenty-five measures were not recommended for field studies, including methods traditionally recognized as “gold standard” in measuring cellular and metabolic changes. In study 2, fatigue was documented in realistic physically demanding work while employing a set of measures to provide a comprehensive picture of fatigue development. Not all measures revealed increasing fatigue over the workday or over the workweek, which may be a result of measures reflecting different fatigue processes. Thus, the study reinforced the need of a complementary set of measures, reflecting multiple domains, to measure and interpret the temporal development of fatigue. Two measures, rating of perceived discomfort and grip strength, indicated significant differences within a work day, notably an increase at the beginning and end of the shift (perceived discomfort) and a decrease between mid-shift and end of shift (grip strength). It was speculated that within-day trends were consistent with central fatigue mechanisms. Over multiple workdays, both central and peripheral components displayed a significant day effect. Fatigue accumulation over the workweek was observed with <b>grip</b> strength, physiological <b>resting</b> tremor, and postural tremor measures, particularly between day 1 (Tuesday) and day 4 (Friday). In study 3, test-retest reliability ranged between “poor agreement” and “almost perfect agreement”. In terms of sensitivity, action tremor, MMG RMS amplitude, postural tremor, and rating of perceived fatigue were highly responsive. Perceived fatigue remained elevated, relative to baseline, until 11 minutes post-exercise. Postural and physiological tremor persisted from baseline until the third minute of recovery. Action tremor, however, quickly recovered within the first minute of recovery. This current study found that for most of the measures, there were no statistical differences between test battery and continuous measurement, but a few measures were approaching statistical significance. Action tremor and mechanomyography collected during a test contraction, and perceived fatigue assessed by a visual analog scale, were found to be most reliable, most responsive, comparable to continuous measures, and sensitive after the fatiguing activity, and should be considered with other measures of interest, as part of a test battery. In study 4, only two measures revealed a statistically significant time-of-day effect: mechanomyography of a flexor forearm muscle and action tremor at 30 % MVC. These two measures exhibited rhythmicity based on cosinor analysis. Therefore a degree of caution might be required when interpreting daylong fatigue with these two measures, whereas the other measures may not be susceptible to, or detect, significant diurnal effects. Although the remaining measures did not reveal statistically significant time effects, most measures were characterized with similar patterns to those found in previous literature. In study 5, there was no one universal measure that was common, in terms of responsiveness, in all exercise conditions. Although no single measure was found to be most responsive in all conditions, there were measures responsive in most exercise conditions as either a continuous or test battery measure. This was the case with action tremor. A maximum voluntary contraction, which is dependent on processes in both central and peripheral domains, was similarly responsive. Rating of perceived fatigue, which has been cited as a centrally mediated indicator, was also found to increase with exercise progression in hand conditions. Therefore fatigue measures, reflecting changes to both central and peripheral processes, may be useful in measuring tasks and exercises of varying parameters. In this study, we support earlier investigations on the pattern of fatigue development in isometric and time-varying (e. g., intermittent isometric, concentric) contractions. The temporal responsiveness of central and peripheral measures, on the other hand, may be a better reflection of the intensity of the task. The shoulder intermittent condition was not consistent with the expected pattern for an intermittent isometric contraction. However, the study protocol may have inadvertently generated lower muscle activity, and therefore the extent of fatigue may have been minimal. There remains a need to understand complex combinations of task-dependent factors in both fatigue development and temporal responsiveness. In study 6, nine measurement parameters revealed significant increases in fatigue over the work period. Traditional field measures (i. e., MVC and EMG) did not lead to extraordinary time effects. Error rates followed similar trends to the 9 significant measurements: an increase from baseline towards mid-morning, a slight decrease prior to the lunch break, a nadir after lunch, and increasing fatigue effects over the course of the afternoon. Error rates, however, might not be a sole consequence of fatigue – cognitive and physical; but might also reflect changes in arousal level. Over the pipetting task, there was interplay between peripheral and central fatigue mechanisms in three body segments: thumb, hand, and shoulder. Fatigue developed at a “local” level (i. e., at the three body segments) and was consistent with expected patterns observed in study 5, particularly if thumb and shoulder actions were considered concentric actions and the grip force was a sustained isometric contraction. Overall, the collective assessments suggested that rating of perceived fatigue and action tremor, on average, were highly repeatable and responsive in multiple task conditions. Postural tremor or steadiness and maximum voluntary contractions were moderately reliable and responsive. Different forms of tremor may be responsive to different task conditions. Postural tremor amplitude was found to increase over the course of an 8 -hour workday in a light precision work task, and over multiple days in physically demanding work. Action tremor, on the other hand, appeared to be responsive at higher work intensities performed at a shorter duration of time. Possibly, action tremor may be more indicative of changes in the periphery, whereas postural tremor reflects changes more central in nature. Consequently, these measures should be considered for inclusion into a test battery for field use. For the ergonomist or health and safety practitioner, this body of work provides some insight into the utility of a test battery of fatigue measures to complement current task analysis techniques. For workplace researchers, this dissertation provides insight into the temporal development of fatigue in various task conditions and the reliability and responsiveness of select measures in both short and longer-term work-studies. This research might subsequently elicit future investigations in the relationship between work exposure, fatigue development, and performance and longer-term health outcomes...|$|R
