40|$|Background An {{increasing}} number of people with intellectual disabilities are reaching old age. Knowledge has emerged internationally about the complex and largely unmet health needs of this specific ageing population, and associated costs. Annual <b>health</b> <b>checks,</b> incentivised but not mandatory for primary care in England, seek to reduce health inequities for this population. However, their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap. Methods We developed a decision analytical Markov model to compare a strategy in which older people with intellectual disabilities received annual <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> with standard care. The model, developed to inform a guideline for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), followed hypothetical cohorts of 1000 people in England from when they were 40 years old until they died. Outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective and expressed in 2016 British pounds. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3 · 5 %. We carried out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data from published studies as well as expert opinions informed parameters. Findings Annual <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> led to a mean QALY gain of 0 · 072 (95 % CI 0 · 069 – 0 · 113) and mean incremental costs of £ 4911 (4897 – 5133). For a threshold of £ 30 000, annual <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> were not cost effective (mean ICER £ 89 200, 95 % CI 86 252 to 136 769). Costs of intervention needed to reduce from £ 258 to under £ 100 per year for annual <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> to be cost effective. Interpretation Although our findings need to be considered with caution since the model was based on assumptions to overcome evidence gaps, they suggest that providing cost-effective annual <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> is difficult. This immediately raises ethical questions about equitable access to <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> and <b>health</b> itself. Additional resources are needed if health systems are to contribute to a fairer society. Funding NICE...|$|R
40|$|Background: Employees are {{increasingly}} provided with preventive <b>health</b> <b>checks.</b> However, participation rates are low and several ethical issues arise, {{such as a}} potential perceived threat to autonomy and privacy. Aims: To assess what employees think about preventive <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> in the occupational setting. Methods: Samples of construction workers and the general working population in the Netherlands completed a survey about preventive <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> in the occupational setting. We asked half of each sample about potential benefits and drawbacks of <b>health</b> <b>checks,</b> {{and the other half}} about how they should be offered. We employed explorative factor analysis to identify constructs related to perceived benefits and drawbacks, and the way <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> should be provided. We then conducted descriptive analyses and t-tests to compare subgroups of respondents. Results: A total of 482 (27 %) of construction workers and 738 (65 %) employees from the general population responded. The overall survey response rate was 42 % with 41 % completing the first questionnaire and 42 % the second. We identified three constructs related to perceived benefits and drawbacks: self-control over health, disturbance and negative emotion and lack of autonomy. Participants rated 'self-control over health' as the highest potential benefit (mean = 3. 40; SD = 0. 69), and 'your employer interfering in your personal life' as the most important potential drawback (mean = 3. 27; SD = 1. 00). Participants indicated {{that they would like to}} receive help from their occupational physician when an increased health risk is identified (mean = 4. 02; SD = 0. 69). Conclusions: Employees are ambivalent and hesitant concerning preventive <b>health</b> <b>checks</b> in the occupational setting...|$|R
