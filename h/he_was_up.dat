5|$|Despite their {{unexpected}} naval success, the Confederate generals {{were still}} skeptical about their chances in the fort and held another late-night council of war, where {{they decided to}} retry their aborted escape plan. At dawn on February 15, the Confederates launched an assault led by Pillow against McClernand's division on the unprotected right flank of the Union line. The Union troops, unable {{to sleep in the}} cold weather, were not caught entirely by surprise, but Grant was. Not expecting a land assault from the Confederates, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> before dawn and had headed off to visit Flag Officer Foote on his flagship downriver. Grant left orders that none of his generals was to initiate an engagement and no one was designated as second-in-command during his absence.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed {{their enemy}} {{to have the}} {{battlefield}} of his choosing. Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew all along that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against a force superior in numbers and, until {{the last day of}} the battle, he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster, he nevertheless had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army.|$|E

5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E

Following his knee problems in 1988 and 1989, his balance suffered and as his weight continued to increase he began to change his style, preferring to bide his time by grabbing the opponent's mawashi and rely on his huge weight advantage to wear them out. By 1992 he was winning virtually all his matches by yori-kiri (force out), and his lack of ability to change tack once he had been sidestepped {{was one of the}} concerns raised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for promotion.|$|E

25|$|D'Aumont {{learned that}} his {{position}} and of the Leagues made a looming battle inevitable. Mercour sent a force of Leaguers to Morlaix to make forced marches, and made at least ten leagues in a day hoping to join up with a Spanish force under Juan Del Aguila. Norreys with his force however moved down the coast to block their path so that they wouldn't link up with the Spanish. His approach unnerved Mercour who immediately withdrew from the area to fortified positions not far from Morlaix. Norreys sent 700 English troops to demonstrate before Mercour and hastened him to abandon his advantageous positions. Aguila marched his troops and were close to linking up with Mercour's force but their relief column ran into segments of the detached English. Aguila thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against a much larger force - the Spaniards believed that they totalled 6,000 men but didn't realise that the English was a mere detachment. Aguila fearing being overwhelmed then decided to withdraw his men to Blavet on September 17, which meant that Mercour could not relieve castle of Morlaix. Tensions reached boiling point soon after with Aguila and Mercour both blaming {{each other for the}} failure.|$|E
25|$|The most {{controversial}} measure Caesar introduced was an agrarian bill to allot plots {{of land to}} the landless poor to farm. Conservative aristocrats had a tradition of vehemently opposing land redistribution and most such bills were not passed. In Cassius Dio’s opinion, Caesar tried to appear to promote {{the interests of the}} optimates {{as well as those of}} the people, and said that he would not introduce his land reform if they did not agree with it. He read the draft of the bill to the senate, asked for the option of each senator and promised to amend or scrap any clause that had raised objections. The optimates were annoyed because the bill, to their embarrassment, could not be criticised. Moreover, it would give Caesar popularity and power. Even though no optimate spoke against it, no one expressed approval. The law would distribute public and private land to all citizens instead of just Pompey’s veterans and would do so without any expense for the city or any loss for the optimates. It would be financed with the proceeds from Pompey’s war booty and the new tributes and taxes in the east Pompey established with his victories in the Third Mithridatic War. Private land was to be bought at the price assessed in the tax-lists to ensure fairness. The land commission in charge of the allocations would be large and have twenty members so that it would not be small commission run by a clique and many men would share the honour. Caesar added that it would be run by the most suitable men. This was an invitation to the optimates to apply for these posts. He ruled himself out of the commission to avoid suggestions that he proposed the measure out of self-interest and said that he was happy with being just the proposer of the law. The senators kept delaying the vote. Cato advocated the status quo. Caesar came to the point of having him dragged out of the senate house and arrested. Cato said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for this and many senators followed suit and left. Caesar adjourned the session of the senate and decided that since the senate was not willing to pass a preliminary decree he would get the plebeian council to vote. He did not convene the senate for the rest of his consulship and proposed motions directly to the plebeian council. Cassius Dio thought Caesar proposed the bill as a favour to Pompey and Crassus.|$|E
