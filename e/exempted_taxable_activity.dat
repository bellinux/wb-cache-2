40|$|Abstract- Nonprofit {{organizations}} earn both tax–exempt and tax-able revenues. Nonprofits {{may have}} a natural aversion to engaging in ancillary activities and, as a result, taxable ventures need to pro-vide higher returns than alternative investments. A nonprofits’ ability to exploit production complementarities may increase the return to <b>taxable</b> <b>activities</b> and explain {{the extent to which}} it en-gages in taxable ventures. This paper uses tax return data to test the theory that complementarities encourage <b>taxable</b> <b>activities.</b> Complementarities can lower production costs and make it easier for a nonprofit to allocate joint costs from tax–exempt to <b>taxable</b> <b>activities.</b> I find support for both hypotheses...|$|R

Historically, taxes on the poor supported the nobility; modern social-security systems aim to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working. In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the macroeconomic performance of the economy (a government's strategy for doing this is called its fiscal policy; see also tax exemption), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.|$|R

Using a large cross-sectional sample of U. S. states over 1960 - 94, the empirical model tests the predictions of the theoretical model {{within the context of the}} state tax policy on gasoline. While simultaneously controlling for other politico-economic influences, we find that the influence of changes in gas prices on tax rates is negative.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{will examine}} the concept of “fixed establishment” in VAT-law. The concept {{can be found in}} the new EC-directive on the common system of value added tax, however it has existed for thirty years in {{previous}} directives. Despite this, the legislator has never provided a proper definition of the concept. Its meaning has therefore evolved through the case-law of the ECJ. The Court has put forward a number of criteria which are all to be met if a fixed establishment is to be at hand. First of all the stablishment must have the human and technical resources necessary to provide the service. Furthermore the establishment need to be fully dependent on the parent company. This criterion may be fulfilled even though the establishment is a separate legal person. Finally the Court has held that the result of a transaction being taxed in the country where the fixed establishment is located must lead to a rational taxation result. This rational result is to be examined on a case-by-case basis. It seems clear that a scheme where a fixed establishment is being used with the sole purpose of avoiding VAT would not meet this requirement. The concept of fixed establishment is not to be confused with the concept of permanent establishment existing in income taxation. This latter concept is laid down by Article 5 of the OECD Convention. The two concepts share a common heart, however the ECJ has used the concept of fixed establishment to accommodate the needs of Community law in the field of VAT. Furthermore, this master’s thesis will examine what tax planning opportunities fixed establishments may provide. Swedish companies, primarily <b>exempt</b> <b>taxable</b> persons such as banks and insurance companies, may be tempted to establish fixed establishments in states with a low VAT-rate on professional services, i. e. services provided by consultants, engineers, lawyers and accountants etc. <b>Exempt</b> <b>taxable</b> persons are not entitled to deduct input VAT. By having the fixed establishment purchase the service in question abroad at a low rate of VAT and then forward the service to the main office, savings on VAT cost can be made. A VAT-saving scheme, based on reversed charge of VAT, may involve a Swedish company purchasing a service via a fixed establishment in Luxembourg at a VAT-rate of 15 %. When the establishment subsequently forwards the service to the main office in Sweden no taxation will be made since the ECJ has held that transactions within the same legal entity are not taxable. The difference in VAT cost is ten percentage points which is what the Swedish head office saves by having the fixed establishment purchase the service rather than purchasing it directly from the provider. Similarly, a fixed establishment may be organised in Switzerland, outside the Community, where the VAT-rate is even lower. There are obstacles to these kinds of VAT-saving schemes, and these will be more thoroughly examined...|$|R

We find an unusually large number of nonprofits that report taxable income profitability {{in the range of}} [- 0. 01, 0. 01). Further analysis finds that various frictions and restrictions impede nonprofits from reporting near zero taxable income. We find that the likelihood that a nonprofit reports near zero taxable income is decreasing in size and when the <b>taxable</b> <b>activity</b> has a tax-exempt counterpart. We also find that charitable nonprofits are less likely to report near zero taxable income than are hospitals.

40|$|Virtual worlds like Second Life offer players {{opportunities}} to earn real-world income through their {{activities in the}} game. It will not be long before governments begin to establish policies and regulations regarding the income generated by players of these game environments. This paper examines the issue of taxes in virtual world games. Two alternative places for recognizing income could be established by regulators: 1) at the point when in-game transactions take place; or 2) when players convert game assets into real-world currency. We argue for realization of income, and therefore taxation, at the exchange. We expect that burdensome policies such as requiring game operators to monitor and report <b>taxable</b> <b>activities</b> to the authorities will dissuade game play and likely result {{in the collapse of}} these vibrant economies. Therefore, our recommendation is that the IRS should establish specific rules that inform players about how they should calculate income and work with game operators to inform participants of both the rules and consequences for non-compliance...|$|R
40|$|Observed {{economic}} policies {{in developing countries}} differ sharply both from those observed among developed countries and from those forecast by existing models of optimal policies. For example, developing countries rely little on broad-based taxes, and make substantial use of tariffs and seignorage as nontax sources of revenue. The objective {{of this paper is}} to contrast the implications of two models designed to explain such anomalous policies. One approach, by Gordon-Li (2005), focuses on the greater difficulties faced in poor countries in monitoring <b>taxable</b> <b>activity,</b> and explores the best available policies given such difficulties. The other, building on Grossman-Helpman (1994), presumes that political-economy problems in developing countries are worse, leading to worse policy choices. The paper compares the contrasting theoretical implications of the two models with the data, and finds that the political-economy approach does poorly in reconciling many aspects of the data with the theory. In contrast, the forecasts from Gordon-Li model are largely consistent with the data currently available. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} empirically-oriented work on the size of government by integrating the analysis of three basic elements: (i) the 'demand' for government stemming in part from attempts to coercively redistribute, often analyzed in a median voter framework; (ii) the 'supply' of <b>taxable</b> <b>activities</b> emphasized in Leviathan and other models of taxation; and (iii) the distribution of 'political influence' when influence and economic interests are distinct. The role of the first two factors have been considered in recent empirical studies of government growth by Ferris and West (1996) and Kau and Rubin (2002). Estimates of the effect of unequal political influence on the size of government have been provided by Mueller and Stratmann (2003).

40|$|GST is a {{substantial}} revenue raiser for New Zealand. It has been internationally acclaimed and adopted by other countries. The framework for the tax is prescribed by the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”). Under the Act, GST is charged on a supply {{of goods and services}} made in New Zealand on or after 1 October 1986 by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a <b>taxable</b> <b>activity</b> which is not an exempt supply. 2 Given the fiscal significance of GST, the Act is a significant piece of legislation. How is this significant legislation to be read and applied? This paper interprets some of the leading court decisions. It is, of course, the role of the courts to interpret and apply the Act. The higher the court the more authoritative the decision, and the more likely its reasoning is to be applied in subsequent cases. The decisions of the highest court – the Privy Council and, more recently, the Supreme Court – should therefore be accorded great weight when interpreting GST law.

40|$|A {{key feature}} of the invoice-credit form of {{value-added}} tax (VAT) is that some businesses- notably exporters-will pay more tax on their purchases than is due on their sales, and so can seek refunds of excess credits from government. While refunding is straightforward in principle, serious problems arise in practice, including opportunities for fraud and corruption, and denial of refunds by governments with cash shortages. This makes the refund process the "Achilles heel" of the VAT. This paper examines the refund approaches of tax administrations in 36 developing, transitional, and developed countries.

ABSTRACT: The paper focused on the challenges that exist {{on the process of}} revenue collection in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly. Like all metropolitan and municipal authorities, the AMA faces several challenges ranging for the efficient provision of service to revenue collection. The study attempt to eliminate or reduce to minimum the challenges in the process of revenue collection, the problems associated with revenue administration, the tax base coverage and challenges in identifying property owners. Other objectives are to proposed and design a database solution for effective management of property ownership and revenue collection and also to propose a network solution for connecting the assembly’s and the land sector agencies. The study used the interpretative case study approach to obtain study individuals in their natural settings and also obtain deeper understanding of the event. Data was obtained from written narrative, observation and semi structured interviews of 20 participants. In this study the researcher investigated the challenges associated with the collection of property rate in the AMA. It was discovered that revenue trend has not been stable in revenue collection.

40|$|Most {{countries}} with a value-added tax (VAT) exempt {{financial intermediation services}} from the tax. While exemption is generally perceived to be undesirable, it is also widely regarded as unavoidable because of technical difficulties in applying VAT to these services. This article reviews the standard rationale for exempt treatment and then considers {{the relative merits of}} two recent challenges raised in the tax literature. The first challenge involves the application of cash flow taxation to financial intermediation services {{in a manner that is}} consistent with an invoice/credit VAT (which is the dominant form). The second challenge proposes a comprehensive system of zero-rating of financial intermediation services, which is supported by a characterization of the household consumption of such services as non-taxable. The author argues that each of these alternatives to an exemption system suffers from both theoretical and practical implementation difficulties that make maintenance of exempt treatment the preferred approach, at least in the short term. There is, however, a simpler alternative to these fundamental reform options, involving modification of just one aspect of an exemption system to relieve some of its more problematic aspects. Many of the interpretative problems and associated inefficiencies that plague an exemption system arise from the need to distinguish between <b>taxable</b> and <b>exempt</b> financial services. The author argues that these difficulties can be eliminated, to a large extent, by basing the distinction on the form of prices. In support of this approach, he points out that it is consistent with the underlying reasons for the application of exempt treatment. The author considers a number of other possible modifications, but these are either rejected outright or viewed with a healthy skepticism. For example, the author is critical of the apparent rationale for the application of cash flow taxation to property and casualty insurers. He also rejects proposals that accept some looseness in the formulaic allocation by financial intermediaries of the costs of business inputs between <b>exempt</b> and <b>taxable</b> services for input credit purposes. In his view, an explicit reliance on pricing structures to draw the boundary between <b>exempt</b> and <b>taxable</b> services is preferable to the provision of relief for blocked input tax credits of financial intermediaries. Finally, the author is skeptical of the case for a policy response intended to address the tax bias under an exemption system for financial intermediaries to insource supplies. <br /...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{evidence}} of linguistics, the Hungarians brought the knowledge of beekeeping {{with them to the}} Carpathian Basin. Beekeeping and the consumption of honey must have been a common practice in Csongrád (historically the county seat in the early Middle Ages), a settlement surrounded by water, as records show that in 1138 the people here were required to pay a tax in márc (mead). In Turkish times, mid- 16 th-century defters (taxation lists) provide evidence of beekeeping during that period. After the Turks were driven out of Hungary, a record dating from 1731 shows that as part of his economic organising activity the Hungarian landowner Sándor Károlyi wanted to make beekeeping a <b>taxable</b> <b>activity.</b> Notitia, an 18 th-century description by Mátyás Bél (minister of religion, teacher, historian), and the survey ordered in the time of Joseph II record the endowments for beekeeping (extensive natural stretches of water and melliferous wildflowers) as well as the man-made conditions (cultivated melliferous plants such as tobacco, grapevines, fruit trees). 19 th-century sources also confirm the existence of local beekeeping. Material collected orally in 2004 shows that folk and peasant beekeeping was practised at several places in the area in the late 19 th and the 20 th centuries. In addition to establishing the locations, in a few places the researchers also obtained a description of the place occupied by beekeeping in the peasant economy.

40|$|Trata-se o presente trabalho do instituto da imunidade tributária referente ao disposto no art. 150, VI, b e c da Constituição Federal de 1988. É analisada cada forma de imunidade das entidades do elenco da norma constitucional, bem como traz a lume as polêmicas quanto à tributação das atividades de cada tipo associativo homenageado pelo constituinte originário na Carta Maior. A imunidade tributária somente é possível de ser tratada diante da Competência Tributária Impositiva ao limitar os poderes da União Federal, dos Municípios, dos Estados e do Distrito Federal em criar tributos. O tratamento tributário dado à exploração {{comercial}} e às propriedades pertencentes à Igreja (alínea "b" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988), ou seja, àquelas receitas que são provenientes de atividades atípicas, sempre causaram dúvidas na jurisprudência e dividem a doutrina até hoje. Não diferente é o tratamento tributário dado à produção e circulação de bens das entidades do elenco da alínea "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988, cujas atividades atípicas, por muitos são entendidas como tributáveis. As atividades típicas, por sua vez, quando inerentes aos templos de qualquer culto, devem ser qualificadas pela imunidade plena, enquanto as entidades da alínea "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988, são deparadas com a norma de imunidade de eficácia contida, da qual depende de lei complementar, cuja discussão no presente trabalho traz a polêmica acerca da aplicação da lei ordinária ou da lei complementar; a posição maciça dos tribunais é no sentido da ratificação do art. 14 do Código Tributário Nacional, como requisito para qualificar quais entidades devem ser brindadas com a imunidade. Por fim, para não ficar somente no campo teórico, o presente trabalho analisa a aplicação da imunidade aos tipos associativos do elenco das alíneas "b" e "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988 sob a ótica dos Tribunais pátriosThis study {{seeks to}} bring the understanding of tax immunity system according to article 150, VI, "b" and "c" of the Federal Constitution of 1988. Each type of immunity from the constitutional law is analyzed. It is also brought to light the controversy regarding the taxation of the activities of each associative type embraced by the constituent present in the Federal Constitution. Tax exemption is only possible {{to be dealt with}} before the mandatory tax jurisdiction that limits the powers of the Federal Government, the Municipalities, the States and the Federal District to create taxes. The tax treatment given to commercial exploitation and to the properties owned by the Church ("b" of article 150, VI of the Constitution of 1988), that is, revenue originating from atypical activities, has always raised doubts in jurisprudence and caused doctrine to have different views, today. It is no different the tax treatment given to production and circulation of goods from entities mentioned in article 150, VI, "c" of 1988 Federal Constitution, since the atypical activities are regarded by many as <b>taxable.</b> Typical <b>activities,</b> in turn, when related to temples of any cult, must be qualified for full immunity while entities of article 150, VI, "c" of the 1988 Federal Constitution, have to face the immunity rules of limited discretionary accountability which depends on the supplementary law. The present investigation discusses the controversy on the adoption of either ordinary or supplementary law. Courts major position is towards ratification of article 14 of the National Tax Code, as a requirement to qualify which entities should be entitled to immunity. Finally, in order no to stay only in theoretical level, this study will analyze the application of immunity to associative types of article 150, VI, "b" and "c of the Federal Constitution 1988, from the perspective of Brazilian court...|$|R
40|$|Section 20 of the Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962 {{allows a}} {{taxpayer}} that incurs an assessed loss to carry forward {{the balance of}} assessed loss incurred, to be set off against taxable income earned in or added to losses incurred in future years. The issues regarding the carry forward of assessed losses in terms of section 20 is complex {{and in terms of}} the said section, a company is only entitled to set off its assessed loss from the previous year against its taxable income in the current year, if the taxpayer has carried on a trade during the current year and has derived income from that trade. Under the provisions of section 20 (2 A), a taxpayer other than a company can utilise an assessed loss even if no trading has been conducted. Assessed losses of natural persons, may however be ring-fenced. The aim of this treatise was twofold. Firstly it was to gain clarity on the „trade‟ and „income from trade‟ issues and secondly to compare South African legislation with that of Australia, with a view to recommending a change in our rules regarding the treatment of assessed losses in the context of companies. The critical lessons to be learned from the cases presented, is that liquidators, creditors and others must ensure that the company continues trading in order to x keep the assessed losses valid. Realisation of assets (including stock), and the collection of outstanding debts during liquidation does not constitute the carrying on of a trade in terms of s 20 (1). The continuity of trade is an important element in regard to the carry forward of assessed losses to be utilised in the current and future years. Therefore it is important that a company carries on some activity that falls within the definition of trade. In the landmark case of SA Bazaars, it was held that a company did not have to trade continuously throughout the year to qualify for the set-off of the assessed loss or carry forward of the assessed loss, that is, to trade for say part of the year. The court however left open the issue of whether it was necessary to derive income from that trade. In order to clarify the issues regarding assessed losses, SARS issued Interpretation Note 33 granting taxpayers a concession in certain cases where a company has traded, but not derived income from that trade. But in ITC 1830, the court ruled that a company must trade and must derive income from that trade in order to carry forward its assessed loss, which effectively means that SARS cannot apply Interpretation Note 33. SARS does not have the authority to make concession which is contrary to the wording of the Act. xi In Australia, operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely to be set-off against future income, provided a company meets the more than 50 % continuity of ownership test. Where the continuity test fails, losses can be deducted if the same business is carried on in the income year (the same business test). From the research conducted and in order to solve the issues surrounding the carry forward of assessed losses it was suggested that one of the following be adopted :- The method used in Australia for the carry forward of assessed losses., or A decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal is needed for a departure from the literal meaning of the words pertaining to the requirements regarding the carry forward of assessed losses. Furthermore, to clarify the definition of „income‟, as used in the context of s 20, is it gross income less <b>exempt</b> income or <b>taxable</b> income?. If section 20 relates to taxable income, then an assessed loss will never be increased, which it is submitted, is not what the legislature intended. Section 20 ought to be revisited to eliminate any uncertainty about the income requirement and in the context in which the word „income‟ is used in that section...|$|R
