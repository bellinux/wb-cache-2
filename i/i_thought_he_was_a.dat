[...] As a senior, Larkins played against Gordon Bell, Archie Griffin, and Ricky Bell of USC. [...] Larkins said: [...] "Gordon Bell was the best of the three. [...] He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on. [...] Gordon has a lot more speed and more moves than Archie does, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> better all around player." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing at the moment.... I just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E

500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Comics {{historian}} Mark Evanier, calling Grandenetti [...] "ne of {{the great}} individual stylists of comic books in the fifties and sixties," [...] wrote that, [...] "As the [...] wore on, he got away from combat art and conventional page layouts, taking what he'd learned from [...] Eisner and applying it in new, then-revolutionary directions. Like most artists who departed from the conventional, his work was loved by many but disliked by some. … y the early seventies, Grandenetti was working so far outside even the relaxed conventions of DC Comics {{that he no longer}} quite fit in. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> marvelous, distinct talent who wasn't precisely suited to the work he was assigned, like The Spectre, Prez and [...] "Nightmaster".|$|E
2500|$|However, Faugheen's career took a major turn as {{just before}} the start of the Punchestown festival in late April 2014, his stablemate Vautour [...] "failed a late fitness test" [...] {{according}} to Mullins, that made them switch targets during that week with Faugheen running instead in the early Tuesday's race Herald Champion Novice Hurdle which was over the 2 miles trip. In the race he was against a couple of Vautour's former rivals of which Faugheen [...] "made light work" [...] and made Mullins to reconsider his future prospect: [...] "You'd have to consider staying hurdling with him next season. Looking at him beforehand, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> chaser, but there's no harm in having another good hurdler and that would certainly make you think that maybe he should stay at this game".|$|E

[...] But the White Chief is not as the big men in out tribes. [...] He wore no plumes and no decorations. [...] He had none of his young men (warriors) with him, and only that I heard him talk he would have been to me as other white men. [...] But my brother Mr. Gladstone came to see me in my lodge as a friend, and I was glad to see the White Chief, for though my tongue was tied in his {{presence}} my heart was in full friendship. [...] After he went away they told me that half of his great nation of white men have adopted him as their chief.

2500|$|In 1965, Wilson met Tony Asher at a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles. Asher {{was at the time}} a 26-year-old lyricist and copywriter working in jingles for an advertising agency. The two exchanged ideas for songs, and soon after, Wilson heard of Asher's writing abilities from mutual friends. In December 1965, he contacted Asher about a possible lyric collaboration, wanting to do something [...] "completely different" [...] with someone he had never written with before. Asher accepted the offer, and within ten days, they were writing together. Wilson played some of the music he had recently recorded and gave a cassette to Asher containing the backing track to a piece called [...] "In My Childhood". The result of Asher's tryout was eventually retitled [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and the success of the piece convinced Wilson that Asher was the wordsmith he had been looking for. When Wilson was asked why he felt Asher was the right collaborator: [...] "Oh, a lot of reasons. One, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cool person. Two, anybody that hung out with [...] Loren Schwartz was a very brainy guy, a real verbal type person. I just felt that there was something there that had to be, you know, that really had to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucy Benjamin {{told the}} Daily Star that keeping the secret that her {{character}} {{was responsible for}} the attempted murder had been the [...] "worst two months of her life". She commented to The Mirror, [...] "For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. The first person I told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1954, Orwig {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} as the athletic director at the University of Nebraska for $12,600 a year. [...] He remained at Nebraska until 1961, and during his tenure the Corhuskers started to emerge into national prominence. [...] Orwig was responsible during his seven years at Nebraska for creating the Touchdown Club, the Extra Point Club and the Husker Athletic Achievement Awards. [...] However, the football team did not fare well during Orwig's time there, as the football program went through three coaches (Bill Glassford, Pete Elliott, and Bill Jennings), and had a 27–44 record. [...] Orwig was the athletic director who hired Pete Elliott as the football coach at Nebraska in 1956. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I thought the world of him. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great guy." [...] In 1961, Orwig quit his position at Nebraska to accept the athletic director job at Indiana; news reports indicated that Orwig had been offered $20,000 a year by Indiana, $5,000 more than he was making at Nebraska. [...] At the time, Orwig said: [...] "The decision to accept the Indiana University position as Director of Athletics was a most difficult one[...] [...] [...] The people of Nebraska and the University have been most kind to me over the past 7 years. [...] Their understanding of our problems, their excellent help and their friendship have been heartwarming[...] [...] [...] I leave Nebraska with the greatest admiration for its administrative staff, its teaching staff, and its increasing educational strength[...] [...] [...] My thanks go out to all my friends throughout the state and best wishes and hopes to the Cornhuskers for many victories {{in the years to}} come." [...] Football coach Bill Jennings said, [...] "I'm sorry to see Bill leave and I'm sure everybody who has worked with him does. He's done a fine job.
