During the Second World War, the Nevill Ground was again requisitioned for military purposes, this time to hold soldiers.

25|$|In early September 1950, Yoshida {{nominated}} Hayashi to {{head the}} NPR {{with support from the}} Emperor, who not only had confidence in Hayashi, but also appreciated his performance as Vice-Minister of Imperial Household. This time the nomination of Hayashi was opposed by Willoughby and his intelligence staff, which was responsible for recruitment matters of NPR. They not only favored Hattori and other prewar Japanese army officers, but also even tried to prevent Hayashi from getting appointed. Nevertheless, their views were not shared by other parties within the GHQ. In particular, both Brigadier-General Courtney Whitney, Chief of the Government Section (GS), which was responsible for the NPR's personnel matters, and Major-General Whitfield P. Shepard, Chief of the Civil Affairs Section Annex (CASA), which was responsible for the development and training of the NPR, favored Hayashi. G-3 Division of the GHQ, which dealt with military operations, law enforcement and repatriation, also showed their support to Hayashi. Because of Willoughby's opposition, the nomination of Hayashi dragged on for a month and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more weeks before the nomination was approved only after the intervention of MacArthur and Yoshida.|$|E
25|$|Day Five (17 March): Much {{rested on}} the {{shoulders}} of Randall and Amiss, but after playing one of his best knocks against Australia, Amiss lost concentration and fell to the part-time medium pace of Chappell for 64. By this time, Randall was well beyond his century, his first in Tests, and looked capable of winning the match if he was well supported at the other end. With his total on 161, Randall was given out to a catch by Marsh, but Marsh indicated that he didn't take the ball cleanly, so the Australians recalled the batsman. After a promising half century partnership with Greig had hauled England to within 117 runs of an improbable victory, Randall fell to a brilliant one handed catch by Cosier from the spin of O'Keeffe. He made 174 off 353 balls in a marathon 446 minutes. With the breach made, Lillee returned to attack the tail and although England continued to fight, the wickets tumbled at regular intervals. Finally, Lillee trapped Alan Knott on the crease with a fast, straight delivery to earn an lbw decision and victory for his country. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> moments before it was realised that the winning margin of 45 runs was exactly the same as it had been 100 years before. Randall received the man of the match award, ahead of Lillee (who took eleven wickets for the match) and Marsh.|$|E

2500|$|In 1775, Bukovina, {{the scene}} of the 1821 incidents, was annexed from Moldavia by the Habsburgs, and {{inherited}} the practice of slavery, especially since the many monasteries in the region held a large number of Roma slaves. The number of Roma living in Bukovina was estimated in 1775 at 800 families, or 4.6% of the population. Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor issued an order abolishing slavery on June 19, 1783, in Czernowitz, similar to other orders given throughout the Empire against slavery (see Josephinism). The order met the opposition of the large slaveholders: the Romanian Orthodox monasteries and the boyars. The boyars loudly pleaded their case to the authorities of Bukovina and Galicia, arguing that the banning of slavery was a transgression against the autonomy and traditions of the province, that bondage is the appropriate state for the Roma and that it was for their own good. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more years until the order was fully implemented, but {{toward the end of the}} 1780s, the slaves officially joined the ranks of the landless peasantry.
