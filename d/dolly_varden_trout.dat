5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> <b>trout,</b> wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E
25|$|Sport {{fishing is}} another {{important}} local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen exploiting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> <b>trout</b> (Salvelinus malma), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).|$|E

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} myth, most beaver dams do not pose {{barriers}} to trout and salmon migration, {{although they may}} be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. In a meta-review of studies claiming that beaver dams act as fish passage barriers, Kemp et al. found that 78% of these claims were not supported by any data. In a 2013 study of radiotelemetry-tagged Bonneville cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki utah) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Utah, both of these fish species crossed beaver dams in both directions, including dams up to [...] high. Rainbow, brown, and brook trout {{have been shown to}} cross as many as 14 consecutive beaver dams. Both adults and juveniles of coho salmon, steelhead trout, sea run cutthroat (Oncorhyncus clarki clarki), <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> <b>trout</b> (Salvelinus malma malma), and sockeye salmon are able to cross beaver dams. In southeast Alaska, coho jumped dams as high as two meters, were found above all beaver dams and had their highest densities in streams with beaver. In Oregon coastal streams, beaver dams are ephemeral and almost all wash out in high winter flows only to be rebuilt every summer. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) may be limited by beaver dams, but the presence of juveniles upstream from the dams suggests that the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows. Two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond.|$|E

500|$|In 1880, the Salmon Creek {{was named}} by Richard Harris and Joe Juneau (during their {{first visit to}} the area for gold prospecting). The local people called it Tilhini meaning [...] "dog salmon" [...] a native name used by Tingit Alaskan Indian; this name is also shown in some early {{topographic}} maps. In 1917, fish propagation was established in Salmon Creek Reservoir by introducing 50,000 fry lings (small and young recently hatched fish) in the reservoir with assistance from Alaska Fish and Game Club, which maintained a hatchery at Juneau. This helped in propagating fish reserves of Salmon in the reservoir.

40|$|Bull trout {{are members}} of the char {{subgroup}} of the salmon family (salmonids), which also includes the <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden,</b> lake <b>trout</b> and Arctic char. Bull trout living in streams grow to about 4 pounds while those in lake or large river environments can weigh more than 20 pounds. Biologists distinguish char from other salmonids such as trout and salmon bythe absence of teeth in the roof of the mouth, the presence of light-colored spots on a dark background (trout and salmon have dark spots on a lighter background), the absence of spots on the dorsal fin, their smaller scales, and differences in skeletal structure. Char species such as bull trout live farther north than any other group of freshwater fish except Alaskan blackfish and are well adapted for life in very cold water. Bull <b>trout</b> and <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> look very similar and once were considered thesame species. However, taxonomic research has identified them as differentspecies. Both have small pale yellow to crimson spots on a darker background, which ranges from olive green to brown above, fading to white on the belly. Spawning adults develop varying amounts of red on the belly. Both species also exhibit differences in size, body characteristics, coloration, and behavior across their range...|$|R
5000|$|... 2006 {{revisions}} to PacRim's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) filing with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows {{the company expects}} to discharge more than 7400000 gal of mine area runoff daily into salmon-bearing tributaries of the Chuitna River, including Creek 2002 (Lone Creek), Creek 2003 (Middle Creek) and Creek 2004. That effluent would reach Cook Inlet. The NPDES documents demonstrate that PacRim anticipates a variety of discharge pollutants, including organic carbon, assorted suspended solids, ammonia, nitrates, oil and grease, and metals including aluminum, iron, and manganese. In addition, housing and other operational facilities {{would be expected to}} discharge small amounts of fecal coliform and residual chlorine. According to the NPDES filing, PacRim would build four sedimentation ponds to remove some suspended solids. Three ponds would receive runoff from areas affected by mining operations, the fourth would receive runoff from mine facilities. Four outfall locations would discharge effluent to the fresh water creeks, waterbodies that support all five species of Pacific salmon, as well as <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> and <b>trout.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Taku is the Southeast Alaska's top salmon-producing river.

40|$|Abstract. —The {{relationship}} between the movement of small (, 150 -mm) <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> Salvelinus malma and cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii and stream discharge is not well known in streams of southeast Alaska. We measured movement in a small headwater stream using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and stationary antennas to record time and date of movement. Fish with PIT tags were detected by transceivers and stationary antennas in the stream. The date and time of detection at an antenna were matched with stream discharge (m 3 /s) at the same date and time. Most <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> moved upstream during late summer and early fall. Most cutthroat trout movement was in May, and movement declined through the summer. Few fish moved during the winter. Most fish moved within a narrow discharge range, with a few moving at higher discharges. More than 97 % of fish from both species were detected as moving upstream at discharges below the 5 % exceedance level during the 4 -year period of discharge measurements. <b>Dolly</b> <b>Varden</b> and cutthroat <b>trout</b> moved throughout {{the entire length of}} usable habitat in the stream.
