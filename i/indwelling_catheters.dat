5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters.</b> Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E

40|$|In {{a survey}} of urinary tract infections at the Kyoto University Hospital, gram-negative bacilli were {{accounted}} for 86. 7 % in 1974 and 64. 0 % in 1970, of microorganism isolated from urine specimens. Incidence of E. coli did not change and that of Pseudomonas and Proteus group increased in those years. Modes of urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients were characterized by <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> to the urinary tract. E. coli and Klebsiella were mainly isolated from urines without <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter.</b> However, Pseudomonas, Proteus group, Citrobacter and Enterobacter were frequently isolated from urines with <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter.</b> Under administration of anitibiotics, frequency of E. coli decreased and that of Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter increased in urines from the non-catheterized patients. During hospitalization, colonizations were mostly seen among gram-negative bacilli. Secondary isolated bacilli consisted of Pseudomonas, Enterbacter and Citrobacter. Stones, tumors, urinary stasis and VUR, as predisposing factors for urinary tract infections, were not always attributed to significant bacteriuria. However, the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> induced bacteriuria and gave rise to characteristic bacillous spectrum of urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Acute urinary {{retention}} (AUR) {{is a common}} urological problem. We have observed {{a growing list of}} patients on <b>indwelling</b> bladder <b>catheter</b> awaiting surgery after AUR. This study was aimed at identifying the health, financial and quality of life (QoL) implications of prolonged use of <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> in these patients Methods We review the side-effects, QoL and cost of changing an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> among patients who were on the waiting list for definitive surgery after AUR. All the 62 patients who presented to weekly catheter clinic for change of the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> were recruited over a 3 – week period into the study. Results The mean age of the patients was 57. 5 years and the mean catheter use time was 23 months. The aetiology of AUR was BPH in 40 (64 %) and urethral trauma in 16 (28. 4 %) of the patients. The common side effects of prolonged catheterization included urethral/suprapubic pain, bleeding per urethram, loss of dignity, loss of job or being out of school, lack of sexual intercourse, pericatheter leakage of urine and recurrent urinary tract infection. The cost of change of the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> to the patient each time ranged from 460. 00 – 2500. 00 Naira (averaged 789. 67 Naira). The total annual cost for the change of <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> after AUR in our catheter clinic was estimated to be 7, 350, 000. 00 Naira (58, 800 US dollars) with 1, 890, 000. 00 Naira (15, 120 US dollars) being the cost borne by the patients per annum and the rest being government subsidy. Fifty-three (85. 5 %) patients described that they were unhappy. There was a significant correlation between QoL and the presence of pain (p = 0. 015) and bleeding (p = 0. 042) associated with the presence of an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter.</b> Conclusion The need to have an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> for a prolonged period after AUR is a painful experience and associated with several side-effects. This has a significant negative effect on the patients' QoL and constitutes a significant financial burden to the patients and the government. We suggest that measures should be put in place to reduce the waiting time for surgery and therefore the catheterization time among the patients with AUR. </p...|$|R
25|$|Bacterial and fungal {{infection}}s {{are common in}} ALF, with one study demonstrating culture-proven infection in 80% of ALF patients. Defective cellular and humoral immunity as well as presence of <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters,</b> coma, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and medications that suppress immunity all predispose to infection. Localizing symptoms of infection such as fever and sputum production are frequently absent and the only clues to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function. There must be a low threshold for obtaining frequent cultures (blood, urine, and sputum), chest radiographs, and paracentesis. Bacteria that enter through the skin, such as streptococci and staphylococci, tend to predominate. Aggressive surveillance is essential as prophylactic antibiotics have shown little benefit. Fungal infections, particularly {{in the setting of}} broad-spectrum antibiotics, are also common, and disseminated fungemia is a poor prognostic sign.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indwelling</b> <b>catheters</b> (also {{known as}} foleys) are very {{often used in}} {{hospital}} settings or if the user {{is not able to}} handle any of the above solutions himself. The indwelling catheter is typically connected to a urine bag that can be worn on the leg or hang {{on the side of the}} bed. <b>Indwelling</b> <b>catheters</b> need to be changed on a regular basis by a health care professional. The advantage of <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters</b> are, that the urine gets funneled away from the body keeping the skin dry. The disadvantage, however, is that it is very common to get urinary tract infections when using <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{methods of}} serial {{electrophysiologic}} testing are in widespread use. Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study {{and a new}} catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test. An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing. Little is known about differences between these two methods {{with respect to the}} likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications. To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter,</b> a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients. Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter,</b> a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter. Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters. No {{differences were found between the}} <b>indwelling</b> and new <b>catheter</b> tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of estrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion. Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter.</b> Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all). There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications. An <b>indwelling</b> pacing <b>catheter</b> has induction characteristics identical to those of a newly placed catheter and complications of the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> are infrequent. This approach may have advantages for patients and physicians...|$|R

30|$|Hepatic {{arterial}} {{injury is}} an uncommon complication of percutaneous biliary drainage interventions (Saad et al. 2008). When symptoms of hemorrhage into the biliary tree such as pain, hemobilia, peri catheter hemorrhage and upper gastrointestinal bleeding persist despite conservative management, other interventions are indicated. These include upsizing of the biliary drainage catheter and arteriography/embolization. The angiographic manifestations of hepatic arterial injury include arteriobiliary or arterioportal fistula, pseudoaneurysm, extravasation and focal arterial caliber irregularity {{at the site}} of <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter.</b> These findings may be obscured by the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> and the contrast in the biliary ducts.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases of}} {{patients}} with <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters,</b> special care should be taken so that a community-acquired infection does not occur.

50|$|The {{incidence}} {{of all forms}} of candidiasis have increased in recent decades. This is due to developments in medicine, with more invasive medical procedures and surgeries, more widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppression therapies. The HIV/AIDs global pandemic has been the greatest factor in the increased {{incidence of}} oral candidiasis since the 1980s. The incidence of candidiasis caused by NCAC species is also increasing, again thought to be due to changes in medical practise (e.g., organ transplantation and use of <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters).</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{cystitis}} glandularis, non-mucinous and mucinous (intestinal). The difference is in the cellular production of mucin, a normal feature of colonic and intestinal epithelial cells but not of urothelial cells. Another distinction is made between focal areas and diffuse involvement of the bladder. Whereas focal areas are more common, diffuse involvement is seen in chronically irritated bladders, such as in paraplegics or those with bladder stones or <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheters.</b> Individuals with diffuse intestinal-type cystitis glandularis {{are at increased risk}} for developing bladder cancer.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} of this randomized prospective {{study was to determine}} whether a urinary catheter is nec-essary for all patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were randomized to treatment with or without insertion of an <b>indwelling</b> urinary <b>catheter.</b> All patients received spinal anesthesia with 15 to 30 mg of 0. 5 % bupivacaine. The catheter group was subjected to a standard postoperative protocol, with removal of the <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> within forty-eight hours postoperatively. The experimental group was monitored for urinary retention and, if necessary, had straight catheterization up to two times prior to the placement of an <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter.</b> Results: Two hundred patients were included in the study. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups in terms of the prevalence of urinary retention, the prevalence of urinary tract infection, or the length of stay. Nine patients in the no-catheter group and three patients in the catheter group (following removal of the catheter) required straight catheterization because of urinary retention. Three patients in the catheter group and no patient in the no-catheter group had development of urinary tract infection. Conclusions: Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia appear to be at low risk for urinary retention. Thus, a routine <b>indwelling</b> <b>catheter</b> is not required for such patients. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level I.
