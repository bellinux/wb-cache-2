5|$|Henry is {{generally}} credited with initiating the English Reformation – {{the process of}} transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed.

No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Charles V's control of the Papacy. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy (which he had previously defended), though as historian A. F.
