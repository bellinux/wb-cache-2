In Italy, a recent regulatory intervention has focused on start-ups creating a framework where <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups</b> are defined and regulated. Among <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups,</b> those with a social vocation are of particular interest, since they are understudied in the literature. Indeed, the aim of this paper is twofold: to analyze the relationship between social innovation and sustainability in the latter businesses, and try to understand how sustainability could be fostered through them. Italian cases of <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups</b> will be studied through content analysis applied to the Social Impact Assessment Document provided by firms. Results show that the Social Impact Assessment Document provided by <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups</b> explicitly pays attention to social innovation and sustainability in different ways. However, the document does not show the link between social innovation and sustainability. Nonetheless, going through these documents, the link between social innovation and the three aspects of sustainability (economic, social and environmental) clearly emerge and therefore could be better managed...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} on entrepreneurial teams {{has failed to}} settle the controversy over whether team heterogeneity helps or hinders new venture performance. Reconciling this inconsistency, this paper suggests a new conceptual approach to disentangle differential effects of team heterogeneity by modeling two separate heterogeneity dimensions, namely knowledge scope and knowledge disparity. Analyzing unique data on functional experiences {{of the members of}} 337 start-up teams, we find support for our contention of team heterogeneity as a two-dimensional concept. Results suggest that knowledge disparity negatively relates to both start-ups' entrepreneurial and innovative performance. In contrast, we find knowledge scope to positively affect entrepreneurial performance, while it shows an inverse U-shaped relationship to <b>innovative</b> <b>start-up</b> performance.

Building on this simple observation, the paper shows that incomplete contracts can be preferred to complete contracts. This is because (i) execution of incomplete contracts reveals less information to outside parties, giving rise to strategic gains; (ii) secretly executed complete contracts could not do better, given the possible strategic uses of the hard information generated by execution of the contract. The key effects at work are explored {{in the case of}} financial contracts for <b>innovative</b> <b>start-up</b> companies, providing a rationale for the observed differences in the extent to which venture capital contracts include a variety of contingencies, and for how this varies across industries and geographically. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Innovative</b> <b>start-ups</b> {{and their}} {{respective}} market partners are faced with severe asymmetric information problems due to their lack of prior production history and reputation. We study whether entrepreneurial signaling can help solve these problems and thereby increase the potential success of <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups.</b> We concentrate our analysis on the credit and labor market because they are crucial {{for the success of}} <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups.</b> We focus on the role of educational signals and assume that not only employees but also entrepreneurs signal their quality with certain characteristics of their educational history. Potential employees will use an entrepreneur's university degree as a quality signal when deciding whether to accept a job at an innovative start-up; and banks will use a more precise indicator, namely the actual length of study in relation to a standard length, as a signal when deciding upon credit for an innovative founder. Since asymmetric information and skill requirements are different for traditional start-ups we do not expect employees or banks to use the same signals for traditional start-ups. We empirically test ou...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge is {{recognized}} as an important ingredient for economic growth in addition to physical capital and labor. While transforming knowledge into products and processes it is exploited commercially. Nevertheless, the existing knowledge stock and the absorptive capacity of actors like employees at firms and researchers at universities and research institutions are conditional for the ability to produce, identify, and exploit knowledge. Since incumbent firms do not exploit new knowledge to the full extent, realized entrepreneurial opportunities may arise. This paper tests the hypothesis whether or not entrepreneurship is an important vehicle for knowledge flows and economic growth. The empirical results indicate that an increase in <b>innovative</b> <b>start-up</b> activity {{is more effective than}} an increase in general entrepreneurship for economic growth.

40|$|Business angels {{provide both}} {{financing}} and managerial experience, which {{increase the likelihood}} of the survival of <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups.</b> Over the last years, European countries with developing informal venture capital markets have seen governments support the creation of business angels networks (BANs) to increase and consolidate these markets. Using the Portuguese context to carry out the empirical work, this paper provides an assessment of value added provided by angels’ networks. A total of 88 useable responses were received and analysed using non-parametric statistical techniques. This paper demonstrates that is evidence of positive contribution of BANs in terms of bringing together investors and linking them with entrepreneur’s seeking finance. BANs {{played an important role in}} financing <b>innovative</b> <b>start-ups</b> also in peripheral regions. Results lead us to conclude that government support BANs would appear to be an effective mechanism to stimulate the angel market in developing informal venture capital markets.
