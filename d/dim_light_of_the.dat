25|$|The Ross Sea {{party was}} a {{component}} of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–17. Five men were stranded not far away from Cape Evans. There was sea ice {{between them and the}} relative safety of the hut on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, Aeneas Mackintosh and Victor Hayward, decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a blizzard hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men tried to look for them, but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during polar night the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars.|$|E
2500|$|President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, {{which took}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} {{the freedom of}} all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with {{the adoption of the}} 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: [...] "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with both}} the {{original}} Dark Fall and the sequel, , Jonathan Boakes worked primarily alone on Lost Souls, writing, designing and programming the game, as well as voicing several characters, designing the sound effects (with Matt Clark), and composing the music (with Ben Gammons). Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think {{a little of that}} personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Darkling Room {{is the best way to}} approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E
60|$|Afterward {{they sat}} {{before the fire}} and by <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{kerosene}} lamps chatted together <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's adventures.|$|R
60|$|The Kid looked keenly {{into the}} shadows {{up and down the}} arroyo and toward <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mexican village.|$|R
60|$|De Batz {{stood and}} watched him {{for as long as}} <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street lamps illumined his slim, soberly-clad figure; then he turned on his heel and walked off in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{opened the}} note {{and read it}} aloud in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabin.|$|E
60|$|Presently The Sheik {{came and}} parted the rugs. He glared through the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan shuddered at her fate, {{for even}} in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vault he was {{impressed}} by her beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Davy, Davy!" [...] they shouted, {{for they}} were in the mood for anything. There stood Colonel Clark in <b>the</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background. [...] "We must keep 'em screwed up, Davy," [...] he had said that very day.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, {{just before}} he saw <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{lanterns}} disappearing down the road, which at this point makes a sharp dip before rising abruptly once more on <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood, Sir Marmaduke finally put his foot in the stirrup and started to follow.|$|R
50|$|Desert rainbow-skinks {{shelter in}} {{woodland}} leaf litter, feeding mainly on invertebrates. Their large eyes {{help them to}} see their prey in <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter, and the eyes are covered by an eyelid with a transparent window that protects the eye while burrowing in the litter.|$|R
60|$|The man's {{white face}} shone eagerly in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gloomy little apartment. His eyes glittered. He waited almost breathlessly.|$|E
60|$|The {{flash of}} scorn, which shot across the {{features}} of the Teton, was visible, even by the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars.|$|E
60|$|Malvina's {{eyes were}} fixed on the Professor. In the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-ceilinged room, those eyes seemed all of her that was visible.|$|E
50|$|Skaer {{has made}} a number of 16mm films with the British artist Rosalind Nashashibi {{including}} Flash in the Metropolitan in 2006, which depicts the artifacts and artworks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Metropolitan Museum <b>of</b> Art in New York as they appeared in a <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> museum interrupted by <b>the</b> flashes <b>of</b> a strobe. <b>The</b> two have collaborated on the films Our Magnolia and Pygmalion Event, as well as several others.|$|R
5000|$|The first Philippine flag is hosted {{inside the}} museum and is {{available}} for viewing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public. The century-old flag is being preserved by the museum management following instructions made by the Smithsonian Institution in a collaborative consultation. <b>The</b> temperature and <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room where the flag is displayed is regulated as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preservation efforts on the flag. In 2011, {{it was reported that}} the flag may still be in a [...] "good viewing state" [...] for 20 to 30 years/ ...|$|R
60|$|Soon after, her weary {{head was}} on her pillow, and <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> grey <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summer night showed the quiet peace and calmness that had settled on her {{sleeping}} face.|$|R
6000|$|The blush of {{the young}} soldier was visible even in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp-fire as he started up on one elbow, and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|He stood still, {{and leaning}} {{with both hands}} upon his partisan, he sought {{to make out the}} courtier's {{features}} in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rising moon.|$|E
60|$|For some {{minutes he}} did not dare venture within, but finally, as his eyes became {{accustomed}} to the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior he slowly and cautiously entered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Echoes in Rain" [...] was {{released}} on 20 November 2015, {{the same day as}} the accompanying album Dark Sky Island. It showed Enya performing the song with the female string ensemble - Wired Strings, and a female choir, in Harrow School in London. The set featured an antique rotating globe, turning as the 'long journey home' the lyrics describe progressed and changed from night to day and back; to emphasise, intense lighting lit the church to represent the day (white, bright lights), and <b>the</b> night (blue, <b>dim</b> <b>lights)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey.|$|R
60|$|Now {{they were}} in <b>the</b> nave <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old fane where the cold struck them like a sword. <b>The</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torches showed them that, short as had been the time, <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> this marvellous {{marriage}} had spread about, {{for at least a}} score of people were standing here and there in knots, or a few of them seated on the oak benches near the chancel. All these turned to stare at them eagerly as they walked towards the altar where stood the priest in his robes, and since his sight was dim, behind him the old clerk with a stable-lantern held on high to enable him to read from his book.|$|R
25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is first mentioned in Red Mars; it takes off when Sax creates an alga {{to withstand the}} harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In Green Mars, GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By Blue Mars, GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in <b>the</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer planets.|$|R
60|$|So therewith Sir Tristram gave {{orders to}} Gouvernail, and Gouvernail brought him his shining golden harp, and the harp glistered with great splendor in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilion.|$|E
60|$|Nelly Bryant {{gazed at}} the note with wide eyes. She was stunned. She took it limply, {{and looked at it}} under the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas-lamp over the door.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{had been}} asleep {{about two hours}} when he awoke with a start. He sat up, and in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room saw his brother {{thrashing}} wildly in the bed.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft pilots used an eye patch, {{or close}} one eye to {{preserve}} night vision {{when there was}} disparity in the light intensity within or outside their aircraft, such as when flying at night over brightly lit cities, so that one eye could look out, and the other would be adjusted for <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cockpit to read unlit instruments and maps. [...] The FAA still recommends, [...] "a pilot should close one eye when using a light to preserve some degree of night vision". [...] Some military pilots have worn a lead-lined or gold-lined eyepatch, to protect against blindness in both eyes, in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> a nuclear blast or laser weapon attack.|$|R

60|$|The {{young artist}} {{remained}} by the table, while his sister followed her lover to the door. In the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall {{he could see}} their figures and overhear their words.|$|E
6000|$|Halleck {{remained}} on the pavement with Bartley falling limply against him in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dawn. [...] "What you want? What you doing with me?" [...] he demanded with sullen stupidity.|$|E
60|$|Presently, I {{heard a noise}} again, {{and woke}} up quietly, without starting, but just {{opened my eyes and}} peered about as well as the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little oil-lamp would allow me.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enciente {{had been}} {{repaired}} and greatly strengthened, and covered by bastions and other works, {{so that even}} were one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forts taken <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy would but be begun. The theatres had been closed from the first. The café's chantants, and the open-air concerts had long since followed the example, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasing seriousness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas. The café's themselves were no longer crowded until midnight; <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lamps that had taken <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> gas gave a sombre air to these establishments, and by eight o'clock in <b>the</b> evening most <b>of</b> them put up their shutters.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} in the room now. Through the narrow barred window <b>the</b> steely rays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon fought with <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> yellow <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil lamp, and lit up <b>the</b> pale face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Committee's agent with its lines of cruelty in sharp {{conflict}} with those of greed.|$|R
60|$|Twice {{the tall}} {{clock in the}} corner whirred and sharply struck the hour, but {{throughout}} the whole long consultation Hiram stood silent, motionless as a stock, his eyes fixed almost unwinkingly upon the three heads grouped close together around <b>the</b> <b>dim,</b> flickering <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> candle and the papers scattered upon the table.|$|R
