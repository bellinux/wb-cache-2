5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that he {{had fallen in love with}} Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to play a significant role in the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, the back room of The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E

Pezzente used the <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{performance}} venue, dubbing it the Gallery Quiva. Around 1996, fumes from the mechanic's garage below the loft forced them to vacate it. Shortly after their departure, Efrim Menuck moved into the space and established Hotel2Tango, serving both as a recording studio and practice space. There, in 1997, the original recording of F♯ A♯ ∞ took place. By this time, the band had reached an unwieldy 15 members. In preparation of the album, they trimmed their numbers to ten.|$|E

25|$|Western Utah {{is mostly}} arid desert with a basin and range topography. Small {{mountain}} ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape. The Bonneville Salt Flats are an exception, being comparatively <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of once forming {{the bed of}} ancient Lake Bonneville. Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake, which once covered most of the eastern Great Basin. West of the Great Salt Lake, stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid Great Salt Lake Desert. One exception to this aridity is Snake Valley, which is (relatively) lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from groundwater derived from snow melt in the Snake Range, Deep Creek Range, and other tall mountains {{to the west of}} Snake Valley. Great Basin National Park is just over the Nevada state line in the southern Snake Range.

Sutcliffe was versed in music: he had sung in the local church choir in Huyton, his mother had insisted on piano lessons for him {{since the age of}} nine, he had played bugle in the Air Training Corps, and his father had taught him some chords on the guitar. In May 1960, Sutcliffe joined Lennon, McCartney, and George Harrison (then known as [...] "the Silver Beatles"). Sutcliffe's fingers would often blister during long rehearsals, as he had never practised long enough for his fingers to become calloused, even though he had previously played acoustic guitar. Sutcliffe started acting as a booking agent for the group, and they often used his Gambier Terrace <b>flat</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rehearsal room.|$|E

Production was based at Hartswood Films' Cardiff production unit, Hartswood Films West, which was opened in late 2009 to take advantage of the BBC's planned Cardiff Bay [...] "drama village". Production of the first two series was based at Upper Boat Studios, where Doctor Who had been produced. Cardiff was more economical than in London, with some good matches for parts of London. Some architecture could not be faked, so location shooting in the English capital was necessary. The location shots for 221B Baker Street were filmed at 187 North Gower Street– Baker Street was impractical because of heavy traffic, and the number of things labelled [...] "Sherlock Holmes", which would need to be disguised.

500|$|In 1803 Sir John Sinclair, {{president}} of the Board of Agriculture, spoke {{of the need to}} cultivate the substantial Finchley Common and Hounslow Heath (perhaps prophetic of the Dig for Victory campaign of World War II) and fellow Board member Middleton estimated that one tenth of the county, , was uncultivated common, capable of improvement. However William Cobbett, in casual travel writing in 1822, said that [...] "A more ugly country between Egham (Surrey) and Kensington would with great difficulty be found in England. <b>Flat</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pancake, and until you come to Hammersmith, the soil is a nasty, stony dirt upon a bed of gravel.

The cut-off travels due east by I-80 {{to the north and}} the now Union Pacific Central Corridor railroad tracks to the south. Leppy Pass Road, exit 4 on I-80, provides access to the Bonneville Speedway north of the Interstate. Between SR-58 and Leppy Pass Road, the highway is designated Federal Aid Route 2654. Further south, a rest area was built along the southern side of I-80, however no road access was provided between the rest area and the cut-off.

[...] Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood. [...] Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood. [...] After the police [...] found slips of paper written with the dead children's personal details, Lim tried to allay suspicions by claiming that Ghazali had come to his flat seeking treatment for a bleeding nose. [...] He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's. [...] Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation. [...] Lim overheard them and became agitated, raising his voice at the law enforcers. [...] His ire was mimicked by Hoe as she gestured violently and shouted at the officers.
