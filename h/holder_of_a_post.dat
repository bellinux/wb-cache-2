50|$|In some countries, {{such as the}} United States, {{the term}} {{secretary}} is used to indicate the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cabinet-level <b>post.</b> This usage derives {{in part from the}} desire {{of the founders of the}} United States to differentiate the country from the United Kingdom, which denoted such offices as Ministers. There are <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> popular variations of the title used to indicate that the secretary in question has <b>a</b> high degree <b>of</b> authority, such as general secretary (or, following usage in the Norman language, secretary-general), first secretary, and executive secretary.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the vice}} {{president}} {{does not need to}} have any political experience, most major-party vice presidential nominees are current or former United States Senators or Representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former Governor, a high-ranking military officer, or <b>a</b> <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major <b>post</b> within the Executive Department. The vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidates. The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.|$|R
