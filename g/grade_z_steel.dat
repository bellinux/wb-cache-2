40|$|Aims: Existing {{scales for}} {{functional}} grading {{of patients with}} cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), such as the Nurick scale and modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scale, do not address certain culture-specific activities of the Indian population while grading patients with CSM. Materials and Methods: We modified the Nurick scale and mJOA scale to develop the Indian modifications of Nurick (imNurick) and mJOA scales (imJOA and imJOA scales), respectively, and then evaluated these modified scales in 93 patients with CSM to determine whether these modifications had a meaningful impact on the functional scores of these patients. Results: There was good interobserver agreement in the assessments documented in all the four scales (Nurick grade, imNurick grade, mJOA scale, and imJOA scale) (kappa = 1). Both Nurick <b>grading</b> (<b>z</b> = 4. 4, P = 0. 00) and imNurick <b>grading</b> (<b>z</b> = 5. 5, P = 0. 00) had a valid construct when tested against lower limb mJOA (llmJOA) score. The Indian modified upper limb JOA (imulmJOA) score too had a good construct with modified upper limb JOA (ulmJOA) score (z = 2. 5, P = 0. 01). There was substantial agreement between Nurick grade and imNurick grade (weighted kappa of 0. 75) when {{taken as a whole}} group and between ulmJOA score and imulmJOA scores (weighted kappa of 0. 75). However, there was significant disagreement between the Nurick grade and imNurick grade scales in patients who were Nurick grade 2 and 3 (kappa = 0. 07). Conclusions: The proposed Indian modifications of Nurick grade and mJOA scale that incorporate the ethnic practices of the Indian population and some Asian population are better discriminators of different levels of functional ability among patients with CSM in this population, as compared to the existing Nurick grading and mJOA scale...|$|R

A nonheated eyebag {{was applied to the}} contralateral eye as a control. Results: Eyelid temperatures, NITBUT, and TFLLT increased significantly from baseline in test eyes immediately after removal of the heated eyebag compared with those in control eyes (maximum temperature change, 2. 3 +/- 1. 2 [degrees]C vs. 0. 3 +/- 0. 5 [degrees]C, F = 20. 533, p < 0. 001; NITBUT change, 4. 0 +/- 2. 3 seconds vs. 0. 4 +/- 1. 7 seconds, p < 0. 001; TFLLT change, 2. 0 +/- 0. 9 grades vs. 0. 1 +/- 0. 4 <b>grades,</b> <b>Z</b> = - 4. 035, p < 0. 001). After 10 minutes, measurements remained significantly higher than those in controls (maximum temperature change, 1. 0 +/- 0. 7 [degrees]C vs. 0. 1 +/- 0. 3 [degrees]C, F = 14. 247, p < 0. 001; NITBUT change, 3. 6 +/- 2. 1 seconds vs. 0. 1 +/- 1. 9 seconds, p < 0. 001; TFLLT change, 1. 5 +/- 0. 9 vs. 0. 2 +/- 0. 5 <b>grades,</b> <b>Z</b> = - 3. 835, p < 0. 001).

50|$|However, some tank armor {{material}} contains {{depleted uranium}} (DU), {{common in the}} US's M1A1 Abrams tank, which incorporates steel-encased depleted uranium armor, a substance that will fast fission when it captures a fast, fusion-generated neutron, and thus on fissioning will produce fission neutrons and fission products embedded within the armor, products which emit among other things, penetrating gamma rays. Although the neutrons emitted by the neutron bomb may not penetrate to the tank crew in lethal quantities, the fast fission of DU within the armor could still ensure a lethal environment for the crew and maintenance personnel by fission neutron and gamma ray exposure, largely depending on the exact thickness and elemental composition of the armor—information usually hard to attain. Despite this, Ducrete—which has an elemental composition similar to, but not identical to the ceramic second generation heavy metal Chobham armor of the Abrams tank—is an effective radiation shield, to both fission neutrons and gamma rays due to it being a <b>graded</b> <b>Z</b> material.

The GIA has developed a rating system for color in white diamonds, from D to Z (with D being [...] "colorless" [...] and Z having a bright yellow coloration), which has been widely adopted in the industry and is universally recognized, superseding several older systems. The GIA system uses a benchmark set of natural diamonds of known color grade, along with standardized and carefully controlled lighting conditions.

Oddly enough, diamonds <b>graded</b> <b>Z</b> are also rare, and the bright yellow color is also highly valued.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis and design method for lapped connections between cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>Z</b> sections after careful calibration against test {{data obtained from}} a total of 26 one point-load tests on lapped connections. Based on the experimental observations on the lapped connection tests where combined bending and shear is always critical in the cross-sections {{at the end of}} laps, an analysis method is proposed to evaluate all the internal forces within the lapped connections. Once the co-existing moments and shear forces in the lapped connections are evaluated, the critical sections are readily checked against combined bending and shear using codified design rules. Moreover, design expressions are also proposed for the evaluation of effective flexural rigidities of lapped connections with various bolt configurations against practical lap length to section depth ratios. Consequently, the structural behaviour of lapped sections between cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>Z</b> sections in terms of strength and stiffness is quantified rationally for general design.

Although {{perceived}} social support {{is thought to be}} a strong predictor of psychological outcomes following trauma exposure, the temporal relationship between perceived positive and negative social support and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms has not been empirically established. This study investigated the temporal sequencing of perceived positive social support, perceived negative social support, and PTSD symptoms in the 6 years following trauma exposure among survivors of traumatic injury. Method. Participants were 1132 trauma survivors initially assessed upon admission to one of four Level 1 trauma hospitals in Australia after experiencing a traumatic injury. Participants were followed up at 3 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 6 years after the traumatic event. Results. Latent difference score analyses revealed that greater severity of PTSD symptoms predicted subsequent increases in perceived negative social support at each time-point. Greater severity of PTSD symptoms predicted subsequent decreases in perceived positive social support between 3 and 12 months. High levels of perceived positive or negative social support did not predict subsequent changes in PTSD symptoms at any time-point. Conclusions. Results highlight the impact of PTSD symptoms on subsequent {{perceived social}} support, regardless of the type of support provided. The finding that {{perceived social support}} does not influence subsequent PTSD symptoms is novel, and indicates that the relationship between PTSD and perceived social support may be unidirectional.

40|$|Summary: Although {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitors (TKI) {{are the most}} common first-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, high-dose interleukin- 2 (HD-IL 2) remains the only agent that provides durable complete responses. The optimal sequence of these agents remains uncertain. This retrospective multi-institutional study examined the safety and efficacy of HD-IL 2 following TKI therapy. After IRB approval at 7 HD-IL 2 centers, data relating to patient, disease, and treatment characteristics among 40 consecutive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who were treated with HD-IL 2 after at least 1 prior TKI therapy were retrospectively collected. The most common cardiac adverse events were grade 3 hypotension and vascular leak syndrome. Six patients (15 %) experienced other <b>grade</b> <b>Z</b> 3 cardiac adverse events. There were 2 treatment-related deaths due to congestive heart failure, occurring in 1 patient with short TKI to HD-IL 2 interval and another patient with an abnormal baseline cardiac stress test. Best responses included 2 CRs (5 %, duration 40 + and 62 + mo), 3 PRs (8 %, duration 6, 11, and 24 mo), 13 SD (32 %, median duration 12 mo), 20 PD (50 %), and 2 not evaluable patients. Median overall survival was 22 months. Administration of HD-IL 2 could be safe and effective after TKI therapy; however, careful selection of patients is critical. We recommend baseline cardiac risk factor assessment, screening with both cardiac stress test and echocardiogram, and allowing a TKI to HD-IL 2 interval of at least 2 months.
