25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{mountain}} is extremely characteristic. Only from northwest <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a 'tind' a high pointy summit in Norwegian. From the east, from Galdhøpiggen, it shows its steep wall with Nåle balancing on the left flank, {{as seen in the}} table. This wall {{is one of the more}} inaccessible in Jotunheimen and is climbed rarely. The southwest face is less forbidding, and it is possible to find a way up through the partly snow-covered talus slopes. The mountain, as its neighbors, consists of the hard gabbro rock, which withstands erosion better than most other rocks. The orientation of the layers of gabbro in Skarstind is uncommon. Normally they rise from northwest towards southeast, which is why many summits are easiest to reach from the north side. At Skarstind the layers rise from southwest towards northeast. This is easily seen on the photo in the table.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, when the Hayman Fire and Coal Seam Fire ravaged much of Western Colorado, Owens made perhaps the first major press faux-pas of his tenure.

5000|$|<b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Like</b> I'm Here? {{contains}} the same new age, krautrock and kosmische styles {{that were a}} part of their previous albums. However, in the words of journalist Derek Miller, it is much more [...] "sharp"er, concise and pop music-influenced than their previous works. In categorizing the album's overall style, critic Rick Anderson of Allmusic labeled it a [...] "slightly uneasy borderland between ambient music and avant-garde experimentation." [...] He compared the album's soundscape to that of 1970s electronic pop and synthesized classical music, consisting of slightly cheesy-sounding keyboard arpeggiations," [...] "waveform generators," [...] and [...] "sweet-and-sour analog synth sounds." [...] He called some of the record's material, including [...] "Candy Shoppe," [...] a more enthusiastic version of the works of Fripp & Eno.|$|E

50|$|Nowadays {{the wedding}} breakfast is not {{normally}} a morning meal, nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a typical breakfast, so its name can be confusing. The name is {{claimed to have}} arisen {{from the fact that}} in pre-Reformation times, the wedding service was usually a Eucharistic Mass and that the bride and bridegroom would therefore have been fasting before the wedding in order to be eligible to receive the sacrament of Holy Communion. After the wedding ceremony was complete, the priest would bless and distribute some wine, cakes, and sweetmeats, which were then handed round to the company, including the bride and groom. This distribution of food and drink was therefore a literal “break fast” for the newly married couple, though others in attendance would not necessarily take Communion and therefore would not necessarily have been fasting. Since usage of the phrase cannot be shown to date back earlier than {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century however, a pre-16th-century origin seems unlikely.|$|E
50|$|John Elliott, Steve Hauschildt and Mark McGuire {{began playing}} music {{together}} under the name Fancelions in 2005 in Cleveland's western suburbs of Bay Village and Westlake. Shortly thereafter, they re-formed as Emeralds, playing their first show under that name in June 2006. Since then the group has released over forty recordings on various independent labels. The album <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Like</b> I'm Here?, released on Editions Mego in 2010, is their most widely known release to date. It received the Best New Album designation from Pitchfork Media, the Album of the Year award from Drowned in Sound, and accolades from many other publications. Mark McGuire and Steve Hauschildt also perform and record under their own names, while John Elliott does so under a number of monikers including Outer Space and Imaginary Softwoods. The band also maintains multiple labels including McGuire & Elliott's Wagon, Hauschildt's Gneiss Things and Elliott's curated imprint Spectrum Spools.|$|E

5000|$|Silver called [...] "Exercise #3 (Buildings)" [...] {{the most}} [...] "pattern-based" [...] track on Exercises, [...] "mainly {{a set of}} cycles that build on one another, with some pads and melodies that offer an {{emotional}} core." [...] Compared by Worthington to Glass' piece Glassworks, it involves a progressive rock-style synthesized brass performing a fanfare over piano arpeggios and a harsh synth bass a la the Emeralds LP <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Like</b> I'm Here? (2010). [...] "Exercise #4 (Spirit)" [...] was the last recording completed for Exercises. It was inspired by British rock band Talk Talk's song “Wealth,” and its title derived from where [...] "Wealth" [...] came from, Talk Talk's fourth studio LP Spirit of Eden (1988). [...] "Exercise #4 (Spirit)" [...] was performed in improvisation and has a different palette of instruments {{in comparison to the}} EP's other tracks, including Yamaha DX7 sounds and pan flute samples. The track is constructed around a electronically-produced pump organ sound. Steve Shaw of Fact magazine wrote about the track, [...] "as clicky mid-range keys amble daintily beneath, a butterflies-in-the-stomach sense of quiet excitement is drawn out by increasing vibrato and breathy shakuhachi/vox chord gestures." [...] A rework of [...] "Exercise #4 (Spirit)" [...] was included on CFCF's collaboration album with Jean-Michel Blais titled Cascades (2017).|$|E
