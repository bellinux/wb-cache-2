40|$|Abstract: A popular {{hypothesis}} for {{the noted}} steady {{decline in the}} population of Steller sea lions, Eumetopias jubatus (Schreber, 1776), in the regions from Prince William Sound through the Aleutian Islands relates to their nutritional sta-tus. Sea lion diets appear to have shifted from primarily small schooling <b>fatty</b> <b>fishes</b> to low-fat fish such as walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma (Pallas, 1814). We examined the seasonal changes in proximate nutrients of pollock collected in the Bering Sea. Mean energy density (dry mass) of pollock peaked in October then declined and remained low throughout winter. Energy recovery occurred in the summer months with strong recovery observed in female fish caught in July. Contrary to whole fish carcass energy contents, both total protein and moisture contents were at their highest levels in winter (January) when total crude lipid content was at its lowest (p < 0. 05). This trend gradually de-clined to its lowest levels in the fall when lipid content was high. The decline in total lipids during winter seasons ap-peared to parallel gonad development during the prespawning period. Sex differences in energy densities were not found. Proximate analysis data for moisture, protein, ash, and lipid content also did not show any significant variation between males and females. Protein digestibility of pollock was higher (p < 0. 05) in the summer than in the spring, but not different for winter or fall. We concluded that the nutrient content of walleye pollock may have some impact on the Steller sea lions that feed on them, particularly the energetic value {{that appears to be}} low during important feed-ing periods for this marine mammal...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} health {{benefits associated with}} the consumption of <b>fatty</b> <b>fishes</b> such as mackerel. They provide important nutrients linked to their lipid, proteins, vitamins and minerals. As well as being {{a rich source of}} omega- 3 fatty acids, fatty fish is an excellent protein source. Fish provides proteins of high biological value which contains essential amino acids with high digestibility. There are many steps during pre-handling, handling, storage and processing which may affect lipids, proteins and vitamins of <b>fatty</b> <b>fishes</b> leading to the reducing nutritional values. To maximize the health benefits of fatty fish, it is therefore important to know how these steps will affect the different components of fish and how these compounds can be retained during different processing steps. The main aim of this work has been to study the oxidation of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins of white, black and whole mackerel muscle during chilled (+ 4 ̊ C) and frozen storage (- 30 ̊ C). The samples were either chilled stored for 4 and 9 days or frozen stored for 1, 7 and 12 months. The contents of protein carbonyl and total thiol were used to measure the extent of protein oxidation during fish storage. Protein carbonyl was measured by the use of a conventional DNPH-based and an ELISA method. The second aim was to evaluate the effects of protein oxidation on water holding capacity and protein solubility. The lipid oxidation during chilled and frozen storage of the same samples as used in the present work, have been evaluated in a master project and the results was used to consider the relationship between lipid and protein oxidation. The conventional DNPH-based method was found not to be a useful method for measuring the content of protein carbonyls in fatty fish like mackerel due to the incomplete resolubilization of the protein pellet in guanidine hydrochloride. Carbonyl contents of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein of all muscle types were relatively stable during chilled and 1 month frozen storage of samples. This could implicate that protein carbonylation was not developed in samples during refrigerated and 1 month frozen storage. However, the total thiol group generally decreased in myofibrillar proteins during chilled and 1 month frozen storage, which could be an implication of protein thiol group oxidation in those samples. WHC was relatively stable during chilled and 1 month frozen storage. Sarcoplasmic protein solubility was also stable during this period of storage while the myofibrillar protein solubility generally decreased. Frozen storage for 7 and 12 months significantly influenced the oxidative stability of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins of all mackerel muscle types. Sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein carbonyl contents increased significantly during frozen storage at - 30 ̊ C for 7 and 12 months compared to the chilled and 1 month frozen storage. At the same time, the total thiol group contents decreased significantly. These results show that duration of frozen storage has a strong impact on protein oxidation in mackerel. Increased protein carbonyl contents and decreased thiol group contents in 7 and 12 months frozen samples occurred concomitantly with a loss of WHC and protein solubility. It could be concluded that protein oxidation had a significant effects on the loss of WHC and protein solubility. Myofibrillar proteins had significantly higher carbonyl content, lower total thiol group content and lower protein solubility compared to the sarcoplasmic proteins in both chilled and frozen stored samples. This may implicate the higher stability of sarcoplasmic proteins with regard to protein oxidation and freeze denaturation compared to myofibrillar proteins. While the black and mixed muscle had a significantly higher sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar carbonyl contents compared to the white muscle, no clear relationship between muscle types and loss of thiol groups, WHC and protein solubility was observed. The results from the lipid oxidation study on the same mackerel samples show decreased level of TBARs after 7 months frozen storage. The increased carbonyl contents and decreased thiol group contents at the same time may indicate a correlation between protein and lipid oxidation progress in mackerel...|$|E
40|$|Lake Vättern {{has been}} {{contaminated}} {{with high levels}} of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for decades, which could be due to the release of wastes from industries and urban communities surrounding the water system. This has especially had a negative effect on <b>fatty</b> <b>fishes,</b> which could accumulate large amounts of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and thereby also become a source of environmental toxicants to humans through consumption. Most PCB analysis only quantify a handful of congeners, the so called indicator-PCBs (I-PCBs), but this might leave out important information. In this study, an existing analytical method was improved by supplementing with additional congeners to detect a larger set of PCB congeners in Arctic char (Salvelinus salvelinus) and European whitefish (Coregonus acronius) caught from Lake Vättern, Sweden. New pre-packed multilayer silica columns from CAPE technologies were tested and used to pretreat the fish samples prior to analysis with a Gas Chromatograph coupled to low-resolution Mass Spectrometer using Atmospheric Pressure Ionization (API GC/MS). It was found that modifications of the clean up method for PCBs were necessary, such as lowering the amount of hexane in the washing step and combining the two eluent fractions. The Arctic char and the European whitefish showed a fat content of 0. 18 % and 0. 74 %, respectively. Concentrations of detected congeners ranged from 0. 5 to 1470 pg g- 1 fresh weight (fw) in Arctic char and varied between 1. 2 to 6550 pg g- 1 in European whitefish. For Arctic char and European whitefish, the WHO 2005 -TEQ values were 0. 4 pg g- 1 fw and 0. 6 pg g- 1 fw, respectively. The greatest total PCB concentration of 25900 pg g- 1 was measured in European whitefish. The total concentration of I-PCBs (# 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) was 3710 pg g- 1 for the Arctic char and 13900 e pg g- 1 for the European whitefish. All obtained results were lower than those reported from other studies. Constructed congener profiles show that the two species have similar ratios of PCB # 138 and # 153. Differences are observed of PCBs with a higher chlorination grade, probably due to differences in migration patterns, habitats of the lake, diets, metabolism or bioaccumulation...|$|E

40|$|I sought {{theoretical}} {{insight on}} synergistic effects {{of resources and}} predators that are potentially relevant to the decline of harbour seals in Prince William Sound and to indirect effects of fisheries. Simulations predicted that compensatory foraging effort by seals will mitigate potential loss of energy reserves when resources decline, but only {{at the cost of}} higher predation rates, even if predator densities remain constant. A second study predicted net energy gain and predation risk per foraging dive, parameterising an analytical model with field data on seal behaviour, resource distributions, and use of depth by Pacific sleeper sharks and killer whales. Analyses suggested that risk of mortality from sharks and net energetic gain were greatest when seals foraged in deep strata, and empirical data showed individual variation in use of these strata. Plots of the individuals’ predicted energy gain against predicted predation risk fit best when relative danger from sharks was assumed to be much greater than that from killer whales. The first two studies combined suggest that, theoretically, overfishing of near-surface <b>fatty</b> <b>fishes</b> might increase shark predation rates on seals. A third model predicted an asymmetric trophic cascade in which indirect effects of sleeper sharks on resources were mediated by seal avoidance of riskier strata. Risk management by seals is predicted to reduce mortality on the dangerous resource (deep pollock) while increasing mortality on the safer resource (shallow herring), and the bycatch of sharks altered this dynamic. Although empirical data are lacking to test most predictions and various assumptions, the three models derive from first principles of behavioural ecology and provide a rigorous basis for predicting indirect effects of fisheries. Further, overfishing of sharks and of resources used by marine mammals are pressing global problems which cannot be addressed by empirical studies alone; indirect interactions between species are too complex to be elucidated without theoretical guidance and rapid exploitation often outpaces the acquisition of data relevant to conservation. Thus, theory presented here is important for assessing the potential damage wrought by different fishery scenarios, informing decisions that attempt to optimise exploitation and conservation, and guiding empirical research...|$|E
40|$|Host {{responses}} to systemic anti-cancer treatment play {{important roles in}} the development of anti-cancer drug resistance. In this thesis we show that splenic F 4 / 80 +/CD 11 blow macrophages mediate the resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics induced by two platinum-induced fatty acids (PIFAs), 12 -S-keto- 5, 8, 10 -heptadecatrienoic acid (KHT) and 4, 7, 10, 13 -hexadecatetraenoic acid (16 : 4 (n- 3)) in xenograft mouse models. Splenectomy or depletion of splenic macrophages by liposomal clodronate protects against PIFA-induced chemoresistance. In addition, we found that 12 -S-HHT and 16 : 4 (n- 3) function via the leukotriene B 4 receptor 2 (BLT 2) and G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR 120) respectively. Genetic loss or chemical inhibition of BLT 2 prevents 12 -S-HHT-mediated resistance and genetic loss or chemical inhibition of GPR 120 prevents 16 : 4 (n- 3) -mediated chemoresistance in vivo. Mass spectrometry analysis of conditioned medium derived from PIFA-stimulated splenic macrophages identified several unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) as the resistance-inducing molecules, of which LPC(24 : 1) is specifically released in response to 16 : 4 (n- 3) stimulation. When comparing cisplatin and PIFA-treated tumors with cisplatin alone treated tumors we found overall less gH 2 AX, a measure for DNA damage, and enhanced CHK 1 signaling, suggestive of enhanced DNA damage repair. Furthermore, PIFAs are unable to induce chemoresistance in BRCA 1 -/-;p 53 -/- mice, a model for loss of homologous recombination-mediated DNA-damage repair. In addition to MSC-mediated production of 16 : 4 (n- 3), certain fish oils and <b>fatty</b> <b>fishes,</b> like mackerel and herring also contain 16 : 4 (n- 3) and the concentrations found were within the range known to induce chemoresistance in mice. A healthy volunteer study showed that ingestion of 16 : 4 (n- 3) -containing fish oil or fish increased 16 : 4 (n- 3) levels in plasma with a peak 4 hours after intake. Interestingly, the fish oils containing relatively high levels of 16 : 4 (n- 3) (5 - 6 mM) were able to increase plasma 16 : 4 (n- 3) levels to values known to induce chemoresistance in mice even when they were ingested at the daily recommended dose. Taken together, we have identified and intricate network of lipid signaling by splenic macrophages that induces systemic chemoresistance in vivo via an altered DNA damage response...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{refers to}} a group of fat soluble steroids. The most {{important}} forms are cholecalciferol occurring in foods of the animal origin and ergocalciferol of the plant origin. Human accept them in the diet; the <b>fatty</b> <b>fishes,</b> fish liver, and some other foods like milk, eggs or yeasts are rich resources of vitamin D. Unlike the other vitamins, the synthesis of vitamin D can also take place in the living body. Cholecalciferol is formed in the skin from its precursor 7 - dehydrocholesterol by the effect of UVB radiation. The conversion efficiency depends on various factors. Two successive reaction steps are necessary for the activation of vitamin D. The first step of hydroxylation occurs in the liver to be formed calcidiol. Calcidiol is the principal form of vitamin D in the blood acting also as the indicator of body supplies. The second one takes place in the kidneys where calcidiol is transformed to calcitriol. Calcitriol is assumed as the active hormonal form of vitamin D binding to the receptor for vitamin D - VDR. The best known and the most explored function is the effect of vitamin D on the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Consequently, vitamin D also influences the proper functions of muscles and the immune system. It reduces the risk of the cancer and cardiovascular diseases by various mechanisms as well. However, there are assumed another effects of vitamin D on the human body, which are not fully yet understood and are the subject for further research. Calcium constitutes the major mineral component of bones and teeth. It is an essential nutrient and therefore it is necessary to supply it with food. Its content in foods is various as well as its usability from these. The major resources of calcium are milk and dairy products. Calcium is also present in eggs, mineral waters, certain fishes and food of plant origin. Especially, the plant resources usability of calcium is limited because of the insolubility of some calcium complexes. Calcium is essential for the composition structure of bones and teeth. Besides of structural function, it has a main role in the blood coagulation, neuromuscular transmission or muscle contraction. Vitamin D has an influence on the usability of calcium because of the efficiency increase of calcium absorption in the intestine. The lack of both micronutrients leads to skeletal diseases - osteoporosis, osteomalacia and rickets. The adequate intake of both essential part of food, vitamin D and calcium, is important especially for the growing children, elderly people, and pregnant and lactating women...|$|E

There was no effect of intake of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish,</b> fish products, total fish or use of cod liver oil supplements on the risk of T 2 DM. Conclusion: Lean fish consumption of 75 – 100 g/d had a beneficial effect on T 2 DM. It remains unclear whether lean fish in itself has a protective effect on T 2 DM or that lean fish consumers have a protective life-style that {{we were not able to}} take into account in this study. Unfavorable effects of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> consumption or use of cod liver oil supplements on T 2 DM were not observed...|$|R

The advice on fat was not associated with any difference in mortality, perhaps because it produced only a small reduction (3 - 4 %) in serum cholesterol. The subjects advised to eat <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> had a 29 % reduction in 2 year all-cause mortality compared with those not so advised. This effect, which was significant, was not altered by adjusting for ten potential confounding factors. Subjects given fibre advice had a slightly higher mortality than other subjects (not significant). The 2 year incidence of reinfarction plus death from ischaemic heart disease was not significantly affected by any of the dietary regimens.

40|$|Objectives Dietary {{intake of}} {{long-chain}} (LC) n - 3 PUFA {{in developed countries}} is low compared with recommendations. Fish is naturally rich in LC n - 3 PUFA, but is also a dietary source of heavy metals and organic pollutants.

Also, the contribution of margarines enriched with LC n - 3 PUFA was assessed. Design Published nutrient and contaminant data were used in a probabilistic model to calculate the simultaneous nutrient and contaminant intake for different fish consumption scenarios. Results The Belgian recommendation for EPA + DHA (0 · 3 % of total energy intake) can be reached by consuming <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> a minimum of twice a week, or by varying between lean and <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> a minimum of three times a week. At this fish consumption level, MeHg intake is not an issue of toxicological concern.

40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether habitual dietary intake of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish,</b> whole grains, fruits and vegetables, or a combination of them all, is associated with oxidative stress levels, measured as urine concentration of 8 -iso-prostaglandin F 2 α (8 -iso-PGF 2 α) in healthy women. Methods Eighty-one participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Mean age of the women was 26. 1 ± 6. 2 (mean ± SD) years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 22. 4 ± 3. 0 kg/m 2. The concentration of 8 -iso-PGF 2 α was determined in urine, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels were determined in blood. Participants' habitual fish, whole grain, fruit, and vegetable intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire. Results In the multivariate analysis, there was a significant inverse association between 8 -iso-PGF 2 α and high <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> intake (P < 0. 001). <b>Fatty</b> <b>fish</b> intake was positively correlated to serum phospholipid concentrations of EPA (P = 0. 001) and DHA (P = 0. 002). A borderline effect of DHA was seen on 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, but higher serum phospholipid concentrations of fatty acids were generally not related to lower F 2 -isoprostane levels. No overall effect from whole grains or fruits and vegetables was seen. Conclusions The results indicate that high intake of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> is related to lower levels of oxidative stress, but high levels of ω- 3 fatty acids in intake may not alone explain the effect. High habitual intake of whole grains or fruits and vegetables did not seem to affect the F 2 -isoprostane level...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{long-term}} effects on diet of dietary advice to eat {{fruit and vegetables}} or <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> are not well described. Materials and methods: From 1990 to 1996 3114 men aged 37 - 70 with treated angina were recruited from general practices in South Wales. A dietitian randomly allocated the eligible men to receive advice to eat more fruit and vegetables, or advice to eat more <b>fatty</b> <b>fish,</b> or both these types of advice or neither. In 2000, a brief self-completion questionnaire {{was sent to a}} sample of 1191 of the men known to be alive at the end of March 1999. Results: The questionnaire was returned by 944 of the 1036 men alive at the time the questionnaire was sent. Those given fish advice were consuming more <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> but the difference was modest 21. 9 g day(- 1) vs. 14. 0 g day(- 1) (P < 0. 01). The differences in fruit and vegetables intake between those given fruit advice and those not given fruit advice were small 373. 2 g day(- 1) vs. 351. 7 g day(- 1) (P = 0. 05). Discussion: Men of this age group may be particularly resistant to fruit and vegetables advice; population-based interventions or interventions targeted at women might be more effective...|$|R

Associations between exposure and birth weight and infant development at 6 months were also explored. Diet was assessed in mid-pregnancy by a food-frequency questionnaire. One hundred nulliparous 25 - 35 -year-old women of normal pre-pregnancy body-mass-index were chosen according to their intake of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish,</b> as <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> is a potential route of exposure. Intake of other foods of animal origin was also explored. Dioxin-like activity was measured in plasma using the Dioxin-Responsive Chemically Activated LUciferase eXpression (DR-CALUX) and quantified in toxic equivalents (CALUX-TEQs). Information on infant attainment of specific milestones was obtained by maternal report in a standardized interview. The sample mean was 46 pg CALUX-TEQ/g lipid. Plasma dioxin-like activity increased by 10. 7 pg CALUX-TEQ/g lipid (95 % CI: 1. 8; 19. 7) for the highest compared to the lowest tertile of total dietary fat intake but decreased by - 9. 8 pg CALUX-TEQ/g lipid (95 % CI: - 19. 4; - 0. 2) for <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> intake. The inverse association for <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> was explained by lower intake of high-fat food groups such as red meat, fats and oils, which were also predictors of dioxin-like activity. Plasma dioxin-like activity was not associated with birth weight, but an inverse correlation was observed with total developmental score (Spearman r=- 0. 23, p= 0. 046). Our study indicates that dietary patterns associated with high fat intake may lead to increased plasma dioxin-like activity and in utero exposure might be related to early infant development...|$|R

The aim was to investigate associations between fish intake and the MetS in a cross-sectional study of men and women. Fish intake, waist circumference, triglycerides (TG), HDL-C, glucose and blood pressure were assessed among 2874 men and women (46 – 49 y) in the Hordaland Health Study (1997 – 1999). <b>Fatty</b> <b>fish</b> intake was inversely associated with TG in men only; mean difference in TG between highest and lowest quartile of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> intake was – 0. 33 mmol/L (95 % CI: – 0. 51, – 0. 15).

40|$|Two {{successive}} {{randomized trials}} examined {{the effect of}} an increased intake of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish,</b> {{or the use of}} fish oil supplements, in reducing mortality in men with heart disease. The Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART) was conducted in 2033 men who were recovering from acute myocardial infarction (MI). Those who were advised to eat <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> (or who opted to take fish oil capsules instead) had a 29 % reduction in all-cause mortality over the following two years compared with those not so advised. The effect appeared in {{the first few months of}} the trial. The Diet and Angina Randomized Trial (DART 2) involved 3114 men with stable angina. Advice to eat <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> did not reduce mortality, and taking fish oil capsules was associated with a higher risk of cardiac and sudden death. The adverse effects of fish or fish oil were restricted to men not taking β-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, and were greater in those taking digoxin. Evidence from other sources strongly suggests an anti-arrhythmic action of fish oil, particularly after MI or in the presence of acute ischemia. The apparently conflicting results of the two trials may reflect different actions of n- 3 fatty acids in acute and chronic conditions, together with different effects of eating fish and taking fish oil capsules. A mechanism is proposed that could account for these findings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{cross-cultural}} differences in the frequency of fish intake and in motivations for fish consumption between people from households with (CVD+) or without (CVD-) medical history of cardiovascular disease, using data obtained in five European countries. Methods A cross-sectional consumer survey was carried out in November-December 2004 with representative household samples from Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Spain. The sample consisted of 4, 786 respondents, aged 18 – 84 and who were responsible for food purchasing and cooking in the household. Results Individuals from households in the CVD+ group consumed fish more frequently in Belgium and in Denmark as compared to those in the CVD- group. The consumption of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish,</b> which is the main sources of omega- 3 PUFA associated with prevention of cardiovascular diseases, was on the same level for the two CVD groups in the majority of the countries, except in Belgium where CVD+ subjects reported to eat <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> significantly more frequently than CVD- subjects. All respondents perceived fish as a very healthy and nutritious food product. Only Danish consumers reported a higher subjective and objective knowledge related to nutrition issues about fish. In the other countries, objective knowledge about fish was on a low level, similar for CVD+ as for CVD- subjects, despite a higher claimed use of medical information sources about fish among CVD+ subjects. Conclusion Although a number of differences between CVD- and CVD+ subjects with respect to their frequency of fish intake are uncovered, the findings suggest that fish consumption traditions and habits – rather than a medical history of CVD – account for large differences between the countries, particularly in <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> consumption. This study exemplifies the need for nutrition education and more effective communication about fish, not only to the people facing chronic diseases, but also to the broader public. European consumers are convinced that eating fish is healthy, but particular emphasis should be made on communicating benefits especially from <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> consumption. </p...|$|R

Design: Cross-sectional analysis of dietary intake using a computerised standardised 24 -hour recall interview. Crude means, means and standard errors adjusted by age, season and {{day of the week}} were calculated, stratified by centre and gender. Setting: Twenty-seven redefined centres in the 10 European countries participating in the EPIC study. Subjects: In total, 35 955 subjects (13 031 men and 22 924 women), aged 35 - 74 years, selected from the main EPIC cohort. Results: A six- to sevenfold variation in total fish consumption exists in women and men, between the lowest consumption in Germany and the highest in Spain. Overall, white fish represented 49 % and 45 % of the intake of total fish in women and men, respectively, with the greatest consumption in centres in Spain and Greece and the least in the German and Dutch centres. Consumption of <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> reflected that of total fish. However, the greatest intake of very <b>fatty</b> <b>fish</b> was in the coastal areas of northern Europe (Denmark, Sweden and Norway) and in Germany. Consumption of fish products was greater in northern than in southern Europe, with white fish products predominating in centres in France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and Norway. Intake of roe and roe products was low. The highest consumption of crustacea was found in the French, Spanish and Italian centres. The number of fish types consumed was greater in southern than in northern Europe. The greatest variability in consumption by day of the week was found in the countries with the lowest fish intake. Conclusions: Throughout Europe, substantial geographic variation exists in total fish intake, fish sub-groups and the number of types consumed. Day-to-day variability in consumption is also high...|$|R
