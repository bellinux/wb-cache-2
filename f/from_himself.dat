5|$|Fortune's novels all {{follow the}} same basic theme: a heroine — a priestess and initiatrix who is magically {{experienced}} and assertive — who meets a man and saves him <b>from</b> <b>himself.</b> In her later novels this entails the duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and bring them into balance.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1995, Červenko {{submitted}} {{his report}} on Operation Una to Tuđman, divorcing responsibility <b>from</b> <b>himself,</b> and blaming Vrbanac and Defence Minister Gojko Šušak. The blame was subsequently placed on Vrbanac alone, ultimately ending his military career. Mareković, who {{was expected to}} succeed Červenko as the Chief of the General Staff, was passed over in favour of General Pavao Miljavac when Červenko retired in 1996.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention <b>from</b> <b>himself,</b> Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E

5000|$|Abhibhāvayatana (Abhibhvāyatana, Abhibhāyatana), or abhibhāyatana (Abhibhāyatana, Abhibhāyātana, [...] "control of perceptions"), is {{a concept}} in Buddhism through which {{meditation}} is achieved in eight stages by mastering the senses. During this process, the practitioner separates <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> the physical world, frees <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> attachments to physical forms, and begins freeing <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> pain and pleasure of the material world tied to suffering in Buddhism.|$|R
5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame <b>from</b> <b>himself</b> to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
5|$|McKenzie {{was killed}} on 17 July 1889 by {{severance}} of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts {{were found on the}} body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's modus operandi to deflect suspicion <b>from</b> <b>himself,</b> and those who ascribe it to the Ripper.|$|E

5|$|In March 2009, Dave Whelan {{acquired}} {{a chain of}} fitness clubs from JJB Sports. In the process, Whelan used the business {{to set up a}} new venture, DWSportsfitness and announced that the stadium name would change to the DW Stadium in August. Whelan also announced {{that at the same time}} the stadium was renamed, its ownership would pass <b>from</b> <b>himself</b> to Wigan Athletic. Concerns about the future of Wigan Warriors were arrested in the same announcement, as Whelan extended the lease on the stadium by 50 years for the rugby league team. Before their match against Leeds Rhinos in July 2009, both clubs were given the opportunity to rename one stand, with the intention of renaming them in honour to a recognised player from each club's history. The rugby league club were granted the East Stand, which they renamed 'The Boston Stand' in tribute to the Welsh winger Billy Boston, As Wigan Athletic had spent many years in the lower leagues it was recognised that most of their players were not known, so the West Stand was renamed 'The Springfield Stand' after the club's former ground.|$|E

25|$|Without {{going outside}} his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking {{out from his}} window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (<b>from</b> <b>himself),</b> the less he knows. Therefore the sages got their {{knowledge}} without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so.|$|E
25|$|In this view, the Son and the Spirit {{are both}} one with God {{and in no}} way {{separated}} from Him. Thus, the Divine Unity consists of the Father, with His Son and His Spirit distinct <b>from</b> <b>Himself</b> and yet perfectly united together in Him, and the Filioque confuses the theology as it was defined at the councils at both Nicaea and Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|Ellington led the {{orchestra}} by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section. As a bandleader, Ellington {{was not a}} strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra {{with a combination of}} charm, humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away <b>from</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
25|$|The kibbutzim were {{established}} during the pioneer period {{and were the}} fulfilment of the Zionist vision, {{during that period of}} time every member was required to give the maximum <b>from</b> <b>himself</b> for the good of the collective: the kibbutz and the state. In addition, as a group it was easier to deal with the common problems of the individuals—which allowed the recruitment of a large number of people for maintaining the safety of the community at that time, and therefore this way of life was suited for the Zionist goals more than other forms of life at that time.|$|E
25|$|Aboutrika {{initially}} did {{not want}} to discuss the issue, but he broke his silence and spoke exclusively Al Jazeera's Carrie Brown.

He feels sorry for their starving and suffering, and has many worries about their safety. Aboutrika affirmed for the Egyptian Football Federation that he is responsible for any problems appearing on surface.
