50|$|Hydroquinones {{are one of}} the {{two primary}} {{reagents}} in the defensive glands of bombardier beetles, along with hydrogen peroxide (and perhaps other compounds, depending on the species), which collect in a reservoir. The reservoir opens through a muscle-controlled valve onto a thick-walled reaction chamber. This chamber is lined with cells that secrete catalases and peroxidases. When the contents of the reservoir are forced into the reaction chamber, the catalases and peroxidases rapidly break down the hydrogen peroxide and catalyze the oxidation of the hydroquinones into p-quinones. These reactions release free oxygen and generate enough heat to bring the mixture to the boiling point and vaporize about a fifth of it, producing a <b>hot</b> <b>spray</b> from the beetle's abdomen.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was the {{development}} of an antireflective (AR) coating technique that has the potential for high throughput and low cost yet is capable of producing films of good optical quality. Previous efforts to develop sprayed AR coatings had utilized titanium isopropoxide mixed with volatile solvents. These films worked well on smooth surfaces but when applied to etched semi-crystalline silicon surfaces yielded inconsistent results with more than 20 percent of the AM 1 incident light being reflected. In this program titanium isopropoxide was sprayed directly onto heater wafers (410 C) to produce a uniform AR coating even on highly textured surfaces. Tests on various types of solar cells yielded performance improvements for the <b>hot</b> <b>sprayed</b> AR cells that are equivalent to that observed for evaporated TiOx AR coated cells. As an extension of this effort a new double layer AR consisting of a bottom layer of <b>hot</b> <b>sprayed</b> titanium isopropoxide and a top layer of <b>hot</b> <b>sprayed</b> aluminum isopropoxide in methylene chloride has resulted in more than 10 percent improvement in cell output as compared to a single layer AR cell...|$|R

Combined 3 cLIF-phase Doppler analyzer measurements were also implemented to derive correlations between droplet size and temperature. Both sprays had different characteristics in terms of flow rate and droplet size distribution. The liquid spray was successively pre-heated, and the other spray was maintained and injected at ambient temperature. The thermal mixing {{will be discussed in}} light of a wide set of experimental results obtained under various experimental conditions, including different liquid flow rates, droplet size distributions and droplet concentrations. To analyze the potential effect of droplet coalescence on the mean local liquid temperature, both sprays were alternatively seeded with fluorescent dye.

The main pur- pose of this work is to design {{the model of the}} fuselage and to minimize its drag. The analysis of experimental data obtained in TsAGI and other research centers was made at the first stage of the work. All features of flow around parts of the fuselage obtained from experimental data were taken into account. The de- pendencies of the fuselage component drag, such as the bow, fairings exhaust pipes of helicopter, sponsons, and tail sectionof the fuselage, on their form are described in this article. At the second stage the fuselage geometry was created in program SolidWorks. All the features of the flow around various fuselage components derived from the experimental data were considered in designing. The third stage is calculating of fuselage model aerodynamic characteristics. The calculations were made in the program ANSYS CFX (TsAGI License № 501024). Boundary conditions were chosen so as to correspond to normal at- mospheric conditions at 1, 000 meters with velocity of flight is V = 85 m/s. The output of the hot jet from engines is takinginto account in computation. The purpose of this calculation is to find the optimal angle of the engine exhaust pipe whenthe <b>hot</b> <b>spray</b> does not intersect with the tail and stabilizer and creates the maximum of propulsive force. The volume of the grid in computational domain is approximately 13 million cells. Data analysis has shown that the fuselage has a 20 % less drag at cruising flight (аf = - 4 °) compared to the original model.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} detailed {{investigations of}} two different problems in gas-liquid two-phase flow, namely, a study of interfacial stability in a partially filled cylinder subjected to vertical oscillations and a study of heat and mass transfer from <b>hot</b> <b>spray</b> droplets injected into an closed vessel. The interfacial instability study considers experimental data taken from the author's previous work. Cylinders of various diameters, partially filled with water, ethanol or glycerol were subjected to a sinusoidal vertical motion. The critical acceleration, causing the interfacial wave to grow unstable, {{was found to be}} approximately constant for a given cylinder diameter, independent on the amplitude of the forcing oscillations. The experiments also indicate that the critical Acceleration always decreases with increasing cylinder diameter. A mathematical analysis of the interfacial instability is based on a stability investigation of a Mathieu equation. It is shown that the experimental data fall into unstable regions for a single, first mode of oscillations. This finding is supported by the experimental analysis given by Cilliberto and Gollub. The analysis shows the effects of the liquid column height on the interfacial instability to be dependent on tanh (k [...] l.). This multiplier is equal to 1 for the column heights of 250 mm, 500 mm and 750 mm, investigated, and a given cylinder diameter, thus having no effect on the results. Computational analysis of the interfacial problem is developed which is based on the simplified MAC method incorporating the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model for simulating the effects of surface tension. Computational experiments were run for water and glycerol, the two liquids of significantly different properties. The results are presented in the form of time sequenced plots showing the interfacial positions and graphs relating the interfacial wave amplitude and time. Stability of the interface is found to be dependent on the initial surface disturbance. Growth of the interfacial wave is observed in some cases. In the range of situations investigated, surface tension effects are found to have only a small influence both on the stability and frequency of the interfacial oscillations. The period of interfacial oscillations with no forcing vibrations is found to be in good agreement with the period predicted by mathematical analysis. Influence of the initial disturbance profile was also investigated. The results indicate that the interfacial wave adopts oscillatory behaviour similar to the other cases. The oscillation frequency of the interfacial wave undergoing forcing vibrations is found to match the findings of the mathematical analysis. The wave oscillates with an angular velocity equal to the multiples of the half the forcing vibration angular velocity, co/ 2. In the second investigation a testing rig was constructed to investigate the heat and mass transfer processes in dense hot sprays injected into an enclosed cylindrical vessel. Heat and mass transfer rates were investigated indirectly from the measurements of the gas - vapour mixture pressure rise in the cylinder. The experiments covered different combinations of the parameters influencing the processes. The number and size of spray nozzles, the vessel volume, the type of gas and the initial pressure level in the cylinder were investigated. The experimental results indicate that, for the range of solid cone nozzles tested, the heat and mass transfer characteristics are, to a first approximation independent {{of the size of the}} nozzles. The results also show that the rise of spray chamber internal pressure is directly proportional to liquid temperature and flowrate. An analysis, based on energy balances for the whole cylinder, has yielded a new dimensionless group incorporating the important parameters of droplet heat transfer namely the droplet velocity and radius, spray chamber dimensions, gravity, conductivity and convectivity. A good match has been found between the analytical results and experimental findings. An improved analysis, incorporating the effect of evaporation from drops, is also presented. It is based on simultaneous solution of energy and mass balance equations for a single droplet. Again, good agreement with the experimental results is found. Both analyses indicate that, for this particular case of dense, evaporative spray, the Nusselt number tends to have a value equal to I...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Many {{new drug}} {{substances}} have low aqueous solubility {{which can cause}} poor bioavailability after oral administration. The application of solid dispersions is a useful method to increase the dissolution rate of these drugs and thereby improve their bioavailability. So far, several methods {{have been developed to}} prepare solid dispersions. To obtain a product with the desired attributes, both the formulation and production processes should be considered. Areas covered: The most currently used methods to produce solid dispersions, such as the fusion method, <b>hot</b> melt extrusion, <b>spray</b> drying, freeze drying and supercritical fluid precipitation, are reviewed in this paper. In addition, the physicochemical characteristics of the obtained solid dispersions are discussed. Expert opinion: Solid dispersions can be successfully prepared by simple fusion, <b>hot</b> melt extrusion, <b>spray</b> drying, freeze drying and supercritical fluid precipitation. <b>Hot</b> melt extrusion, <b>spray</b> drying and freeze drying are processes that can be applied for large scale production. The simple fusion method is not very suitable for large scale production, but is particularly suitable for screening formulations. The most recent method to produce sold dispersions is supercritical fluid precipitation. The process conditions of this method need extensive investigation, in particular in relationship with the selection of the type of carrier and/or solvent. Both processes and formulation aspects strongly affect the characteristics of solid dispersion products. Furthermore, application of crystalline solid dispersions is gaining increasing interest because they are thermodynamically more stable than amorphous solid dispersions...|$|R
