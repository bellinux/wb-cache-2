5|$|In 1995 Jagger founded <b>Jagged</b> Films with Victoria Pearman. <b>Jagged</b> Films' first {{release was}} the World War II drama Enigma in 2001. That same year it {{produced}} {{a documentary about}} Jagger entitled Being Mick. The programme, which first aired on television 22 November, coincided {{with the release of}} his fourth solo album, Goddess in the Doorway. In 2008 the company began work on The Women, an adaptation of the George Cukor's film of the same name. It was directed by Diane English.|$|E

5|$|Alanis Morissette is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter and {{musician}} from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Morissette {{has released}} five studio albums internationally through Maverick Records: <b>Jagged</b> Little Pill (1995), Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998), Under Rug Swept (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), and Flavors of Entanglement (2008). <b>Jagged</b> Little Pill, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, and Under Rug Swept debuted at {{number one on}} the Billboard 200, and were among the top five on the Canadian Top 50 Album Chart. After leaving Maverick, Morissette released her most recent album, Havoc and Bright Lights (2012) independently via Collective Sounds.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's {{plan was}} for the 1st Canadian Division to attack across the Moro in the coastal {{lowlands}} to take Ortona first and then Pescara. Inland, in the <b>jagged</b> hills above {{the headwaters of the}} Moro, the relatively fresh 2nd New Zealand Division would attack toward Orsogna, while between these two the 8th Indian Infantry Division would hold the centre of the front in a relatively static role.|$|E
5|$|On fertile fronds, from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} on the underside of each pinna. They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by translucent, pale tan indusia with somewhat <b>jagged</b> edges. Each sporangium holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} or Danube newt (Triturus dobrogicus) is {{a species of}} newt found {{in central and eastern}} Europe, along the basin of the Danube river and some of its tributaries and in the Dnieper delta. It has a smaller and more slender body than the other crested newts in genus Triturus but like these, males develop a {{conspicuous}} <b>jagged</b> seam on back and tail during breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have <b>jagged</b> ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|Before and After Science is {{the fifth}} studio album by British {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it was originally released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the UK and by US Island soon after. Guest musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany helped with the album, including members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster. Over one hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical styles of the album range from energetic and <b>jagged</b> to more languid and pastoral.|$|E
5|$|Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most difficult climbs in the Philippines, and is thus a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and <b>jagged</b> summit. Another a suitable place for hiking and trekking is Mount Payaopao is Tablas. Meanwhile, Banton's Guyangan Cave System, an Important Cultural Treasure, is where the Banton Cloth — the earliest known warp ikat textile in Southeast Asia — was found in 1936.|$|E
5|$|None of {{them knew}} {{the color of the}} sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were {{fastened}} upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was <b>jagged</b> with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and <b>jagged</b> and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark {{was one of the}} many {{amphibia}} originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, its first scientific name, Squalus carcharias. Later, Sir Andrew Smith gave it Carcharodon as its generic name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' specific name and the current scientific name, Carcharodon carcharias, was finalized. Carcharodon comes from the Ancient Greek words karcharos, which means sharp or <b>jagged,</b> and odous, which means tooth.|$|E
5|$|Crested newts {{are dark}} brown, with black {{spots on the}} sides, and white {{stippling}} in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, crested newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake feature of the crested newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very <b>jagged</b> in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they were before the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of <b>jagged</b> coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, <b>jagged</b> 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a <b>jagged</b> asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left <b>jagged).</b> The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small <b>jagged</b> stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Pycnoporellus alboluteus, {{commonly}} known as the orange sponge polypore, is a species of polypore fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae. Distributed throughout the boreal conifer zone, the fungus is found in mountainous regions of western North America, and in Europe. It causes a brown cubical rot of conifer wood, especially spruce, but also fir and poplar. The soft, spongy orange fruit bodies grow spread out on the surface of fallen logs. Mature specimens have tooth-like or <b>jagged</b> pore edges. A snowbank mushroom, P.alboluteus can often be found growing on logs or stumps protruding through melting snow. Although the edibility of the fungus and its usage for human culinary purposes are unknown, several species of beetles use the fungus as a food source.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Knoetschesuchus is {{relatively}} short, with the snout taking up 47% of skull length in K. langenbergensis and 42% in K. guimarotae, which {{allows them to}} be classified as brevirostrine crocodilians. Along {{the side of the}} snout are two undulations, a smaller one on the premaxilla and a larger and broader one on the maxilla. The <b>jagged</b> suture between the premaxilla and maxilla is angled towards the front of the skull in K. langenbergensis and towards the back in K. guimarotae. Along the midline of the snout are the thin and wedge-like nasals; the nostrils, which face upwards, are clearly separated by the nasals in K. guimarotae, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the case in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|Today at Omaha <b>jagged</b> {{remains of}} the harbor {{can be seen at}} low tide. The shingle bank is no longer there, cleared by {{engineers}} in the days following D-Day to facilitate the landing of supplies. The beachfront is more built-up and the beach road extended, villages have grown and merged, but the geography of the beach remains as it was and the {{remains of the}} coastal defenses can still be visited. At the top of the bluff overlooking Omaha near Colleville is the American cemetery. In 1988, particles of shrapnel, as well as glass and iron beads resulting from munitions explosions were found in the sand of the beach, and the study of them estimated that those particles would remain in the sand of the beach for one to two centuries.|$|E
5|$|As Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, peak wind gusts of 165km/h, (105mph) were reported, with {{extensive}} damage also reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita all buildings except for the church were flattened with an estimated cost to rebuild the houses exactly as they were was estimated at A$12,000 (US$10,000 1997), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$84,000 (63,000 USD 1997). Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of <b>jagged</b> coral left behind.|$|E
5|$|As the Mary Rose {{was built}} and served {{during a period}} of rapid {{development}} of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of staves or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and breech loaded, from the back, and equipped with simpler gun-carriages made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one pair of wheels, or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, <b>jagged</b> holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, <b>jagged</b> slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|For {{transportation}} on the bay, steamboats were commonplace between Corpus Christi and Ingleside {{during the}} 1930s. Native Americans used a route {{made up of}} a series of shallow oyster beds, dubbed Reef Road. The passage, which was about 18 to 24inches in depth, could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into Corpus Christi Bay. White settlers discovered the road in the 1860s, and it became a common way to pass from Portland to Corpus Christi via buggy, although its <b>jagged</b> course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall off the beds and drown. A wooden causeway connecting Portland and Corpus Christi was first constructed in 1915, but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms. A permanent concrete bridge was erected in the 1950s, and a double lane was added in 1988. The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the most}} {{important}} steps towards an expressionist design were under taken by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. This began with St Paul's Church in the new town of Glenrothes (1956–57). This was a wedge-shaped construction of white-painted common brick focused on a dramatic, <b>jagged</b> metal cross by the sculptor Benno Schotz. From about 1960, all Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's churches were designed in this Late Modernist style, as at St Bride's, East Kilbride (1963–64), which had a rectangular plan. From the mid-1960s, they adopted a centralised, non-rectangular plan, with seating ranged round the altar, reflecting liturgical change. Sacred Heart Church, Cumbernauld (1964), was rectangular, of load-bearing brick, dramatically lit through dark coloured windows. Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun (1965) had a splayed plan and slanted ceiling. St Benedict Drumchapel (1965–67) had a prow-like roof on curved, laminated timbers. These innovative designs inspired others to experiment, including J. McCarron's Our Lady of Sorrows, South Uist (1964–65). However, many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church, citing structural or maintenance problems.|$|E
5|$|The Emancipation of Mimi became Carey's highest-selling {{album in}} the US since Daydream (1995). In its {{first week of}} release, it debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 with 404,000 copies sold, the highest first-week sales in Carey's career, until E=MC² opened with 463,000 in 2008. It became her fifth number-one album in the country and her third album to debut at the top. It {{remained}} in the top ten for many months before dropping to number eleven on September 28, 2005. The album remained in the top twenty for thirty-one consecutive weeks. It returned to the top five after the release of the Ultra Platinum Edition, which helped the album rebound to number four, with sales of 185,000 units. The Emancipation of Mimi was the best-selling album in the US in 2005, with nearly fivemillion units sold. By the last full week of the year, the album outsold 50 Cent's The Massacre, which had been released more than six weeks earlier. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album since Alanis Morissette's <b>Jagged</b> Little Pill in 1996. Ten months after its release, the album was certified six-times platinum by the RIAA, and it reached its 6 million sales mark in the US in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6–10cm (2.5–4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). The cap is initially hemispherical before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. The cap margin is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the cap margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of Sarcodon imbricatus. The gills are free (unattached to the stalk), white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may {{the top of the}} stalk when broken. With age, the gill edges can become <b>jagged</b> and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100–120 gills extend fully from the stalk {{to the edge of the}} cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to cap margin).|$|E
5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and <b>jagged.</b> The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to <b>jagged</b> rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E
5|$|Tired of the {{constant}} violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction. As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee {{the building of the}} Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He was asked if he wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto <b>jagged</b> rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly. His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.|$|E
