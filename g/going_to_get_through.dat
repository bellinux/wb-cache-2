500|$|President Clinton {{stated that}} after seeing images of babies being {{pulled from the}} wreckage, he was [...] "beyond angry" [...] and wanted to [...] "put [...] fist through the television". Clinton and his wife Hillary {{requested}} that aides talk to child care specialists about how {{to communicate with the}} children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: [...] "I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> this". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.|$|E
500|$|Although Safran {{initially}} {{intended the}} series {{to be an}} ensemble, with Alex the lead protagonist, this changed after Chopra was cast. As the show's [...] "face" [...] and featuring in its publicity campaign, Alex dominated the storyline and became the main character of the series. Although the character was initially written as Caucasian, Safran completely rewrote her character with Chopra in his mind, tweaking her background as she became half-Indian and spent ten years in Mumbai. Her casting also helped change Alex's personality; in one change, the [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] Alex became [...] "fun and warm". Safran initially focused on the character's dark side, {{saying that he had}} never imagined a positive side: [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control. And still warm and vibrant because she knew no one was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> her walls. From that point on, Alex was the kind of character who can have humor, who can have heart".|$|E
500|$|Following Chopra's casting, {{the series}} {{underwent}} a significant change. Safran had initially {{intended to make}} the show as an ensemble drama with no obvious lead, but after Chopra's casting, Alex became the main character and the show was re-structured around her. The character was initially written to be white, which was also re-written, keeping Chopra in mind. The background of the character was tweaked by making her half-Indian, with an additional backstory of Alex having spent ten years in Mumbai, India. Apart from changing her ethnicity, Safran completely re-envisioned the character. For example, Alex was initially written as [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] but was re-written as [...] "fun and warm". Earlier, the series was supposed {{to focus on the}} character's dark side because Safran had never imagined Alex having a positive side, which changed after Chopra stepped in the role. Safran said, [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control. And still warm and vibrant because she knew no one was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> her walls. From that point on, Alex was the kind of character who can have humor, who can have heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 2, 2007, two {{employees}} of Cheli's in Detroit were fatally stabbed. Megan Soroka, 49, was {{a manager at}} the restaurant and Mark Barnard, 52, was a chef. Police arrested Justin Blackshere, 17, who confessed to the crime. He was a busboy at the restaurant and was fired in November 2006. Blackshere's pregnant girlfriend had also been fired from {{her job as a}} dishwasher. Blackshere was found guilty of {{murder in the first degree}} on August 22, 2007. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole on September 7, 2007. Chelios took a leave of absence from the Detroit Red Wings to help the families of his murdered employees.

500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How am I <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> this day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{included}} {{a recording of}} [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] on their 1965 debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the session was marred by conflict and drama. After the band had completed the song's instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he wasn't going to sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day. The precise reason for Crosby's refusal to sing the song has never been adequately explained but the ensuing fracas between the guitarist and the band's manager, record producer Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby's chest, telling him [...] "The only way you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> that door is over my dead body...You're {{going to stay in}} this room until you do the vocal." [...] According to a number of people present in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears but eventually completed the song's harmony part with sterling results. Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer [...] "got it all out and sang like an angel." ...|$|E
500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world" [...] and Byrne considered his job as lyricist to [...] "bring more humanity" [...] to Eno's instrumentals, which can be [...] "cold and academic." [...] Themes of humanity struggling with technology are apparent on several tracks and Byrne has characterized the [...] "overall vibe" [...] of the album as [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> this. Humanity will prevail." [...] The lyrical content includes [...] "a sinister inflection" [...] but [...] "many songs feel fairly uplifting and the overall tone is hopeful." [...] Byrne focused on mundane events and attempted to write in a style that was [...] "simple but not corny, basic but heartfelt." [...] His inspiration in writing lyrics for [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was the story of ValentinoAchakDeng as told in DaveEggers' —the two are thanked in the liner notes and Byrne had previously performed at a fundraiser for Eggers' 826Valencia. The story of the LostBoys of Sudan is emblematic of the spiritual themes of the album as they go through [...] "all kinds of unrelenting horrors, but [...] eternally hopeful and even cheerful, in a way that defies all logic." [...] The music on this album also expresses homesickness—a lyrical trend that is apparent in Byrne's work with TalkingHeads.|$|E

He was appointed an honorary chaplain to Queen Victoria in 1867 and Chaplain-in-Ordinary in 1872; then served as Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons from 1874-89. In 1867 Byng was appointed vicar {{of the high}} church St. Peter's Church, Cranley Gardens, by Charles James Freake (who had the living of the church).

60|$|There is one unfortunate and perplexing {{phase of}} the voyage of the Snark. Roscoe, who is to be my co-navigator, is a {{follower}} of one, Cyrus R. Teed. Now Cyrus R.

Wherefore Roscoe believes that {{the surface of the}} earth is concave and that we live on the inside of a hollow sphere. Thus, though we shall sail on the one boat, the Snark, Roscoe will journey around the world on the inside, while I shall journey around on the outside. But of this, more anon.

2500|$|The Labour Party {{strongly}} opposed the rearmament programme. Clement Attlee said on 21 December 1933: [...] "For our part, we are unalterably opposed to {{anything in the}} nature of rearmament". On 8 March 1934 Attlee said, after Baldwin defended the Air Estimates, [...] "we on our side are out for total disarmament". On 30 July 1934 Labour moved a motion of censure against the government because of its planned expansion of the RAF. Attlee spoke for it: [...] "We deny the need for increased air arms...and we reject altogether the claim of parity". Sir Stafford Cripps also said on this occasion that it was fallacy that Britain could achieve security through increasing air armaments. On 22 May 1935, the day after Hitler had made a speech claiming that German rearmament offered no threat to peace, Attlee asserted that Hitler's speech gave [...] "a chance to call a halt in the armaments race". Attlee also denounced the Defence White Paper of 1937: [...] "I do not believe the Government are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any safety <b>through</b> these armaments".|$|R
