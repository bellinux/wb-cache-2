5|$|The third {{match was}} between Triple H and Carlito in which Carlito {{could not be}} disqualified. Carlito took {{advantage}} of the situation as he could use any weapon. He attacked Triple H several times with steel chairs, and threw powder in <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>With</b> the referee distracted, a blinded Triple H struck Carlito with a low blow followed by a Pedigree, leading to Triple H pinning Carlito to win the match.|$|E

25|$|Another legend {{is about}} the mysterious {{disappearance}} of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (an incarnation of Krishna according to the Bhavishya Purana). He established Gaudiya Vaishnavism and also known to have composed the Jagannath Astakam. He lived in Puri {{for many years and}} sang bhajans (devotional songs) and led sankirtan processions in front of Jagannath during his Chandan Yatra and Ratha Yatra, along with many devotees. It is also said that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu used to go into a rapturous mood watching the god's love play and dance with joy and also fainted many times due to emotion. Daily, he prayed to Jagannath, standing behind the garudastamba (Pillar of Garuda) with tears flowing down <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>With</b> permission of the king, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu once undertook the task of cleaning the Gundicha temple premises a day before the Ratha yatra (this tradition is followed even to this day by the followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism). It is mentioned that once Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, unnoticed by his attendants, walked towards the Gundicha Temple and was last seen entering the Manikotha, thereafter he was never seen again. This disappearance has remained an unexplained mystery as none of the books written on him have recorded this event. It is believed that he merged with Jagannath at the temple.|$|E

2500|$|Ali {{later said}} in round five {{he could only}} see a faint shadow of Liston {{during most of the}} round, but by {{circling}} and moving frantically he managed to avoid Liston and somehow survive.

2500|$|At 1:00 a.m. on March 29, 1988, Berdella {{abducted}} {{his last}} victim, a 22-year-old male prostitute named Christopher Bryson, whom he lured {{to his house}} upon the promise of payment for sex. At Berdella's home, Bryson was knocked unconscious with an iron bar, then bound to Berdella's bed, where he was subjected to similar methods of abuse and torture endured by previous victims, although in Bryson's case, Berdella repeatedly swabbed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> ammonia, before exclaiming to him: [...] "The only {{things you need to}} think about are you, me, and this house." ...|$|E

2500|$|Terry Garcia, National Geographics {{executive}} vice president for mission programs, said, in response to some of those protesting against the Tutankhamun reconstruction: [...] "The big variable is skin tone. North Africans, we know today, had a range of skin tones, from light to dark. In this case, we selected a medium skin tone, and we say, quite up front, 'This is midrange.' We will never know for sure what his exact skin tone was or the color of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> 100% certainty.... Maybe in the future, people will come to a different conclusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{one morning}} Kurnaz was given new orange overalls, {{and his head}} was bound in a gas mask, his ears covered with {{soundproof}} headphones, and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> thick black diving goggles. His hands were put in mittens. Blindfolded and so tightly handcuffed that circulation was cut off, he was punched in the face, kicked in the genitals, and left on the ground. Some hours later Kurnaz and others were chained together and herded onto a plane. [...] During the long flight, the prisoners {{were not allowed to}} sleep: [...] "the soldiers kept hitting us to keep us awake." [...] The feel of bright sun and extreme heat showed him that he had arrived in a different country.|$|E
2500|$|While he {{considers}} both the 1980 and the 1981 {{versions of the}} album to be [...] "mixed bags", former Mojo editor Mat Snow pairs [...] "the gentle, thoughtful 'Writing's on the Wall'" [...] with [...] "Life Itself", as the two tracks that [...] "stand out as deeply felt returns to singing of his spirituality". Leng recognises the same pair of songs as [...] "about the only reason {{to look into the}} 1981 Somewhere in England", with [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] representing [...] "the ultimate expression of [...] introverted music in an extroverted age". In his comments on the media attention afforded Harrison after his near-fatal stabbing in December 1999, Leng also remarks on the irony that the issues Harrison had addressed in songs such as [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] "were played out before <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> himself as the leading man".|$|E

On 20 May 2010, Grant resigned as the manager of Portsmouth. He announced his decision to leave in an open letter to fans on the club's website, stating that [...] "it was the hardest decision I have ever had to make".
