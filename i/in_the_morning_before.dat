5|$|Fingleton {{was unable}} to {{distinguish}} himself on the field while at school, but after joining Waverley, he made quick progress. Fingleton trained early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>before</b> heading {{to the office and}} working in the afternoon so that the articles would be printed in the evening. He {{was unable to}} afford the club membership so a patron sponsored him. At the age of 16, he broke into the First XI of a grade team which included Test players Alan Kippax, Hanson Carter and Arthur Mailey. Australian Test captain Herbie Collins missed a match due to his work as a bookmaker, and Fingleton stood in at late notice. Under the leadership of Carter, Fingleton batted last and made 11 not out. Forced to follow on, he made 52 not out and cemented his position {{for the remainder of the}} season. Within a year, Fingleton's grade performances were being reported in Sydney newspapers. Playing on a Waverley pitch notorious for uneven bounce, Fingleton developed a style of playe centred around solid defence.|$|E
5|$|Josefson {{played in}} his first IIHF sanctioned tournament when {{he was part of}} Sweden's team at the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships. He managed to score a hat-trick in the first game against Belarus. He left the team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>before</b> the fourth game due to an {{accident}} in which his father and uncle had been exposed to carbon monoxide poisoning. He made his second appearance at the U18 Championship the following year, at the 2009 IIHF World U18 Championships, where he also took the role as alternate captain. He managed to score three goals and seven points in six games. Josefson was a part of Sweden's national junior team at the 2009 World Junior Championships. He played in all of Sweden's six games but did not score any points. A few months later he yet again played for Sweden in the U18 Championship but could not help his team go further than fifth place in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke {{brought in}} Bill Sharman as head coach, and Elgin Baylor {{announced}} his retirement {{early in the season}} after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough. Sharman increased the team's discipline. He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>before</b> a game to practice shots. They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December. They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104. By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in American professional sports. The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96. Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game. West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game. The team failed to score 100 points just once all year, {{and at the end of}} the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year. The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E

25|$|Kent State/Cambodia Incursion Protest, Washington, D.C.: A {{week after}} the Kent State {{shooting}}s, on May 4, 100,000 anti-war demonstrators converged on Washington, D.C. to protest the shooting {{of the students in}} Ohio and the Nixon administration's incursion into Cambodia. Even though the demonstration was quickly put together, protesters were still able to bring out thousands to march in the Capital. It was an almost spontaneous response to the events of the previous week. Police ringed the White House with buses to block the demonstrators from getting too close to the executive mansion. Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>before</b> the march, Nixon met with protesters briefly at the Lincoln Memorial but nothing was resolved and the protest went on as planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{foraging}} {{activities of}} Vespula vulgaris are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is {{to satisfy the}} larval requirements. The workers fly off {{early in the morning}} to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because dews and nectars are most abundant {{early in the morning and}} are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>before</b> the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.|$|E

25|$|Simon Katich and Adam Gilchrist {{decided that}} attack {{was the best}} form of defence, adding 58 in only 8.5 overs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>before</b> England came back {{to take the next}} four wickets for the {{addition}} of only 18 runs, leaving Australia perilously placed at 175 for 9. Simon Jones was the main culprit, using swing to good effect as he removed Katich and Warne in successive balls, and then had Kasprowicz clean bowled. Brett Lee added 47 in 44 balls, including three huge sixes, to take Australia's score to 218, before he was caught off Simon Jones's bowling to give Jones his fifth wicket of the innings. Despite their aggressive batting, Australia therefore finished the first innings 259 runs behind.|$|E
25|$|Aged 13, {{the twins}} were invited by their uncle Bourne, then the captain of Bankstown's first grade team, to trial for the club's under-16 team for the Green Shield. They gained selection, but neither {{averaged}} more than 20 for the season. Aged fourteen, both made their senior grade cricket debut in 19791980, playing in the Fourth XI. The twins broke into East Hills Boys First XI in the same season, and achieved the same level in soccer. In 1980, the twins began playing for Auburn in the state soccer league. The twins generally played two games in a row, in their proper age group, before again with older boys. The same occurred in cricket, where they played in age group competitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>before</b> playing grade cricket in the afternoon. In 198081 the brothers were elevated to the Third XI mid-season. Mark's performance in the Green Shield saw him selected in Bankstown's under-21 team, still aged 15.|$|E
25|$|The Browns {{won their}} final regular-season {{game against the}} Hornets at Soldier Field in Chicago. Boedeker scored Cleveland's first {{touchdown}} on the third play of the game, a rush from six yards out following a Chicago fumble. Motley scored another touchdown eight minutes later {{at the end of}} a 63-yard drive. A fumble by Warren Lahr led to a Hornets touchdown in the second quarter, although kicker Jim McCarthy missed the extra point. Chicago threatened to score again in the fourth quarter after a fumble by Cliff Lewis, reaching the Cleveland three-yard line. Linebackers Bill Willis and Alex Agase tackled Hornets quarterback Johnny Clement for losses, however, stopping the drive. Cleveland won the game 14–6 as snowy conditions slowed the game. The players helped clear snow from the field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>before</b> the game began, but the turf was muddy and slippery. Graham had 88 passing yards, bringing his season total to 2,785. It was the highest mark of his career despite that the season was only 12 games long, two shorter than in previous years. A crowd of only 5,031 people attended the game, largely because of the bad weather. The AAFC's Chicago franchise, however, was also one of its least successful financially, competing with the NFL's Chicago Bears and Chicago Cardinals.|$|E
