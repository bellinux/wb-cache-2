5|$|Theologian and philosopher Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) {{proposed}} an ontological {{argument in the}} second and third chapters of his Proslogion.

5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E

These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

Jeremy and Alysa defeat Blood Fox, and in the town, Jeremy encounters Bartholomew, who split from Castello after an argument. Bartholomew tasks Jermey with recovering the Relic of Light, a powerful weapon that can be used against the vampires, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that Jeremy is still loyal to the order.|$|E

5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Beardsley {{was signed}} by Conference Premier club York City on 19 June 2007, to provide {{competition}} for Richard Brodie, Craig Farrell and Onome Sodje. He made his debut as a starter in their 2–1 home defeat to Cambridge on 11 August 2007, {{in which he was}} substituted on 62 minutes. Despite struggling for a place in the team, Beardsley turned down a loan move to Conference North club Tamworth in September 2007, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his worth at York. He suffered a broken jaw in two places during York's 2–0 away win over Grays Athletic on 22 September 2007, after being elbowed by Jamie Stuart in an off-the-ball incident, which was likely to rule Beardsley out for at least three months. Essex Police confirmed they were making enquiries following the incident. Beardsley returned to the team as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 1–1 home draw with Crawley Town on 1 December 2007. He finished his York career with nine appearances.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> to the team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, {{a combination of the}} league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E
