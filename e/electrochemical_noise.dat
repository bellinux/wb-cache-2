5000|$|On-line {{systems are}} {{a more modern}} development, and are revolutionizing the way {{corrosion}} is approached. There are several types of on-line corrosion monitoring technologies such as linear polarization resistance, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> and electrical resistance. On-Line monitoring has generally had slow reporting rates in the past (minutes or hours) and been limited by process conditions and sources of error but newer technologies can report rates up to twice per minute with much higher accuracy (referred to as real-time monitoring). This allows process engineers to treat corrosion as another process variable that can be optimized in the system. Immediate responses to process changes allow the control of corrosion mechanisms, {{so they can be}} minimized while also maximizing production output. [...] In an ideal situation having on-line corrosion information that is accurate and real-time will allow conditions that cause high corrosion rates to be identified and reduced. This is known as predictive management.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> {{refers to}} the {{spontaneous}} fluctuations in potential and current that can be observed on a corroding metal. The use of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> for obtaining information on the corrosion process generates much interest in research fields. One important application is the measurement of corrosion rate. This can be achieved using the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> {{of a pair of}} electrically coupled corroding metals to obtain an estimate of electrochemical impedance - an abstract quantity that reflects various aspects of the corrosion process. There are a number of problems associated with estimation of impedance information from the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> data, particularly regarding data pre-treatment, accuracy and precision. In addition, the present methods are incomplete: current literature does not offer information regarding the phase of the impedance; and assumptions regarding symmetry of an electrode pair cannot be tested without additional measurements. The thesis addresses the above mentioned problems. Specifically,analysis of the impedance estimation process is given to determine how precision can be affected by various factors;a novel signal processing technique is described that is shown to yield a local optimum precision;the application of the proposed signal processing to time varying systems is demonstrated by use of a time varying, frequency dependent impedance estimate;a technique for recovering phase information, given certain conditions, is suggested so that Nyquist impedance diagrams can be constructed; anda technique for testing the symmetry of a coupled pair of corroding metals is described. An integral part of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> analysis is the software used for numerical computation. The Matlab package from MathWorks inc. provides an extensible platform for <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> analysis. Matlab code is provided in Appendix A to implement ++much of the theory discussed in the thesis. Impedance analysis and many other electrochemical corrosion monitoring techniques are primarily used for uniform corrosion, where the corrosion patterns occur uniformly over the exposed surface. In order to map localised corrosion, where the corrosion is typically concentrated within a small area, a wire beam electrode can be used. A wire beam electrode is a surface that is divided into a matrix of mini-electrodes so that the corrosion rate at different points can be monitored. However, manual connection of each mini-electrode to the measurement device can prove cumbersome. The final chapter of this thesis describes the design and testing of specialised multiplexing hardware to automate the process. In general, the thesis shows that by careful conditioning of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> prior to analysis, many of the problems with the technique of impedance estimation from the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> data can be overcome. It is shown that the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> impedance estimation can be extended to encompass a time varying, frequency dependent quantity for studying dynamic systems; that phase information can be recovered from <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> for the purpose of constructing Nyquist impedance diagrams; and that asymmetric electrodes can be detected without requiring additional measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> associated with corroding metals places a number of requirements on the measurement system if good quality data are to be ob-tained. In particular, aliasing and quantization noise should be avoided. Analysis methods may ignore the ordering of the measured potential or current values by using sequence-independent parameters such as the mean, standard devia-tion, skew, and kurtosis, or they may take the sequencing into account by computing the autocorrelation function, power spectra, or higher-order spectra. When potential and current noise are measured simultaneously, additional meth-ods are available, including the calculation of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> resistance, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>noise</b> impedance, character-istic charge, characteristic frequency, and various cross-correlation methods. Newer, somewhat more speculative methods include wavelet and chaos analysis.

ENM offers several advantages: the measurement is relatively simple to make, it is completely non-interfering with the natural process occurring on the surface and the data are simple to interpret. The original standard arrangement for ENM using a pair of samples has limitations for practical applications because two separate and nominally identical working electrodes are needed and this requirement is very hard (if not impossible) to fulfil in on-site application.

In this study, the wear corrosion of cast CoCrMo, more specifically, sliding wear corrosion and abrasive wear corrosion (using ? 4 ?m SiC abrasive particles) have been investigated using a modified ball cratering rig with a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The concentration effects of proteinaceous material (25 and 50 % bovine serum) and pH levels, i. e. pH 4 · 0 (the pH for an infected joint area) and pH 7 · 4 (the normal pH for a healthy joint) on the tribo-corrosion performance of the alloy are explored. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been deployed to study the protein adsorption/corrosion of the alloy under static, non-abrasive conditions, whereas in situ <b>electrochemical</b> current <b>noise</b> measurements were employed to quantify the mechanoelectrochemical mechanisms present in the tribocorrosion of the alloy under dynamic conditions. In general, protein adsorption was found to be dependent on pH and protein concentration. Protein adsorption in turn influenced the overall tribocorrosion performance of the CoCrMo alloy, including the in situ <b>electrochemical</b> current <b>noise,</b> the specific wear rates, as well as the wear scar morphologies. The presence of bovine serum enhanced the separation of the bearing surfaces and for the sliding wear corrosion the wear rate was markedly reduced.

For the more acidic physiological environment, in comparison to pH 7 · 4, higher corrosion rates occurred under wear corrosion conditions leading to increased metal ion release.

40|$|The {{formation}} of crevice corrosion on type 304 L stainless steel when immersed in 0. 05 M ferric chloride solution {{has been used}} to investigate <b>electrochemical</b> potential <b>noise</b> measurements. The surface activity of the stainless steel was simultaneously studied using a scanning electrode technique to provide corroborating evidence of crevice corrosion. The spontaneous potential noise fluctuations were recorded in a freely corroding system with respect to a reference electrode. Power spectral densities calculated by fast Fourier transforms and a stochastic technique were used for the analysis of the time records, in order to reveal fundamental characteristics of the fluctuations resulting from the initiation and propagation of crevice corrosion. A stochastic analysis tool based on a Poisson process test has been developed and evaluated using data generated by computer simulation of both stochastic and deterministic processes, before applying the analysis technique to real corrosion processes. There appears to be agreement between the two analysis methods; both revealed the presence within the time series of stochastic and deterministic features. Using a combination of noise analysis techniques it was possible to obtain evidence of the different corrosion processes occurring on the 304 L stainless steel which were metastable pitting, propagation and termination of localized corrosion events, and the development of crevice corrosio...|$|R
