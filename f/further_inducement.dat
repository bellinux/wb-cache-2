[...] "It is rumoured that a <b>further</b> <b>inducement</b> to the crime may perhaps be sought {{in the fact that the}} {{deceased}} gentleman had a large sum of money in his possession in Bank of England notes at the time of his death. These notes he carried in a pocket-book about his person, where they were seen by the landlord of the Talbot Arms at Mambury, the night before the supposed murder. When the body was discovered by the side of the brook, two days later, the notes were gone. The pockets were carefully searched by order of the police, but no trace of the missing money could be discovered. It is now conjectured that Mr. Guy Waring, who is known to have lost heavily in the Rio Negro Diamond Mines, may have committed the crime from purely pecuniary motives, in order to release himself from his considerable and very pressing financial embarrassments." ...|$|E
50|$|The parents, {{accurately}} {{interpreting the}} British silence as disapproval, declined the French offer—to their sixteen-year-old daughter's dismay. This {{may have been}} only a maneuver by the Hohenlohes to obtain concessions from the French to secure their daughter's future interests. But before his ministers could press his case with <b>further</b> <b>inducements,</b> Napoléon gave up pursuit of a royal consort. Instead he offered marriage to Eugénie de Montijo, Countess of Teba, whom he had been simultaneously soliciting to become his mistress, and who had refused his advances.|$|R

Apart from local entrepreneurship, foreign direct investments (FDI) have been instrumental in enhancing industrial competitiveness. The Lisbon Agenda revival and Romania’s EU accession will be <b>further</b> <b>inducements</b> for Western businesses to shift production here to fight back both low-cost producers (typically from emerging Asia) and more quality-oriented producers (typically from OECD countries).

60|$|This {{must not}} be, I told her; and then, as <b>further</b> <b>inducement,</b> I communicated to her my recent loss, {{and gave her}} {{the idea that she}} must come with me to take charge of the orphan children, whom the death of Idris had {{deprived}} of a mother's care. Lucy never resisted the call of a duty, so she yielded, and closing the casements and doors with care, she accompanied me back to Windsor. As we went she communicated to me the occasion of her mother's death. Either by some mischance she had got sight of Lucy's letter to Idris, or she had overheard her conversation with the countryman who bore it; however it might be, she obtained a knowledge of the appalling situation of herself and her daughter, her aged frame could not sustain the anxiety and horror this discovery instilled--she concealed her knowledge from Lucy, but brooded over it through sleepless nights, till fever and delirium, swift forerunners of death, disclosed the secret. Her life, which had long been hovering on its extinction, now yielded at once to the united effects of misery and sickness, and that same morning she had died.|$|E
60|$|At the {{beginning}} of the unexplored country, an irresponsible person recommended him to go straight on. He couldn't miss the road, said he. It was straight all the way. Gethryn thanked him, rode on, and having gone a mile came upon three roads, each of which might quite well have been considered a continuation of the road on which he was already. One curved gently off to the right, the other two equally gently to the left. He dismounted and the feelings of gratitude which he had borne towards his informant for his lucid directions vanished suddenly. He gazed searchingly at the three roads, but to single out one of them as straighter than the other two was a task that baffled him completely. A sign-post informed him of three things. By following road one he might get to Brindleham, and ultimately, if he persevered, to Corden. Road number two would lead him to Old Inns, whatever they might be, with the <b>further</b> <b>inducement</b> of Little Benbury, while if he cast in his lot with road three he might hope sooner or later to arrive at Much Middlefold-on-the-Hill, and Lesser Middlefold-in-the-Vale. But on the subject of Anfield and Anfield Junction the board was silent.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. JONES, on {{rising to}} return thanks, being {{received}} with considerable applause, {{said he was}} truly grateful for the kind encouragement he had experienced, but the novelty {{of the situation in}} which he now was renewed all the feelings he experienced when he first saw himself announced in the bills as a young gentleman, being his first appearance on any stage. (Laughter and applause.) Although in the presence of those whose indulgence had, in another sphere, so often shielded him from the penalties of inability, he was unable to execute the task which had so unexpectedly devolved upon him in behalf of his brethren and himself. He therefore begged the company to imagine all that grateful hearts could prompt the most eloquent to utter, {{and that would be a}} copy of their feelings. (Applause.) He begged to trespass another moment on their attention, for the purpose of expressing the thanks of the members of the Fund to the Gentlemen of the Edinburgh Professional Society of Musicians, who, finding that this meeting was appointed to take place on the same evening with their concert, had, in the handsomest manner, agreed to postpone it. Although it was his duty thus to preface the toast he had to propose, he was certain the meeting required no <b>further</b> <b>inducement</b> than the recollection of the pleasure the exertions of those gentlemen had often afforded them within those walls, to join heartily in drinking [...] "Health and Prosperity to the Edinburgh Professional Society of Musicians."

40|$|An important, {{but little}} {{reported}} development in US {{business has been}} increasing numbers of employees with ownership rights in the corporation with an increasingly large economic value. Most comes through Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), which were established in 1974 partly {{as a response to}} anticipated shortfalls in Social Security, but also with the hope of invigorating the economy and distributing the benefits of capitalism more widely through broad-based business ownership. Experience and research indicate that ESOPs and employee ownership more generally do accomplish these aims, but large knowledge gaps remain. Research does confirm that individual employee-owners benefit from ESOPs. Equity comes on top of, not in place of, other compensation. Employee ownership is also associated with considerably greater employment stability and, in firms that simultaneously increase worker participation in decision making, the result is increased job satisfaction, organizational commitment, identification, motivation, and workplace participation. High profile cases accentuate potential risks through lack of diversification, but most employee-owners are less vulnerable than counterparts. Research confirms also that employee ownership, on average, leads to increased firm productivity, profitability, and longevity. Evidence suggests that combining employee ownership with increased employee participation may generate astounding returns on investment. Little is known, however, about management of employee owned firms and few projects even attempt to justify societal claims. Economists, managers, and financiers remain skeptical of employee ownership, and few studies directly counter their concerns. Problems associated with employee ownership go unstudied. For all the extent and appeal of employee ownership, it is on the fringe of both social consciousness and the academic literature. Employee ownership {{is one of the few}} issues on which the political left and right can agree, and is thereby capable of attracting strong support across the US political spectrum. Recent concerns about social security solvency suggest <b>further</b> <b>inducements</b> to widening ESOPs. Given this opportunity, increased knowledge can help promote employee ownership, help ensure its wise adoption and successful implementation, and intelligently influence public policy...|$|R
50|$|Auda’s tribesmen were reputedly {{the finest}} fighters in the desert, {{which is why}} his support and {{assistance}} were vital to the Arab Revolt. Auda had initially been in the pay of the Ottoman Empire, but switched allegiance to Lawrence and Faisal bin Al Hussein. With the incentives of kicking the Turks out of Arabia, and the lure of gold and booty, Auda joined the Arab Revolt, becoming a fervent supporter of the Arab independence movement (apparently {{going so far as}} to smash his Turkish false teeth with a hammer to demonstrate his patriotism). He was repeatedly approached by the Turks with <b>further</b> financial <b>inducements</b> if he would switch to their side, but he refused to go back on his word. He was an Arab patriot and he would ride with Lawrence. He and his tribesmen were instrumental in the fall of Aqaba (July 1917) and Damascus (October 1918).|$|R
50|$|Longbox {{packaging}} was {{phased out}} officially as of April 1, 1993 {{due to the}} controversy. At the same time, major retail stores were no longer selling vinyl records and had converted their displays to accommodate shrink-wrapped jewel cases, meeting the rising consumer demand for CDs while {{eliminating the need for}} longboxes.

50|$|Recruits {{were offered}} a two-guinea {{incentive}} payment if they {{volunteered for the}} Corps. A <b>further</b> <b>inducement</b> was that although enlistment as a British Marine was traditionally for life, members of the New South Wales Marine Corps could seek an honourable discharge {{after three years of}} colonial service. With an eye to the likelihood of delays in setting out, the three-year term would commence on arrival of the Fleet in New South Wales rather than the dates of enlistment in England. Marines who chose this option had no automatic right of return to military service after discharge, but in practice few were refused re-entry when their service expired.|$|E
50|$|It {{had also}} been tolerably well ascertained that, {{although}} fortified works had been thrown up on the right bank of the Seine, the defence of the left bank had been comparatively neglected. A <b>further</b> <b>inducement</b> towards the adoption plan arose from a report which was now received from Major Colomb (in the aftermath of his abortive expedition to capture Napoleon), stating that although {{he had found the}} bridge at Chatou, leading to the Palace of Malmaison Malmaison, destroyed; he had hastened to that of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, on hearing that it had not been damaged; and succeeded in securing as the French were attempting to destroy it. The bridge at Maisons-Laffitte, still lower downstream, was also taken and occupied.|$|E
40|$|For {{approximately}} {{the last fifteen}} years, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been mounting highly sophisticated undercover sting operations in Canada known colloquially as Mr. Big stings. These undercover operations involve multiple officers posing {{as members of a}} ruthless, powerful and wealthy criminal organization in order to trick suspects into making confessions to serious crimes, nearly always homicides. The undercover officers essentially orchestrate a chance meeting with the suspect, known operationally as the “target”, and exert their considerable influence and resources to convince him that he is being inducted into a criminal gang. The target is typically a person suspected of having committed a murder in the past, but who has never been charged due to lack of evidence. Over a period of months or weeks the undercover officers attempt to build a relationship with the target based on fear, greed, companionship, or a combination of those or other emotions. The target is given tasks to perform which appear criminal in nature, but which are actually staged crimes in which every participant is an undercover officer. The target is eventually told he must meet with the boss of the gang, the “Mr. Big” after whom the sting is named, in order for a final decision to be made on whether or not the target can join the gang. The target is told that he must confess to the previous murder of which he is suspected in order to join the gang. Sometimes the target confesses readily, other times he protests his innocence, but Mr. Big will not accept exculpatory statements. Often <b>further</b> <b>inducements</b> are offered by Mr. Big, most notably a promise to derail the investigation by using his influence over corrupt justice system participants. If the suspect admits culpability he will be charged with the crime and nearly always convicted at trial. Canadian courts have exercised virtually no control over police tactics in these cases. Defence counsel have argued against the use of the evidence {{on the basis of a}} breach of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms with regard to the right to silence and also with regard to abuse of process. These arguments have been unsuccessful. Defence counsel have also argued unsuccessfully that the statements should be inadmissible under Canadian hearsay law. It has also been argued, equally unsuccessfully, that the undercover operators should be treated as persons-in-authority, and hence that the statements elicited from the targets should have to be proven voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. Canadian judges have also been unwilling to allow the defence to lead expert evidence in these cases to tell the trier of fact about the possibility of false confessions. The ultimate result is that there is no control over police tactics in these stings. There has been one proven wrongful conviction as a result of these stings, that of Kyle Wayne Unger. Other wrongful convictions may come to light. Short of its outright abolition, probably the best way to control the sting and prevent wrongful convictions is to subject the statements to a formal voluntariness inquiry...|$|R
5000|$|Band agent Wally Jones sends telegrams {{to members}} of a band he represents, which is {{presently}} [...] "between engagements;" [...] leader Earl Gordon is blowing bugle at a race track, singer Linda Farrell is selling tickets at a movie theater, harpist Michelle O'Toole is working as a hat-check girl and other band members are playing golf. They are all instructed to go to Centerville, where Wally has arranged for them to audition for the Titan Tire Company's president, Mr. Gillingwater, who wants new talent for his company's radio show. When the band arrives in Centerville, however, they are told by Wally that Gillingwater has hired Benny Goodman instead. Although they have hotel rooms for the night, they are low on cash and contrive to get a free meal at a [...] "Magonnagle for Governor" [...] political rally. The small crowd pays paying {{little attention to the}} candidate until Earl and the band start playing, so Magonnagle hires the band to accompany him on the rest of his campaign tour. Magonnagle is running with the slogan, [...] "A Vote for Magonnagle Is a Vote for the Common Man," [...] but has little hope of beating the political machine that is backing corrupt, incumbent Governor Quilby. Composer Allen Clark shows up at one campaign stop, wanting to sell the band a song he has written. Earl buys the song for Linda, but Allen really wants to join the band as a singer. Wally finally hires him, partly to help carry his girl friend Michelle's harp. At one rally, Magonnagle is too drunk to speak and Allen delivers a brief pitch on his behalf. Mark Dwyer, a member of the corrupt State Campaign Committee decides to drop the ineffectual Magonnagle and instead run Allen as a candidate to avoid accusations of fraudulent election practices. Allen doesn't want to be involved, but Wally convinces him that it would be good exposure for his singing talents. Dwyer then introduces Allen to several political appointees, who are all cronies of his, and dupes him into signing continuing [...] "appointments" [...] for them. Allen does so, as he, too, fully expects Quilby to win. After Allen and Linda fall in love, Gillingwater asks the band to join his radio show, and Wally negotiates a thirty-nine-week contract at $10,000 per week. To Allen's surprise and distress, however, the polls indicate that he could win the election. Despite <b>further</b> <b>inducements</b> from the political machine, Allen wants to quit, but Dwyer threatens to break them all by revealing the phony [...] "appointments." [...] To protect them, Allen dismisses the band. Magonnagle then returns and tells Linda about the political crooks backing Allen, and thinking that Allen has become one of them, she leaves with the band. In his closing campaign speech, prompted by Magonnagle, Allen denounces Dwyer and his political machine. Linda and the band hear Allen's speech on their bus's radio and return to help him escape from Dwyer. With Allen safely on board, the bus is pursued by police. When the police finally catch up with the bus, they inform Allen that Quilby has conceded the election to him. His friends convince Allen that he can be both governor and radio singer.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{no visible}} moving blades in this fan. The blade is hidden inside the {{pedestal}} of the fan. In 2009 James Dyson first introduces a new {{innovation in the}} bladeless fan by adding air-multiplier technology. This Dyson air-multiplier fan generates airflow up to 55mph. [...] The fan contains a brushless electric motor and this motor rotates nine asymmetrical aligned blades that attach with a rotor. Usually, the upper frame of this fan is ring shaped. The frame is not flat; rather it is manufactured such that the edge can create a curve of a 16-degree angle slope.The air flows through the channel in the pedestal of the fan when the motor is turned on. After that, the air flows through the hollow tube. Then the air is shot out through 16-mm slits. This air flows smoothly, rather than turbulently as with a blade fan. The curvature of the inner wall of the fan creates an area of negative pressure - like an airplane wing - to draw more air into the flow, hence [...] "multiplying" [...] it. This property of the air is called <b>inducement.</b> <b>Further,</b> the air surrounding {{the edges of the}} fan also begins to flow with the direction of the breeze, or is [...] "entrained" [...] to it. Dyson claims that the air-multiplier technology increases the output of the air flowing through the tube by at least 15 times compared to the airflow put out by a traditional bladed fan.|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{regulations}} {{implemented by}} administrative agencies {{have often been}} met with fierce political resistance from regulated parties. In some instances, regulated parties have turned to legislative and judicial bodies for relief from environmental regulation. As these political and legal battles have escalated, several forms of compromises have evolved. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in its administration of the Endangered Species Act, has often utilized the tool of "Habitat Conservation Planning" as {{a means by which}} some regulatory relief is granted in exchange for an agreement by the regulated party to undertake mitigation measures to aid endangered or threatened species.

40|$|Abstract only. Most {{adolescent}} {{substance abusers}} neither seek out nor receive formal treatment for their substance abuse. Despite this, most adolescent substance abusers eventually curb their substance use by their {{mid to late}} 20 ’s (Fillmore, 1988; Kandel and Raveis, 1989; Labouvie, 1996; Pape and Hammer, 1996). One explanation for this concerns {{the nature of the}} teenage years that encourages experimentation {{with a wide variety of}} behaviours, including substance use. This need for rebellion and experimentation is not as strong for someone in their late 20 ’s. Another explanation concerns the process of ‘‘natural recovery’’, where individuals simply identify and rectify their problems themselves (Burman, 1997; Granfield & Cloud, 1999). Sometimes overlooked are the ‘‘interventions’’ contributing to this phenomenon. Environmental pressures are usually involved when people decide to make important changes in their life. There are pervasive influences operating in the environments of almost all adolescent substance abusers discouraging substance use. Anti-drug messages are prevalent in the media, in school, and often in family and peer contexts. The problems that sometimes occur because of substance use (parental conflict, peer conflict, school problems, physical sequelae, employment consequences) provide <b>further</b> <b>inducement</b> for change. The new roles that develop in the mid to late 20 ’s (jobs, marriage, parenting) are other things that tend to conflict with continued substance use (Kandel and Raveis, 1989; Labouvie, 1996). Thus, it is important to recognize that ‘‘interventions’’ for adolescent substance abuse are pervasive. And, for the most part, they can be said to be effective. It is a continuum between these types of environmental pressures and formal treatment programs. Somewhat intermediate are meetings an adolescent may have with his/her school counselor or family physician, or attendance at drop-in group counseling sessions provided in many high schools for substance use and abuse (Wagner, Brown, Monti, Myers and Waldron, 1999).

40|$|Extensive {{evidence}} supports {{the view that}} reading acquisition is dependent upon the mapping between spelling (orthography) and sound (phonics) (see Gleitman 2 ̆ 6 Rozin 1977 for a review). There exists one population for whom this spelling to sound correspondence is naturally dissociated, the congenitally deaf. Reading and writing are essential modes of communication for this group. Yet, few achieve better than a third grade reading level (Wrightston et al., 1963); a fact which is predictable on theoretical grounds. ^ Phonics without sound {{is an attempt to}} learn whether the deaf compensate for the lack of spelling-sound rules by creating an alternative route to phonics. Fingerspelling, a segment of the American Sign Language which provides a one to one mapping between handshape and alphabetic letter, may provide that alternative. ^ Twenty-six second generation deaf students were studied to investigate how they naturally approach the reading task, i. e., to investigate whether they do employ a manual 2 ̆ 2 phonics. 2 ̆ 2 Specifically, the research posed two questions: (1) Do the deaf transform (decode or recode) print into an alternate 2 ̆ 2 phonics 2 ̆ 2 mode? (2) Can the deaf transform print into an alternate phonics? The second question is a composite of two further issues: (a) Are the deaf students competent metalinguists? (Can they segment their language to the level of fingerspelled handshapes that will map directly onto alphabetic letters?); and (b) can the deaf actually perform the mapping from segmented handshapes onto letters? These two processes, segmentation and mapping jointly define the conditions for decoding print. ^ Results from seven studies of congenitally deaf students (age range 4 - 16 years; reading level range pre-primer - 6 th grade; with most of the readers congregated at the 3 rd grade reading level or below) fail to yield any evidence that they naturally decode print into a phonics based form. The students are overwhelmingly capable, however, of creating a manual 2 ̆ 2 phonics 2 ̆ 2 [...] of segmenting to handshape and of mapping handshapes onto letters. <b>Further,</b> <b>inducement</b> of the fingerspelled decoding does seem to benefit a majority of the readers. A detailed presentation of these results and possible explanations for why the deaf do not exercise their phonic capabilities are discussed at length in this thesis. ...|$|E
