50|$|A common {{presentation}} of hyperkalemia {{is in the}} patient with end-stage renal disease who has missed a dialysis appointment and presents with weakness, nausea, and broad QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram. (Note however that patients with chronic kidney disease are often more tolerant of high potassium levels as their body often adapts to it.) Several medications, for example the antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or an ACE inhibitor, {{can also lead to}} the development of significant hyperkalemia. The electrocardiogram will show tall, peaked T waves (often larger than the R wave) or can degenerate into a sine wave as the QRS complex widens. Immediate initial therapy is the administration of calcium, either as calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. This stabilizes the electrochemical potential of cardiac myocytes, thereby preventing the development of fatal arrhythmias. This is, however, only a temporizing measure. Other temporizing measures may include nebulized salbutamol, intravenous insulin (usually given in combination with glucose), and sodium bicarbonate which all temporarily drive potassium into the interior of cells. Definitive treatment of hyperkalemia requires actual excretion of potassium, either through urine (which can be facilitated by administration of loop diuretics such as furosemide) or in the stool (which is accomplished by giving sodium polystyrene sulfonate <b>enterally,</b> where it will bind potassium in the GI tract.) Severe cases will require emergent hemodialysis.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Erythropoietin (Epo) receptors {{are present}} on enterocytes of fetal and {{neonatal}} small bowel but {{the role of}} Epo in the bowel is not known.  AIMS—We tested the following hypotheses: (1) <b>enterally</b> dosed Epo is absorbed from the intestines of neonatal rats, (2) Epo acts as a trophic factor in developing small bowel, and (3) the trophic effects of Epo are dependant on the route of administration.  METHODS—The dose dependant effects of <b>enterally</b> dosed recombinant human erythropoietin (rEpo 0 - 1000 U/kg/day) were studied in artificially raised rat pups and compared with dam raised controls and dam raised pups given rEpo in rat milk. After one week, reticulocyte counts, haematocrits, and plasma Epo concentrations were measured, and calibrated morphometric measurements of villi were performed. The effects of route of rEpo administration (enteral v parenteral) on erythropoiesis, bowel growth, and disaccharidase activity were studied in nursing pups treated for one and two weeks.  RESULTS—Serum Epo concentrations ranged from undetectable (< 0. 6 mU/ml) to 8. 4  mU/ml in control and <b>enterally</b> dosed pups (median 1. 8  mU/ml), and from 4. 9  to 82. 3  mU/ml (median 20. 4  mU/ml) in parenterally dosed animals. No increase in haematocrit or reticulocyte count was noted in <b>enterally</b> treated pups compared with controls after up to two weeks of treatment. Small bowel length was greater in rEpo treated pups, and a dose dependent increase in villus surface area which was independent of the route of dosing and associated with increased BrdU uptake was found.  CONCLUSIONS—rEpo is not <b>enterally</b> absorbed in an intact and functional form from the intestines of neonatal rat pups. Thus <b>enterally</b> dosed rEpo has no erythropoietic effects. However, rEpo acts as a trophic factor in developing rat small bowel whether given <b>enterally</b> or parenterally.    Keywords: erythropoietin; enterocytes; breast milk; development; neonate; ra...|$|E

Our aim was to quantify the net portal absorption, first-pass metabolism, and whole-body flux of <b>enterally</b> infused AKG. In study 1, we quantified the net portal nutrient absorption in young pigs (n = 9) given an intraduodenal infusion of milk replacer [10 mL/(kg. h) ] and either saline (control) or 930 mu mol/(kg. h) AKG for 4 h. In study 2, we quantified the luminal disappearance of a duodenal AKG bolus in young pigs (n = 7). In study 3, we quantified the whole-body kinetics of C- 13 -AKG metabolism when infused either <b>enterally</b> (n = 9) or intravenously (n = 9) in young pigs. In study 1, {{when compared with the}} control group, enteral AKG infusion increased (P < 0. 01) the arterial (13. 8 +/- 1. 7 vs. 27. 4 +/- 3. 6 mu mol/L) and portal (22. 0 +/- 1. 4 vs. 64. 6 +/- 5. 9 mu mol/L) AKG concentrations and the net portal absorption of AKG [19. 7 +/- 2. 8 vs. 95. 2 +/- 12. 0 mu mol/(kg. h) ]. The mean fractional portal appearance of <b>enterally</b> infused AKG was 10. 23 +/- 1. 3 %. In study 2, the luminal disappearance of AKG was 663 mu mol/(kg. h), representing 63 % of the intraduodenal dose. In study 3, the whole-body C- 13 -AKG flux [4685 +/- 666 vs. 801 +/- 67 mu mol/(kg. h) ] was higher (P < 0. 05) when given <b>enterally</b> than intravenously, but (CO 2) -C- 13 recovery was not different (37. 3 +/- 1. 0 vs. 36. 2 +/- 0. 7 % dose). The first-pass splanchnic C- 13 -AKG utilization was similar to 80 %, of which 30 % was oxidized to (CO 2) -C- 13.

40|$|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cytokines are {{essential}} {{for the prevention of}} microbial infections. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in infancy is associated with an increased risk of infection, and this could be related to altered cytokine production. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine if cytokine production is altered in monocytes from surgical infants receiving TPN. METHODS: There were 3 study groups: (a) infants receiving TPN, (b) <b>enterally</b> fed healthy control infants, and (c) <b>enterally</b> fed healthy control adults. Blood samples were incubated with either Escherichia coli LPS, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or with medium alone. Flow cytometry was used to measure monocyte intracellular cytokine: tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 1 beta. RESULTS: After LPS stimulation, the percent of monocytes producing TNF-alpha and IL- 6 were lower in infants on TPN than both control infants and adults. This was most apparent for TNF-alpha. The difference for IL- 1 beta was significant only between infant on TPN and control adults. When blood was stimulated with S. epidermidis, all 3 cytokines were significantly lower in the TPN group compared with control adults. However, the differences between infants on TPN and infant controls only reached statistical significance for IL- 6. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory response to bacterial challenge is impaired in infants on TPN compared with <b>enterally</b> fed infants or adults. The pattern of this response may be dependent on the nature of the microbial challenge. Our results indicate that the susceptibility of TPN-fed surgical infants to bacterial infections may in part be caused by impaired cytokine responses after bacterial invasion...|$|E
