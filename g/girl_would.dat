5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> {{make a good}} ballet story. His first {{idea was}} to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> drop dead.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
25|$|In October, {{several months}} after the wedding, Commonwealth leaders pledged that they would {{implement}} changes in British royal succession law to adopt absolute primogeniture, meaning that the first child of the Duke and Duchess, whether boy or <b>girl,</b> <b>would</b> be next in line to the throne after their father.|$|E

25|$|On May 11, 2012, it was {{announced}} Gossip <b>Girl</b> <b>would</b> return for a shortened sixth and final season, which premiered on October 8, 2012. During the CW upfronts, network president Mark Pedowitz said the number of episodes {{had not yet been}} decided and could consist of 10, 11, or 13 episodes with a retrospective, meaning it would end before Christmas.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 2012, {{executive}} producers Stephanie Savage and Sara Goodman {{told the}} reveal {{of who was}} behind Gossip <b>Girl</b> <b>would</b> happen in the sixth and final season. Savage said they didn't plan at first to reveal the identity of Gossip Girl but that they changed their minds because of the fifth season's storyline. On November 14, 2012, TVLine announced {{there would be a}} flashforward in the finale. Savage later told there would also be a flashback.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Stó:lō girls {{went through}} puberty rites {{at the time}} of their first menstruation. A {{pubescent}} <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> be brought to a pit lined with cedar boughs and told to remain there during daylight hours, leaving only to eat and sleep. Women would bring her fir boughs and instruct her to pick out the needles one at a time, but this was the only work she would be allowed to do; other women would feed and wash the girl until her first menstrual period was over. This custom was practiced widely, at least until youth were sent to residential schools.|$|E

25|$|Every {{morning and}} night she would visit the Temple {{to recite the}} prayers for the day. On the birthdays of Osiris and Isis she would observe the ancient food abstentions, and bring offerings of beer, wine, bread, and tea {{biscuits}} to the Chapel of Osiris. The Lament of Isis and Osiris, which she learned as a <b>girl,</b> <b>would</b> also be recited. She turned one of the temple rooms into a personal office, where she carried out her work and befriended a cobra whom she fed on a regular basis, to the alarm of the temple guards.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{expansion}} in Henry and Clem's South Bend business came from their {{being in the}} right place {{to meet the needs of}} the California Gold Rush that began in 1849. From his wheelbarrow enterprise at Placerville, John M. had amassed $8,000. In April 1858, he quit and moved out to apply this to financing the vehicle manufacturing of H & C Studebaker, which was already booming because of a big order to build wagons for the US Army. In 1857, they had also built their first carriage—"Fancy, hand-worked iron trim, the kind of courting buggy any boy and <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> be proud to be seen in".|$|E
25|$|Odetta {{was born}} in Birmingham, Alabama. She grew up in Los Angeles, where she {{attended}} Belmont High School. She then studied music at Los Angeles City College while employed as a domestic worker. She had operatic training {{from the age of}} 13. Her mother hoped she would follow Marian Anderson, but Odetta doubted a large black <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> ever perform at the Metropolitan Opera. Her first professional experience was in musical theater in 1944, as an ensemble member for four years with the Hollywood Turnabout Puppet Theatre, working alongside Elsa Lanchester. In 1949, she joined the national touring company of the musical Finian's Rainbow.|$|E

5000|$|Ellen Gruenbaum reports that, in Sudan in the 1970s, cut {{girls from}} an Arab ethnic group would mock uncut Zabarma girls with Ya, Ghalfa! ("Hey, unclean!"). The Zabarma <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> respond Ya, mutmura! (A mutmara was a storage pit for grain that was {{continually}} opened and closed, like an infibulated woman.) But despite throwing the insult back, the Zabarma <b>girls</b> <b>would</b> ask their mothers, [...] "What's the matter? Don't we have razor blades like the Arabs?" ...|$|R

25|$|At {{one time}} {{it was said that}} {{appearing}} as a Bond <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> damage an actress's career. Lois Chiles is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of Holly Goodhead, but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in Casino Royale (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role might have on their careers. At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress Eva Green agreed {{to play the role of}} Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won BAFTA's Rising Star Award for her performance. Rosamund Pike, who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in Die Another Day (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for Gone Girl.|$|E
500|$|Other suitors {{within the}} family were suggested, among them Olga's first cousin once removed Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia. Alexandra refused to {{entertain}} the idea of her innocent daughter marrying the jaded, much older Boris Vladimirovich. [...] "An inexperienced <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> suffer terribly, to have her husband 4, or 5th hand or more", Alexandra wrote. She was also aware that Olga's heart lay elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|In March 1940, Schmidt {{was told}} to {{continue}} business {{as if nothing had}} happened, except now she had a special book of twenty additional girls she should only show to certain clients. If a customer used the phrase [...] "I come from Rothenburg", she was instructed to show him the book, allow him make his decision and call for the girl he had selected. The <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> then spend the night with the guest and depart later.|$|E

500|$|Trips {{away from}} the {{boarding}} house were uncommon; the Lowell girls worked and ate together. [...] However, half-days and short paid vacations were possible {{due to the nature}} of the piece-work; one <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> work the machines of another in addition to her own such that no wages would be lost. These close quarters fostered community as well as resentment. Newcomers were mentored by older women in areas such as dress, speech, behavior, and the general ways of the community.|$|E
500|$|... "Fo' Dolla'", set {{in part on}} {{the island}} of Bali-ha'i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a Princeton {{graduate}} and scion of a wealthy Main Line family. [...] Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, Bloody Mary, Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society. [...] He leaves for battle (where he will die) as Bloody Mary proceeds with her backup plan, to affiance Liat to a wealthy French planter on the islands. Cable struggles, during the story, with his own racism: he is able to overcome it sufficiently to love Liat, but not enough to take her home.|$|E
500|$|When it {{was decided}} that Kashimashi: Girl Meets <b>Girl</b> <b>would</b> begin {{serialization}} in MediaWorks' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh, Satoru Akahori wondered what kind of a message he could send to the readers, and eventually decided he wanted to write a steady message of [...] "true love". Akahori noted that up to the creation of Kashimashi, the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of ecchi content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in Kashimashi. He wondered if the story would be interesting, and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works, if he wrote a true love story without much ecchi or fan service.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of This Is What the Truth Feels Like, several news outlets speculated that the lyrics of [...] "Rare" [...] may be written about Shelton's ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. An article from Fox News {{reported}} that [...] "the lyrics {{appear to be a}} slam at Lambert for letting Shelton go", particularly [...] "You're rare / And only a stupid <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> let it go". Andrew Leung of Music Mic, who described the song as [...] "a mid-tempo love ballad", also thought that the same lyrics pointed towards Lambert. Lauren DuBois of EnStars stated that [...] "the song seems to allege that [...] was the one who walked away from the relationship she had with Shelton, not the other way around." [...] Gossip website Hollywoodlife.com stated that in the song, Stefani praises Shelton but [...] "totally disses Lambert".|$|E
500|$|In {{some regions}} of {{southern}} Montenegro, {{such as the}} Bay of Kotor, Grbalj, and Zagarač, and in parts of Herzegovina, a man who acted as a zduhać was called a vjedogonja or jedogonja. There was a rule: if a child {{was born with a}} caul, the <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> become a vještica [...] "witch", and the boy would become a vjedogonja. This could have been prevented by cutting the caul on a trough for feeding dogs, and throwing it away; the child would then grow up into an ordinary person. While the zduhaći and vjedogonje (plural) protected their community from the threats coming from the outside, the witches were the enemy within, doing harm primarily to their own relatives and friends. A correspondence between the witches and the vjedogonje can be seen in a passage from The Mountain Wreath, a poetic drama by Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, the plot of which takes place in 18th-century Montenegro: ...|$|E
500|$|The writers {{had written}} {{a scene in which}} Willa Ford's {{character}} Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore. Eventually, the <b>girl</b> <b>would</b> tire and drown. Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films, but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral. A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna. Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in {{the final version of the}} film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a [...] "cute line" [...] about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death. The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in previous installments of the series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark (Tom McBride) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of Friday the 13th.|$|E
