5|$|The Sacristan re-enters with choristers, {{celebrating the}} news that Napoleon has {{apparently}} been defeated at Marengo. The celebrations cease abruptly with the entry of Scarpia, his henchman Spoletta and several police agents. They <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Angelotti has sought refuge in the church. Scarpia orders a search, and the empty food basket and a fan bearing the Attavanti coat of arms {{are found in the}} chapel. Scarpia questions the Sacristan, and his suspicions are aroused further when he learns that Cavaradossi has been in the church; Scarpia mistrusts the painter, and believes him complicit in Angelotti's escape.|$|E
5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> strikes me as otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing".|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} soon {{declared}} the official [...] "musical ambassadors" [...] for the year, although, according to Linnell, {{it was more}} of an informal arrangement. The band had originally planned to create short videos called [...] "Space Minutes" [...] which would have aired on an unspecified cable television station that was affiliated with ISY, but the plans never came to fruition. In support of the designation, the logo for ISY is included on the back cover of the album. The band was scheduled for concerts to endorse ISY, and mentioned in promotional material from NASA, which headed the celebration in the United States. Commenting on the success of the designation of International Space Year, however, Linnell pointed out that he [...] " [...] think most people <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> this is International Space Year".|$|E
500|$|Generally, modern 5November {{celebrations}} are run {{by local}} charities and other organisations, with paid admission and controlled access. [...] In 1998 {{an editorial in the}} Catholic Herald called for the end of [...] "Bonfire Night", labelling it [...] "an offensive act". Author Martin Kettle, writing in The Guardian in 2003, bemoaned an [...] "occasionally nannyish" [...] attitude to fireworks that discourages people from holding firework displays in their back gardens, and an [...] "unduly sensitive attitude" [...] toward the anti-Catholic sentiment once so prominent on Guy Fawkes Night. David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: [...] "The rockets go higher and burn with more colour, but they have less and less to do with memories of the Fifth of November... it might be observed that Guy Fawkes' Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion. [...] But we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> many times before." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{results of}} the battle led to further {{discussion}} in the US Pacific Fleet about changes in tactical doctrine {{and the need for}} technical improvements, such as flashless powder. It was not until eight months later that the naval high command recognized there were serious problems with the functioning of the torpedoes. [...] The Americans were still unaware of the range and power of Japanese torpedoes and the effectiveness of Japanese night battle tactics. [...] In fact, Wright claimed that his ships must have been fired on by submarines since the observed position of Tanaka's ships [...] "make it improbable that torpedoes with speed-distance characteristics similar to our own" [...] could have caused such damage, though Tanaka states that his torpedoes were fired at a range as short as three miles. [...] The Americans would not recognize the true capabilities of their Pacific adversary's torpedoes (particularly the surface-ship-fired Type 93 [...] "Long Lance") and night tactics until well into 1943. [...] After the war, Tanaka said of his victory at Tassafaronga, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> US naval experts praised my command in that action. [...] I am not deserving of such honors. [...] It was the superb proficiency and devotion of the men who served me that produced the tactical victory for us." ...|$|E

500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors have been fighting {{for the last five years}} to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. This is a terrible thing for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. Why, when we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E

It is best for us that we remain here in our place and to serve God. Now, I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> they are the people of Ṭulayṭulah (Toledo) and those who are near to them.

It sets the cattle upon the belland, which is destructive to the cattle and horses and often kills them" ...|$|E
