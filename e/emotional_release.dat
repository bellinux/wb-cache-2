25|$|Parker and Lydia Cabot {{married in}} 1837, but the union was rocky at first due to {{environmental}} stresses and incompatibilities, {{and both were}} saddened to have no children. In 1840 he sought <b>emotional</b> <b>release</b> {{in the company of}} a neighboring woman, Anna Blake Shaw, who had a similar theology and temperament to his own, but the friendship was by all accounts not sexual. This attachment naturally increased problems at home, where he may have found it difficult to meet the emotional needs of his wife.|$|E
25|$|Emo was an {{outgrowth}} of the early-1980s hardcore punk scene in Washington, D.C. as a reaction to the scene's violence and an extension of the politics espoused by Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat, who returned the music's focus from the community to the individual. Minor Threat fan Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, breaking free of hardcore punk's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms and personal, impassioned lyrics. Many of the band's themes, including nostalgia, romantic bitterness and poetic desperation, became familiar tropes of later emo music. Its performances were public, emotional purges where audience members sometimes wept. MacKaye became a Rites of Spring fan (recording their only album and being their roadie) and formed the band Embrace, which explored similar themes of self-searching and <b>emotional</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{interactions}} between Amy and Andrea. Serba asserted that Kirkman effectively set up Amy's death {{at the beginning of}} the episode, and added that it established a sisterly bond. Serba also acclaimed Laurie Holden's performance; he stated that she [...] "powerfully conveys her grief and despair." [...] Pierce avouched that the opening sequence was likable, while Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal summated that the concluding scene was [...] "an <b>emotional</b> <b>release</b> after a tense build-up." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his <b>emotional</b> <b>release.</b> It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E
500|$|In Entertainment Weekly, Alejandro Garay wrote, [...] "One of my {{favorite}} episodes of 2008 was Lost’s 'The Constant.' [...] It was a beautiful episode that made us fans {{fall in love with}} the show even more. [...] The creators managed to build momentum with smart narrative, by using the romance card to develop such a complicated topic as time traveling. [...] It was exquisite, mind-blowing, impeccably done, and unforgettable." [...] Bill Keveney of USA Today wrote that it is [...] "arguably the most highly praised episode of [...] well-received fourth season", while his colleague Robert Bianco deemed Henry Ian Cusick worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times called the episode a [...] "mind-blowing tour de force". [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "for-the-ages episode" [...] with [...] "a classic Lost moment" [...] in Desmond and Penny's phone call and [...] "an especially spine-tingling performance" [...] by Cusick. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday wrote, [...] "last night's forty-four minutes of Lost were among the most satisfying forty-four minutes in front of the tube in my life." [...] He added that [...] "it wasn't merely a brilliant episode, which pushed the mythology forward more rapidly and richly than any episode in my memory, but it was an <b>emotional</b> <b>release</b> … I actually cried when Penny and Desmond finally…connected" [...] and [...] "there wasn't one, single, solitary false note". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "it was brilliantly executed, as both a brain-twister and as a love story" [...] with an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance by Jeremy Davies. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "the best single outing since season 1's 'Walkabout'" [...] and named the phone call between Desmond and Penny the best moment of the season excluding any moments from the then yet-to-air season finale. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard described [...] "The Constant" [...] as [...] "mindblowing" [...] and cited it as [...] "the reason the hardcore fans love Lost." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that [...] "the time-tripping went into overdrive with this week's brilliant episode … [...] worked beautifully as a showcase for Henry Ian Cusick as the tormented Desmond. [...] It was almost a stand-alone episode, a Twilight Zone/X-Files-style adventure with a start, middle and killer finish." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} well received, commercially and critically. The song received significant radio airplay, charting at number 12 {{on both the}} Billboard US Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. Critics praised the song. Sputnik Music referred to the song as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} songs APC ever released" [...] and [...] "one of the most <b>emotional</b> <b>releases</b> of the album". Artist Direct editor in chief Rick Florino named the track one of the [...] "Top 20 Maynard James Keenan Songs", calling it [...] "...a tender moment of longing encased in a beautiful, blissful melody...'3 Libras' illuminates the singer's massive vocal range and ability." [...] Florino separately praised the band's live composition of the song as well, stating that he felt it reached [...] "heavenly heights" [...] when performed by the band in their reunion tours in 2010.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{literary}} critics frequently dismissed the romance novel genre, often for contrasting reasons. Janice Radway {{contended that the}} genre is bad for women, blinding them {{to the difference between}} fantasy and reality. [...] She posited that women turn towards books in this genre to get an <b>emotional</b> <b>release</b> denied to them in their daily lives, where they must devote themselves to caregiving and have little time for themselves. Other critics saw the genre as simply a rehash of stereotypical sexual and marital roles. [...] In the late 1990s, Crusie wrote several essays defending the romance novel against critics.|$|E
2500|$|Right-wing {{radio host}} Rush Limbaugh {{contended that the}} events were being blown out of proportion, stating that [...] "this is no {{different}} than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of <b>emotional</b> <b>release?</b> You ever heard of emotional release?" [...] Conservative talk show host Michael Savage said, [...] "Instead of putting joysticks, I {{would have liked to have}} seen dynamite put in their orifices", and that [...] "we need more of the humiliation tactics, not less." [...] He repeatedly referred to Abu Ghraib prison as [...] "Grab-an-Arab" [...] prison.|$|E
2500|$|Alcott patiently drudged away at Little Women {{but found}} <b>emotional</b> <b>release</b> in {{scribbling}} her blood-and-thunder tales. [...] The difference shows: in pacing, tone, and content, Love Chase is startlingly unlike its famous successor. The ostentatiously Faustian plot centers on Rosamond Vivian, a discontented maiden {{who lives on}} an English island with only her bitter old grandfather for company and who begins the novel by rashly declaring: [...] "I often feel as if I'd gladly sell my soul to Satan for a year of freedom." [...] Right on cue, a man named Phillip Tempest — a man who bears a more than trivial resemblance to Mephistopheles — walks in the door. Within a month, Rosamond is in love, and although she realizes that this man is “no saint”, she marries him, believing with the fatuousness of youth that her love will save him. She sails away from her lonely island in Tempest's yacht, the Circe, and begins her married life at a luxurious villa in Nice.|$|E
