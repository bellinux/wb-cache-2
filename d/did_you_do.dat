While there during {{recording}} sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks. He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially {{he had no idea}} who she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was [...] "similar to me, where he just does shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that?

500|$|... "Resentment" [...] is {{a passionate}} ballad about a gritty, {{agitated}} goodbye which adds a [...] "different kind of overwrought drama". The track {{is written in}} the key of E major. [...] "Resentment" [...] features a slow groove of 70 beats per minute, with Beyoncé's vocals range spanning from the note of F3 to E5. It is built around a honeyed sample from Curtis Mayfield's [...] (1972) album: [...] "How could you lie?". In [...] "Resentment" [...] Beyoncé sings about infidelity and a boyfriend who cheats and lies to her, seen in the lines [...] "I've been crying for too long/ What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to me?/ You lied, you lied, you lied." [...] In the song, Beyoncé presents a more vulnerable side of herself, because she shows that she doesn't want her boyfriend to leave her for another woman.|$|E
500|$|Andrić felt he {{was destined}} to become a writer. He began writing in {{secondary}} school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her {{one of his first}} works, she replied: [...] "Did you write this? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that for?" [...] Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor (Whirlwind), Savremenik (The Contemporary), Hrvatski pokret (The Croatian Movement), and Književne novine (Literary News). One of Andrić’s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić’s poetry from this period as [...] "subjective and mostly melancholic". Andrić’s translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.|$|E
500|$|He then {{published}} the comic novels: John Goldfarb, Please Come Home! (1963), I, Billy Shakespeare (1965), and Twinkle, Twinkle, [...] "Killer" [...] Kane (1966). He achieved critical success with these books – Marvin Levin in the New York Times, for example, wrote: [...] "Nobody can write funnier lines than William Peter Blatty, a gifted virtuoso who writes like [...] Perelman"; but significant sales were lacking. It {{was at this}} point that Blatty began a collaboration with director Blake Edwards, writing scripts for comedy films such as: A Shot in the Dark (1964), What <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> in the War, Daddy? (1966), Gunn (1967), and Darling Lili (1970), a musical starring Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson. Blatty also worked on his own using the name [...] "Bill Blatty" [...] writing comedy screenplays such as those for the Danny Kaye film The Man from the Diners' Club (1963), and the Warren Beatty/Leslie Caron film Promise Her Anything (1965). Other screenplays include the film adaptation of John Goldfarb, Please Come Home! (1965), and The Great Bank Robbery (1969).|$|E

500|$|After the Pixies {{broke up}} in 1993, Santiago {{had stayed in}} touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: [...] "He called me on my {{cellphone}} and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?' I go, 'Charles, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'" [...] Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and {{by the summer of}} 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, [...] "worked it up a bit in Joey's Pro Tools thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E

2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a distinguishing mark. Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask open-ended questions about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when you arrived? Who did you come with? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|E
