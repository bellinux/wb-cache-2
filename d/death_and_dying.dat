5|$|The text {{consists}} of different Bible {{passages from the}} Old and New Testament, {{as well as individual}} verses of hymns by Martin Luther and Adam Reusner, which all together refer to finiteness, preparation for <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>dying.</b> There are two distinct parts to the cantata: the view of the Old Testament on death shown in the first part is confronted by that of the New Testament in the second part, leading to a symmetrical structure. The juxtaposition of texts from the Old and New Testament appeared before in the Christliche Betschule (Christian school of prayer) by Johann Olearius. Markus Rathey, professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, argued in 2006, that the sermon given at the funeral of Strecker is similar in ideas to the themes of the cantatas. It may be an indication that Bach composed the work for this occasion.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{served as}} a sort of {{opposite}} to the popular idea that The Waste Land {{served as a}}n expression of disillusionment after World [...] War I, even though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. World War II itself has a direct mention in only a few of Eliot's writings. However, World War II does affect the poem, especially with the disruption caused by the war being reflected within the poem as a disruption of nature and heaven. The poem describes society in ways similar to The Waste Land, especially with its emphasis on <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>dying.</b> The place is connected to where Eliot's family originates, and, as such, is also the place where his family will symbolically end. In {{the second part of the}} poem, nature is experiencing disorder, and it is suggested that humans too may burn, and also that reason, knowledge, and science cannot save people. The errors of our past become the reasons for war and conflict and we need to become humble in order to escape the destruction. However, darkness consumes the rulers of the world and society. This is, in part, due to Adam's fall, and the resulting concept of original sin. Christ is our savior and we need to seek redemption to overcome our human failings. Eliot states that he has been involved with fighting for humanity and trying to help mankind learn what is important. Only through Christ is man able to be redeemed.|$|E

2500|$|The Kübler-Ross model, {{commonly}} known as the five stages of grief, is a theory first introduced by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book, On <b>Death</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dying.</b> Kubler-Ross actually applied the stages to persons who were dying, not persons who were grieving. [...] Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill and it was not until much later in her career did she give into the notion that it could be applied to those grieving. [...] She once remarked that it's hard to deny that a loved one has died, but easier to deny that you, in fact, are terminally ill. [...] The popular but largely untested theory describes in five distinct stages how people deal with grief and tragedy. Such events might include being diagnosed with a terminal illness or enduring a catastrophic loss.|$|E

[...] So Heav'nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate, [...] Giving to <b>death,</b> <b>and</b> <b>dying</b> to redeeme, [...] So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate [...] 300 [...] So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes [...] In those who, when they may, accept not grace. [...] Nor shalt thou by descending to assume [...] Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. [...] Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss [...] Equal to God, and equally enjoying [...] God-like fruition, quitted all to save [...] A World from utter loss, and hast been found [...] By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, [...] Found worthiest to be so by being Good, [...] 310 [...] Farr more then Great or High; because in thee [...] Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, [...] Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt [...] With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; [...] Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne [...] Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, [...] Anointed universal King; all Power [...] I give thee, reign for ever, and assume [...] Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream [...] Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: [...] 320 [...] All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide [...] In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; [...] When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n [...] Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send [...] The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime [...] Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes [...] The living, and forthwith the cited dead [...] Of all past Ages to the general Doom [...] Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. [...] Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge [...] 330 [...] Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink [...] Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, [...] Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while [...] The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring [...] New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell [...] And after all thir tribulations long [...] See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, [...] With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. [...] Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, [...] For regal Scepter then no more shall need, [...] 340 [...] God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods, [...] Adore him, who to compass all this dies, [...] Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. [...] No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all [...] The multitude of Angels with a shout [...] Loud as from numbers without number, sweet [...] As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung [...] With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's fill'd [...] Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent [...] Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground [...] 350 [...] With solemn adoration down they cast [...] Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, [...] Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once [...] In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life [...] Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence [...] To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, [...] And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, [...] And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn [...] Rowls o're Elisian Flours her Amber stream; [...] With these that never fade the Spirits Elect [...] 360 [...] Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, [...] Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright [...] Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon [...] Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd. [...] Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took, [...] Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side [...] Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet [...] Of charming symphonie they introduce [...] Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; [...] No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine [...] 370 [...] Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n. [...] Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, [...] Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, [...] Eternal King; thee Author of all being, [...] Fountain of Light, thy self invisible [...] Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st [...] Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st [...] The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud [...] Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, [...] Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, [...] 380 [...] Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim [...] Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. [...] Thee next they sang of all Creation first, [...] Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, [...] In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud [...] Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines, [...] Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee [...] Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, [...] Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests. [...] Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein [...] 390 [...] By thee created, and by thee threw down [...] Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day [...] Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, [...] Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook [...] Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks [...] Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid. [...] Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime [...] Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might, [...] To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, [...] Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n, [...] 400 [...] Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome [...] So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: [...] No sooner did thy dear and onely Son [...] Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man [...] So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, [...] He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife [...] Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern'd, [...] Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat [...] Second to thee, offerd himself to die [...] For mans offence. O unexampl'd love, [...] 410 [...] Love no where to be found less then Divine! [...] Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name [...] Shall be the copious matter of my Song [...] Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise [...] Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. [...] Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear, [...] Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. [...] Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe [...] Of this round World, whose first convex divides [...] The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd [...] 420 [...] From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness old, [...] Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off [...] It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent [...] Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night [...] Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms [...] Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; [...] Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n [...] Though distant farr som small reflection gaines [...] Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: [...] Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field. [...] 430 [...] As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, [...] Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, [...] Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey [...] To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids [...] On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs [...] Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; [...] But in his way lights on the barren plaines [...] Of Sericana, where Chineses drive [...] With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: [...] So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend [...] 440 [...] Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, [...] Alone, for other Creature in this place [...] Living or liveless to be found was none, [...] None yet, but store hereafter from the earth [...] Up hither like Aereal vapours flew [...] Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin [...] With vanity had filld the works of men: [...] Both all things vain, and all who in vain things [...] Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, [...] Or happiness in this or th' other life; [...] 450 [...] All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits [...] Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, [...] Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find [...] Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; [...] All th' unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, [...] Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, [...] Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, [...] Till final dissolution, wander here, [...] Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; [...] Those argent Fields more likely habitants, [...] 460 [...] Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold [...] Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: [...] Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born [...] First from the ancient World those Giants came [...] With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: [...] The builders next of Babel on the Plain [...] Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe [...] New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: [...] Others came single; hee who to be deemd [...] A God, leap'd fondly into Aetna flames, [...] 470 [...] Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy [...] Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the Sea, [...] Cleombrotus, and many more too long, [...] Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers [...] White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. [...] Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek [...] In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n; [...] And they who {{to be sure of}} Paradise [...] Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, [...] Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd; [...] 480 [...] They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, [...] And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs [...] The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; [...] And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems [...] To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot [...] Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe [...] A violent cross wind from either Coast [...] Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry [...] Into the devious Air; then might ye see [...] Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost [...] 490 [...] And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, [...] Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, [...] The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft [...] Fly o're the backside of the World farr off [...] Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld [...] The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown [...] Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; [...] All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd, [...] And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame [...] Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste [...] 500 [...] His travell'd steps; farr distant hee descries [...] Ascending by degrees magnificent [...] Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, [...] At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd [...] The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate [...] With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold [...] Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes [...] The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth [...] By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. [...] The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw [...] 510 [...] Angels ascending and descending, bands [...] Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled [...] To Padan-aram in the field of Luz, [...] Dreaming by night under the open Skie, [...] And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n. [...] Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood [...] There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes [...] Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd [...] Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon [...] Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd, [...] 520 [...] Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake [...] Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. [...] The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare [...] The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate [...] His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. [...] Direct against which op'nd from beneath, [...] Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, [...] A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, [...] Wider by farr then that of after-times [...] Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, [...] 530 [...] Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear, [...] By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, [...] On high behests his Angels to and fro [...] Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard [...] From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood [...] To Beersaba, where the Holy Land [...] Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; [...] So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set [...] To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. [...] Satan from hence now on the lower stair [...] 540 [...] That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate [...] Looks down with wonder at the sudden view [...] Of all this World at once. As when a Scout [...] Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone [...] All night; at last by break of chearful dawne [...] Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, [...] Which to his eye discovers unaware [...] The goodly prospect of some forein land [...] First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis [...] With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, [...] 550 [...] Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. [...] Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, [...] The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd [...] At sight of all this World beheld so faire. [...] Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood [...] So high above the circling Canopie [...] Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point [...] Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears [...] Andromeda farr off Atlantick Seas [...] Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole [...] 560 [...] He views in bredth, and without longer pause [...] Down right into the Worlds first Region throws [...] His flight precipitant, and windes with ease [...] Through the pure marble Air his oblique way [...] Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon [...] Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, [...] Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, [...] Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old, [...] Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, [...] Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there [...] 570 [...] He stayd not to enquire: above them all [...] The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven [...] Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends [...] Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe [...] By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, [...] Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie [...] Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, [...] That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, [...] Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move [...] Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute [...] 580 [...] Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp [...] Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd [...] By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms [...] The Univers, and to each inward part [...] With gentle penetration, though unseen, [...] Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: [...] So wondrously was set his Station bright. [...] There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps [...] Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe [...] Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. [...] 590 [...] The place he found beyond expression bright, [...] Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; [...] Not all parts like, but all alike informd [...] Which radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; [...] If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; [...] If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, [...] Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon [...] In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides [...] Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, [...] That stone, or like to that which here below [...] 600 [...] Philosophers in vain so long have sought, [...] In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde [...] Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound [...] In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, [...] Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. [...] What wonder then if fields and regions here [...] Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run [...] Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch [...] Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote [...] Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt [...] 610 [...] Here in the dark so many precious things [...] Of colour glorious and effect so rare? [...] Here matter new to gaze the Devil met [...] Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, [...] For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, [...] But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon [...] Culminate from th' Aequator, as they now [...] Shot upward still direct, whence no way round [...] Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, [...] No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray [...] 620 [...] To objects distant farr, whereby he soon [...] Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, [...] The same whom John saw also in the Sun: [...] His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; [...] Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar [...] Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind [...] Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings [...] Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd [...] Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. [...] Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope [...] 630 [...] To find who might direct his wandring flight [...] To Paradise the happie seat of Man, [...] His journies end and our beginning woe. [...] But first he casts to change his proper shape, [...] Which else might work him danger or delay: [...] And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, [...] Not of the prime, yet such as in his face [...] Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb [...] Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; [...] Under a Coronet his flowing haire [...] 640 [...] In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore [...] Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, [...] His habit fit for speed succinct, and held [...] Before his decent steps a Silver wand. [...] He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, [...] Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, [...] Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known [...] Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n [...] Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne [...] Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes [...] 650 [...] That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth [...] Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, [...] O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; [...] Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand [...] In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, [...] The first art wont his great authentic will [...] Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, [...] Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; [...] And here art likeliest by supream decree [...] Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye [...] 660 [...] To visit oft this new Creation round; [...] Unspeakable desire to see, and know [...] All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, [...] His chief delight and favour, him for whom [...] All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, [...] Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim [...] Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell [...] In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man [...] His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, [...] But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; [...] 670 [...] That I may find him, and with secret gaze, [...] Or open admiration him behold [...] On whom the great Creator hath bestowd [...] Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; [...] That both in him and all things, as is meet, [...] The Universal Maker we may praise; [...] Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes [...] To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss [...] Created this new happie Race of Men [...] To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. [...] 680 [...] So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; [...] For neither Man nor Angel can discern [...] Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks [...] Invisible, except to God alone, [...] By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: [...] And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps [...] At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie [...] Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill [...] Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd [...] Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held [...] 690 [...] The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; [...] Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule [...] In his uprightness answer thus returnd. [...] Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know [...] The works of God, thereby to glorifie [...] The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess [...] That reaches blame, but rather merits praise [...] The more it seems excess, that led thee hither [...] From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, [...] To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps [...] 700 [...] Contented with report heare onely in heav'n: [...] For wonderful indeed are all his works, [...] Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all [...] Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; [...] But what created mind can comprehend [...] Thir number, or the wisdom infinite [...] That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. [...] I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, [...] This worlds material mould, came to a heap: [...] Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar [...] 710 [...] Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; [...] Till at his second bidding darkness fled, [...] Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: [...] Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then [...] The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, [...] And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n [...] Flew upward, spirited with various forms, [...] That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs [...] Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; [...] Each had his place appointed, each his course, [...] 720 [...] The rest in circuit walles this Universe. [...] Look downward on that Globe whose hither side [...] With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; [...] That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light [...] His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere [...] Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon [...] (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide [...] Timely interposes, and her monthly round [...] Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; [...] With borrowd light her countenance triform [...] 730 [...] Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, [...] And in her pale dominion checks the night. [...] That spot to which I point is Paradise, [...] Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. [...] Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. [...] Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, [...] As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, [...] Where honour due and reverence none neglects, [...] Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, [...] Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, [...] 740 [...] Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, [...] Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.|$|E
