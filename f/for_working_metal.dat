50|$|Excavations on High Cliffy Island have {{uncovered}} extensive stone structures, some consisting of dry-stone formwork only evidenced {{elsewhere on the}} other side of the continent at Lake Condah in Victoria. The island lies east of the Montgomery group. It takes its name from the geophysical feature of steeply rising up cliffs to a height of some 15 metres. In addition, 3 rock shelters, and several work sites, high-quality quartz sandstone, chert and limestone quarries, dugong-butchering areas and places <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>metal</b> harpoons, were revealed. Given the presence of glassware, pottery and clay pipe material, it was suggested initially that the stone building might have been the handiwork of Makassar traders. The analysis concluded that the structures were of Aboriginal manufacture. One possibility is that they are the remains of monsoonal refuges, where the Yawijibaya could retire to, in order to escape the mosquitoe and sandfly infestations that would have plagued their low-lying mangrove-fringed islands as the rains set in.|$|E
50|$|Both {{metal and}} wood slappers {{are used for}} metalworking. Generally wood slappers are covered with a leather-face. Slappers {{can be used to}} shrink, contour, and planish (smooth) the panel without leaving rough marks to clean up. The slapper {{controls}} more surface with each blow than a hammer can and is very easy to use because it has the same angle of attack as a body hammer. This means the user does not need to change their arm and hand position when moving from hammer to slapper. The slapper can be far more effective than the hammer for shrinking because its leverage gives greater mechanical advantage over the rough spots. The slapper is great <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>metal</b> over a T-stake or for gouging and planishing. A good slapper can make radius bends and crowns quite well. A slapper works well with forming stakes and post dollies for lightly planishing and pulling cold shrinks.|$|E
50|$|Bilateral {{trade between}} Australia and Paraguay is small, {{reflecting}} on deals happening at times rather than continuous arrangements of supply. In 2013-14, two-way merchandise trade totaled AUD$3.4 million, of which AUD$1.3 million were Australian exports, made up mainly {{of paper and}} paper products, civil engineering equipment and machine tools <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>metal.</b> Australia's major import from Paraguay (2013-14) was oil-seeds and oleaginous fruits. In December 2009, P&O Maritime Services acquired a 70 per cent stake in the Dos Santos Group Bulk Barging business, a river navigation business based in Asunción. P&O's head office is based in Melbourne and the company maintains operations in five Australian ports. There may be some openings for investment in the agribusiness sector and for the export of agriculture related and other products and services from Australia. The mining industry in Paraguay has, to date, been relatively underdeveloped but the recent discovery {{of one of the}} world's three largest deposits of ilmenite (a titanium ore) has the potential to greatly expand mining in the country. Australian companies with existing interests in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay may find that the close commercial ties that these countries have with Paraguay may facilitate entry into the Paraguayan market. In 2011, the Paraguayan-Australian Chamber of Commerce was formed. This organisation works closely with the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires to facilitate and encourage trade and investment between the two countries.|$|E
