5|$|I. <b>gracilis,</b> {{named by}} Lydekker in 1888 as the type species of Sphenospondylus and {{assigned}} to Iguanodon in 1969 by Rodney Steel, {{has been suggested}} to be a synonym of Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, but is considered dubious nowadays.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus <b>gracilis,</b> {{the older}} species, {{is found in}} the Löwenstein Formation (Lower Norian). P.engelhardti stems from the upper Löwenstein Formation (Upper Norian), the Trossingen Formation (Upper Norian), and {{equivalently}} aged rock units. Plateosaurus thus lived probably from approximately 214 to 204 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The creek whaler feeds {{predominantly}} {{on small}} teleost fishes (including threadfin breams and lizardfishes) and crustaceans (including penaeid prawns and mantis shrimps); cephalopods are also infrequently consumed. Known parasites {{of this species}} include the tapeworm Callitetrarhynchus <b>gracilis,</b> and a nematode in the genus Pulchrascaris.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Plateosaurus <b>gracilis,</b> an incomplete postcranium, is kept at the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Stuttgart, Germany, {{and the type}} locality is Heslach, a suburb of the same city.|$|E
5|$|Yates has {{cautioned that}} P. <b>gracilis</b> {{may be a}} metataxon, which {{means that there is}} neither {{evidence}} that the material assigned to it is monophyletic (belongs to one species), nor that it is paraphyletic (belongs to several species). This is the case because the holotype of P.(Sellosaurus) <b>gracilis</b> has no skull, and the other specimens consist of skulls and material that overlaps too little with the holotype to make it certain that it belongs to the same taxon. It is therefore possible that the known material contains more species belonging to Plateosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Banksia inflorescences are {{energy-rich}} {{sources of}} food, and B. aquilonia nectar is a likely food item {{of the endangered}} mahogany glider (Petaurus <b>gracilis),</b> {{as well as many}} other mammals and birds. Avian species observed visiting the flower spikes include the bridled honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater, eastern spinebill and rainbow lorikeet.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{species such}} as Gnathamitermes tubiformans have {{seasonal}} food habits. For example, they may preferentially consume Red three-awn (Aristida longiseta) during the summer, Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) from May to August, and blue grama Bouteloua <b>gracilis</b> during spring, summer and autumn. Colonies of G.tubiformans consume less food in spring than they do during autumn when their feeding activity is high.|$|E
5|$|Five {{putative}} lower molariforms of Ferugliotherium {{are known}} from the Los Alamitos Formation (MACN Pv-RN 20, 174, 175, and 253 and MLP 88-III-28-1). These teeth include the holotypes of Ferugliotherium windhauseni (MACN Pv-RN 20, the only second lower molariform, or m2) and Vucetichia <b>gracilis</b> (MACN Pv-RN 174).|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, spiny {{lobsters}} {{are an important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus <b>gracilis.</b> The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E
5|$|In his 1981 {{study of}} Canadian dinosaur footprints, Richard Kool {{produced}} rough walking speed estimates based on several trackways made by different {{species in the}} Gething Formation of British Columbia. Kool estimated one of these trackways, representing the ichnospecies Irenichnites <b>gracilis</b> (which may {{have been made by}} Deinonychus), to have a walking speed of 10.1 kilometers per hour (6 miles per hour).|$|E
5|$|Bohlinia entered China and {{northern}} India {{in response to}} climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. <b>gracilis</b> a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built while G. <b>gracilis</b> was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver {{for the evolution of}} the giraffes {{is believed to have been}} the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern {{and northern}} Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.|$|E
5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in {{the canopy of}} trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus <b>gracilis)</b> and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
5|$|One {{group of}} temnospondyls, the Branchiosauridae, {{is also known}} from larval specimens. Branchiosaurids like Branchiosaurus and Apateon are {{represented}} by many fossils preserving skin and external gills. An entire growth series is exhibited in {{the wide range of}} sizes among specimens, but the lack of terrestrially adapted adult forms suggests that these temnospondyls were neotenic. Unlike other temnospondyls, their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature. Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles. Recently, large specimens of Apateon <b>gracilis</b> were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle, indicating that not all branchiosaurs were neotenic.|$|E
5|$|Those Famennian strata {{represent}} {{the top of}} the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping. Above, the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity. It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse clayey and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina <b>gracilis.</b> These strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase.|$|E
5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis <b>gracilis).</b> Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
5|$|From there, {{the story}} becomes more complex. Apparently, the {{skeleton}} was {{scattered throughout the}} quarry, with the remains being recovered from September 1879 to September 1880. Marsh elected to place some of the material in a new species, C. agilis, {{on the strength of}} a pair of fused pubic bones he thought belonged to an animal {{three times the size of}} C. fragilis. He returned to the genus in 1888 to add C". <b>gracilis,</b> based on unknown remains only represented today by a single claw bone pertaining to a small theropod from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland. This species is not currently accepted as representing Coelurus in reviews of the genus, but has not been given its own genus.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia is {{only found}} in Australia. Until its rediscovery, the genus was only {{known from the}} {{original}} specimens collected in Western Australia by Amy Crocker in December 1931. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed doubt about the type locality of the ant, but said that the specimens were probably collected from {{the western end of}} the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct, as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find the ant but failed to do so. In 1977, Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera, 1300km (800mi) away from the original collection site. Colonies are found in old growth mallee woodland with many Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus brachycalyx, Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus <b>gracilis</b> abundant. Only a few small colonies are known in its restricted distribution, listing it as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|S. <b>gracilis</b> entered South America {{during the}} early to middle Pleistocene, where it {{probably}} gave rise to S.populator, which lived {{in the eastern part}} of the continent. S.fatalis also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were therefore divided by the Andes mountains. The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and invasive species sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included proboscideans, horses, camelids and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. Native metatherian predators (including the saber-toothed thylacosmilids) had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{shows that the}} pelican lineage has existed for at least 30million years; the oldest known pelican fossil was found in Early Oligocene {{deposits}} at the Luberon in southeastern France and is remarkably similar to modern forms. Its beak is almost complete and is morphologically identical to that of present-day pelicans, showing that this advanced feeding apparatus was already in existence at the time. An Early Miocene fossil has been named Miopelecanus <b>gracilis</b> {{on the basis of}} certain features originally considered unique but later thought to lie within the range of inter-specific variation in Pelecanus. The Late Eocene Protopelicanus may be a pelecaniform or suliform – or a similar aquatic bird such as a pseudotooth (Pelagornithidae). The supposed Miocene pelican Liptornis from Patagonia is a nomen dubium (of doubtful validity), being based on fragments providing insufficient evidence to support a valid description.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark is {{a largely}} solitary animal, though {{occasionally}} several individuals {{may be found}} at the same location. In the Mozambique Channel, it outnumbers the bull shark on the east side while the opposite is true on the west side, suggesting there may be competitive exclusion between these similar species. Parasites documented from the pigeye shark include the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini, the copepods Pandarus smithii and P. cranchii, and the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus <b>gracilis,</b> Cathetocephalus sp., Floriceps minacanthus, Heteronybelinia australis, Otobothrium australe, O. crenacolle, and Protogrillotia sp. Young pigeye sharks are potentially vulnerable to predation by larger sharks. The natural mortality for juveniles in Cleveland Bay has been measured at no more than 5% per year; this rate is comparable to that in juvenile bull sharks, and is much lower than in juvenile blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) or lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|About twenty {{teeth and}} a jaw {{fragment}} have {{been referred to}} Ferugliotherium, but the assignment {{of many of these}} is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as Ferugliotherium is in question. The identity of a few additional isolated premolars assigned to Ferugliotherium, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (Vucetichia <b>gracilis),</b> which is now considered a synonym of Ferugliotherium. They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1990, Bonaparte merged {{the family}} Gondwanatheriidae into Sudamericidae and, {{together}} with David Krause, redefined Gondwanatheria as a multituberculate suborder that included both Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae, thus rejecting {{a relationship between}} gondwanatheres and xenarthrans. Krause, Bonaparte, and Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska redescribed Ferugliotherium in 1992 and suggested that the teeth that Vucetichia was based on may have been worn specimens of Ferugliotherium. They placed Ferugliotherium among multituberculates and suggested {{that it may be}} part of the suborder Plagiaulacoidea. The following year, Krause confirmed that Vucetichia <b>gracilis</b> is a synonym of Ferugliotherium windhauseni. Together with Bonaparte, he also proposed to classify gondwanatheres as a superfamily (Gondwanatherioidea) within Plagiaulacoidea, including the families Ferugliotheriidae and Sudamericidae. In 1996, Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte tentatively identified a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from Los Alamitos as Ferugliotherium. On the basis of the morphological features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatheres are not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one species}} of Coelurus, the type species C. fragilis, is still {{recognized}} as valid today, although six other {{species have been}} named over the years. C. agilis, as discussed, was named by Marsh in 1884 for {{what turned out to}} be additional parts of the skeleton of C. fragilis. Cope's C. bauri and C. longicollis, named in 1887 from Late Triassic fossils from New Mexico, were transferred by Cope in 1889 to his new genus Coelophysis. C. daviesi was named by Richard Lydekker in 1888 for Harry Seeley's Thecospondylus daviesi, a neck vertebra from the Early Cretaceous of England, but this species was later transferred to its own genus, Thecocoelurus. C. <b>gracilis,</b> another Early Cretaceous species, was also named in 1888. It was coined by Marsh for what seems to be an assortment of limb remains, but Gilmore could only find a single claw when he reviewed the species in 1920. This species has been proposed as outside Coelurus since the 1920s (when Gilmore assigned it to Chirostenotes), and has been regarded as a dubious species outside of Coelurus in recent reviews. Finally, during the period when Ornitholestes was thought to be the same as Coelurus, its type species was recognized as distinct by Steel, as C. hermanni.|$|E
5|$|The first {{member of}} the family Ferugliotheriidae to be discovered, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, was named in 1986 by Argentinean {{paleontologist}} José F. Bonaparte {{on the basis of a}} tooth from the Late Cretaceous Los Alamitos Formation of Argentina. Bonaparte placed Ferugliotherium as the only {{member of the}} new family Ferugliotheriidae, which he tentatively assigned to the order Multituberculata, a large group of extinct mammals (distinct from both monotremes and therians, the two major groups of living mammals) that was particularly widespread in the northern continents (Laurasia), but had never previously been found in the south (Gondwana). In 1990, Bonaparte named another species, Vucetichia <b>gracilis,</b> from Los Alamitos. He placed it in the family Gondwanatheriidae, together with Gondwanatherium, another Los Alamitos mammal, within the order Gondwanatheria, which also contained the family Sudamericidae, then with the single genus Sudamerica. Bonaparte considered the gondwanatheres to be probably most closely related to the xenarthrans (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) within a group called Paratheria.|$|E
5|$|Four {{putative}} first lower molariforms (mf1s) of Ferugliotherium are known, and {{the only}} known tooth of Trapalcotherium is also thought to be an mf1. Ferugliotherium mf1s are roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bear two longitudinal rows of cusps. There are four cusps in the lingual row (on {{the side of the}} tongue) and three in the labial row (the side of the lips). The cusps are connected to cusps in the other row by transverse ridges and separated from cusps in their own rows by three transverse furrows. Two heavily worn Ferugliotherium mf1s were originally identified as upper molars of Vucetichia <b>gracilis</b> by Bonaparte in 1990. One of the two preserves the roots; at the front and back, there were two roots, fused at their bases. The mf1 of Trapalcotherium differs only in some details; among others, the cusps are less distinct from the crests. The sole mf2 of Ferugliotherium is the holotype. It bears two rows of two cusps. The cusps in the front and back pairs are connected by a broad ridge and the two pairs are separated by a deep furrow. Transverse ridges between the cusps similar to those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related.|$|E
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus <b>gracilis).</b> Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E

25|$|The TUG flap (also the TMG flap) {{consists}} of the <b>gracilis</b> muscle and a transversely-oriented island of skin and fat on the superior inner thigh. Sacrifice of the <b>gracilis</b> muscle does not result in functional impairment. The TUG flap is nourished by the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery with two venae comitantes, which come from the profunda femoris vessels. The vessels are routinely anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels, instead of to the thoraco-dorsal vessels in the axilla, because the blood vessels of the TUG flap are relatively short.|$|E
25|$|Marsh {{described}} the new {{genus and species}} Pteranodon longiceps and referred the toothless American pterosaurs to the new order Pteranodontia. He also {{described the}} new species Pteranodon comptus and P. <b>gracilis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} Cleve hills show {{a greater}} variety of vegetation, with Open Scrub (Mallee/Saltbush), typically containing Eucalyptus porosa (mallee box), Eucalyptus <b>gracilis</b> and Eucalyptus oleosa with an understorey of Atriplex vesicaria (bladder saltbush).|$|E
25|$|Hamstring autografts {{are made}} with the semitendinosus tendon, either alone or {{accompanied}} by the <b>gracilis</b> tendon for a stronger graft. The semitendinosus is an accessory hamstring (the primary hamstrings are left intact), and the <b>gracilis</b> is not a hamstring, but an accessory adductor (the primary adductors are left intact as well). The two tendons are commonly combined and {{referred to as a}} four-strand hamstring graft, made by a long piece (about 25cm) removed from each tendon. The tendon segments are folded and braided together to form a tendon of quadruple thickness for the graft. The braided segment is threaded through the heads of the tibia and femur, and its ends are fixed with screws on the opposite sides of the two bones.|$|E
25|$|The flap {{provides}} a rather small skin island {{with a relatively}} thin fat pad, which makes it only possible to reconstruct small to medium-sized breasts. The small skin island also makes it a less appropriate flap for delayed breast reconstructions. Atrophy of the <b>gracilis</b> muscle may cause secondary volume and contour deformities of the reconstructed breast for which additional corrections may be necessary.|$|E
