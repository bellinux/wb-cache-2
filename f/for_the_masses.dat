5|$|Lasker {{followed}} Steinitz's principles, {{and both}} demonstrated {{a completely different}} chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.|$|E

5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b> Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses,</b> the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{regulated}} {{commerce and}} the economy by creating official markets (tsena) and standardizing market scales (fandanjana) and other units of measurement, including length and volume. King Andrianampoinimerina established the first marketplace in Antananarivo on the grounds today occupied by the Analakely market's tile-roofed pavilions, constructed in the 1930s. Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday (Zoma) as market day, when merchants would come to Analakely to erect stalls shaded with traditional white parasols. This sea of parasols extended throughout the valley, forming {{what has been called}} the largest open air marketplace in the world. Traffic congestion and safety hazards caused by the ever-growing Zoma market prompted government officials to split up and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997. Prosperity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> in Imerina increased throughout Andrianampoinimerina's reign, leading to growth in population density.|$|E
40|$|We prove a simple, {{explicit}} formula <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of any asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) Kähler manifold, assuming only {{the sort of}} weak fall-off conditions required <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> to actually be well-defined. For ALE scalar-flat Kähler manifolds, <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> {{turns out to be}} a topological invariant, depending only on the underlying smooth manifold, the first Chern class of the complex structure, and the Kähler class of the metric. When the metric is actually AE (asymptotically Euclidean), our formula not only implies a positive mass theorem for Kähler metrics, but also yields a Penrose-type inequality <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass.</b> Comment: 53 pages, minor corrections and improvements, final versio...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the idea}} that {{electromagnetism}} is responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> differences within isotopic multiplets, and possibly also <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>mass</b> of <b>the</b> electron, a supersymmetric gauge theoretical model based on the group SU(2) _L× SU(2) _R× U(1) _Y is constructed.

25|$|A {{central part}} of the {{lifestyle}} is the attachment to the rebbe. As with most Hasidic groups today, the Rebbe's position is generally attained through his lineage. However, to be accepted by the masses, the Rebbe is expected to display behaviors such as humility, love for fellow Jews, and general devotion to God's service. The rebbe, as tzadik or righteous person, is seen as a conduit to God <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first Israeli {{government}} {{headed by}} Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion opposed {{the return of}} the Bedouin from Jordan and Egypt.

The government saw the Negev as a potential home <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> of Jewish immigrants, including 700,000 Jewish refugees from Arab lands.

25|$|Spain's {{neutrality}} in World War I {{allowed it}} to become a supplier of material for both sides to its great advantage. The export of raw agricultural products, minerals, textiles and steel prompted an economic boom; subsequently the surplus balance of trade grew to over five hundred million pesetas. The extraordinary growth in business profits favoured industrial oligarchs and the merchant middle class, but increases in wages for workers did not keep pace with inflation—overall standards of living <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> actually decreased. The urban industrial proletariat, meanwhile, kept up continuous pressure for wage increases.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, the Original American Kazoo Company in Eden, New York started {{manufacturing}} kazoos <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> in a two-room {{shop and}} factory, utilizing {{a couple of}} dozen jack presses for cutting, bending and crimping metal sheets. These machines were used for many decades. By 1994, the company produced 1.5 million kazoos per year and was the only manufacturer of metal kazoos in North America. The factory, in nearly its original configuration, is now called The Kazoo Factory and Museum. It is still operating, and it {{is open to the public}} for tours.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} wet cells, Gassner's {{dry cell}} was more solid, {{did not require}} maintenance, did not spill, and {{could be used in}} any orientation. It provided a potential of 1.5 volts. The first mass-produced model was the Columbia dry cell, first marketed by the National Carbon Company in 1896. The NCC improved Gassner's model by replacing the plaster of Paris with coiled cardboard, an innovation that left more space for the cathode and made the battery easier to assemble. It was the first convenient battery <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> and made portable electrical devices practical, and led directly to the invention of the flashlight.|$|E
