Unemployable and sensitive about his bulk, Lambert became a recluse.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>account</b> of interest-based animal rights as preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>account</b> is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be}} done to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E

5|$|In Sanskrit, a {{well-known}} poem (Mahakavya) in 18 cantos called Vikramankadeva Charita by Kashmiri poet Bilhana recounts in epic style {{the life and}} achievements of his patron king Vikramaditya VI. The work narrates the episode of Vikramaditya VI's accession to the Chalukya throne after overthrowing his elder brother Someshvara II. The great Indian mathematician Bhāskara II (born c.1114) flourished during this time. From <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>account</b> in his famous work Siddhanta Siromani (c. 1150, comprising the Lilavati, Bijaganita on algebra, Goladhaya on the celestial globe and Grahaganita on planets) Bijjada Bida (modern Bijapur) was his native place.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 1943, the 32nd Infantry Regiment {{was pinned}} down by enemy {{fire in the}} {{vicinity}} of Fish Hook Ridge, in the Aleutian Islands. On <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez {{was shot in the head}} as he approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying of the wound the following day. Because of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Producer Alan Douglas {{had helped}} Duke Ellington with errands {{when they were}} both working in Paris in the early 1960s.

5|$|Upon Andronikos's death, two factions emerged at court: the {{supporters}} of Kantakouzenos, chiefly provincial magnates from Macedonia and Thrace, and those opposed to him, led mainly by the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, who obtained the support of Andronikos's widow, Anna of Savoy. Kantakouzenos did not claim the throne for himself, but demanded the regency, based on his close association with the deceased emperor, and {{with the support of}} the capital's troops secured it. His position, however, was weakened by the adherence of Apokaukos to the Patriarch's camp; Kantakouzenos, in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> relates that Apokaukos had urged him to seize the throne in hopes of his own advancement, and when he refused, the powerful chancellor switched over to his opponents' camp.|$|E
5|$|When Jeanne Silberman {{felt that}} her son's {{potential}} {{was not being}} fully realized in Wisconsin, she sent him to Black-Foxe, a military institute in Hollywood, where he was bullied and sexually assaulted, primarily {{because he was the}} only Jewish boy in the school, according to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>account.</b> After an unsuccessful short stay at Black-Foxe, Wilder returned home and became increasingly involved with the local theatre community.

5|$|According to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963.

Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E
