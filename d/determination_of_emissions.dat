40|$|Many {{pollutants}} are {{of importance}} for assessing the adverse impact of the air pollution, e. g. NO 2, CO, lead, VOCs and particulate matter. In addition to monitoring of traditional pollutants, measurements of benzene, toluene and xylenes {{have been carried out}} in central Copenhagen since 1994. A method to determine emissions from the actual car fleet under realistic driving conditions has been developed. The method is based on air quality measurements, traffic counts and inverse application of street air quality models. Using this method average emission factors of CO, NOx and benzene for the fleet of petrol fuelled vehicles was estimated for the period 1994 - 1999. The trends were related to the measures taken to reduce the emissions from vehicles, i. e. percentage of catalyst cars and fuel composition. <b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> of ultrafine particles will be based on the same method.

40|$|The initial National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP - 40 CFR 61, Subpart H) Program at Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico (SNL/NM) required: (1) {{continuous}} air {{monitoring of}} sources if the calculated effective dose equivalent (EDE) {{to the maximum}} exposed individual (MEI) was > 0. 1 mrem/yr; (2) the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> based on measurements or measured parameters if the EDE to the MEI was < 0. 1 mrem/yr; and (3) the calculation of worst case releases when the expected air concentrations were below detection limits using standard monitoring equipment.

The level of effort required to implement these activities was independent of the EDE contributing from individual sources. A recent programmatic review found the NESHAP program to be in excess of the legal requirements. A further review found that, in summation, 13 of 16 radionuclide sources had a negligible impact on the final calculated EDE to the MEI used to demonstrate compliance at 20 separate on-site receptor locations.

Aircraft measurements of methane mixing ratio profiles are input to the model, from which influence functions are obtained; these are the footprints of potential contributing emissions. Inversion techniques and statistical analysis enable the determination of confidence intervals for methane emissions. Results are compared with prior emissions data obtained by other methods. For two case studies in the Manawatu region of New Zealand in June 1995 and April 1997, methane emission fluxes of 54732 and 56754 mgm 2 d 1 are obtained (95 % confidence intervals). These are consistent with independently estimated per-animal emission rates and observed livestock densities. For a field campaign in New Zealand’s Waikato region in 1999, where no emissions estimates were available a priori, the average emission fluxes derived using receptor-oriented techniques are 67746 mgm 2 d 1. The error-bars on the emission fluxes are arguably quite large. This is due to uncertainties in the methane observations and errors in the meteorological simulations, which play a different role in each case study. Improvements in both the experimental and modelling procedures are proposed to reduce uncertainties in the calculated emission fluxes...|$|E
40|$|The Region of Western Macedonia in Greece {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} areas in Europe due to large lignite ¿ fired power plants with total installed capacity of approx. 4500 MW. The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> and emission factors for the region is an essential part of the EU-supported project SMAQ, aimed at developing methods for optimizing pollution abatement plans and for early warning of extreme pollution incidents. Using various data sources and the CORINAIR methodology, emissions and local emission factors have been estimated for the main industrial and non-industrial activities in that region. Biogenic sources such as animal husbandry and agricultural activities have been examined as well. The particular source sectors examined include power plants, lignite mining, road transport, central heating systems and agriculture. Calculated emission factors are based on data from the local pollution sources, while default values from CORINAIR or other sources are used to fill existing data gaps. An emissions inventory concerning major pollutants (PM, SO 2, NOx, CO, N 2 O, VOC, CH 4, NH 3) was compiled for the period 2001 ¿ 2004. As expected, the most significant pollutants are SO 2 and NOx, followed by PM and CO, emitted from power plants. However, CO emissions due to road transportation are also quite significant.

40|$|The {{emission}} behaviour {{with regard}} to dust, ozone and VOC (TVOC) of nine different hardcopy devices in combination with suitable air sampling and analysis procedures was investigated in different emission test chambers (two different 1 m" 3 - chambers and one 20 m" 3 -chamber). Air sampling and analysis for VOC were done by means of Tenax TA and subsequent thermal desorption (TDS) in connection with GC/MS. Ozone was determined continuously. The ozone analyser worked {{on the basis of}} the flame rid reaction of ozone with ethylene according to the principle of chemiluminescence. The dust determination was done gravimetrically by means of glass fibre filter and an ultra micro-balance. Additional the particle emission during the printing process was measured with a particle counter. The general technical conditions of the tested hardcopy devices were the reason for short printing times with a maximum of 36 minutes. In order to achieve the equilibrium concentration in the test chambers the air exchange rate in the 1 m" 3 - test chambers had to be increased to a value of n= 4, 0 to 4, 7 per hour. Additional to the examination of the hardcopy devices in the emission test chambers different papers were investigated by means of direct - TDS and different toners were tested by means of head space sampling in combination with GC/MS. For the examined hardcopy devices emission rates were determined. The emission rates for TVOC ranged from 0, 41 to 22, 4 mg per piece and hour, for ozone from less than 0, 02 to 4, 6 mg per piece and hour and for dust from 0, 10 to 7, 63 mg per piece and hour. The comparison between recycling paper and paper produced form primary fibres showed in general higher SVOC emissions from recycling paper.

40|$|AbstractThe use of amine {{solvents}} in post-combustion {{carbon capture}} (PCCC) pilot and demonstration plants has {{increased over the}} last several years, and subsequently a clear understanding of the potential human and environmental impacts of those solvents has become increasingly more important. EPRI convened a workshop of international stakeholders in 2011 entitled “Health and Environmental Toxicity of Amines for Post-Combustion Carbon Capture: Launching a Dialogue on Research Needs”. A main goal was to bring together members of the solvent development community, government agencies, environmental organizations, academic researchers, industry, and other stakeholders to discuss different approaches to evaluating toxicity of solvents for CO 2 capture, particularly in face of proprietary issues. Several research needs were identified, including improved risk assessment methodologies, additional pilot plant emissions data, improved understanding of atmospheric chemistry and losses. However despite these critical knowledge gaps the key outcome was that these gaps are “fillable” and are not “deal- breakers” for the technology. Another critical need identified by a majority of the 2011 Workshop attendees was to standardize stack sampling and analytical methods for amines and their degradation products. This led to the development in early 2012 of an international “Amine and Amine Degradation Products Methods Standardization Working Group”. The group goals are to collaboratively evaluate efficacy of methods that already have or could be applied in power plant stacks, to discuss how to improve characterization of sampling artifacts, and to design a testing program to evaluate various sampling and analytical methods. The long-term goal of the working group is to produce guidelines for more accurate and consistent <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> of amines, related compounds, and their degradation products. Methods reviewed included both online (e. g. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; proton- transfer-reaction and other types of mass spectrometry) and offline or manual (e. g. sorbent trapping and thermal desorbtion) analysis for both gas and particle phase compounds. The overall themes that emerged included the dependence of emissions and appropriate methods on the design and major components of the pilot facilities, the potential impacts of mist formation, and the need for additional laboratory and in-situ method comparison and evaluation testing programs. The results of EPRI's community-based efforts will be used to help direct future research on amine emissions, sampling and analysis methods, environmental fate and transport, and health impacts...|$|E
40|$|A. Context One of the {{objectives}} of the European Construction Products Directive (CPD) is to harmonize the technical specifications with regard to dangerous substances and construction materials. Construction products could emit or contain dangerous substances that have been defined as dangerous substances under Commission directives and national regulations. In the future construction products may only be placed on the market in the European Union if they accord with the (second generation) harmonized technical specifications including health aspects and bear the CE mark. B. Objectives The goal of this research project is to improve the flow of knowledge and information vis-à-vis normalisation activities in the domain of indoor air measurements, indoor product emission testing, labeling and certification by proposing an evaluation method and standardized assessment methods for a harmonized approach relating to emissions from building materials into indoor air for implementation in Belgium. This approach will comply with current European harmonizing efforts ongoing on European level. C. Conclusions 	International tendencies as well as national developments indicate the growing importance of building material emission testing 	Harmonisation of governmental schemes to assess volatile organic emissions {{in the context of the}} CPD is necessary to obtain transparency 	The topic of different limit values in different countries is a difficult problem to solve 	It was demonstrated that it is possible with alternative methods (µ-chamber and FLEC) to achieve a qualitative and quantitative correlation with the reference method. However there is a need to extend this comparative study to more materials 	 The important influence of the quantification procedure on the emission results was demonstrated 	The possiblity to investigate microbial resistance of building materials with the so called µ-chamber technique was demonstrated 	A twofold methodology for the odour determination of building materials was developed: a quantitative method based on intensity and a qualitative method based on hedonic scale. Furthermore the basis for the development of an electronic nose specific for evaluation of building materials was laid down 	A possible evaluation scheme for Belgium on the basis of AFSSET/AgBB/prEN 15052 was proposed with two modifications: -	Time path modification (7 or 10 days) -	Prescreening with alternative method (< 20 L) D.

40|$|The {{promulgation}} of Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulations 2014 {{on emissions}} from {{coal-fired power plants}} in Malaysia has prompted power plant operators to adopt emission control strategy that complies with the new emission limits. Currently, various emission control strategies are available to achieve the desired emission level. Each strategy offers unique advantages and disadvantages, depending on the objective <b>of</b> <b>emissions</b> control, process nature, and constraints on the resources incurred.

A model that relates the source distribution to the concentration data is formulated and Bayesian probability theory is used to derive the posterior probability for the source parameters (e. g., location, emission rate). The Bayesian inference methodology for source reconstruction is validated against real dispersion data sets...|$|R
40|$|The result <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> {{formaldehyde}} <b>emission</b> from particleboard samples glued with {{urea formaldehyde}} and mixture of UF and MF resin is {{reported in this}} paper. The particleboard samples were selected from two different factories {{in addition to those}} prepared in the laboratory at the center. The values <b>of</b> formaldehyde <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> particleboard prepared in the laboratory are between 6. 154 ppm (Jeungjing) and 18. 720 ppm (meranti kuning), from factory A between 0. 295 ppm- 7. 710 ppm; while from factory B between 13. 246 ppm- 23. 691 ppm. Board samples from factory A glued with mixture of UF and MF resins. on the other hand, show an average <b>emission</b> value <b>of</b> 0. 295 ppm...|$|R
40|$|A new {{accurate}} <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> beta-delayed neutron <b>emission</b> probabilities from nuclei in the {{low mass}} region of the light fission group has been performed. The measurements were carried out using the BELEN 4 pi neutron counter at the IGISOL-JYFL mass separator in combination with a Penning trap. The new results significantly improve the uncertainties <b>of</b> neutron <b>emission</b> probabilities for Br- 91, As- 86, As- 85, and Ge- 85 nuclei. Postprint (published version...|$|R
