Each {{of the three}} trials had two co-primary endpoints, one for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) {{and the other for}} sexual desire. Each of the 3 trials also had a secondary endpoint that measured distress related to sexual desire. All three trials showed that flibanserin produced {{an increase in the number}} of SSEs and reduced distress related to sexual desire. The first two trials used an <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> to measure sexual desire, and did not find an increase. These two trials also measured sexual desire using the Female Sexual Function index (FSFI) as a secondary endpoint, and an increase was observed using this latter measure.

5000|$|Since {{the summer}} of 2014 HowNutsAreTheDutch {{provides}} an automated <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> study. This {{is also known as}} the ecological momentary assessment methodology. With this diary study participants can monitor their emotions, behaviour, somatic symptoms, and well-being over 30 days (3 times a day), which results in a personal network model. There is no financial compensation for taking part in the research; instead, if participants fill in the diary often enough they get a personal, automatically generated report in return. The web-platform uses automated vector autoregression models to determine cause-effect relationships between the measured features in the time series data. Results evidence substantial between-person variability in within-person associations. The diary study featured in the Dutch magazine [...] "Psychologie" [...] as a Quantified Self tool. Some researchers coupled data from commercially available sensors (i.e., their Apple Watch, Google Fit, Jawbone, NikeFuel, or Misfit) to their HowNutsAreTheDutch diary data to study the interaction between their physical and psychological processes.|$|E
5000|$|Event {{sampling}} methodology (ESM) {{refers to a}} diary study. ESM {{is also known as}} ecological momentary assessment (EMA) or experience {{sampling methodology}}. ESM includes sampling methods that allow researchers to study ongoing experiences and events by taking assessments one or more times per day per participant (n=1) in the naturally occurring social environment. ESM enables researchers to study the prevalence of behaviors, promote theory development, and to serve an exploratory role. The frequent sampling of events inherent in ESM enables researchers to measure the typology of activity and detect the temporal and dynamic fluctuations of experiences (e.g., at work, or in a relationship). The popularity of ESM as a new form of research design increased over the recent years, because it addresses the shortcomings of cross-sectional research which cannot detect intra-individual variances and processes across time and cause-effect relationships. In ESM, participants are asked to record their experiences and perceptions in a paper or <b>electronic</b> <b>diary.</b> Diary studies allow for the studying of events that occur naturally but are difficult to examine in the lab. For conducting event sampling, SurveySignal and Expimetrics [...] are becoming popular platforms for social science researchers. Experience sampling studies increasingly use sensor data.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate electronic diaries as a tool for investigating associations between physical symptoms and psychological variables. METHODS: A qualitative systematic review of <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> studies in pain and symptoms research was performed. RESULTS: Studies of <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> use report good acceptability and accuracy of data recording. A descriptive classification of the findings of <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> studies yielded five categories: experience, recording data when symptoms were present; interaction, testing the relationship between variables at different levels; sequential, observing associations at different time lags; process, recording possible mediating constructs such as catastrophization and self-efficacy; and intervention, recording during treatment to identify trends. Most data from diary studies suggest relatively weak associations between variables. CONCLUSION: Electronic diaries are a potentially valuable tool for psychosomatic research.

40|$|Abstract: After initial use for treatment-documentation {{within the}} scope of {{follow-up}} studies, <b>electronic</b> <b>diaries</b> are increasingly implemented in clinical settings. Particu-larly, diaries seem to fit very well in areas where ”paper and pencil-diaries ” yet con-stitute well established elements of symptom-focussed treatment settings, including a detailed description and analysis of problem behaviour. This e. g. applies to treatment of eating disorders like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder (BED). BED is characterised by ingestion of a large amount of food in a discrete pe-riod of time, accompanied by a sense of loss of control. BED in particular appears to be predisposed for the use of electronic diaries: By the mean of self-observation based on diary recording, information about triggers of problem behaviour, thoughts, somatic symptoms, and feelings experienced during a binge, as well as patient’s reactions in a detailed manner may be assessed. Therefore, as a therapeutic mean, <b>electronic</b> <b>diaries</b> are fostering taking-over of self-responsibility and thus, will raise treatment motivation. Especially when binge eating and loss of control occur, the use of diaries enhances self-control and self-regulation. <b>Electronic</b> <b>diaries</b> realised on handheld-computers (Palm 100 m) are used {{within the scope}} of an intervention study realised by the Dept. of General Internal and Psy-chosomatic Medicine of the University of Heidelberg, focussing on treatment of obese patients with binge eating disorder. Purpose of the study is the registration of therapeu-tic relevant information as well as the assessment of progression within a multimodal, out-patient group therapy. First experiences demonstrate the feasibility of mobile computing systems even with elder out-patients with no or little technical knowledge. However, implementa-tion of the system requires focussing particularly on technical aspects. Limitations which may result from insertion of innovative technical equipment (particularly, a sus-ceptibility to electronic problems and maybe resulting in restrictions of data) should be considerated in an adequate manner during scheduling. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, {{electronic}} diaries {{are increasingly}} used in medical {{research and practice}} to investigate patients' processes and fluctuations in symptoms over time. To model dynamic dependence structures and feedback mechanisms between symptom-relevant variables, a multivariate time series method has to be applied. Methods We propose to analyse the temporal interrelationships among the variables by a structural modelling approach based on graphical vector autoregressive (VAR) models. We give a comprehensive description of the underlying concepts and explain how the dependence structure can be recovered from <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> data by a search over suitable constrained (graphical) VAR models. Results The graphical VAR approach {{is applied to the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> data of 35 obese patients with and without binge eating disorder (BED). The dynamic relationships for the two subgroups between eating behaviour, depression, anxiety and eating control are visualized in two path diagrams. Results show that the two subgroups of obese patients with and without BED are distinguishable by the temporal patterns which influence their respective eating behaviours. Conclusion The use of the graphical VAR approach for the analysis of <b>electronic</b> <b>diary</b> data leads to a deeper insight into patient's dynamics and dependence structures. An increasing use of this modelling approach could lead {{to a better understanding of}} complex psychological and physiological mechanisms in different areas of medical care and research. </p...|$|E
