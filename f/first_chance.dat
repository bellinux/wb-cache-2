5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting a cross from Paul Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt heading the ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams, Lineker looked up, before making a cross for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline {{continued}} to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team. This gave the English crowds their <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> to see {{what all the fuss}} was about. Ken Farnes, the Cambridge University fast bowler, also bowled it in the University Match, hitting a few Oxford batsmen.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Madhavan {{appeared}} in a supporting role as an Indian police officer in Fred Olen Ray's English film, Inferno, which was shot in India. His <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> in Indian cinema {{came in the form}} of Shanti Shanti Shanti (1998), a Kannada film, in which he appeared as a carefree youngster alongside actor Abbas. However, the film failed to make an impact and went unnoticed at the box office. During the period, Hindi film director Vinod Pandey launched Madhavan as a Bollywood hero, with a project titled Akeli, however the film was shelved before the production process had been completed.|$|E

25|$|The {{seats of}} Tauranga and Epsom {{provided}} particular resonances: Winston Peters failed to retake the marginal Tauranga (and Ron Mark {{failed to win}} the Rimutaka seat), meaning New Zealand <b>First's</b> <b>chances</b> of returning to the House depended on winning 5% of the party vote, which they did not accomplish. Similarly, the electoral fortunes of the ACT Party depended very largely on Rodney Hide retaining Epsom, which he did.|$|R
5|$|In 1998, Duncan was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} last two players for the United States national team for the World Basketball Championship. However, this team was later replaced with CBA and college players because of the NBA lockout. Duncan's <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but a knee injury forced him {{to stay out of the}} Olympic Games themselves.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked the}} game off, and also {{fashioned}} the <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren {{on the left}} wing to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head the ball over the crossbar after losing his marker. Two minutes later, a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence time to get back.|$|E
5|$|Woodall's <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> {{to work on}} {{television}} came about when Granada Sky Broadcasting signed her and Constantine to host a daytime shopping show, also called Ready to Wear. Soon after their television debut, {{they were given a}} recurring makeover slot on Richard & Judy. This gained them crucial exposure and attention from Jane Root, controller of BBC Two, who signed them to the channel encouraged by their tenacity and their book and internet business.|$|E
5000|$|Scott Yanow of Allmusic says, [...] "Tenor-saxophonist Benny Golson's third {{recording}} as {{a leader}} was significant in two ways. It was his first {{opportunity to work with}} trombonist Curtis Fuller (the two would be members of The Jazztet by 1960) {{and it was one of}} his <b>first</b> <b>chances</b> to really stretch out on record as a soloist; up to this point Golson was possibly better known as a composer".|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>chances</b> of {{the match}} fell to Manchester United's Paul Scholes, who {{took a couple of}} {{long-range}} efforts at goal - one went just wide while another was tipped away by Millwall goalkeeper Andy Marshall. Scholes was presented with another opportunity on the six-yard line, when a rabona cross from Cristiano Ronaldo found him unmarked; the midfielder seemed as surprised by the cross as everyone else and completely missed the ball with his hooked shot.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, as {{he wanted}} to get <b>first</b> team <b>chances,</b> he decided to {{transfer}} to Michelotti. However, he had only played Michelotti for 2 games.|$|R
5|$|As consul he {{took part}} in a number of Senate debates. His <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> to shine in the Senate came in the dispute between ex-preator Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Cornelius failed to give his seat to Corbula at a gladiatorial show, and the {{incident}} sparked a debate between the rights of age and the defenders of tradition, in which Drusus argued a rapprochement. In another, it was proposed by Caecina Severus that the wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in the provinces. Caecina delivered a speech in support of the bill, followed with speeches by both Valerius Messalinus and Drusus in opposition to it. The proposal was then abandoned, not because of the arguments made, but because of the intervention of an external force (the auctoritas of Drusus) the same reason for the later repeal of the Oppian law (lex Oppia).|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{opened the}} scoring after only eight {{minutes of the}} match through teenage {{hometown}} midfielder Hamilton. A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by Shutt into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders and, despite the fact he was stumbling, shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball going in after hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through Shutt and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, Shutt {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E
5|$|CSKA kicked-off {{the first}} half of extra-time. Five minutes into the half, Liverpool {{substitute}} Sinama Pongolle was booked. With two minutes of the half remaining, the ball was played into the centre of the CSKA half; Ignashevich misjudged the flight of the ball, which went over his head and fell to Cissé. His subsequent shot was saved by Akinfeev, but the ball rebounded to Cissé who scored to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. The half was brought to an end with Liverpool leading {{for the first time in}} the match. Liverpool kicked-off the second half of extra-time. CSKA had the <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> of the half, but Vágner Love's effort was easily saved by Reina. Liverpool responded midway through the half; Cissé's cross from the right side of the pitch was met by García, who scored. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|However, his <b>first</b> team <b>chances</b> became limited at Everton {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Dave Watson in August 1986, and injuries didn't help his <b>chances</b> of <b>first</b> team football either.|$|R

5|$|Chelsea {{created their}} <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> {{of the match}} after 18 minutes – a shot from Lampard which hit Kolo Touré. They fought back to equalise two minutes later. Ballack {{launched}} the ball to Drogba {{on the right-hand side}} of Arsenal’s penalty area. Diverting his markers who attempted to set the offside trap, Drogba took the ball and shot it past Manuel Almunia's goal to score. The equaliser led to Chelsea asserting themselves in the match as the team began to build up possession. Denílson, at the midway point of the half, received the game’s first yellow card for a foul on Essien; the Chelsea midfielder was later booked for a tackle on Baptista. Sticks of celery were thrown at Fàbregas before he took a corner close to stoppage time; targeting opponents with the vegetable was a Chelsea supporter’s ritual going back more than two decades and originated from song.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He {{then opened the}} bowling and castled home captain Les Berry for one to leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{created the}} <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> {{of the game}} in the 20th minute. A pass from John Barnes sent Steve Nicol clear to shoot, but his effort saw the ball roll wide of the far post. Liverpool created a further {{opportunity}} six minutes after – from a free-kick delivered by Barnes on the left, Rush managed to outjump his marker and head the ball {{in the direction of the}} Arsenal goal. It however hit the near post and rebounded in the direction of Arsenal goalkeeper John Lukic. Minutes after the half-hour mark, Liverpool scored the opening goal – a long ball from Barry Venison went behind the Arsenal defence and reached Peter Beardsley. Unimpeded, he controlled the ball and shot it with his right foot to score. Arsenal's Kevin Richardson missed a chance to level the scoreline after good play by Lee Dixon; from outside the penalty box he scuffed his shot and the ball went over the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool had {{a chance}} to take the lead before half-time. Phil Neal {{advanced}} down the right hand side of the pitch and found Dalglish who passed to Graeme Souness, who ran late through the Real defence. His subsequent shot was not held by Agustín Rodríguez, but Souness was unable to get to the rebounded ball. Real had the <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> of the second half. Liverpool's defence had stopped as they thought Cunningham was offside, however he was not and Camacho advanced towards Ray Clemence in the Liverpool goal. Clemence came off his line and ran towards the Real midfielder, Camacho attempted to lob the ball over the keeper, but his shot went over the goal.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the match}} {{and they had}} <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> of the match in the fourth minute, but the free-kick by midfielder Murphy was caught by United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Defender Henchoz was shown a yellow card in the 12th minute and United midfielder Giggs had the first shot of the match, which was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Twice {{in the next few}} minutes, Liverpool had chances from moves down the {{right-hand}} side of the pitch. On both occasions, however, the pass into the penalty area was intercepted. United had a chance to score in the 20th minute. Keane passed to Scholes, who found Giggs on the left-hand side of the pitch. His cross into the penalty area found striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, but his shot went wide of the Liverpool goal.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} the <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> of {{the second}} half after just three minutes, when Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received the ball {{on the edge of the}} penalty area and held it up before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E

Presales were held for U2.com subscribers, with those holding membership the longest getting the <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> to purchase tickets. Sales were strong, with initial dates in Chicago and outside Boston and New York selling out within minutes once the public sale began, and with second shows being added at each venue. Due to the higher capacity of the 360 degree configuration, the shows often set records for the largest concert attendance at each venue; tour director Craig Evans claims the tour set attendance records for 60 different venues. Two of the U2 360° Tour's concerts remain {{in the top five}} highest-attended single concerts in the United States ever, with the 25 October performance in Pasadena, California, setting the record at 97,014 attendees.|$|E
