5|$|Following the US 33 interchange, Skyline Drive heads {{southwest}}. The roadway {{passes through}} Smith Roach <b>Gap</b> <b>and</b> {{comes to the}} Bacon Hollow Overlook to the south, where it curves to the west. The drive heads through Powell <b>Gap</b> <b>and</b> reaches the west-facing Eaton Hollow Overlook, where it turns to the southwest and winds along. The road bends south and comes to a ranger station at Simmonds Gap. Skyline Drive continues southerly to the Loft Mountain Overlook on the east side, where it turns westerly before heading northwest. The roadway then makes a hairpin turn to the southwest. The road straddles the border of Rockingham and Albemarle counties and continues to the south to the Loft Mountain Wayside, which is site of restrooms and food service. Skyline Drive heads southwest and comes to Loft Mountain, where a ranger station, restrooms, campground, and camp store are located. The drive heads past Browns Gap Parking before it comes to Dundo, where an overlook to the northwest, restrooms, picnic grounds, and Dundo Group Camp are located.|$|E

WhaT IS aLREady knoWn on ThIS TopIc: • The gender pay <b>gap</b> is substantial <b>and</b> slowly declined until 2007 / 08 when it slightly increased. pay penalties persist for women. • There is only limited evidence on pay <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> pay penalties by gender and ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and disability. WhaT ThIS REpoRT addS: • This is the first study to analyse average hourly pay <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> pay penalties by gender and ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation and age. • Gender pay <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> penalties tend to persist, regardless of group. Most groups of ethnic minority women and men (though not all) experience pay <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> pay penalties, but the variation across groups stands out. • disabled women and men experience substantial pay <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> pay penalties. • younger and older workers experience pay gaps, but do not tend to suffer pay penalties. • The findings on religion and sexual orientation are mixed. • The higher qualified you are, the less {{likely you are to}} suffer pay <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> pay penalties, though this does not hold for every group...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Fundamental to {{multiple}} sequence alignment algorithms is modeling insertions <b>and</b> deletions (<b>gaps).</b> The most prevalent model {{is to use}} <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties. While <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties are well understood conceptually, their effects on multiple sequence alignment, and consequently on phylogeny scores are not as well understood. We use exhaustive phylogeny searching to explore the effects of varying the <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties for three nuclear ribosomal data sets. Particular attention is given to optimal phylogeny scores for 200 alignments {{of a range of}} <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties <b>and</b> their respective distribution of phylogeny scores...|$|R

5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment were {{driven out of}} Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{in the process of}} being relieved, returned to the front, closed the <b>gap,</b> <b>and</b> pushed the Ottoman soldiers back out of the lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 21 August, tanks of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had linked with Polish forces at Coudehard, and the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry {{divisions}} had secured St. Lambert and the northern passage to Chambois; the Falaise pocket had been sealed. Approximately 20–50,000 German troops, minus heavy equipment, escaped through the <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> were reorganized and rearmed, in time to slow the Allied advance into the Netherlands and Germany.|$|E

40|$|Third order {{amplitude}} equations on hexagonal lattices can be {{used for}} predicting the existence and stability of stripes, <b>gaps,</b> <b>and</b> spots in pattern forming systems. These amplitude equations predict the nonexistence of bistable ranges between <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> spots and tristable ranges between stripes, <b>gaps,</b> <b>and</b> spots. In contrast, numerical studies show the existence of such tristable ranges. In the present work we use amplitude equations up to the fifth order for finding such bistable and tristable ranges.

5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened {{what remained of the}} Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; such a move would have overstretched them. Without consulting the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher who began from pole position. Barrichello began from {{third on the}} grid and overtook Coulthard going into the first corner.

During the course of the second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to close the <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position. Barrichello took third, ahead of BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve in fourth.|$|E
5|$|Following Dunmore's War, Richard Henderson, a {{prominent}} judge from North Carolina, hired Boone {{to travel to}} the Cherokee towns in present North Carolina and Tennessee and inform them of an upcoming meeting. In the 1775 treaty, Henderson purchased the Cherokee claim to Kentucky to establish a colony called Transylvania. Afterwards, Henderson hired Boone to blaze {{what became known as the}} Wilderness Road, which went through the Cumberland <b>Gap</b> <b>and</b> into central Kentucky. Along with a party of about 30 workers, Boone marked a path to the Kentucky River, where he founded Boonesborough. Other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone returned to the Clinch Valley and brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} syntax <b>and</b> distribution of <b>Gapping</b> <b>and</b> Fragments, {{as well as}} the movements involved in ellipsis contexts in general. In the first part, it is argued that the syntax of <b>Gapping</b> <b>and</b> Fragments is identical. In the second part it is argued that the licensing condition on ellipsis holds at the discourse component and that, from a discourse perspective, the distribution of <b>Gapping</b> <b>and</b> Fragments is identical. The main claim of this study, then, is that <b>Gapping</b> <b>and</b> Fragments should not be formally distinguished in a theory of ellipsis. The final part of this dissertation is concerned with the movements of the remnant elements of ellipsis. Answers are provided to questions such as why these movements are often impossible in non-elliptical contexts and what it is that triggers these movement...|$|R

The former {{approaches}} to the Darlington's Bridge, which itself was dismantled by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission in 1954, became Route 163 in New Jersey and State Route 1039 in Pennsylvania. The US 611 freeway was designated I-80 by 1960, and US 611 was moved back to its old all-Pennsylvania alignment by 1972, leaving US 46 to end at I-80 and Route 94.|$|E

In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
5|$|Kubica {{dropped to}} 13th as his {{traction}} control fault worsened, and a train of cars {{that wanted to}} pass developed behind him. Kovalainen's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the <b>gap</b> <b>and</b> Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal, the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E
