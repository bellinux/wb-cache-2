In 1903 the military held a competition with £1000 first prize for a tractor that must weigh under 13 tons ready for the road, could haul 25 tons for 40 miles at 3 mph average speed including gradients of 1 in 18, and should be capable of 8 mph with <b>half</b> <b>load</b> and be able to climb 1 in 6 slopes towing that <b>half</b> <b>load.</b> Other conditions included winch capability of 15 tons, and ability to cross 2 feet of water. The results of the trial were reported in The Automotor Journal. When the trials were held only one vehicle attended, the Hornsby Heavy Oil Tractor. Not only did it win the £1000 prize for meeting the criteria laid down, but it received a bonus of £180 for completing 58 miles towing its 25-ton load before requiring fuel or water.|$|E

Operation of the stack under various scenarios was simulated such as start-up from room temperature, steady state at full and <b>half</b> <b>load</b> and sudden changes of load (from full to <b>half</b> <b>load</b> and reverse), under constant or variable flow rate of the cooling air. In variable power load operation, the stack temperature is not constant. One interesting finding of this analysis is that liquid water occurs at the outlet whenever the stack temperature falls below 60 °C, although the nominal operating conditions were selected such {{that there is no}} liquid water at the outlet at steady state operation. The results also indicate that this particular stack has insufficient heat exchange area with cooling air resulting in relatively large cooling air flow rates and low temperatures...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{adsorption}} of toluene on pure-silica MEL zeolite is investigated using {{a variety}} of experimental and simulation methods. First, we measured the volumetric and calorimetric isotherms at 301 K and at 315 K. The volumetric adsorption isotherm presents a substep at a loading of roughly 4 molecules per unit cell that shifts to higher pressures at higher temperatures and that coincides with a sudden increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the substep at <b>half</b> <b>load</b> is caused by the {{adsorption of toluene}} molecules at different energetic sites within the porous network. According to this, toluene molecules occupy first the intersections, and once all intersections are filled, additional toluene molecules place themselves within the channels. The structure of the adsorbate/adsorbent system was further investigated by performing X-ray powder diffraction experiments of the zeolite at three different loads: empty, at <b>half</b> <b>load</b> (before the substep), and at high load (after the substep). Numerous new low intensity peaks and splittings of existing peaks at the empty and half-loaded diffractograms appear in the diffraction pattern of the high load sample. Atomic structural models compatible with the experimental spectra were obtained by performing N-reverse Monte Carlo simulations. Whereas at <b>half</b> <b>load</b> a good fit of the experimental diffraction pattern can be obtained using the rigid zeolite approximation, at high load, this is only possible when the flexibility of the zeolite is incorporated. In this structural model, the channel cross sections are deformed from a nearly circular shape in the empty zeolite to a more elliptical shape {{in the case of the}} high load zeolite.

40|$|A novel {{in-cylinder}} {{pressure method}} for determining ignition delay {{has been proposed}} and demonstrated. This method proposes a new Bayesian statistical model to resolve the start of combustion, defined as being {{the point at which}} the band-pass in-cylinder pressure deviates from background noise and the combustion resonance begins. Further, it is demonstrated that this method is still accurate in situations where there is noise present. The start of combustion can be resolved for each cycle without the need for ad hoc methods such as cycle averaging. Therefore, this method allows for analysis of consecutive cycles and inter-cycle variability studies. Ignition delay obtained by this method and by the net rate of heat release have been shown to give good agreement. However, the use of combustion resonance to determine the start of combustion is preferable over the net rate of heat release method because it does not rely on knowledge of heat losses and will still function accurately in the presence of noise. Results for a six-cylinder turbo-charged common-rail diesel engine run with neat diesel fuel at full, three quarters and <b>half</b> <b>load</b> have been presented. Under these conditions the ignition delay was shown to increase as the load was decreased with a significant increase in ignition delay at <b>half</b> <b>load,</b> when compared with three quarter and full loads...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a case study}} on the utilization of global solar radiation data on horizontal surface to perform economical feasibility of using Photovoltaic (PV) panels with battery backup to meet a small load for a camping site in Saudi Arabia. The analysis considers three scenarios with daily average energy demands of: (i) full load, (ii) 75 % load and (iii) <b>half</b> <b>load</b> with annual peak load of 3. 84, 3. 06 and 2. 27 kW, respectively. Each of these loads is further studied economically to investigate the effect of battery storage for 1 to 5 days. The study also compares the cost of electricity generation in $/kWh from PV system and diesel generating systems. The lower mean temperature (~ 20 °C) and high intensity of radiation (~ 6. 3 kWh m 2 /day) in Abha make it a promising site for the usage of PV systems for desert camping. Analysis of the data indicates that the battery storage capacity cost {{plays an important role}} in the overall cost of the PV system. The economical indicators suggest that larger PV systems be preferred over the smaller ones with minimal storage option.

40|$|This study {{examines}} high rate vermicomposting {{of sewage sludge}} using high stocking densities of earthworms. To examine the loading capacity, two vermicompost beds were established in identical 0. 84 in diameter reactors, one loaded at an average rate of 10 kg-wet-sludge-mixture m(- 2) day(- 1) (0. 5 kg-carbon m(- 2) day(- 1)), the other loaded at 20 kg-wet-sludge-mixture m(- 2) day(- 1) (1 kg-carbon m(- 2) day(- 1)). The sludge mixture was from a commercial vermicomposting company (Vermitecho) and contained 80 - 90 % sludge and 10 - 20 % green waste and clay. The beds were operated in fed-batch mode for 38 days, and then monitored for a further 12 days without any further sludge loading. Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were added once or twice weekly over the 38 days loading period to gradually decrease the ratio of sludge loading rate to total earthworm biomass. By adding earthworm incrementally, the feeding rate ranged from 3. 9 to 1. 25 kg-wet-sludge kg-earthworm(- 1) day(- 1) for the full load experiment and 2 - 0. 62 kg-wet-sludge kg-earthworm- 1 day(- 1) for the <b>half</b> <b>load</b> experiment. The extent of degradation was estimated by fitting a 1 st order model to the CO 2 production rate from the beds. Based on the 1 st order model, 53 +/- 20 % (95 % CI) and 68 +/- 4 % of the organic carbon was converted to CO 2 -C in the full load and <b>half</b> <b>load</b> experiments respectively. The CO 2 production rate in the <b>half</b> <b>load</b> experiment became stable and repeatable when the total earthworm biomass reached 5. 4 kg, corresponding to a feed rate of 1. 04 kg-wet-sludge-mixture kg-earth worm(- 1) 1 day(- 1). In contrast, the rate of CO 2 production was still climbing and traces of methane were evident in the full load experiment {{at the end of}} the 38 day loading period. The experiments indicate that high rate vermicomposting beds are sustainable providing the feeding rate does not exceed approximately 1 kg-wet-sludge kg-earthworm(- 1) day(- 1).
