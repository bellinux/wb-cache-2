50|$|One {{hypothetical}} {{example of}} instrumental convergence {{is provided by}} the Riemann Hypothesis catastrophe. Marvin Minsky, the co-founder of MIT's AI laboratory, has suggested that an artificial intelligence designed to solve the Riemann hypothesis might decide to take over all of <b>Earth's</b> <b>resources</b> to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal. If the computer had instead been programmed to produce as many paper clips as possible, it would still decide to take all of <b>Earth's</b> <b>resources</b> to meet its final goal. Even though these two final goals are different, both of them produce a convergent instrumental goal of taking over <b>Earth's</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|R
