Gluten samples were obtained by this method (doughs differing in water content from 42. 6 to 47. 1 %) and the rheological properties of dough and the corresponding gluten were studied in frequency sweep. The gluten coming from dough after ultracentrifugation had water contents in the range of 54. 2 – 58. 8 %. An increase in water content reduced the storage modulus to a greater extent than the loss modulus for the studied dough. The gluten was not affected to the same extent by an increase in water content, as was the dough. The ratios of G′dough/G′gluten and G″dough/G″gluten approached the value of 1 when the amount of dough water increased.

40|$|Re-milled {{durum wheat}} semolinas from Altamura, Laterza and Matera (Southern Italy), {{currently}} {{used in the}} production of traditional breads, were tested for quality. The re-milled semolinas exhibited variable technological quality, and different bread-making techniques were observed. Alveograph P/L ranged from 0. 34 to 2. 50 with W values from 71104 to 176104 J. The higher values were found in samples from Laterza, which gave breads with the lowest specific volumes, due to its excessive gluten tenacity. The P/L values were correlated to SDS sedimentation height; <b>dry</b> <b>gluten</b> was correlated to both wet gluten content and protein content, and was negatively correlated to P/L. Bread protein content was correlated to the protein content of the starting material and bread specific volumes were negatively correlated to alveographic P/L values. Significant differences were found between breads from different points of origin (attributable to differences in the bread-making processes), in terms of the level of total titratable acidity and the yellow pigment content of the crum...|$|E
40|$|Effect {{of barley}} flour on {{rheological}} characteristics of dough, organoleptic, nutritional and storage characteristics of south Indian parotta G Koushika Maiya, BG Shwetha and D Indrani Barley (Hordeum sativum) {{is a good}} source of dietary fibre, particularly b-glucan. Effect of 10, 20, 30 and 40 % barley flour on the rheological characteristics of dough and quality characteristics of south Indian parotta was studied. Use of increasing amount of barley flour from 0 to 40 % increased farinograph water absorption and decreased stability, increased extensograph resistance to extension and decreased extensibility, decreased amylograph set back and increased peak viscosity values. Sensory analysis showed that use of barley flour above 30 % brought about adverse effect on the quality of parotta. Addition of combination of 2 % <b>dry</b> <b>gluten</b> powder and 0. 001 % xylanase enzyme, XY (combination of improvers) decreased elasticity, increased exten-sibility of the dough and quality of parotta with 30 % BF. During 48 h of storage, parottas with 30 % barley flour remained softer than control parotta. The total dietary fibre and b-glucan contents of parotta with 30 % BF were 2. 0 and 10. 5 times higher than the control parotta...|$|E
40|$|Lanzou Alkaline Stretched Noodles (LASN) was a {{traditional}} staple food in northwest China for nearly 90 years. LASN specialty wheat breeding {{has become an}} important target since 1990 s. In order to discover the LASN specialty wheat quality requirement for allelic variations at Glu- 3 of northwest China spring wheats. Two northwest China spring wheat cultivars and 39 elite F 6 breeding lines were adopted to determine the low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) composition by one step one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) basing on the protocol of Singh et al. (1991). The results showed that Glu-A 3 d and Glu-B 3 g were correlated to high protein content, high volume of SDS-sediment and super dough strength (W). While Glu-A 3 a was bad to <b>dry</b> <b>gluten</b> content and SDS-sediment as well as dough properties such as dough strength (W) and dough tenacity (P). Moreover, Glu-B 3 j has not significant influence on flour quality, but it has the negative effect on dough strength (W) and dough extensibility (L). As for LASN quality, Glu-A 3 d and Glu-B 3 g were beneficial alleles and Glu-A 3 a was unbeneficial alleles for LASN quality...|$|E
40|$|Beef cattle {{longevity}} {{is related}} to reproductive success, which can be influenced by development system and maternal environment. Three experiments were conducted to determine the impact of development system, maternal protein supplementation, and ovarian steroidogenic environment on beef cattle reproduction. Experiment 1 evaluated the effect of heifer development system on heifer performance and reproduction. Heifers developed on corn residue (CR) had reduced BW from prebreeding through pregnancy diagnosis compared with drylot (DL) developed heifers, {{but there was no}} difference in reproductive performance. A subset DL and CR heifers were placed in an individual feeding system to determine feed efficiency during late gestation. Drylot heifers tended to have increased final BW and ADG. In Exp. 2, primiparous heifers were individually fed grass hay and received either no supplement (CON), a distillers based supplement (HIGH), or a <b>dried</b> corn <b>gluten</b> feed (LOW) based supplement during late gestation. Weaning calf BW tended to be greater for steers born to HIGH supplemented dams compared with CON. Similarly, carcass characteristics were altered in calves based on maternal nutrition. The objective of Exp. 3 was to identify the effect of ovarian and follicular environment on oocyte molecular phenotype. Ovariectomy was performed on beef cows approximately 36 h after CIDR removal and PGF administration. Cows were classified as high (HGE) or low (LGE) based on granulosa cell efficiency. Cows classified LGE had increased androgen secretion and expression of steroidogenic pathway enzymes in theca cells. Furthermore, mRNA abundance of ZAR 1 was reduced in LGE oocytes. In summary, these experiments support the following findings: (1) developing heifers on CR does not reduce reproductive performance or impact late gestation feed efficiency compared with DL-developed heifers; (2) primiparous heifer protein supplementation improved steer calf weaning BW and altered progeny carcass characteristics; (3) Increased androgen production in LGE animals increases steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and/or mRNA stability during oocyte growth and maturation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of corn co-products in beef systems in Iowa. A series of questions was developed and constructed into a survey format and distributed to 2, 157 producers of varying production types throughout Iowa using a database compiled by ISU Extension Beef Field Specialists. A total of 349 (n= 349) surveys were returned and evaluated. Of the surveys returned 243 producers indicated that they marketed fed cattle on an annual basis and 215 producers operated beef cow herds with some producers falling into both categories. Overall it was determined that Iowa producers are taking advantage of including corn co-products into their nutrition programs. Large operations are more actively feeding co-products with 87 % of beef cow operations over 200 head and over 90 % of all producers marketing more than 500 head indicating they are currently feeding corn coproducts. The most commonly fed co-products were <b>dry</b> corn <b>gluten</b> feed, wet corn <b>gluten</b> feed, <b>dried</b> distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), wet distillers grains with solubles (WDGS), and modified distillers grains with solubles (MDGS). When asked what the producers felt the primary advantages were for feeding corn co-products, the advantage of price was noted by an overwhelming majority (77 %). Producers were also asked how their use of corn coproducts has been influenced and the most popular responses were that more co-products will be fed and that a comparison will be made between the price paid for each corn co-product on a delivered dry matter basis. With his in mind, it is reasonable to believe that Iowa beef producers are focusing on the most economical nutrition programs and that using corn co-products are a viable and economical resource for feeding beef cattle in Iowa. However, some disadvantages were expressed by producers. The most common concerns were the storage issues of co-products, the problem of only needing a small amount of co-product at a time, and the increasing levels of sulfur common in corn co-products...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} effects of {{nitrogen}} supply, drought and UV radiation on wheat grain quality under the ambient and elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide. The theoretical part {{deals with the}} global climate changes, greenhouse gases and especially with effects of elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide on plants. Also, it is dealt with effects of elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide on the wheat grain quality. In the experimental part nitrogen content by the Kjeldahl method, contents of <b>dry</b> and wet <b>gluten,</b> Zeleny test, falling number and content of starch in the wheat samples were determined. The {{results of this study}} confirmed affecting the quality of the wheat grain from the elevated concentrations of CO 2, nitrogen fertilization, drought and UV radiation. The most evident was the influence of nitrogen nutrition, fertilization positively affected the quality of grain, there was an increase in content of crude protein, gluten content, value of Zeleny sedimentation test, and falling number. As a result of the increase in protein content was also a decrease in starch content. Due to increased levels of carbon dioxide protein content and gluten, Zeleny sedimentation test values and falling number decreased and conversely starch content increased. The decrease of Zeleny sedimentation test by the influence of elevated CO 2 concentration was fully compensated by nitrogen fertilization...|$|R
