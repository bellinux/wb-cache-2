5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E

I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E

Glasser and six other assistants resigned on April 7, 1939, during the tenure of [...] U.S. Attorney William Joseph Campbell. According to Campbell: [...] "Mr. Glasser has the best record of convictions of any one in this office and his conviction record in alcohol cases {{is the best in}} the entire country.

500|$|Brownlee denied {{absolutely}} MacMillan's claims. [...] He {{said that}} there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan, likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece. [...] To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General's office, he asserted [...] "in the thirteen years <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position." [...] He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until Christopher Pattinson, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Edson, told him. [...] He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee was what he would consider normal for a husband and wife (which was corroborated by his wife).|$|E

500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode; [...] "We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," [...] said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and as long as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the business, there are very few firsts." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry {{believed}} that his marriage was cursed and found confirmation in the Bible, in [...] Although {{in the morning}} following his wedding, Arthur had claimed that he was thirsty [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the midst of Spain last night" [...] and that [...] "having a wife is a good pastime", these claims are generally dismissed by modern historians as mere boasts of a boy {{who did not want}} others to know of his failure, and Catherine maintained the claim that she had married Henry while still a virgin until the day she died. After Henry's constant support of the claim that Catherine's first marriage had been consummated, an annulment was issued on 23 April 1533, while the King had already married Anne on 25 January. Anne was beheaded for high treason in 1536, after which Henry proceeded to marry four more times. At {{the time of his death}} in 1547, Henry only had three living children; the only son, Edward VI, succeeded but died six years later. His successors were Henry's daughters by Catherine and Anne, Mary I and Elizabeth I. Upon Elizabeth's death in 1603, the male line of the House of Tudor came to an end.|$|E
500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the past about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently." ...|$|E

Findlay {{was appointed to the}} Fair Work, Skills and Training portfolio, while Boyack became Shadow Minister for Rural Affairs, Food and Environment. Baillie was handed the post of Shadow Minister for Finance, Constitution and Economy, while Marra took on Health, Wellbeing and Sport. Other appointments to Labour's frontbench team were Mary Fee (Infrastructure, Investment and Cities), Gray (Education and Lifelong Learning), Ken Macintosh (Social Justice, Communities and Pensioners' Rights), Hugh Henry (Justice), Claire Baker (Culture, Europe and External Affairs), Kelly (Parliamentary Business Manager), Neil Bibby (Chief Whip), and Graeme Pearson (Enterprise). It was also announced that Dugdale would speak for Labour at First Minister's Questions. Lamont did not have a place in the new cabinet, but Murphy stated that she had not wanted one: [...] "Johann and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> touch with one another; she has wished me well. I'm looking forward to getting together with her, but Johann wasn't looking for a job in today's reshuffle. I think Johann will be {{a big part of the}} Scottish Labour Party for years to come".|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the job right from day one when everybody's new and {{getting to know each}} other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E
