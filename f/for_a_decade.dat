5|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> after World War II, Piłsudski {{was either}} ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, {{along with the}} entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E
5|$|The KKK had {{a revival}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> after 1915, {{especially}} in industrial {{cities and the}} Midwest. In 1921, Trotter was successful in shutting down new screenings of The Birth of a Nation in Boston; he allied with Roman Catholic organizations, who objected to the KKK's anti-Catholic stance of the 20th century, and were strong in {{the city as a}} result of extensive Irish and Italian immigration.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, Hydra and Psara {{had been}} reduced to {{secondary}} duties: Hydra became a gunnery training ship while Psara was used to train engine-room personnel. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war {{on the side of the}} Triple Entente and the Hydra-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and accommodation space <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b> All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{had laid}} out a five-year plan for success in 1925, and it came to {{fruition}} exactly on schedule, as his Arsenal won their first major trophy in the 1930 FA Cup Final, beating his old side, Huddersfield Town, 2–0. Despite having only finished 14th in the League the same season, the win spurred Arsenal on and laid the foundations <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> in which Arsenal would become the dominant team in England and eventually win five league titles.|$|E
5|$|During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards {{attacked}} the Jokhang in 1966 and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> {{there was no}} worship in Tibetan monasteries. Renovation of the Jokhang began in 1972, and was mostly complete by 1980. After this {{and the end of}} persecution, the temple was re-consecrated. It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, who come to worship Jowo in the temple's inner sanctum. During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly boarded up until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a time, it was a hotel.|$|E
5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} of Amazing in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited Amazing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> {{were unable to}} sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|However, in 1948the Swiss {{were able}} to {{purchase}} 130 surplus P-51 Mustangs from the United States. Several other aircraft types followed, including the 220 de Havilland Vampires purchased in 1949and 1953, 250de Havilland Venoms acquired 1954-56, and 100 Hawker Hunters from 1958. The P-51s replaced the Messerschmitt Bf 109s and remained operational <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b> Both the Venoms and Vampires showed remarkable longevity, with the Venoms in service until 1983and the Vampires until 1990, more than 40years. Remarkably the Swiss Air Force after these acquisitions was the first air {{force in the world}} to operate only jet aircraft in their front-line squadrons.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, {{construction}} {{began on}} a $5.5million project {{to improve the}} intersection between Clover Street (NY65) and Jefferson Road (NY252) {{in the town of}} Pittsford. The project, which had been in development <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> involved the widening of Jefferson Road from two to four lanes {{in the vicinity of the}} intersection, the addition of green arrow signal lights for all left-hand turns, and the installation of sidewalks alongside both Clover Street and Jefferson Road. Work on the project was temporarily halted during the winter months; however, it resumed on April1, 2009. The project was completed in late 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the rising musical styles, {{especially}} grunge, {{began to take}} their places as the dominant styles in the mainstream, which resulted in heavy metal music losing popularity and going underground <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b> Many Christian metal musicians began to play extreme metal, and soon death metal replaced thrash metal in popularity. Audiences in many underground metal scenes began favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular styles. As with other glam metal acts of the time, Stryper lost popularity and split up in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In the mid 1530s, {{the natives}} of western Honduras {{resisted}} the Spanish incursions, their efforts {{were led by}} Sicumba in the Ulúa valley. Sicumba was the indigenous lord of an extensive and well-populated territory along the lower Ulúa River; he {{had a number of}} strong fortresses along the course of the river, and commanded many warriors. His centre of operations was his riverside fortress at Ticamaya. Sicumba headed an indigenous campaign that successfully limited Spanish activities in western Honduras <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and Deutschland {{were placed}} in reserve after the 1878 {{maneuvers}} were cancelled and remained there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> {{with the exception of}} the 1883 maneuvers. During the maneuvers, both ships' steam engines proved troublesome, and indeed forced a temporary halt to the training exercises when they simultaneously broke down. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a state visit to Great Britain in August 1889 and a tour of the Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890.|$|E

Nadal went on to defend his French Open title, defeating Murray in the semi-final and Djokovic in the final.|$|E

5|$|Select {{committees}} are temporary committees, {{established by the}} Senate to deal with particular issues. This may occur when a particular group of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or {{where there is no}} existing committee suited to addressing a particular topic. Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shaw was {{particularly}} {{known for his}} performances in productions of Shakespeare plays which were considered daring and ahead of their time.

He also wrote several poems and a novel, The Christening, in 1975. He is also known for his brief but important performance in Return of the Jedi, the original third installment in the Star Wars franchise, in which he portrayed an unmasked and redeemed Anakin Skywalker (formerly Darth Vader), and his ghost in the original version of the film.|$|E

They returned to the Premier League at the second attempt, and despite being relegated the following season, they made an instant return to the Premier League in 2007 and survived there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a {{bruising}} primary {{battle with}} another incumbent whose district was combined with his, in which McEwen faced charges of bouncing checks on the House bank, he narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland. Following an unsuccessful {{run in the}} adjacent Second District in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> until in 2005 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress in the Second District special election to replace Rob Portman, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, Jean Schmidt. McEwen's 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a pro-life stance, defending Second Amendment rights, and promising to limit taxes and government spending. In 2006, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the Second District.|$|E
5|$|Around the 14th century, {{the temple}} was {{associated}} with the Vajrasana in India. In the 18th century the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, following the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792, did not allow the Nepalese to visit this temple and it became an exclusive place of worship for the Tibetans. During the Chinese development of Lhasa, the Barkhor Square in front of the temple was encroached. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang temple in 1966 and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> there was no worship. Renovation of the Jokhang took place from 1972 to 1980. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{as an extension of the}} Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994). Many Nepalese artists have worked on the temple's design and construction.|$|E
