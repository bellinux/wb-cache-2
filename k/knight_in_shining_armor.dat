500|$|On his return, Lafayette {{found the}} American cause {{at a low}} ebb, rocked by several {{military}} defeats, especially in the south. Lafayette was greeted in Boston with enthusiasm, seen as [...] "a <b>knight</b> <b>in</b> <b>shining</b> <b>armor</b> from the chivalric past, come to save the nation". He journeyed southwest and on 10 May 1780 had a joyous reunion with Washington at Morristown, New Jersey. The general and his officers were delighted {{to hear that the}} large French force promised to Lafayette would be coming to their aid. Washington, aware of Lafayette's popularity, had him write (with Alexander Hamilton to correct his spelling) to state officials to urge them to provide more troops and provisions to the Continental Army. This bore fruit in the coming months, as Lafayette awaited the arrival of the French fleet. However, when the fleet arrived, there were fewer men and supplies than expected, and Rochambeau decided to wait for reinforcements before seeking battle with the British. [...] This was unsatisfactory to Lafayette, who proposed grandiose schemes for the taking of New York City and other areas, and Rochambeau briefly refused to receive Lafayette until the young man apologized. Washington counseled the marquis to be patient.|$|E

In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court!

40|$|When {{people think}} about highly {{abstract}} concepts, they draw upon concrete experiences to structure their thoughts. For example, black <b>knights</b> <b>in</b> fairytales are evil, and <b>knights</b> <b>in</b> <b>shining</b> <b>armor</b> are good. The sensory experiences black and white are used to represent the abstract concepts of good and evil. These and similar metaphors are not only used to intentionally communicate the meaning of abstract concepts, but also underlie abstract conceptual thought. Several views on the representation of concepts have emerged over the last decennium which all share the idea that conceptual processing is perceptual in nature. According to these grounded approaches to cognition, conceptual thought consists of representations built on concrete sensory information. Even though people cannot directly see, hear or touch abstract concepts, perceptual information is theorized to play {{an essential role in}} abstract conceptual thought. The current thesis investigates to which extent people use perceptual information to think about abstract concepts. The studies reveal that sensory experiences structure abstract thoughts. Chapter 2 proposes that many of our concrete experiences with moral situations are directly related to symmetrical or balanced distributions of rewards and other outcomes, and aims to shows that thinking about moral or immoral words activates associations with perceptual symmetry. People were asked to guess which of two Chinese ideographs correctly translated moral and immoral Dutch words. As expected, they chose more symmetric ideographs for moral words, and more asymmetric ideographs for immoral words. Chapter 3 focuses on the concept of time, which {{has been shown to be}} represented with the past at our left, and the future at our right. Since the auditory modality shows a similar sensitivity to spatial information as the visual modality, the previously observed structuring of time in space was assumed to extend to the auditory modality. Past and future related words were presented to participants over headphones. Words were louder in the left or right ear, and people were asked to indicate in which ear they judged the words to be louder. Critical experimental trials were presented equally loud in both ear. Participants thought future related words in these critical trials were louder in the right ear more often than past related words. Chapter 4 shows that sensory dimensions structure abstract dimensions. Black and white represent bad and good. White in isolation, however, is rather neutral. It seems that perceptual information such as the color white does is not intrinsically positive, but can be used in opposition to black to represent the opposition between good and evil. Together, these chapters show that perceptual information influences abstract conceptual processing, even for highly abstract concepts that lack perceptual characteristics. Future research could focus on how the learning of abstract concepts by children can be facilitated by perceptually representing their meaning. Furthermore, metaphors cannot only facilitate, but also constrain moral reasoning, an aspect which has not been investigated. Abstract thought is one of the most sophisticated abilities of human beings, and acknowledging the importance of perceptual representations will substantially improve our understanding of abstract reasoning...|$|R

But therewith Sir Tristram ran very quickly in beneath the blow, so that the stroke of Sir Kay failed of its mark. Then Sir Tristram leaped up and catched Sir Kay around the body and dragged him down from off his horse very violently upon the ground, and with that the sword of Sir Kay fell down out of his hands and lay in the grass. Then Sir Tristram lifted up Sir Kay very easily and ran with him to the well of water and soused him therein several times until Sir Kay cried out, [...] "Fellow, spare me or I strangle!"
