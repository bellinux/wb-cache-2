40|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{associated with}} the treatment of human schistosomiasis {{appears to be an}} emerging problem requiring more attention from the scientific community than the subject currently receives. Drug-resistant strains of Schistosoma mansoni have been isolated by various investigators as a result of laboratory experimentation or from a combination of field and laboratory studies. Review of this data appears to indicate that the lack of susceptibility observed for some of the isolated strains cannot be ascribed solely to previous administration of antischistosome drugs and thus further studies are required to elucidate this phenomena. Strains of S. mansoni have now been identified from Brazil which are resistant to oxamniquine, <b>hycanthone</b> and niridazole; from Puerto Rico which are resistant to <b>hycanthone</b> and oxamniquine; and from Kenya which are resistant to niridazole and probably oxamniquine.

40|$|International audienceSchistosoma mansoni is a {{parasitic}} plathyhelminth {{responsible for}} intestinal schistosomiasis (or bilharzia), a disease affecting 67 million people worldwide and causing an important economic burden. The schistosomicides <b>hycanthone,</b> and its later proxy oxamniquine, were widely used for treatments in endemic areas during the twentieth century. Recently, {{the mechanism of}} action, {{as well as the}} genetic origin of a stably and Mendelian inherited resistance for both drugs was elucidated in two strains. However, several observations suggested early on that alternative mechanisms might exist, by which resistance could be induced for these two drugs in sensitive lines of schistosomes. This induced resistance appeared rapidly, within the first generation, but was metastable (not stably inherited). Epigenetic inheritance could explain such a phenomenon and we therefore re-analyzed the historical data with our current knowledge of epigenetics. In addition, we performed new experiments such as ChIP-seq on <b>hycanthone</b> treated worms. We found distinct chromatin structure changes between sensitive worms and induced resistant worms from the same strain. No specific pathway was discovered, but genes in which chromatin structure modifications were observed are mostly associated with transport and catabolism, which makes sense {{in the context of the}} elimination of the drug. Specific differences were observed in the repetitive compartment of the genome.

Collagen fibrils in periovular granulomas changed in texture from dense and more oriented to loose and disorganized. Fibroblasts, at first with marked signs of hyperfunction, became less so at a time when collagen fragments appeared within secondary lysosomes in macrophages and fibroblasts. Schistosomal ovular antigens remained sequestered inside the fibrotic granulomas up to the final, 39 th day after treatment. Thus, specific treatment of schistosomiasis showed a beneficial effect upon the hepatic lesions from the very beginning and promoted changes in the periovular granulomas that indicated a rapid, although incomplete, resorption of fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hycanthone</b> methanesulfonate (HCT) {{was shown}} to induce "forward" and "reverse" {{mutations}} in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Mutational effects of HCT on S. tyhhimurium TA 1532 were concentration and time dependent. A comparison of mutagenic potency for TA 1532 was made between HCT and the frame-shift mutagens quinacrine and ICR- 191. An investigation of structure-activity relationships revealed the substituent in the 4 -position of ring A to be critical for mutagenicity. Activity was found when this group was a hydroxymethyl (i. e., HCT) or an aldehyde (Win 25, 315), but the analogues having a carboxyl group (Win 25, 850) or methyl group (lucanthone) in this positionwere inactive. Removal of a single ethyl group from the side chain did not affect mutagenic activity inasmuch as the potency of desethyl HCT (Win 27, 262) equaled that of HCT on a molar basis. A marginal activity was found {{with a sample of}} HCT sulfoxide (win 27, 266), but this sample was found to contain traces of HCT. The HCT analogue with a terminal N-oxide in the side chain (Win 29, 329) was inactive at the concentration tested...|$|E
40|$|Schistosomiasis, a {{grave and}} {{debilitating}} disease of socioeconomic importance, is increasing in incidence despite concerted {{efforts to control}} and contain the disease in all the endemic areas. While a multipronged method of control using health education, sanitation and snail control has been used, chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis play {{the most important and}} crucial role in containing/preventing the transmission of the disease. Schistosomicides such as antimonials were introduced, as early as the 1990 s as the drugs of choice and continued to be used until the early 1960 s. The antimonials were administered intravenously, and produced severe side effects; the various variables that determined their effects at the site of action made their application difficult and adversely affected their use in large scale chemotherapy. The antimonials were then replaced by <b>hycanthone</b> and lucanthone which were administered intramuscularly. These drugs produced immediate side effects such as hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal disturbances, and were consequently withdrawn. It was then decided that the alternative was to produce synthetic drugs that could be administered orally. Niridazole, oxamniquine, and metrifonate were introduced as schistosomicidal agents, with drugs like oltipraz and amoscanate still at clinical trial phase. Therapeutic doses of drugs like <b>hycanthone,</b> niridazole and amoscanate have been found to cause many major side effects. A significant advance in the control of schistosomiasis chemotherapy is the introduction of a relatively safe, effective, broad spectrum oral helminthic agent, praziquantel. Studies have also shown that oxamniquine is as effective as praziquantel in eliminating intestinal S. mansoni infection, and metrifonate is as effective as praziquantel in eliminating urinary S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections. Praziquantel {{has been found to be}} effective in treating S. haematobium infections compared with metrifonate and more effective in treating S. mansoni infection when compared with oxamniquine. Because the drug is effective even when treating advanced hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, with few side effects, praziquantel is currently the drug of choice for the treatment of any kind of schistosomiasis. The only limitation is the cost which restricts its use in many developing countries. While effective, safe drugs for mass chemotherapy are being developed, the problem of therapeutic failure and drug resistance is being reported from certain developing countries. Under these circumstances, alternative drugs must be resorted to. Mass treatment, a crucial goal in the eventual control of schistosomiasis, awaits a well-tolerated and nontoxic drug that will ultimately prove to be effective where cure is definite. Until such a time, while eradication of the disease is a near impossibility, reducing the intensity of infection can ultimately reduce morbidity and even mortality.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the magnitude of the schistosomiasis problem throughout the world, and is based on information on schistosomiasis control programmes provided by 103 countries in reply to a questionnaire circulated by the World Health Organization in 1976. According to the data either given in these replies, published, or provided in internal reports to WHO, schistosomiasis {{is one of the most}} widespread parasitic infections of man. Some 500 million people are thought to be exposed to infection and four main species of schistosomes are prevalent, together with their various intermediate snail hosts, in 73 countries. Control programmes are operating in 41 % of responding endemic countries although they are on a national scale only in Brazil, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Morocco, Puerto Rico, St Lucia, Tunisia, and Venezuela. It appears that a maximum of only 1 - 2 % of all cases have been treated, the most frequently used drugs being niridazole and <b>hycanthone.</b> A small number of efficient molluscicides are in regular use but their high cost precludes large-scale application. Installation of water supplies and health education are the most frequently used non-specific control measures. Nearly 50 % of endemic countries use more than three different methods of control simultaneously. The national schistosomiasis control programmes in Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela are examples of combined approaches that have resulted in a significant decline in the prevalence of schistosomiasis. Finally, some specific needs in research, control, and training of personnel are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Stable {{resistance}} to the anthelmintic <b>hycanthone</b> can be produced in the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni by exposing immature parasites in mice to the drug. Within a single generation, genomic rearrangements, detected as rRNA-encoding DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), accompany the appearance of resistance in this model. One of these RFLPs, an approximately 3. 6 -kilobase BamHI fragment, was shown previously to associate consistently with resistance in independent generations of the JHU strain of S. mansoni. To characterize the genetic changes responsible for this RFLP, the fragment was cloned and sequenced. A comparison of the cloned fragment with a normal 18 S rRNA gene demonstrated that the drug resistance-associated RFLP fragment arises through the addition of 732 base pairs into an 18 S rRNA gene, 134 base pairs downstream of the junction of the intergenic spacer and the mature 18 S rRNA gene. The mutation is nonrandom, targets one, or a few only, of the 100 or so copies of the ribosomal genes, and may represent the incomplete duplication of the gene since the inserted element is identical in sequence to the region contiguous to it. The sequence spanning the junction of the insertion and the original 18 S rRNA gene {{was used as a}} specific primer for the BamHI RFLP in PCR experiments. The analysis conclusively demonstrated that the mutation is induced rather than selected by the drug since the junctional sequence was not detectable in the drug-sensitive parent population of schistosomes. In addition, analysis of four, independently derived, resistant lines indicated that the same region of the gene was mutated each time. Together, these data demonstrate that reproducible changes are induced during the acquisition of resistance in schistosomes and suggest that the resistant phenotype is induced rather than selected from preexisting forms...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with standard 2 – 4 week antibiotic treatment, 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics may be involved. In our previous study, we screened an FDA drug library and reported 27 top hits that showed high activity against Borrelia persisters. In this study, we present {{the results of an}} additional 113 active hits that have higher activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than the currently used Lyme antibiotics. Many antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, anthelmintics or antiparasitics) used for treating other infections were found to have better activity than the current Lyme antibiotics. These include antibacterials such as rifamycins (3 -formal-rifamycin, rifaximin, rifamycin SV), thiostrepton, quinolone drugs (sarafloxacin, clinafloxacin, tosufloxacin), and cell wall inhibitors carbenicillin, tazobactam, aztreonam; antifungal agents such as fluconazole, mepartricin, bifonazole, climbazole, oxiconazole, nystatin; antiviral agents zanamivir, nevirapine, tilorone; antimalarial agents artemisinin, methylene blue, and quidaldine blue; antihelmintic and antiparasitic agents toltrazuril, tartar emetic, potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate, oxantel, closantel, <b>hycanthone,</b> pyrimethamine, and tetramisole. Interestingly, drugs used for treating other non-infectious conditions including verteporfin, oltipraz, pyroglutamic acid, pidolic acid, and dextrorphan tartrate, that act on the glutathione/γ-glutamyl pathway involved in protection against free radical damage, and also the antidepressant drug indatraline, were found to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the promising active hits in drug combination studies in vitro and also in vivo in animal models. These studies may have implications for developing more effective treatments of Lyme disease...|$|E
