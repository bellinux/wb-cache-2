Intersection improvements are scheduled at the NY146/ Aqueduct Road/ Williams Road and NY146/ Riverview Road intersections. This {{part of the project}} will be built in 2008 and is to include new turn lanes at each intersection. To the south, the Rexford Bridge over the Mohawk River and the surrounding roadway will be improved in stages, with completion expected by 2017.

25|$|Major {{research}} on roundabout capacity {{has been carried}} out in multiple countries. Software can help calculate capacity, delay and queues. Packages include ARCADY, Rodel, <b>Highway</b> <b>Capacity</b> Software and Sidra Intersection. ARCADY and Rodel are based on the Transport Research Laboratory mathematical model. The TRL approach is derived from empirical models based on geometric parameters and observed driver behaviour with regard to lane choice. Sidra Intersection software includes roundabout capacity models developed in Australia and the USA.|$|E
25|$|Research on U.S. roundabouts {{sponsored}} by the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) culminated in a capacity model that {{was included in the}} <b>Highway</b> <b>Capacity</b> Manual (HCM) Edition 6 and the TRB-FHWA Roundabout Informational Guide (NCHRP Report 672). The HCM Edition 6 model is based on lane-based gap-acceptance theory. A recent NCHRP survey of US state transport agencies found that Sidra Intersection is the most widely used software tool in the USA for roundabout analysis.|$|E
500|$|The {{transport}} economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as [...] "one policy {{response to the}} problem of congestion", was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003: [...] "congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, <b>highway</b> <b>capacity</b> at a specific place and time. The quantity supplied (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it—and use it more wastefully—than they would if they had to pay a price that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users' willingness to pay for the resource".|$|E
50|$|Thus {{the basic}} {{theoretical}} result of three phase theory about {{the understanding of}} stochastic capacity of free flow at a bottleneck is as follows: At any time instant, there is the infinite number of <b>highway</b> <b>capacities</b> of free flow at the bottleneck. The infinite number of the flow rates, at which traffic breakdown can be induced at the bottleneck, are the infinite number of <b>highway</b> <b>capacities.</b> These capacities are within the flow rate range between a minimum capacity and a maximum capacity (Figure 7).|$|R
50|$|In {{three-phase}} traffic theory, traffic breakdown {{is explained}} by the F → S transition occurring in a metastable free flow. Probably the most important consequence {{of that is the}} existence of a range of <b>highway</b> <b>capacities</b> between some maximum and minimum capacities.|$|R
30|$|Arasan and Arkatkar [10] {{studied the}} effect of {{variation}} of traffic composition, road width, magnitude of upgrade and its length on Indian <b>highways</b> <b>capacity</b> and LOS, and subsequent {{it was concluded that}} highway performance significantly changes with change in traffic volume composition, width of roadway, magnitude of upgrade and its length.|$|R
500|$|To {{measure the}} true effects of any traffic {{management}} scheme it is normally necessary {{to establish a}} baseline, or [...] "do nothing" [...] case, which estimates the effects on the network without any changes other than normal trends and expected local changes. Notably this was not done for the London Congestion Charging Scheme, {{which has led to}} claims that {{it is not possible to}} determine the extent of the actual influence of the scheme. Regardless of the scheme's impact, in a retrospective analysis Transport for London (TfL) estimated there would have already been a significant reduction in traffic as a consequence of parking policies and increased congestion due to traffic management and other interventions that had the effect of reducing <b>highway</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 2006, the last year before the zone was expanded, TfL observed that traffic flows were lower than in any recent year, while network traffic speeds were also lower than in any recent year.|$|E
5000|$|... (iii) The {{understanding}} of <b>highway</b> <b>capacity</b> as a particular value. This {{understanding of}} road capacity was probably introduced in 1920 - 35 (see [...] ). Currently, {{it is assumed}} that <b>highway</b> <b>capacity</b> of free flow at a highway bottleneck is a stochastic value. However, in accordance with the classical understanding of <b>highway</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{it is assumed that}} at a given time instant there can be only one particular value of this stochastic <b>highway</b> <b>capacity</b> (see references in the book).|$|E
5000|$|... 3. The {{understanding}} of <b>highway</b> <b>capacity</b> as a particular value (see references {{in the book}} [...] ) fails because this assumption {{about the nature of}} <b>highway</b> <b>capacity</b> contradicts the empirical evidence that traffic breakdown can be induced at a highway bottleneck.|$|E
50|$|The {{existence}} at {{any time}} instant {{of a range of}} <b>highway</b> <b>capacities</b> in Kerner’s theory changes crucially methodologies for traffic control, dynamic traffic assignment, and traffic management. In particular, to satisfy the nucleation nature of traffic breakdown, Kerner introduced breakdown minimization principle (BM principle) for the optimization and control of vehicular traffic networks.|$|R
5000|$|Spontaneous traffic breakdown, i.e., a {{spontaneous}} F → S phase transition, may {{occur in a}} wide range of flow rates in free flow. Kerner states, based on empirical data, that because of the possibility of spontaneous or induced traffic breakdowns at the same freeway bottleneck at any time instant there is a range of <b>highway</b> <b>capacities</b> at a bottleneck. This range of freeway capacities is between a minimum capacity [...] and a maximum capacity [...] of free flow (Figure 7).|$|R

50|$|Reversible {{lanes and}} contraflow lanes are {{commonly}} employed {{when there is}} little or no available right-of-way for the width of a highway to be increased. These types of managed lanes increase the <b>highway's</b> <b>capacity</b> in the direction of the flow of these lanes, which is typically the direction of travel of the majority of traffic during peak hours (e.g. into a city center in the morning, out of a city center in afternoons/evenings). Reversible lanes along expressways are typically separated from other traffic lanes by concrete barriers and incorporate multiple gates or barriers to prevent traffic traveling in the opposite direction from entering these lanes. Contraflow lanes are typically one or two lanes on one side of a dual-carriageway on which the direction of travel is reversed during certain hours. Contraflow lanes are generally separated from opposing traffic by plastic pylons or moveable jersey barriers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Increased {{traffic volume}} {{has made it}} urgent to improve <b>highway</b> <b>capacities</b> by {{widening}} the existing embankments in south-eastern coastal areas of China. Adding a new embankment adjacent to the existing embankment will result in additional settlement within the existing embankment. And also, differential settlement will occur between the existing and widened embankment over soft soils. Excessive settlement and/or excessive differential settlement may cause longitudinal cracks, drop-off on the road surface, even local or global instability. A numerical analysis was conducted to investigate {{the influence of the}} thickness of soft soils on the development of settlements of the existing and widened embankment. The effect of widening time on the settlements was also discussed. The results indicate that the thicker the soft soils, the more time needed for the existing embankment to reach its final settlements. It is also found that there exists a most appropriate widening time for minimizing the additional settlements of the existing embankment on soft soils with a given thickness...|$|R
