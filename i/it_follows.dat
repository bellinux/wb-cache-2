5|$|A 30 Days of Night/The X-Files {{cross-over}} graphic {{novel was}} published by WildStorm in 2010. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> Mulder and Scully to Alaska as they investigate a series of grisly murders that {{may be linked to}} vampires.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|As {{integration}} of the delta function results in the Heaviside step function, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> that the static deflection of a slender beam subject to multiple point loads is described {{by a set of}} piecewise polynomials.|$|E
50|$|The Lincoln Highway entered Illinois on US Route 30 which <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> to Aurora {{where it}} became Illinois Route 31, which <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> to Illinois Route 38 at Geneva where it turned west to Dixon. From Dixon, it {{continued}} west on Illinois Route 2 to Sterling where it rejoins US Route 30. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> US Route 30 to {{just east of}} the Iowa state line, where it turned slightly northwest of Illinois Route 136.|$|R
50|$|By 1934, the Department of Highways assumed Lansdowne Street in Peterborough as Highway 7A, {{providing}} an alternate route south of downtown. At {{that point in}} time, Highway 7 entered Peterborough by following Lindsay Street east from Fowlers Corners to Chemong Road and curving southeast. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> Chemong Road to Reid Street, which <b>it</b> then <b>followed</b> south. The route proceeded west along McDonnel Street and south along George Street to Lansdowne Street, which <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> east out of Peterborough. Highway 28 entered Peterborough from the west along Lansdowne Street, curving north at what is now Ford Street. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> this onto what is now Clonsilla Avenue, and curved east onto Charlotte Street, which <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> to George Street. Highway 7A thus provided a direct route between Highway 28 and Highway 7 south of Peterborough.|$|R
50|$|From Paxinos, {{the turnpike}} {{followed}} the present Pennsylvania Route 61 until it crossed Shamokin Creek, {{just east of}} Sunbury. From there <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> Highland Avenue, and joined Market Street. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> Market Street to the square, where the turnpike reached its northern terminus.|$|R
5|$|At {{the north}} end of {{platform}} 3, a disused bay platform can be seen. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> the original alignment of the main platform before the 1903 expansion.|$|E
5|$|Highway405 {{serves to}} connect the {{northern}} end of I-190 in New York at the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge with the QEW, and as such <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> a somewhat direct path between the two.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> that circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow. All other curves take less time to collapse than a circle of the same length.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} routing {{southeast of}} the capital was WV 61 to Marmet, where it took WV 94 southwest to Racine. From Racine to Danville, <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> today's WV 3 and onward to Madison. From Madison south to Logan, <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> today's WV 17.|$|R

50|$|The Lincoln Highway entered Wyoming east of Pine Bluffs. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> county roads through Egbert and Hillsdale to Archer {{where it}} rejoined US Route 30. <b>It</b> <b>followed</b> US Route 30 (now largely Interstate 80) through Cheyenne, Laramie, Medicine Bow, and Rawlins to Granger Junction. From there, <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> former U.S. Route 30S and U.S. Route 530 (now Interstate 80) through Fort Bridger and Evanston to the Utah state line. At places, the road itself is now Business I-80 in Lyman and follows {{frontage}} roads in many places.|$|R
5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> that the flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> {{that there is a}} being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E

5|$|Highway 82 {{begins at}} Exit 116 from I-70 in Glenwood Springs, just 300ft (100 m) {{east of the}} Roaring Fork's {{confluence}} with the Colorado River. <b>It</b> <b>follows</b> Laurel Street north for one block, then turns east on Sixth Street for another block, after which it turns south on Grand Avenue. From there it crosses both I-70 and the Colorado River on a viaduct past the train station into downtown Glenwood Springs.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> that the choice was a correct one {{that leads to a}} satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E

In {{the case of}} the transitional vertebra, it was called sacralised L 5 if <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> after L 4, and it was called lumbarised S 1 if <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> after L 5.|$|R
5000|$|The line of {{the road}} through {{what is now the}} heavily {{built-up}} town of Croydon is debated. There are two main possibilities: that <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> the {{line of the}} modern (late-medieval/post-medieval) high road (London Road - North End - High Street - South End - Brighton Road); or that <b>it</b> <b>followed</b> a more westerly course through Old Town.|$|R
5|$|K-44 first {{appeared}} on the 1932 Kansas state highway map. Its alignment when it was designated is identical to that which <b>it</b> <b>follows</b> today; however, the road was not yet paved. This did not happen until sometime between 1948 and 1950, and the highway has not been majorly modified since then.|$|E
