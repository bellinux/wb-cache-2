40|$|The thesis work {{deals with}} {{improving}} {{of quality of}} operation of synchronous <b>electric</b> drive <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> (SED PU). Proposed by the work solutions lie in real-time PU controlling and condition-monitored maintenance (CMM) of the unit during operation. Undertaken researches {{of the influence of}} decreasing of quality of input voltage (voltage deviation, frequency deviation, voltage unbalance and voltage nonsinusoidality) and the value of the mechanical load on the energy characteristics of synchronous motors and their analysis confirm validity and adequacy of the developed models and methods of functional diagnostics of <b>electric</b> drive of <b>pumping</b> <b>units.</b> In this (thesis) it was developed the methodology and software complex for determination of reference model of synchronous motors which allows to detect type of the dependence of coefficient of efficiency on the load intensity, calculate the parameters of equivalent circuit and energy characteristics for rated operating condition of electric drive. It was specifed the diagnostic features of electrical and mechanical emergency operation modes of <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> with synchronous motors which allow to determine the pattern of damage and fulfill their timely repair without disruption of the process. Diagnostics combines methods of analysis of instantaneous values of current and voltage of SED, temperature around the unit and allows to determine energy and technical condition of SED PU and predict remaining life time. Method of spectral current analysis allows to detect mechanical damage of the motor and connected to it mechanism in advance. Created soft and hardware of diagnostic of PU with SED ? models, methods, algorithms, programs and system technical (???) engineering solutions take into account the effects of the operation impacts ? quality of input voltage, load condition and temperature around mechanism. Created portable hardware-software complex allows to automatize the process of functional diagnostics of energy efficiency of <b>pump</b> <b>units.</b> It is implemented on the basis of current sensors, voltage, temperature, commutator switch with analog-to-digital converter, PC, developed algorithms and programs "SM reference model", "Diagnostics of SM parameters", "Determination of the remaining life time of SM"). Implementation of developed tools of functional diagnostics of synchronous <b>electric</b> drive of <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> will allow to save up around 10 % of consumed electricity during the average operating life cycle 10 years, that is about twice bigger than its price and also will allow to save up to 50 % of the service and repairs costs. The efficiency and validity accuracy of the developed models, methods, algorithms and programs are confirmed by laboratory experiments and implementations. ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} of the research is to investigate the effect of periodic switching on/off in cyclical pumping on resistance to wear of high voltage electric motors of main <b>pump</b> <b>units.</b> Frequent motors starts in a cyclic pumping lead to accelerated wear of the mechanical motor parts owing {{to the impact of}} dynamic loads at startup, as well as winding insulation due to high inrush currents flow. As a result accelerated depreciation may decrease residual life, overhaul period and service life of electric motors. The main factors affecting the service life of insulation motors are winding temperature, and as a consequence, the thermal aging of the insulation. The use of variable frequency drive can significantly reduce the cyclic transfer modes, or even eliminate them. The authors obtained analytical expressions for the evaluation of insulation deterioration {{at the start of the}} motor, which allow us to study the impact of the following factors: insulation class, the start time, break time at work, initial and nominal temperature, the temperature rise of the windings over the ambient temperature. Cold starts and hot operating conditions, as well as the percentage of the hottest startups in the total number of starts have a drastic impact on insulation deterioration. The obtained expressions for the isolation depreciation are used to determine the change timing of overhauls of high voltage <b>electric</b> main <b>pump</b> <b>units.</b> The developed method was tested and approved by the use of a variable frequency drive at th...|$|R

50|$|Energy {{efficiencies}} {{of water}} heaters in residential use can vary greatly, particularly depending on manufacturer and model. However, electric heaters {{tend to be}} slightly more efficient (not counting power station losses) with recovery efficiency (how efficiently energy transfers to the water) reaching about 98%. Gas fired heaters have maximum recovery efficiencies of only about 82-94% (the remaining heat is lost with the flue gasses). Overall energy factors can be as low as 80% for electric and 50% for gas systems. Natural gas and propane tank water heaters with energy factors of 62% or greater, as well as electric tank water heaters with energy factors of 93% or greater, are considered high-efficiency units. Energy Star-qualified natural gas and propane tank water heaters (as of September 2010) have energy factors of 67% or higher, which is usually achieved using an intermittent pilot together with an automatic flue damper, baffle blowers, or power venting. Direct electric resistance tank water heaters {{are not included in}} the Energy Star program, however, the Energy Star program does include <b>electric</b> heat <b>pump</b> <b>units</b> with energy factors of 200% or higher. Tankless gas water heaters (as of 2015) must have an energy factor of 90% or higher for Energy Star qualification. Since electricity production in thermal plants has efficiency levels ranging from only 15% to slightly over 55% (combined cycle gas turbine), with around 40% typical for thermal power stations, direct resistance electric water heating may be the least energy efficient option. However, use of a heat <b>pump</b> can make <b>electric</b> water heaters much more energy efficient and lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, even more so if a low carbon source of electricity is used.|$|R
