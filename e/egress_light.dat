By comparing model light curves to the observed light curves for both ingress and egress, the frame-tie offsets Delta(lambda) and Delta(beta) (ecliptic longitude and latitude) were determined. The solution for both Delta(lambda) and Delta(beta) gave results consistent with zero offsets, but with an error of about 0. 2 arcsec.

40|$|The {{observations}} {{prior to}} AO- 4 covered {{a number of}} precession phases, leaving a gap at phase 0. 8. In addition, ASCA and previous observations of SS 433 did not observe the spectrum above approx. 10 keV, and consequently the continuum underlying the spectral lines was poorly constrained. Therefore RXTE observations were scheduled for April 1997 to extend the observed spectrum to higher energies; these observations were planned to sample the X-ray lightcurve during the 13. 08 day binary period, concentrating on the eclipse of the compact object which emits the jets. We proposed and were awarded ASCA observations simultaneous with the RXTE observations; {{the purpose of the}} ASCA observations was to provide greater spectral resolution {{at the low end of}} the spectrum observed by RXTE, and to complete the phase coverage of SS 433. As a result of scheduling difficulties early in the mission the RXTE observations were confined to a much shorter time range than originally planned, April 18 - 91 1997. Optical observations of SS 433 were performed at a number of observatories. The ASCA observations occurred from April 18 13 : 10 (UT) to April 21 13 : 20 (UT) for a total effective exposure of 120 ks. The continuum X-ray light curve shows that the ASCA observations started shortly before the ingress into the X-ray partial eclipse, and ended approximately at the time of the <b>egress.</b> <b>Light</b> curves were also obtained for the prominent Fe emission lines in the blue-shifted frame (approaching jet), red-shifted frame (receding jet), and the stationary frame (fluorescent line from the ambient matter). Through the eclipse mapping technique using the light curves, the parameters of the jet emission model were constrained, showing that the kinetic power in the jet exceeds 104 ? erg s-l.

40|$|X-ray light curves {{during the}} eclipse of a geometrically thin {{accretion}} disk surrounding {{a neutron star}} are calculated theoretically. In comparison {{with that of the}} accretion disk around a black bole,which exhibits conspicuous asymmetry due to the relativistic Dopper effect by the disk rotation,the asymmetric nature of the light curve in the present case is not so prominent,since the contribution of the central neutron star on the total X-ray flux is signicicant. This means that the light curve analysis enables us to know whether the object located {{at the center of the}} relativistic accretion disk is a black hole or a neutron star. The dependences of light curves on the inclination angle of the disk and on the X-ray wavelength bands are also examined. Due to the influence of the curvature of the companion rim,ingress and <b>egress</b> of <b>light</b> curves take place rapidly in a higher inclination angle. Moreover,as wavelength bands become soft,the duration of ingress and <b>egress</b> becomes long,since <b>light</b> from the outer part of the disk contributes the total X-ray flux. This wavelength-depencence behavior of light curves depends on the disk model adopted and hence it can help us to discriminate various disk models. 中性子星周辺の幾何学的に薄い降着円盤が伴星に隠される際の，X線光度曲線を理論的に計算した。ブラックホール周辺の降着円盤が隠される際の光度曲線は，降着円盤の回転にともなう相対論的ドップラー効果によって，食の前後で大きく非対称性なものとなる。それと比較して，中性子星周辺の場合は，X線輻射に対する中性子星からの寄与が大きいため，非対称性はあまり顕著でない。これらのことから，X線光度曲線を解析すれば，相対論的降着円盤の中心天体が，ブラックホールか中性子星かの判別をすることが可能になると思われる。降着円盤の傾斜角に対する光度曲線の依存性と波長領域での違いも調べた。伴星の縁の曲率の影響によって、傾斜角が大きい場合には，食の入りと食の出で光度曲線は急峻になる。さらに波長帯が軟X線になるにしたがい，X線輻射に対する降着円盤の外周領域からの寄与が大きくなるので，食の入りと出の幅は長くなる。光度曲線の波長依存性は，降着円盤のモデルによって変わるので，波長依存性を調べればモデルの妥当性も検証できる...|$|R

Like all pathogens of the phylum Apicomplexa, the malaria parasite spends part of its life inside a host cell or cyst.

We designate the planet XO- 3 b, and the star XO- 3, also known as GSC 03727 - 01064. The orbital period of XO- 3 b is 3. 1915426 +/- 0. 00014 days. XO- 3 lacks a trigonometric distance; we estimate its distance to be 260 +/- 23 pc. The radius of XO- 3 is 2. 13 +/- 0. 21 Rsun, its mass is 1. 41 +/- 0. 08 Msun, its vsini = 18. 54 +/- 0. 17 km/s, and its metallicity is [Fe/H] = - 0. 177 +/- 0. 027. This system is unusual for a number of reasons. XO- 3 b {{is one of the most}} massive planets discovered around any star for which the orbital period is less than 10 days. The mass is near the deuterium burning limit of 13 Mjup, which is a proposed boundary between planets and brown dwarfs. Although Burrows et al. (2001) propose that formation in a disk or formation in the interstellar medium in a manner similar to stars is a more logical way to differentiate planets and brown dwarfs, our current observations are not adequate to address this distinction. XO- 3 b is also unusual in that its eccentricity is large given its relatively short orbital period. Both the planetary radius and the inclination are functions of the spectroscopically determined stellar radius. Analysis of the transit light curve of XO- 3 b suggests that the spectroscopically derived parameters may be over estimated.

These facilities will be powerful tools for characterizing transiting exoplanets, but only after {{a considerable amount of}} telescope time is devoted to a single planet. A technique that could provide a relatively rapid means of identifying haze-free targets (which may be more valuable targets for characterization) could potentially increase the science return for these telescopes. Our proposed method utilizes broadband observations of refracted light in the out-of-transit spectrum. Light refracted through an exoplanet atmosphere can lead to an increase of flux prior to ingress and subsequent to <b>egress.</b> Because this <b>light</b> is transmitted at pressures greater than those for typical cloud and haze layers, the detection of refracted light could indicate a cloud- or haze-free atmosphere. A detection of refracted light could be accomplished in < 10 hours for Jovian exoplanets with JWST and < 5 hours for Super-Earths/Mini-Neptunes with E-ELT. We find that this technique is most effective for planets with equilibrium temperatures between 200 and 500 K, which may include potentially habitable planets.

40|$| {{observed}} with the RXTE during {{two of its}} recent type II outbursts in 1999 and 2004. We measured the orbital parameters during both these outbursts independently. We combined the previous measurements of ω with our two measurements and measure the rate of apsidal motion of the system to be ˙ω ~ 0 o. 06 yr− 1. V 0332 + 52 was seen in outburst during 2004. During its previous outburst of 1983 only nine spin period measurements had been obtained and the orbital parameters measured from them were erroneous. We have measured the orbital parameters of this system accurately and determined the correct projected semi-major axis ax sin i and orbital period. The new orbit parameters can now be used to compare with future orbital element measurements to estimate any apsidal motion and/or orbital evolution in this system. We also used the 1999 outburst of 2 S 1417 – 624 to accurately measure the orbital parameters of this system. We have also investigated the long term ﬂux variations in the X-ray light curves of X-ray Binaries. Our studies on the ﬂux variations observed in Cen X- 3 are described in the fourth chapter of the thesis. Long term light curves of X-ray binaries show variations due to many reasons. Periodic variations of few milliseconds to {{a few hours in}} the light curve are seen due to spin of the neutron star. Light curves show variations due to motion of the neutron star in its orbit at timescales of few minutes to several days. Many sources also show quasi periodic variations in their X-ray light curves at timescales smaller than the neutron star orbital period which are believed to arise due to some material inhomogeneity orbiting the neutron star. These variations are called quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs). QPOs in X-ray binaries are observed between a frequency range of few millihertz to a few kilohertz. Long term X-ray light curves of many sources also reveal flux variations at time scales greater than the respective orbital period of the source. These variations are called superorbital variations. Systems like Her X- 1, LMC X- 4, 2 S 0114 + 650, SS 433, XTE J 1716 – 389, 4 U 1820 – 303 and Cyg X- 1 show periodic superorbital variations whereas other systems like SMC X- 1, GRS 1747 - 312, Cyg X 2, LMC X- 3 and the Rapid Burster show quasi periodic superorbital ﬂux variations. These superorbital ﬂux variations are understood as arising either due to a changing mass accretion rate which could be aperiodic in nature or as due to obscuration of the central X-ray source by a tilted, warped and precessing accretion disk. Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the disk precession. The long term ﬂux variations in the X-ray light curves of bright persistent X-ray binaries like Her X- 1, SMC X- 1 and LMC X- 4 have been understood to be due to a periodic (in case of Her X- 1 and LMC X- 4) or a quasi periodic (for SMC X- 1) precession of a warped accretion disk. We analysed the light curves of Cen X- 3 obtained with the RXTE-ASM. The Cen X- 3 light curves show aperiodic X-ray ﬂux variations in all the energy bands of 1. 5 - 3, 3 - 5 and 5 - 12 keV. The high and low states last for a few to upto a hundred days. The source also shows two spectral modes during the observations carried out with the ASM. The source was in a hard state during December 2000 to April 2004. At ﬁrst look the aperiodic variations seen in Cen X- 3 light curves seem to be arising due to a changing mass accretion rate. To investigate the cause of these aperiodic flux variations of Cen X- 3 we studied the orbital modulation and the pulsed fraction as a function of source flux state. In the high state, the eclipse ingress and egress are found to be sharp whereas in the intermediate state, the transitions are more gradual. In the low state, instead of eclipse ingress and <b>egress,</b> the <b>light</b> curve shows a smooth intensity variation with orbital phase. The orbital modulation of the X-ray light curve in the low state shows that the X-ray emission observed in this state is from an extended object. The intensity dependent orbital modulations indicate that the different intensity states of Cen X- 3 are primarily due to varying degree of obscuration. Measurements of the pulsed fraction in different intensity states are consistent with the X-ray emission of Cen X- 3 having two components, one highly varying component with a constant pulsed fraction and a relatively stable component that is unpulsed and in the low state, the unpulsed component becomes dominant. The observed X-ray emission in the low state is likely to be due to scattering of X-rays from the stellar wind of the companion star. Though we can not ascertain the origin and nature of the obscuring material that causes the aperiodic long term intensity variation, we point out that a precessing accretion disk driven by radiative forces is a distinct possibility. We also studied the QPOs in Cen X- 3 that are seen at 40 mHz. The QPOs are explained by the Beat Frequency Model (BFM) as arising due to the beat between the Keplarian frequency of the inner accretion disk and the spin of the neutron star. Thus when the mass accretion rate is high the inner disk radius decreases, increasing the Keplarian frequency and hence the observed QPO frequency and vise versa when the mass accretion rate decreases. Thus if the ﬂux variations of Cen X- 3 were due to a changing mass accretion rate then the observed QPO frequency should have a positive correlation with the observed X-ray ﬂux of the source. But we ﬁnd in our study that the QPO frequency does not have any correlation with the observed X-ray ﬂux and the QPO frequencies does not follow the Frequency-Flux relation as expected in the Beat frequency model. Thus the QPO behaviour is in agreement that the observed X-ray ﬂux does not indicate the true X-ray intensity state and hence the mass accretion rate in Cen X- 3. Therefore, we conclude that X-ray variations of Cen X- 3 are not due to changing mass accretion rate but due to varying obscuration of the central X-ray source, possibly by an accretion disk which precesses aperiodically. The conclusions from our studies presented in chapter 2, 3 and 4 of the thesis are summarised in the ﬁnal chapter. The improved measurements of the rate of change of orbital periods from our work can now help us to detect any small departures from a constant period derivative in the persistent HMXB systems. The improved measurements of the orbital elements of Be-/X-ray binaries can now be used to study orbital evolution and apsidal motion in these system. New outbursts of the transient systems observed by future satellites providing good timing accuracy and large eﬀective area, like LAXPC (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter) of the ASTROSAT mission will facilitate such studies. The long term X-ray light curves study as done for Cen X- 3 can be extended to other X-ray binary systems observed by All Sky Monitor. The method of source flux state dependent studies developed to study the Cen X- 3 system can be easily extended to other systems that show long term superorbital flux variations. These kind of studies can be done by future proposed X-ray missions like ASTROSAT which will have a Sky Monitor similar to ASM dedicated to monitor X-ray sources. More sensitive measurements of long term X-ray light curves with the MAXI mission will allow similar studies {{of a large number of}} X-ray binaries and we will be able to see if aperiodically precessing accretion disk is present in many X-ray binaries...|$|R
