50|$|Second-order {{nonlinearities}} cannot {{exist in}} bulk silicon {{because of the}} centrosymmetry of its crystalline structure. By applying strain however, the inversion symmetry of silicon can be broken. This can be obtained for example by depositing a silicon nitride layer on a thin silicon film.Second-order nonlinear phenomena can be exploited for optical modulation, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, parametric amplification, ultra-fast optical signal processing and mid-infrared generation. Efficient nonlinear conversion however requires phase matching between the optical waves involved.

It has a single-slot cooler as opposed to the <b>double</b> <b>slot</b> cooler on the 8800 GTS and GTX, and uses less power than GTS and GTX due to its 65 nm process. While its core processing power is comparable to that of the GTX, the 256-bit memory interface and the 512 MB of GDDR3 memory often hinders its performance at very high resolutions and graphics settings. The 8800 GT, unlike other 8800 cards, is equipped with the PureVideo HD VP2 engine for GPU assisted decoding of the H.264 and VC-1 codecs. Performance benchmarks at stock speeds place it above the 8800 GTS (640 MB and 320 MB versions) and slightly below the 8800 GTX. A 256 MB version of the 8800 GT with lower stock memory speeds (1.4 GHz as opposed to 1.8 GHz) but the same core is also available. Performance benchmarks have shown that the 256 MB version of the 8800 GT has a considerable performance disadvantage when compared to its 512 MB counterpart, especially in newer games such as Crysis. Some manufacturers also make models with 1 GB of memory; and with large resolutions and big textures one can perceive a performance difference in the benchmarks. These models are more likely to take up to 2 slots of the computer.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the LMAL 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel of a NACA 23021 airfoil with a <b>double</b> <b>slotted</b> flap having a chord 32 percent of the airfoil chord (0. 32 c) to determine the aerodynamic section characteristics with the flaps deflected at various positions. The effects of moving the fore flap and rear flap as a unit and of deflecting or removing the lower lip of the slot were also determined. Three positions were selected for the fore flap and at each position the maximum lift of the airfoil was obtained with the rear flap at the maximum deflection used at that fore-flap position. The section lift of the airfoil increased as the fore flap was extended and maximum lift was obtained with the fore flap deflected 30 deg in the most extended position. This arrangement provided a maximum section lift coefficient of 3. 31, which was higher than the value obtained with either a 0. 2566 c or a 0. 40 c single-slotted-flap arrangement and 0. 25 less than the value obtained with a 0. 4 c double-slotted-flap arrangement on the same airfoil. The values of the profile-drag coefficient obtained with the 0. 32 c <b>double</b> <b>slotted</b> flap were larger than those for the 0. 2566 c or 0. 40 c single slotted flaps for section lift coefficients between 1. 0 and approximately 2. 7.

40|$|Abstract—An {{analysis}} is performed {{to study the}} influence of nonuniform <b>double</b> <b>slot</b> suction on a steady laminar boundary layer flow over a rotating sphere when fluid properties such as viscosity and Prandtl number are inverse linear functions of temperature. Nonsimilar solutions have been obtained from {{the starting point of}} the streamwise co-ordinate to the exact point of separation. The difficulties arising at the starting point of the streamwise co-ordinate, {{at the edges of the}} slot and at the point of separation have been overcome by applying an implicit finite difference scheme in combination with the quasi-linearization technique and an appropriate selection of the finer step sizes along the stream-wise direction.

In addition, various combinations of the aforementioned leading- and trailing-edge flaps were investigated. The tests covered a range of Reynolds numbers between 2. 00 x 10 (6) and 9. 35 x 10 (6). The wing with or without trailing-edge splity of <b>double</b> <b>slotted</b> flap was longitudinally unstable near maximum lift due to tip stalling. The addition of an outboard half-span leading-edge flap or a leading-edge slat to the plain wing or wing with inboard half-span split flaps eliminated tip stalling and resulted in stable moment variations at the stall.

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{electromagnetic}} model and subsequent design is presented for a traveling-wave, coplanar waveguide (CPW) based source that will {{operate in the}} THz frequency regime. The radio frequency (RF) driving current {{is a result of}} photoexcitation of a thin GaAs membrane using two frequency-offset lasers. The GaAs film is grown by molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) and displays sub-ps carrier lifetimes which enable the material conductivity to be modulated at a very high rate. The RF current flows between electrodes deposited on the GaAs membrane which are biased with a DC voltage source. The electrodes form a CPW and are terminated with a <b>double</b> <b>slot</b> antenna that couples the power to a quasi-optical system. The membrane is suspended above a metallic reflector to launch all radiation in one direction. The theoretical investigation and consequent design is performed in two steps. The first step consists of a direct evaluation of the magnetic current distribution on an infinitely extended coplanar waveguide excited by an impressed electric current distributed over a finite area. The result of the analysis is the difference between the incident angle of the laser beams and the length of the excited area that maximizes the RF power coupled to the CPW. The optimal values for both parameters are found as functions of the CPW and membrane dimensions as well as the dielectric constants of the layers. In the second step, a design is presented of a <b>double</b> <b>slot</b> antenna that matches the CPW characteristic impedance and gives good overall performance.
