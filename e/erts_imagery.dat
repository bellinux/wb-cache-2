40|$|Based on initial {{work in the}} Lake Tanganyika area {{of eastern}} Zaire, it has been {{concluded}} that <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is extremely useful for reconnaissance level geologic mapping and analysis in this region of the humid tropics. In particular, <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> has proven useful for recognizing and mapping regional structural units, for recognizing major structural features, and for arriving at some preliminary hypotheses about the mineral potential of the area. Results so far indicate that <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> can make a major contribution {{to the development of}} the mineral resources of the country. Research has concentrated on applications of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> in the field of cartography, geology, forestry, hydrology and agriculture. For the work in geology, a test site was chosen in eastern Zaire on the shore of Lake Tanganyika in the vicinity of the Lukuga River. This area was selected because of its varied geology and the existence of two frames of cloud-free <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. One unique advantage of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> for delineating soil associations {{is the large}} area that can be scanned with one photo. Although soil associations usually are published at scales of 1 : 500, 000 or 1 : 1, 000, 000, the delineations are drawn on much larger scale maps covering small pieces of the scene and then pieced together. Alluvial areas are usually swollen {{out of proportion to}} other soil areas. <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> puts alluvial areas into their proper size. A second feature of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is that a soil association map constructed with its aid assures that the cartographic level of the associations is more nearly the same. Another advantage of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is that the actual shape and configuration of soil associations are apparent. Also with <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> significant new delineations may become apparent which were missed when constructing soil association maps from conventional large scale photos...|$|E
40|$|Distribution {{and flow}} of water masses at four depth {{intervals}} were determined by analyzing <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> {{through the use of}} optical models of classes of vertical oceanographic profiles. Data used for these models was obtained from shipboard measurements including surface spectral radiance, and optical and more conventional oceanographic depth profiles. The spectral models obtained were applied to radiance-contoured <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> in band 4, 5, 6, and 7.

40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1975 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona Academy of Science - April 11 - 12, 1975, Tempe, ArizonaThe {{possibility}} of using imagery {{from the earth}} resources technology satellites (ERTS) to monitor changes in areal snow cover in east-central Arizona is examined. Four methods {{were used in the}} interpretation of areal snow cover from the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery,</b> the densitometer, dot grid, squares grid and projection-planimeter methods providing results of 69, 71, 72 and 74 percent of areal cover respectively. No one method for interpretation of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> should be ruled unusable, but any use made of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is dependent upon turn-around time for obtaining the imagery, as snow cover information which cannot be obtained within 24 hours is limited in practical application...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The {{limit of resolution}} on <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is normally acknowledged to be about 60 miles although very long features such as roads and railways which are often less than 10 miles long are easily detectable. An example is the north-south road and railway from Lobatse to Francistown. Vegetation growth from winter to summer is readily monitored on false color imagery. The limits of government ranches and special farming areas can be quite accurately ascertained from <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> Another aspect to which <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> lends itself is the location and demarcation of bush fires, {{many of which were}} seen on the first imagery which was acquired {{at the end of the}} cold, dry season. As a whole, MSS 7 offers maximum reflectance contrast among black and white imagery and is the wavelength used most for interpretation...|$|E
40|$|The use of ERTS- 1 imagery for mineral resources, {{geologic}} structure, and landform surveys is discussed. Four {{categories of}} <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> application are defined and explained. The {{types of information}} obtained by the various multispectral band scanners are analyzed. Samples of land use maps and tectoning and metallogenic models are developed. It is stated that the most striking features visible on <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> are regional lineaments, or linear patterns in the topography, which reflect major fracture zones extending upward from {{the basement of the}} earth...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> {{was used as}} a tool in the identification and refinement of soil association areas; to classify land use patterns between crop and fallow fields; to identify corn, soybeans, and oats; and to identify broad generalized range ecosystems. Various data handling techniques were developed and applied to accomplish these tasks.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The stereo {{cover of the}} Skylab photos, their clarity, and their resolution put them far above the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> not only in distinguishing between patterns but also in determining {{the nature of the}} country. The following land systems: (1) plains with sand dunes; (2) ridges, foothills, and alluvial plains; (3) dune-covered country with stony hills; and (4) alluvial plains were indistinguishable on the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> However, the same places are clearly distinguishable on the Skylab photos, together with the character of the dunes (parallel, reticulate, or irregular) ...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of <b>ERTS</b> <b>Imagery</b> {{has shown}} a number of alpine glacial {{features}} can be recognized and mapped successfully. Although the Wyoming mountains are generally regarded as the type locality for Rocky Mountain glaciation some areas have not been studied from a glacial standpoint because of inaccessibility or lack of topographic control. <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> provides an excellent base {{for this type of}} regional geomorphic study. A map of maximum extent of Wisconsin Ice, flow directions and major glacial features was compiled from interpretation of the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> Features which can be mapped are large moraines, outwash fans and terraces. Present-day glaciers and snowfields are easily discriminated and mapped. Glaciers and glacial deposits which serve as aquifers {{play a significant role in}} the hydrologic cycle and are important because of the increasing demand placed on our water resources. ERTS provides a quick and effective method for change detection and inventory of these vital resources...|$|E
40|$|<b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is {{of unique}} value for mapping of certain {{fractures}} {{that are not}} identifiable on aircraft imagery. Because color infrared and <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> complement each other both sources of data were used to map fractures in western Indiana and eastern Illinois. In the Kings Station Mine, Gibson County, Indiana, most roof falls reported had occurred in areas where mapped fractures were closely spaced and intersecting. Using this information {{as a basis for}} extrapolation, roof fall hazard maps were prepared for other mine sites. Various coal resources programs related to energy and environment also were conducted...|$|E
40|$|There are no author-identified {{significant}} results in this report. A multistage sampling experiment was conducted using low (10, 000 ') and high (60, 000 ') altitude aircraft imagery {{in comparison with}} orbital (560 miles) <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> Although the aircraft data provide detailed landscape observations similar to ground truth data, they cover relatively small areas per image frame for irregular static slices of time. By comparison, ERTS provides repetitive observations in a regional perspective for broad areal coverage. Microdensitometric and computer techniques {{are being used to}} analyze the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> for gray tone signatures, comparisons, and ultimately for landscape change detection...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Detection {{and analysis of}} fracture systems can be more effectively conducted utilizing snow cover as an enhancement tool. From analysis within the Great Barrington Test Site {{it appears that the}} use of aeromagnetic data effectively supplements lineament data acquired using <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> Coincidence of lineaments derived from aeromagnetics with lineaments interpreted from <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> apparently indicate the presence of mineralized fracture systems and dikes. Utilizing both tools can increase the speed and efficiency of mineral exploration and geological mapping in areas where bedrock is obscured by a thick unconsolidated sediment cover...|$|E
40|$|<b>ERTS</b> <b>Imagery</b> has {{provided}} data relating {{to a number}} of environmental and limnological concerns such as water quality, lake flooding and lake ice formation. Pollution plume data provided by ERTS was recently used in the Supreme Court case involving the States of Vermont and New York and a paper company. Flooding of lowland tracts has been a major concern due to a repetitive pattern of high lake levels over the past three years, and <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is being used to construct the first series of flood maps of the affected areas. Lake ice development and turbidity patterns have also been studied from ERTS, since these have significance for shore erosion studies...|$|E
40|$|ERTS {{images were}} {{compared}} to surficial geologic maps, prepared through traditional field studies. Lithologic boundaries, bedrock outcrops, bedrock structures, and geomorphologic features were examined. An area southeast of the Twin Cities, located chiefly in northern Dakota County was studied, {{as well as the}} New Brighton 15 -minute quadrangle located in portions of Ramsey and Anoka Counties. Visual comparison of geologic maps and <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> demonstrated the limitations of this approach to geological investigations. Bedrock outcrops and bedrock structure in the metropolitan area do not appear on <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> However, certain glacial sediments can be identified and are potentially mappable. Certain geomorphological features were also discernable...|$|E
40|$|The {{thrust of}} New Jersey's ERTS {{investigation}} is development of procedures for operational use of ERTS- 1 data by the Department of Environmental Protection {{in the management}} of the State's coastal zone. Four major areas of concern were investigated: detection of land use changes in the coastal zone; monitoring of offshore waste disposal; siting of ocean outfalls; and allocation of funds for shore protection. <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> was not useful for shore protection purposes; it was of limited practical value in the evaluation of offshore waste disposal and ocean outfall siting. However, <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> shows great promise for operational detection of land use changes in the coastal zone. Some constraints for practical change detection have been identified...|$|E
40|$|In the Rocky Mountains, most streamflow {{results from}} {{snowmelt}} {{and the demand}} for water in the western United States makes the value of accurate streamflow forecasting high. Studies have shown that snowpack depletion-runoff relationships have the potential to improve various streamflow forecasting techniques. However, the use of these relationships in streamflow forecasting has been limited by the difficulty in obtaining measures of areal snow cover. The Earth Resources Technology Satellites (ERTS) have shown potential for measuring areal snow cover. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> to measure changes in snow cover in east-central Arizona for use in developing snowpack depletion-runoff relationships. Results indicated that, despite some difficulties, ERTS-l imagery could be interpreted for areal snow cover. Also, a highly significant relationship existed between measures o£ areal snow cover from ERTS-l imagery and subsequent runoff during the snowpack depletion period. However, quality ERTS-l imagery cannot presently be obtained frequently enough to be the sole source of data for monitoring changes in areal snow in Arizona. In addition, a delay in obtaining <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> must be overcome before the data from <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> can be used for practical applications...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations {{initially}} {{contracted with}} NASA {{to carry out}} investigations in three countries; but now {{as the result of}} rapidly increasing interest, <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> has been/is being used in 7 additional projects related to agriculture, forestry, land-use, soils, landforms and hydrology. Initially the ERTS frames were simply used to provide a synoptic view of a large area of a developing country as a basis to regional surveys. From this, interest has extended to using reconstituted false color imagery and latterly, in co-operation with Purdue University, the use of computer generated false color mosaics and computer generated large scale maps. As many developing countries are inadequately mapped and frequently rely on outdated maps, the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is considered to provide a very wide spectrum of valuable data. Thematic maps can be readily prepared at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 using standard NASA imagery. These provide coverage of areas not previously mapped and provide supplementary information and enable existing maps to be up-dated. There is also increasing evidence that <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is useful for temporal studies and for providing a new dimension in integrated surveys...|$|E
40|$|Crop calenders used to {{determine}} when Earth Resources Technology Satellite ERTS data would provide the most accurate wheat acreage information and to minimize the amount of ground verified information needed are presented. Since barley, oats, and rye are considered 'confusion crops, i. e., hard to differentiate from wheat in <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery,</b> specific dates are estimated for these crops in the following stages of development: (1) seed-bed operation, (2) planting or seeding, (3) intermediate growth, (4) dormancy, (5) development of crop to full ground cover, (6) heading or tasseling, and flowering, (7) harvesting, and (8) posting-harvest operations.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The {{results of the}} analysis of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> for the Arizona and California test sites indicate that {{the extent of the}} mountain snowpacks can be mapped from ERTS data in more detail than is depicted in aerial survey snow charts. In addition to comparative analysis with aerial snow charts, the ERTS data have also been compared with high altitude aircraft photography. The results of the comparative analysis indicate that although small details in the snow line that cannot be detected in the ERTS data can be mapped from the higher resolution aircraft data, the boundaries of the areas of significant snow cover can be mapped as accurately from <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> as from aircraft photography...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of West German investigations into multidisciplinary geoscientific experiments in central Germany and the Alps, and hydrogeological investigations in the Pampa of Argentina based on ERTS- 1 data. The main {{goals of the}} investigation were achieved. The studies have given {{a good idea of}} the possibilities and limitations of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> depending on the objectives in question and on the geographical conditions of the areas under investigation. Even in the well known region of central Europe, ERTS has proven its ability of improving present knowledge. In fields such as pollution monitoring and regional planning the satellite techniques should have distinct practical value. For any regional study of less known areas, the value of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> can hardly be overestimated...|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Data from ERTS passes crossing the Bering Sea in early March have been correlated with ice observations {{collected in the}} Bering Sea Experiment (BESEX). On two flights of the NASA CV- 990 aircraft, the ice conditions {{in the vicinity of}} St. Lawrence Island reported by the onboard observer are in close agreement with the ice conditions mapped from the corresponding <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> The ice features identified in <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> and substantiated by the aerial observer include the locations of boundaries between areas consisting of mostly grey ice and of mostly first and multi-year ice, the existence of shearing leads, and the occurrence of open water with the associated development of stratus cloud streaks. The BESEX correlative ice formation verifies the potential of practical applications of ERTS data...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur dioxide fumes {{have been}} {{affecting}} the forests around Wawa, Ontario, {{which have been}} under surveillance {{for a number of}} years and were recently covered by ultra-small-scale (1 : 160, 000) air photography for damage-assessment purposes. Image interpretation supported by electronic color enhancement was used to delineate on <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> three damage zones (total-kill, heavy-kill and medium-damage zones). The zones delineated on <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> are similar to the results of aerial sketch-mapping and air photo interpretation. Band 5 provided the greatest detail for assessing the damage to the forests, followed in successive order by bands 4, 6 and 7.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A 1. 1, 000, 000 scale sketch map has been prepared from <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> of the Prince Olav Coast, Antarctica. This {{is the first}} such mapping {{of the extent of}} the ice tongues of the Shtrase and Fietta Bay glaciers. Shtrase is of particular interest because the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> shows the tongue extending out into the Lutzom-Holm Bay approximately 32 miles further than ever depicted on existing maps. This sketch map and others in work covering coastal areas of the Antarctic continent show many coastal changes when compared to what {{is believed to be the}} most current published maps. These sketch maps along with the accompanying mosaics will be a bench mark for future revision to existing maps and charts and also an invaluable source for mew mapping. <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> is now available over Mt. Siple, Antarctica, and it is expected to provide a source to position Mt. Siple correctly in relation to the Executive Committee Range. A mosaic at 1 : 500, 000 scale is also being compiled that will serve as a source for future revision of 1 : 250, 000 scale maps of the Ellsworth Mountains, change and improve the shape and size of the islands within the Ronne Ice Shelf, and redefine the ice front of the Ronne and Filchner Shelves...|$|E
40|$|Use of the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> {{involved}} the recognition {{and interpretation of}} various ground patterns. Analysis and application are tied to ongoing programs. Specific studies utilizing the imagery and NASA aircraft photography are: a statewide lake and dam inventory; assessment of flooding and floodprone areas along the Missouri portion of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers; land-use classification for several counties; structural features in selected areas; and Pleistocene features in northern Missouri. Though {{it has been suggested}} that repetitive coverage is not necessary for geologic studies, it is this specific feature along with the synoptic view of large portions of the State that provided the potential for the utilization of the <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> in Missouri.

40|$|This survey {{covered the}} French Massif-Central (where {{crystalline}} and volcanic rocks outcrop) {{and its surrounding}} sedimentaries, Bassin de Paris, Bassin d'Aquitaine and Rhodanian valley. One objective was the mapping of fracturing and the surveying of its relationship with known ore deposits. During this survey {{it was found that}} <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> outlines lithology in some sedimentary basins. On the other hand, in a basement area, under temperature climate conditions, lithology is rarely expressed. These observations can be related to the fact that band 5 gives excellent results above sedimentary basins in France and generally band 7 is the most useful in a basement area. Several examples show clearly the value of <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> for mapping linear features and circular structures. All the main fractures are identified with the exception of new ones found both in sedimentaries and basement areas. Other interesting findings concern sun elevation which, stereoscopic effect not being possible, simulates relief in a better way under certain conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{delineation}} of flood-prone {{areas is}} an important activity in several parts of the world. Conventional methods map the topography surrounding the river via ground surveys and supplementary aerophotography. The conventional method costs approximately $ 2, 000 per river-kilometer, is laborious and time-consuming. ERTS information can supplement this method by two complementary techniques: (1) the dynamic method images the floods as they occur, exploiting the fact that visible evidence of inundation remains for a substantial period after the high waters have receded; (2) the static method utilizes the fact that several flood plains have been found recognizable on <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery</b> from distinctive, permanent indicators left by previous floods. For areas whose full development {{is still in the}} future, the dynamic method allows the gradual buildup with time of a flood plain map, by simply correlating existing <b>ERTS</b> <b>imagery.</b> The static method allows in several areas, a first-cut indication, of proneness to floods...|$|E
