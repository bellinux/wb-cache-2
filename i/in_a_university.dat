5|$|In 1963, after The Bell Jar was published, Plath {{began working}} on another {{literary}} work titled Double Exposure. It was never published and disappeared around 1970. Theories {{about what happened to}} the unfinished manuscript are repeatedly brought up in the book Sylvia Plath's Fiction: A Critical Study by Luke Ferretter. Ferretter also claims that the rare books department at Smith College in Massachusetts has a secret copy of the work under seal. Ferretter believes that the draft of Double Exposure may have been destroyed, stolen, or even lost. He presumes in his book that the draft may lie unfound <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> archive.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> such hypotheses {{ought to be the}} subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E

Whereas many pre-1992 universities use the grades: Lecturer (A), Lecturer (B), Sr Lecturer, Reader, Professor, post-1992 grades are normally Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Principal Lecturer, Reader, Professor. Much confusion surrounds the differing use of the [...] "Sr. Lecturer" [...] title. <b>A</b> Sr. Lecturer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> post-1992 <b>university</b> is equivalent to <b>a</b> Lecturer (B) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pre-1992 <b>university,</b> whereas <b>a</b> Sr. Lecturer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pre-1992 <b>university</b> is most often equivalent to <b>a</b> Principal Lecturer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> post-1992 <b>university.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1953, Howard Thurman {{became the}} Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, {{after ten years}} in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was {{prompted}} {{by the desire to}} share their ideas of outreach and inclusion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>university</b> setting, though they were aware that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends. Shortly after they arrived, a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith, author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation, as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>university.</b>|$|E
