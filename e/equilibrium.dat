5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal <b>equilibrium</b> that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic <b>equilibrium</b> amongst themselves much faster than they come into <b>equilibrium</b> with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{oscillation}} susceptibility of the ADMIRE aircraft {{along the}} path of longitudinal flight <b>equilibriums</b> is analyzed numerically in the general and in a simplified flight model. More precisely, the longitudinal flight <b>equilibriums,</b> the stability of these <b>equilibriums,</b> {{and the existence of}} bifurcations {{along the path}} of these <b>equilibriums</b> are researched in both models. Maneuvers and appropriate piloting tasks for the touch-down moment are simulated in both models. The computed results obtained in the models are compared in order to see if the movement concerning the landing phase computed in the simplified model is similar to that computed in the general model. The similarity we find is not a proof of the structural stability of the simplified system, what as far we know never been made, but can increase the confidence that the simplified system correctly describes the real phenomenon...|$|R

5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic <b>equilibrium.</b> By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in <b>equilibrium.</b> Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in <b>equilibrium.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{to find the}} profit-maximizing Nash <b>Equilibriums</b> in allocating generation amounts with consideration of ramp-rates under competitive market environment. In order to find the Nash <b>equilibriums</b> {{it is necessary to}} search all the feasible combinations of generators’ outputs which satisfy various constraints. The procedure to eliminate the dominated strategies can be formulated using Bellman’s optimality principle of dynamic programming problem and hence the backward or forward search algorithm of dynamic programming can be easily applied. Therefore, the Nash <b>equilibriums</b> are found using dynamic programming method and we found that there exist several Nash <b>Equilibriums</b> in the generation allocation problem. Individual generators participate in a game to maximize its profit through competitions and play a game with bidding strategies of its generation quantities in a spot market. The ramp-rate physically or technically limits generators to increase or decrease outputs in its range and restricts the number of bidding strategies of each generator. We suggest the Dynamic Programming to find the Nash <b>Equilibriums</b> while removing the dominated strategies in each stage (or each time). In the case studies, we analyzed the generation allocation game for a 12 -hour multi-stage and compared it with the results of dynamic economic dispatch. Both of the two cases were considered generator’s ramp-rate effects. Index Terms [...] Generation allocation, game theory, competitiv...|$|R

So, market prices and number of allowed power plants seem to be more stable in the constrained market. Also, there is a large distance between market prices and the price cap.

40|$|The western Pacific {{subtropical}} high (WPSH) {{is closely}} related to Asian climate. Previous studies have shown that a precise dynamical model focusing on the interaction between WPSH and other summer monsoon factors has not been developed. Based on the concept of dynamical model reconstruction, this paper reconstructs a nonlinear dynamical model of subtropical high ridge line (SHRL) and summer monsoon factors from recent 20 years data. Then, using genetic algorithm (GA), model inversion and model parameter optimization are carried out. Based on the reconstructed dynamical model, dynamical characteristics of SHRL are analyzed and an aberrance mechanism is developed, in which the external forcings resulting in the WPSH anomalies are explored. Results show that the configuration and diversification of the SHRL <b>equilibriums</b> have better represented the abnormal activities of the SHRL in short and medium term. Change of SHRL brought by the combination of <b>equilibriums</b> is more complex than that brought by mutation. The mutation behavior from high-value to low-value <b>equilibriums</b> of the SHRL in summer corresponds with the southward drop of the SHRL. The combination behavior of the two steady <b>equilibriums</b> corresponds with disappearance of the “double-ridge” phenomenon of WPSH. Dynamical mechanisms of these phenomena are explained...|$|R
25|$|Solubility <b>equilibrium</b> {{is a type}} {{of dynamic}} <b>equilibrium</b> that exists when a {{chemical}} compound in the solid state is in chemical <b>equilibrium</b> with a solution of that compound.

25|$|The Nash <b>equilibrium</b> {{was named}} after American {{mathematician}} John Forbes Nash, Jr. A version of the Nash <b>equilibrium</b> concept was first known {{to be used in}} 1838 by Antoine Augustin Cournot in his theory of oligopoly. In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A Cournot <b>equilibrium</b> occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a pure-strategy Nash <b>equilibrium.</b> Cournot also introduced the concept of best response dynamics in his analysis of the stability of <b>equilibrium.</b> However, Nash's definition of <b>equilibrium</b> is broader than Cournot's. It is also broader than the definition of a Pareto-efficient <b>equilibrium,</b> since the Nash definition makes no judgements about the optimality of the <b>equilibrium</b> being generated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Equilibrium</b> {{chemistry}} {{is concerned with}} systems in chemical <b>equilibrium.</b> The unifying principle is that the free energy of a system at <b>equilibrium</b> is the minimum possible, so that {{the slope of the}} free energy with respect to the reaction coordinate is zero. This principle, applied to mixtures at <b>equilibrium</b> provides a definition of an <b>equilibrium</b> constant. Applications include acid–base, host–guest, metal–complex, solubility, partition, chromatography and redox equilibria.|$|E

We examine this claim and argue that ubiquitous computing is not a departure from traditional computing but rather an evolutionary and natural step, which is in-sync with the global trends influencing the development of information technologies. Using two interrelated analytical prismsâmegatrends and <b>equilibriums,</b> this paper provides a new point-of-entry for understanding ubiquitous computing from a perspective that accounts for human nature and the technology they use. We demonstrate that, together, megatrends and <b>equilibriums</b> provide a foundation for understanding information systems, and in particular ubiquitous computing systems.

40|$|Based on {{time series}} data of 500 hPa {{potential}} field from NCEP/NCAR (National Center for Environmental Forecast of American/National Center for Atmospheric Research), a novel consideration of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) time–space separation and dynamic system reconstruction for time series is introduced.

The SH activity and its abnormal mechanism is studied using the developed dynamical model. Results show that the configuration and diversification of the SH <b>equilibriums</b> have good correspondence with the actual short–medium term abnormal activity of the SH.
