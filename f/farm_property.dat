5|$|The {{barn and}} the {{surrounding}} Manor <b>Farm</b> <b>property</b> were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group, a builder/property developer which aimed to restore the barn {{to serve as a}} showcase for the company. The farm underwent major changes, with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L-shaped office building constructed facing the barn. Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn, following an initial renovation carried out in 1989. However, in 2006, the company went into receivership. The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through.|$|E

25|$|Late in Haley's {{life he had}} {{acquired}} a small farm in Clinton, Tennessee, although {{at the time it}} had a Norris, Tennessee address. The Farm is {{a few miles from the}} Museum of Appalachia, and Haley lived there until his death. After his death the property was sold to the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), which calls it the Alex Haley Farm. The nonprofit organization uses the farm as a national training center and retreat site. An abandoned barn on the <b>farm</b> <b>property</b> was rebuilt as a traditional cantilevered barn, using a design by architect Maya Lin. The building now serves as a library for the CDF.|$|E
25|$|Farmhouses were, in {{the colonial}} era, often small two-story structures. It was not {{uncommon}} {{for them to be}} razed if the landlord desired to extend the estate to the <b>farm</b> <b>property</b> and move the tenants further east; as a result most of the surviving ones are made out of stone, such as Clermont's Stone Jug and Rhinebeck's Fredenburg House, since they were harder to demolish. Later in the 18th century, after independence, the tenants' homes echoed the Neoclassical aspirations of their landlords, as well as similar trends in Germany. Around Clermont, some two-story wood-frame farmhouses with five-bay facades and centrally-located entrances remain from this period.|$|E
25|$|Buford {{studied at}} Centre College before {{entering}} the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1837. Graduating in 1841, as a second-lieutenant with the First dragoons from 1842 through 1846, he did Frontier duty in the Kansas Territory and the Indian Territory. He then served in the Mexican–American War {{in which he was}} appointed brevet captain for bravery at the Battle of Buena Vista. When that war ended, he was dispatched for further duty on the Frontier and in 1848 was part of the Santa Fe Trail expedition. In 1849, Buford escorted the mail from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to the east, using, in part, the new Cherokee Trail. He was then sent to the Army's cavalry school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, but in October 1854 he resigned his commission and returned to his native Kentucky where his family owned a <b>farm</b> <b>property</b> near Versailles in his native Woodford County.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987 ten looters paid $10,000 to dig at the Slack <b>Farm</b> <b>property.</b> After {{two months}} {{complaints}} by local people {{led to the}} arrest of the perpetrators for the misdemeanor of [...] "desecrating a venerable object" [...] (a charge which is now a felony, in part due to the controversy over Slack Farm). Prosecution on this charge was difficult in the late 1980s, in part because this predated the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and related state legislation, which made it clearer that such activities were illegal. The illegal digging of such objects destroys much of their archaeological value, as it removes its association from its surroundings. The situation in which an article is found, its level of burial, its surroundings and even its original condition are valuable in determining the history of many sites, all of which are lost when an object is removed in secret, unrecorded in its provenance, and lost to the antiquities black market.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} and mid-20th century, Wilton {{students}} went to high schools in Westport, New Canaan, Norwalk (until 1930), Danbury and Ridgefield. Since the schools in these communities were becoming overcrowded with population growth, a regional high school for Wilton was proposed in 1935 but was vetoed by the state governor. In the following year, Wilton, Weston and Redding began a joint study, which rejected the idea again. Instead, the committee recommended that Wilton wait for population to increase enough to support a high school, {{and in the meantime}} buy enough land for the school. In 1940, a town meeting approved the purchase of the Harbs <b>Farm</b> <b>property,</b> a [...] tract near the intersection of School and Danbury Roads. In 1944, a regional high school was proposed again, and again the idea was rejected, this time by the town of Redding, which killed the proposal. A consultant hired by Wilton town officials recommended in 1948 that town population growth could support a high school in less than a decade. The regional high school idea was then permanently dropped.|$|E
2500|$|The {{improvements}} in transportation that initially benefited agriculture eventually produced its decline. As it became quicker and more convenient for residents {{to travel from}} their homes {{to other parts of}} Queens, to Brooklyn, and to Manhattan, the area came to be seen as both desirable and affordable for the construction of housing for city-dwellers and increases in land values enticed farm owners to sell out. [...] John Sackett came of a family of religious dissenters that had settled in Queens late in the 17th century. [...] In 1802 he inherited a farm of 115 acres including much of what is now Woodside and in 1826 his heirs sold much of the property to John A. Kelly, the son of a German immigrant, and his sister-in-law (also of German descent), Catherine B. (Friedle) Buddy. [...] As other well-to-do merchants had done in other areas of Queens, Kelly and Buddy bought <b>farm</b> <b>property</b> for use as a rural estate where they planned to live in the warmer months of the year. Not long after, a friend of Kelly's, William Schroeder, bought another parcel of the Sackett property for the same purpose. [...] Like Kelly, he came of a family that had emigrated from Germany and, like Kelly, he had achieved wealth as a merchant in Charleston, South Carolina. [...] Unlike Kelly, however, he did not move North, but kept the estate for use during summer vacations.|$|E
