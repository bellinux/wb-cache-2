The PDC campaigned as a member of the Patriotic Agreement in 1993 elections. The Christian Democratic Party was one of the founding components of Social and Democratic Power (PODEMOS), for which it provided its electoral registration.

The Justice and Development Party, the ruling party since 2002, is found to have captured all of the far-right Islamist, about half of the far-right nationalist, and half of the center-right votes. ...|$|R
50|$|Three {{political}} parties were dominant from 1982 to 2005: The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement which had {{carried out the}} 1952 Revolution; Revolutionary Left Movement; and <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> founded in 1982 by former dictator and later elected President Hugo Banzer. Despite the revolutionary names of the first two, they generally pursued centrist economic policies.|$|R
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Bolivia on 14 July 1985. As no candidate for the presidency received over 50% of the vote, the National Congress was required to elect a President on 4 August. Although Hugo Banzer of <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> received the most public votes, Congress elected Víctor Paz Estenssoro of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement.|$|R

His alternate was Edgar Balcázar Velasco. He has also been the Prefect of Pando.|$|R
50|$|Formed in 1937, the Bolivian Socialist Falange (Falange Socialista Boliviana or FSB) of Óscar Únzaga {{gained a}} strong {{following}} amongst former landowners {{by offering a}} platform strongly influenced by Franco and Benito Mussolini. The FSB became effective opposition to the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement government although their fortunes would later decline and they were ultimately absorbed into the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action.</b>|$|R
50|$|The right-of-center {{opposition}} {{includes a}} variety of political parties. During the 2005-09 political cycle the largest of these was PODEMOS, a successor to <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action.</b> In the 2009 elections, several parties and politicians united to form Plan Progreso para Bolivia - Convergencia Nacional, whose presidential candidate, Manfred Reyes Villa and parliamentary slate came in second in the 2009 elections.|$|R
50|$|In March 2002, MacLean-Abaroa won his party's first-ever primary {{election}} and the nomination as the presidential candidate of the right wing <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> or A.D.N (Acción Democrática Nacionalista), the party founded by former Bolivian Dictator General Hugo Banzer). The June 2002 elections marked his first unsuccessful bid for the presidency of Bolivia. Shortly after, he joined the World Bank as a Lead Public Sector Management specialist on governance, decentralization and poverty reduction.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, {{a section}} of the PIR {{membership}} broke away and founded the Communist Party of Bolivia (PCB). By the 1960s, the PCB had to a large extent replaced the PIR. Following the military coup in 1964, the PIR went underground and disintegrated into warring factions. A reconstituted PIR emerged in the late 1970s as a puppet party of the dictator Hugo Banzer. In 1979, it dissolved into Banzer's new <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (ADN).|$|R
50|$|Only Hugo Banzer of <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> and Víctor Paz Estenssoro of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement contested the Congressional ballot. Whilst Banzer {{was only}} {{supported}} {{by his own}} party, Paz also received the votes of the Revolutionary Left Movement, the Leftwing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement-Vanguard, the Christian Democratic Party and the Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari. Socialist Party-1, the Bolivian Socialist Falange and the United People's Front did not support either candidate.|$|R
25|$|In the 1985 elections, the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> Party (ADN) of Gen. Banzer won a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, followed by former President Paz Estenssoro's MNR and former Vice President Jaime Paz Zamora's Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). In the congressional run-off, the MIR sided with MNR, and Paz Estenssoro was chosen for a fourth term as President. When he took office in 1985, he faced a staggering economic crisis. Economic output and exports had been declining for several years.|$|R
50|$|Bolivia's multiparty {{democracy}} {{has seen a}} wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the Revolutionary <b>Nationalist</b> Movement, <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action,</b> and the Revolutionary Left Movement predominated from 1985 to 2005. The current president is Evo Morales, the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. Morales' Movement for Socialism - Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades, doing so both in 2005 and 2009.|$|R
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Bolivia on 1 June 1997. As no candidate for the presidency received over 50% of the vote, the National Congress was required to elect a President on 4 August. Hugo Banzer of <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (ADN) was subsequently elected. Whilst the ADN emerged as the largest party in Congress, it failed to win a majority of seats, and formed a coalition government with the Revolutionary Left Movement, Conscience of Fatherland and the Civic Solidarity Union.|$|R
50|$|In the 1985 elections, the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> Party (ADN) of Gen. Banzer won a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, followed by former President Paz Estenssoro's MNR and former Vice President Jaime Paz Zamora's Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). In the congressional run-off, the MIR sided with MNR, and Paz Estenssoro was chosen for a fourth term as President. When he took office in 1985, he faced a staggering economic crisis.

50|$|In the 1985 elections, the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (ADN) of General Hugo Banzer Suárez won a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, followed by former President Víctor Paz Estenssoro's Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) and former Vice President Jaime Paz Zamora's Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). But in the congressional run-off, the MIR sided with the MNR, and Paz Estenssoro was chosen for a fourth term as President. When he took office in 1985, he faced a staggering economic crisis. Economic output and exports had been declining for several years.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (ADN), {{the party}} of then {{president}} and former military dictator Hugo Banzer, came third in the polls. It was however able to get 70 mayors elected from its ranks. Notably in municipalities were the mayors were elected by the municipal councils, ADN was able to obtain {{a high percentage of}} mayors elected. The foremost stronghold of the party was Pando Department, where the party got 49% of the votes and was able to gain 14 out of 15 mayoral posts.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1988, Bolivia's foreign {{minister}} asserted that narcotics traffickers {{were attempting to}} corrupt the political process. Bolivians were outraged, for example, by secretly taped [...] "narcovideos" [...] made in 1985 by Roberto Suárez Gómez (known as the [...] "King of Cocaine" [...] in Bolivia until the mid-1980s) and aired on national television in May 1988. The tapes, provided by a former naval captain cashiered for alleged corruption, showed two prominent politicians from Banzer's <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (Acción Democrática Nacionalista—ADN) and military figures fraternizing with Suárez.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} {{traditionally}} dominant parties in Bolivia (such as the MNR and Banzer's <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action,</b> or ADN), the MIR has lost ground in recent years. One {{of its most}} important leaders, Oscar Eid, even {{went to jail for}} links to narcotics trafficking, further tarnishing the party. Indeed, the MIR lost so much support that it chose not to run candidates for the 2005 presidential elections. Instead, it chose to focus its efforts in local and provincial contests. They are not doing particularly well in that sphere either.|$|R
50|$|The FSB's ranks {{were further}} diluted when various factions split off {{from it in}} the {{aftermath}} of the Banzer dictatorship and the electoral upheavals of the 1978-80 period. Carlos Valverde Barberry eventually emerged as leader and was presidential candidate in 1980 but results were poor. Factionalism again dogged the movement and much of it was absorbed into the conservative <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (founded by Banzer himself). The rump FSB again came to adopt more left-wing rhetoric as a party of opposition although they were eliminated from Congress at the 1989 election and gained no seats at the 1993 election.|$|R
50|$|Seven smaller parties—Revolutionary <b>Nationalist</b> Movement, <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action,</b> New Republican Force, Civic Solidarity Union, Front for Victory, Andean Amazonic Power, and Colla Power—reported {{progress}} {{towards a}} common alliance on June 18. The bloc {{would be called}} United for Bolivia (Unidos por Bolivia), and a congressional deputy involved in alliance talks promised it would be finalized on June 25. Several of these parties—Nationalist Democratic Action, New Republican Force, the faction of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement led by Johnny Torres, as well the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), Bolivian Socialist Falange (FSB), and New Citizen Power (NPC)—threw their support behind the Christian Democrats and candidate Jorge Tuto Quiroga.|$|R
50|$|In {{the initial}} months of 1989, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) tried {{in vain to}} {{postpone}} the election date, arguing that the deadline for electoral registration restricted citizen participation. In December 1988, the party's delegation in Congress had managed to amend the electoral law of 1986. Arguing that the new registration requirements, which limited registration to citizens who possessed cédulas de identidad (national identity cards), constituted a violation of universal suffrage, the MNR pushed through legislation that added birth certificates and military service cards as valid registration documents. <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (ADN) refused to go along with its ally and eventually charged the MNR with conducting fraudulent registrations. By mid-February this issue had triggered the rupture of the pacto.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nationalist</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Action</b> (in Spanish: Acción Democrática Nacionalista) is {{a right-wing}} {{political}} party in Bolivia led by Dr. Freddy Terrazas Salas. ADN {{was founded on}} March 23, 1979 by the military dictator Hugo Banzer after he stepped down from power. It later expanded to include the Revolutionary Left Party (PIR) and a faction of the Bolivian Socialist Falange (FSB). As leader of the ADN, Banzer ran in the 1979, 1980, 1985, 1989, 1993, and 1997 presidential elections. He obtained third place in 1979 and 1980, and won a plurality of the 1985 vote, but, since he did not attain the 50% necessary for direct election, Congress (in accordance with the Bolivian Constitution) selected the chief executive. Its choice was the second-place finisher, Dr. Víctor Paz Estenssoro.|$|R
