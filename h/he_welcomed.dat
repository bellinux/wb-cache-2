5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and <b>he</b> <b>welcomed</b> slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E
5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, <b>he</b> <b>welcomed</b> the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all the surest way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E

5|$|Having left Thompson's tradition, Buczynski {{decided to}} form his own form of Wicca, which he claimed had {{actually}} dated {{back to the}} Palaeolithic and transmitted to him by a figure whose anonymity he had to protect. Referring to this new tradition as Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft or the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, it was heavily influenced by the Welsh mythology contained in texts like The Mabinogion and the Arthurian legends which fascinated him, despite his lack of Welsh heritage. It took as its basis {{the structure of the}} Gardnerian tradition, with its Book of Shadows being largely based upon that which he had obtained through his work with Thompson, accompanied by sections taken from the recently published Lady Sheba's The Book of Shadows. Officially founded in October 1972, later that year an outer court was founded through which to teach interested persons who were not yet initiated. Notably, <b>he</b> <b>welcomed</b> LGBT people and non-caucasians into his tradition {{at a time when they}} were denied entry to most other Wiccan covens. Although taking an open attitude to spiritual seekers, Buczynski prevented the occult investigator, Hans Holzer, from entering the outer coven when the latter requested admission to undertake research for his book The Witchcraft Report; like many in the Pagan and occult community, Buczynski was wary of Holzer's intentions and the sensationalist claims he purported in his publications.|$|E
5|$|In October 1024, Salih's forces, led by Ibn Tawq, {{advanced}} against Aleppo {{and fought}} in sporadic engagements with the Fatimid troops of governors Thu'ban and Mawsuf. Salih himself arrived at Aleppo—after having sacked several coastal districts—with {{large numbers of}} Bedouin warriors on 22 November. He besieged the city, first camping outside of Bab al-Jinan, where his demand that Ibn Abi Usama, the city's qāḍī (head Islamic judge), and other notables surrender was refused. Salih then gathered more troops and engaged Aleppo's defenders for over fifty days, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. On 18 January 1025, the Bab Qinnasrin gate was opened to Salih by Salim ibn al-Mustafad, head of the city's surviving Hamdanid ghilmān; Ibn Mustafad had defected from the Fatimids after a quarrel with Mawsuf, and together with numerous townsmen and other former ghilmān, <b>he</b> <b>welcomed</b> Salih, who granted the inhabitants safe conduct. Afterward, Salih had the towers of the city's walls demolished, according to the Egyptian contemporary chronicler, al-Musabbihi, leading the local populace to believe Salih was preparing to hand over Aleppo to the Byzantines; fearing this, they fought alongside Fatimid troops and temporarily ousted Salih's forces, killing some 250 Kilabi warriors. Zakkar views Salih's destruction of Aleppo's walls as a tactical move to enable an easier reconquest of the city should his troops have been ousted.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 <b>he</b> <b>welcomed</b> the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E
