40|$|This Essay {{explores the}} history <b>of</b> {{formulations}} <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> <b>doctrine,</b> arguing that agency law {{can best be}} rationalized as a distinctive subject by recognizing that an agent acts {{as an extension of}} the principal. The Essay relies on historical material related to the drafting of the Restatements <b>of</b> <b>Agency,</b> the disagreements among Reporters and other participants about the contours agency law, and the intellectual backdrop against which these experts worked. Their disputes, preceded as they were by challenges to the fundamental coherence <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> law, led to successive formulations <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> doctrine; while attempting to provide a comprehensive level of generality, some formulations threatened to distort established limits on the scope of a principal 2 ̆ 7 s responsibility for the actions of an agent. To explain that distortion, this Essay proceeds first by outlining the debates over the status <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> law as an independent branch of law and the ALl 2 ̆ 7 s struggles to define agency law. It then delves into the history and development <b>of</b> inherent <b>agency</b> power as a doctrine, through its inclusion in the Restatement (Second) <b>of</b> <b>Agency</b> and culminating in the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s rejection by the Restatement (Third). The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> inherent <b>agency</b> power originated as a sort of catch-all (termed a 2 ̆ 2 third bottle 2 ̆ 2) for cases in which an agent had neither actual nor apparent authority, but nonetheless was able to subject the principal to liability to third parties. Inherent agency power generalized these as situations arising from the agency relationship itself and where the protection of third parties from harm was sought. As a distinct doctrine, inherent agency power risked situations in which a principal would be subject to liability on a transaction entered into by an agent when a third party had notice that the agent lacked authority. This Essay then explains the impact <b>of</b> inherent <b>agency</b> power <b>doctrine</b> on agency law. The perceived necessity for inherent agency power stemmed part from definitions of apparent authority that were unduly narrow. Tying the themes of the discussion together, the Essay returns to the distinctiveness <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> <b>doctrine</b> among common-law subjects, a distinctiveness that does not require the use of generalizations that lack clarity and normative content...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{theories}} widely accepted {{as a basis for}} liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.The concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit {{as an extension of the}} common law <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> - respondeat superior (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is M.

40|$|Local {{boards of}} health often issue {{regulations}} that have broad effects that surpass {{the borders of}} the city or county to which they apply. Promulgation of such rules by board of health members appointed by the executive branch implicates separation of powers concerns; because such regulations may so extensively burden a locality’s citizens, it may be more appropriate for elected officials to adopt these regulations. Indeed, local businesses or other interested parties often bring suit challenging local board of health actions. Courts apply different analytical methodologies to review these challenges, which often leads to incongruent local health agency discretion for different boards in different states—or even between different local boards in the same state. This Note suggests that the above concerns implicitly affect how courts assess local board of health action. Based on an examination of four local boards of health and their relationships with their local and state governments, this Note posits that there are three factors that courts and policymakers should examine when assessing the parameters of a local board of health’s regulatory discretion: the locality’s history, the locality’s government structure, and the locality’s politics. By taking into account these three factors before applying traditional <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> local <b>agency</b> review—including nondelegation, preemption, or Dillon’s Rule—courts may be better positioned to decide which <b>of</b> these <b>doctrines</b> should apply. In conducting this analysis, this Note also furthers the understanding of the place local boards of health hold in the grander struggle between local and state governments...|$|R

In Anglo-Saxon common law, {{the courts}} have allowed agency of {{necessity}} to develop to meet the prevailing commercial needs, but also restricted its development through the imposition of demanding criteria. After summarising and distinguishing the basic principles applicable to the ‘full ’ <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> of necessity and the ‘more limited ’ sub-doctrine relating to reimbursement of agent’s expense, this paper locates and analyses the current application of the doctrine’s criteria {{in the age of}} ubiquitous mobile phones, synchronous internet communications, email, and immediate money transfers.

40|$|In this {{discussion}} I {{will try to}} understand if {{it is possible to}} talk about a distribution of power between constituencies and how it is, eventually, regulated the coexistence of a plurality of interests under the U. K. system and under the Italian law. In this regard, I will focus on a particular “step” of the companies’ life, that is far from the physiological phase: when a company is “in troubles”. Necessary, speaking about corporate power in the pathological stage of companies presumed to provide for a description of this power distribution between the actors when companies are normally carrying on business activities. The approach I want to suggest to perform this analysis is the so-called <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>agency</b> problems, that can read the relationships between the various actors, beyond what is suggested by law, in economic terms, that is in terms of agency costs. As a result, the starting point in looking for the object above is an economic one, that is a theoretical model that allows to understand, in principle, the relationship between ownership/risk and power of control and the rationales connected with these issues. More specifically, this ideal model is identified in a company where only the members risk and have the property of the company. Are also the same members to make business decisions. Then, the interest that is pursued is that of their ownership because they are solely to exercise control. Since that model does not exist in the real world, where necessary the company needs director performances and requires relationships with creditors and other stakeholders, necessarily a plurality of interests came into play, all more or less attributable to the company or related to the business. Members are no longer the only category to take risks and make decisions, that is to exercise corporate power. Consequently, the transfer of risk even head to other than members, is reflected, by applying the economic theory of the correlation between ownership and control, in a new distribution of power. This new scenario deals with legal strategies which are set up to prevent symptomatic potential corporate conflicts. The purpose is to try to understand if in the UK system and in the Italian law the economic risk distribution model is respected and, eventually, if power is proportionate to the risk that the parties have taken, or there is a mismatch between interests. In this regards, it will be focus on different legal strategies: on the one hand, imperative rules, on the other, contractual remedies that could be seen as, respectively, regulatory and private responses to agency problems. In conclusion, by the agency costs theory and the common English theoretical legal strategies distinction, I wish to offer, respectively, a common language and a general analytic framework with which functionally compare the U. K. and Italy approaches to the distribution of corporate power when companies are in troubles. Finally, some considerations will arise, verifying whether, according to the legal strategies adopted by these jurisdictions, the models of distribution of power are aligned with the economic ones...|$|E

Agencies normally prevail {{in the majority of}} their cases before the federal courts because courts employ <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> deference to <b>agencies</b> 2 ̆ 7 decisions. In the context of wilderness management, however, the success rates <b>of</b> the <b>agencies</b> varies drastically {{depending on the type of}} challenge brought. The Article provides a historical overview of different schemes for wilderness protection, from administrative regulatory schemes to the adoption of the 1964 Wilderness Act and subsequent enactments. It then examines specific case studies and numeric information from all of the cases decided under the 1964 Wilderness Act. The numbers reveal three striking facts. First, a two-fold gap exists between agency success rates in litigation depending on who brings the challenge and the type of challenge it is. Second, the agencies tend to lose in challenges brought by environmentalists more often than not. Third, the party of appointment for the judges does not appear to affect overall distribution of their votes as measured on a simple 2 ̆ 2 pro-wilderness 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 anti-wilderness 2 ̆ 2 axis.

40|$|During much of {{the twentieth}} century, civil {{processes}} in the United States relied on a conceptual framework anchored in the constitutional and common law of due process. More recently, the case law looks to <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> contract and <b>agency</b> law to enforce contracts to preclude litigation and to encourage the entry of contracts to conclude litigation. While “bargaining {{in the shadow of}} the law” is a phrase often invoked, bargaining is increasingly a requirement of the law of conflict resolution, both civil and criminal. Therefore, analyses of the meaning of agreements, familiar features of the law of contract, are becoming central elements of the new law of Civil Procedure. As a consequence, debate needs to center on what the law of “Contract Procedure” should provide. Central questions include whether parties ought to be able to contract for jurisdiction (both state and federal), for choice-of-law rules, and for privacy. Contract Procedure needs also to decide how to regulate the role of judges (who sometimes participate in shaping civil bargains) and what rights parties have when post-agreement conflicts arise either about the existence of a settlement or about the meaning of its terms. As Contract Procedure supplements and sometimes supplants “Due Process Procedure,” the rules of bargaining for legally binding judgments need to identify what bargains law cannot abide.

The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin.

Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life.

Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John.
