I got, like, two, I got, this next album and two, I got three more albums in my head, conceptualized. Once <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out, I'm done. [...] We're still doing it. … [...] The next one is more like trap music. It’s Trap Muzik 2017. And the one after that, it’s gonna be more like a, uh, love as it pertains to a dope boy. And the one after that, that’s my final album. It’s called Kill the King. The last album is Kill the King. Simply because ever since my first album, I've put the title of 'King of the South' on me and to make yourself the king is to make you a target. And in chess, the object is to kill the king. So Kill the King is the title of my last album. Will they kill him or will he ride into the sunset happily ever after?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Is {{this to be}} got in Frankfort?" [...] asked Mrs. Wagner. [...] "I {{only know}} lemon-juice as a remedy against ink-marks, when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> on my dress or my fingers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First-rate workmanship, sir--worth {{twice the}} money; only <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> a bargain from Cologne," [...] said the son, parenthetically, from a distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with these fellers?" [...] said Mr. Crewe. [...] "Haven't I done enough for the town? Didn't <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> rural free delivery? Didn't I {{subscribe}} to the meeting-house and library, and don't I pay more taxes than anybody else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Mr Swiveller, putting two sixpences into a saucer, and {{trimming}} the wretched candle, when the cards {{had been cut}} and dealt, 'those are the stakes. If you win, you <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> all. If <b>I</b> win, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em.</b> To make it seem more real and pleasant, I shall call you the Marchioness, do you hear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I'd {{better take}} the shares,' said Sir Felix, {{feeling that it}} might very {{probably}} be that day fortnight before he could start for New York. 'Could <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> Mr Melmotte?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stick your paddle {{between two}} {{points of the}} rock, Tom," [...] Harry shouted, [...] "while the chief and <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> in. Sit well over {{on the other side}} of the boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my book," [...] {{she told}} him. [...] "I {{have to make}} ever so many {{drawings}} in color before <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> right. If you're fond of the wild creatures, I'll show them to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never fear that!" [...] {{said the}} first. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em,</b> I'll soon have their airs out of them; they'll soon find that they've {{another kind of}} master to deal with than Monsieur St. Clare. 'Pon my word, I'll buy that fellow. I like the shape of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help {{it if it}} is," [...] said Mr. Crewe. [...] "Every hour is {{valuable}} to me, and I've got to take my chances when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em.</b> For some reason, you haven't been down at Leith much this summer. Why didn't you telephone me, as I asked you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Knock off my {{head with}} little apples," [...] he {{declared}} emphatically, striking the fist of one hand into the palm of the other, [...] "if those two men ever escape me! I'll stay here to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> if it takes {{the rest of my}} natural life, and if <b>I</b> don't <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> then <b>I</b> promise you I'll live unnaturally long or until <b>I</b> do <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> or my name's not Charley Le Grant!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course. I {{try to make}} my {{patients}} my friends; I talk to them cheerfully; I amuse them and distract them; <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> away, as far as I can, from themselves and their symptoms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Thank you kindly,' says I. 'Just {{at present}} it is a one man job, but maybe, if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out, {{you will be}} able to give us some advice as to how we had best manage.' ...|$|E
60|$|I now {{proceed to}} propound to the Judge the interrogatories, {{so far as}} I have framed them. I will bring forward a new {{instalment}} when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> ready. I will bring them forward now, only reaching to number four.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and <b>I</b> cant <b>get</b> <b>them</b> clean," [...] said Margaret, {{holding up}} two very pretty {{dripping}} hands, and quoting, in mock heroic parody: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes--whenever <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> indeed. But romance-writers {{might know}} nothing of love, judging by {{the way in which}} they treat of it." ...|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (bluntly). No. (Then {{with a grin}} at her shocked face.) <b>I</b> don't <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> They're {{something}} <b>I</b> can't seem to get acquainted with.|$|R
6000|$|... "All wet and torn!" [...] he murmured, and {{his voice}} sank again into sadness. [...] "I have carried them these three years past. Look! These were for little {{children}} in Belgium and in Serbia. Can <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to them, think you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The bumps?" [...] asked Arthur, as {{the wagon}} gave a jolt {{a bit more}} {{emphatic}} than usual; [...] "yes, Patsy dear, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> all; but I won't pass judgment on Millville and Uncle John's farm just yet. Are we 'most there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I now {{proceed to}} propound to the Judge the interrogatories, {{so far as}} I have framed them. I will bring forward a new {{installment}} when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> ready. I will bring them forward now only reaching to number four. The first one is: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{published}} 6 or 7 {{letters in}} the Tribune while I was gone, now <b>I</b> cannot <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> suppose I must have them copied.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am still}} very popular among the people. My family can go about unmolested. <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out of France, however, in case--in case ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> {{out into}} the open, there's nothing I couldn't do with 'em, Major. Perhaps when the uniforms come down, they'll change their mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Be quick then,' {{answered}} Gudu, {{climbing into}} a tree. And the rabbit hastened {{back to the}} bushes, and gathered {{a quantity of the}} leaves, which he hid among his fur, 'For,' thought he, 'if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> now I shall save myself the trouble of a walk by-and-by.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There you go, Mr. Smith! Well, men {{of another}} kind, when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> {{to be honest}} enough to own the truth, think just the reverse: that my life must be a dreadful bore in its normal state, though {{pleasant}} for the exceptional few days they pass here.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} give an acute critic any {{opportunity}} for telling me that the will, as detailed by me, was all illegal. I have not by me the ipsissima verba; nor can <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> now, as I am very far from Doctors' Commons. So I will give no verbal details at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did my best, sir," [...] the man answered, [...] "but {{they seemed}} to take a {{particular}} fancy to that one. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>get</b> <b>them</b> off it nohow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{saw some}} pretty new birds, {{high up in}} a tree yonder,' he remarked. And the son answered: 'Show me the way and <b>I</b> will <b>get</b> <b>them</b> for dinner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} about my summer clothes. <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>them</b> before long, and I'd like to go with Mrs. Grant {{and learn how to}} shop, if you are willing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not aisy to {{get them}} off, and how should <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> on again? No; they have got there, and there {{they have got to}} stop, bad cess to them! I told Hoolan to rub grease into them for an hour last night, but the rascal was as drunk as an owl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have. According to my {{notion of}} ethics, he owes me six {{thousand}} dollars, and I {{shall not be}} quite content until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out of him, although that may never happen. I feel just now that it would please me especially to make him smart as well, which I quite realize, is unnecessary folly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} kept me in as a {{punishment}} because I did my sums wrong. The other boys {{have gone out}} bird-nesting, but I have to stop here until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> right. I don't know when that will be," [...] he added with a sigh, [...] "as I hate rule of three and can't do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That would I; and a farm, too, if <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> cheap," [...] {{answered}} Brigham, with a sneer he did {{not attempt}} to conceal. [...] "How do you sell farms to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's possible, but I {{thought about}} buying camels. I reckon <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>them</b> for a low price, paid in trade goods, and I expect {{you know what}} they are worth just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. I {{will go up}} {{the ravine}} and bring down a bundle of dry sticks from the forest. <b>I</b> will <b>get</b> <b>them</b> as dry as possible, {{so as not to}} make a smoke." ...|$|R
