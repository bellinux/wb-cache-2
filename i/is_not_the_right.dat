5|$|In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, Ahalya is {{depicted}} as a romantic adulteress. When Brahma creates Ahalya as the most beautiful being, she {{falls in love with}} Indra and longs for him, but Brahma grants her to Gautama. After Ahalya's marriage, Indra too craves for her. He frequently visits her and flirts with her in Gautama's absence. At one point, Ahalya receives a visit from Indra's female messenger, who proceeds to mock husbands who avoid sex by saying that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> day for pleasure. Ahalya protests, maintaining that she imagines Gautama to be Indra as they have sex and that a woman should be a stone, forgoing all thought of sexual gratification. That night, when Ahalya longs for conjugal bliss, Gautama refuses her, saying that she is not in her fertile period. Agitated, she wishes that Indra was there to satisfy her. Indra perceives her wish and comes in Gautama's disguise, but is revealed by his seductive speech. Ignoring the deception, Ahalya joyously makes love to him.|$|E

500|$|The public {{consultation}} process before the ruling, and the ruling itself were controversial, yielding 229 comments. ILUC {{was one of}} the most contentious issues. On June 24, 2008, 27 scientists and researchers submitted a letter saying, [...] "As researchers and scientists in the field of biomass to biofuel conversion, we are convinced that there simply is not enough hard empirical data to base any sound policy regulation in regards to the indirect impacts of renewable biofuels production. The field is relative new, especially when compared to the vast knowledge base present in fossil fuel production, and the limited analyses are driven by assumptions that sometimes lack robust empirical validation." [...] The New Fuels Alliance, representing more than two-dozen biofuel companies, researchers and investors, questioned the Board intention to include indirect land use change effects into account, wrote [...] "While it is likely true that zero <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> number for the indirect effects of any product in the real world, enforcing indirect effects in a piecemeal way could have very serious consequences for the LCFS.... The argument that zero <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> number does not justify enforcing a different wrong number, or penalizing one fuel for one category of indirect effects while giving another fuel pathway a free pass." ...|$|E

Ajit Duara argues in The Hindu that [...] "the accomplished cultural sophistication and political genius of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{has to be}} dumbed down to the astoundingly moronic levels of Lage Raho Munnabhai." [...] Filmmaker Jahnu Barua was also critical, stating that [...] "Gandhian philosophy is serious business and Lage Raho Munna Bhai <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> way to show it."

[...] A writer for International Business Times adds that Cooper, despite being in his 40s, has a [...] "boyish charm and laid-back personality." [...] Cooper believes that {{his personality}} relates to acting: [...] "I enjoy people, that makes this profession a lot easier, and I can sleep anywhere. That's a skill."

500|$|Steiger {{was offered}} the title role in Patton (1970), but turned it down {{because he did not}} want to glorify war. The role was then given to George C. Scott, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Steiger called this refusal his [...] "dumbest career move", remarking, [...] "I got on my high horse. I thought I was a pacifist." [...] Instead, he chose to portray Napoleon Bonaparte {{opposite}} Christopher Plummer in Sergei Bondarchuk's Waterloo (1970), a co-production between the Soviet Union and Italy. One commentator wrote: [...] "I watched with extraordinary respect, no, that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> word, with enthusiasm, the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo," [...] while literary critic Daniel S. Burt describes Steiger's Napoleon as an [...] "unusual interpretation", finding him less convincing than Plummer's Wellington.|$|E
500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping out of the senate race: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time for me to run for office.

Leng recognises Barham's arrangements on [...] "pivotal" [...] songs such as [...] "Isn't It a Pity", [...] "My Sweet Lord", [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] and [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] as important elements of the album's sound, while Spector has praised Harrison's guitar and vocal work on the overdubs, saying: [...] "Perfectionist <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> word. Anyone can be a perfectionist. He was beyond that..." [...] Harrison's style of slide guitar playing incorporated aspects of both Indian music and the blues tradition; from its introduction on All Things Must Pass, Leng writes, Harrison's slide guitar became his musical signature – [...] "as instantly recognisable as Dylan's harmonica or Stevie Wonder's".|$|E

500|$|On December 17, Shumlin {{announced}} that he was dropping his plan to implement single-payer healthcare. The reforms, which required business and personal tax increases, had never advanced beyond the framework stage. Shumlin, who had missed two earlier financing deadlines, said that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time" [...] because the federal government had offered less funding than expected and [...] "the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state's economy." [...] The media also cited controversy surrounding comments made by economist Jonathan Gruber, who was involved in crafting and advocating for the plan, and Shumlin's failure to win a majority in the election as reasons for the cancellation. The decision, which Shumlin called the [...] "biggest disappointment" [...] of his career, drew a mixed response. Business groups lauded his [...] "pragmatic" [...] move but supporters of health care reform organized protests and said that it would end his political career.|$|E

2500|$|Cosmologist Alan Guth {{proposed}} a multi-verse {{solution to the}} Fermi paradox.

Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop. However, Guth notes [...] "Perhaps this argument explains why SETI has not found any signals from alien civilizations, but I find it more plausible that it is merely a symptom that the synchronous gauge probability distribution <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Romney's {{energy plan}} that was {{unveiled}} in August 2012 would maintain subsidies for oil companies, which Romney's rival for the presidency, Obama, would eliminate. During the 2008 presidential campaign, in November 2007 {{when all of}} the Democratic presidential candidates were calling for eliminating billions of dollars of tax breaks for oil companies, Romney told the New York Times, [...] "Now <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to raise taxes on our oil companies." [...] Throughout most of the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney himself made almost no public statements directly commenting on tax breaks for oil and gas companies; and the Romney campaign declined to respond to repeated requests from the Tampa Bay Times Politifact and The Washington Post's Fact Checker to clarify his position. However, he did tell a town hall gathering in April 2012 that, in contrast to Obama, {{he did not want to}} raise taxes on oil companies. Romney's chief energy advisor also testified before Congress twice during the campaign on behalf of the oil and gas industry that Congress should maintain tax benefits for oil and gas producers. During the first presidential debate between Romney and Obama, in October 2012, Romney hinted for the first time that as president he might consider eliminating $2.8 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas producers if Congress would agree to cut the tax rate for all corporations by 30%.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the 2012 presidential campaign, in June 2011, Romney said, [...] "I don't {{speak for}} the {{scientific}} community, of course, but I believe the world's getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read {{that the world is}} getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive. He doesn't know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it.... What you won't see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the refusal}} to honour the victims during the opening {{ceremony}} of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This {{was the first time}} that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by “honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village" [...] and said that the Israelis “came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.” [...] Rogge added, [...] "we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.” In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, [...] "He is trying to do the bare minimum,” and called it [...] "shameful." [...] Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, “This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.” At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had [...] "submitted to terrorism", and would be [...] "written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace." [...] Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of Limmud International tweeted that “the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge".' ...|$|E
