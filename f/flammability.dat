5|$|Plutonium–uranium–titanium and plutonium–uranium–zirconium were {{investigated}} {{for use as}} nuclear fuels. The addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance, reduces <b>flammability,</b> and improves ductility, fabricability, strength, and thermal expansion. Plutonium–uranium–molybdenum has the best corrosion resistance, forming a protective film of oxides, but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons.|$|E
5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in <b>flammability.</b>|$|E
25|$|C-260, {{passed in}} 2003, {{requires}} cigarette manufacturers to produce ‘fire-safe’ cigarettes (cigarettes that extinguish when left unattended, reducing their <b>flammability).</b>|$|E
25|$|Armored {{fighting}} vehicles use diesel {{because of}} its lower <b>flammability</b> risks and the engines' higher provision of torque and lower likelihood of stalling.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the health}} risks of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and <b>flammability</b> of naphthalene, other {{substances}} like camphor are sometimes used (though camphor has its own toxicity issues).|$|E
25|$|The three {{metallic}} principles: sulphur to <b>flammability</b> or combustion, mercury to volatility and stability, {{and salt}} to solidity. became the tria prima of the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus. He reasoned that Aristotle's four-element theory appeared in bodies as three principles. Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental and justified them by recourse to the description of how wood burns in fire. Mercury included the cohesive principle, so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart. Smoke described the volatility (the mercurial principle), the heat-giving flames described <b>flammability</b> (sulphur), and the remnant ash described solidity (salt).|$|E
25|$|Older mothballs {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} naphthalene, {{but due to}} naphthalene's <b>flammability,</b> many modern mothball formulations instead use 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The latter formulation may be somewhat less flammable, although both chemicals have the same NFPA 704 rating for <b>flammability.</b> The latter chemical is also variously labeled as para-dichlorobenzene, p-dichlorobenzene, pDCB, or PDB, making it harder to identify unless all these synonyms are known to a potential purchaser. Both of these formulations have the strong, pungent, sickly-sweet odor often associated with mothballs. Both naphthalene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene undergo sublimation, meaning that they evaporate from a solid state directly into a gas; this gas is toxic to moths and moth larvae.|$|E
25|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} takes up about 1/600th {{the volume of}} natural gas in the gaseous state. It is odorless, colorless, {{non-toxic}} and non-corrosive. Hazards include <b>flammability</b> after vaporization into a gaseous state, freezing, and asphyxia.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{made of a}} napped {{synthetic}} fabric, such as polyester or polar fleece; however sleepers {{made from}} heavier natural fabrics such as cotton are also available, they are not common in North America due to stringent regulations regarding <b>flammability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gas venting from {{vehicles}} {{powered by}} LNG may create a <b>flammability</b> hazard if parked indoors {{for longer than}} a week. Additionally, due to its low temperature, refueling a LNG-powered vehicle requires training to avoid the risk of frostbite.|$|E
25|$|Dryer lint, which {{collects}} on the {{lint screen}} of a clothes dryer, is highly flammable and therefore presents a fire hazard. However, {{because of this}} <b>flammability,</b> dryer lint may be collected for use as tinder, although burning man-made fibres can produce toxic fumes.|$|E
25|$|Safety Standard UL 796 covers {{component}} {{safety requirements}} for printed wiring boards {{for use as}} components in devices or appliances. Testing analyzes characteristics such as <b>flammability,</b> maximum operating temperature, electrical tracking, heat deflection, and direct support of live electrical parts.|$|E
25|$|Phosphoric acid is not combustible, nor flammable, {{and will}} not burn in itself. <b>Flammability</b> of the {{chemical}} exists only from incompatible reactions with other compounds/materials. Decomposition of H3PO4 to toxic fumes readily occurs upon mixing with: alcohols, aldehydes, cyanides, ketones, phenols, esters, sulfides, and halogenated organics.|$|E
25|$|Mixtures of {{dispersed}} {{combustible materials}} (such as gaseous or vaporised fuels, and some dusts) and air will burn {{only if the}} fuel concentration lies within well-defined lower and upper bounds determined experimentally, referred to as <b>flammability</b> limits or explosive limits. Combustion can range in violence from deflagration through detonation.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of sulfur}} monoxide's rare {{occurrence}} in our atmosphere and poor stability; {{it is difficult}} to fully determine its hazards. But when condensed and compacted, it forms disulfur dioxide, which is relatively toxic and corrosive. This compound is also highly flammable (similar <b>flammability</b> to methane) and when burned produces sulfur dioxide, a poisonous gas.|$|E
25|$|Coupled {{with all}} this, {{materials}} such as celluloid have been recognised as highly flammable since early days of its usage, and acts such as the Celluloid and Cinematograph Films Act 1922 and the Cinematograph Act 1952 gave the fire brigade powers to take samples of film and test them for <b>flammability</b> {{even though they were}} not the enforcing authority.|$|E
25|$|Some {{shipping}} companies have experimented with using popcorn as a biodegradable replacement for expanded polystyrene packing material. However, popcorn has numerous undesirable properties as a packing material, including attractiveness to pests, <b>flammability,</b> {{and a higher}} cost and greater density than expanded polystyrene. A more processed form of expanded corn foam has been developed to overcome some of these limitations.|$|E
25|$|CFCs and HCFCs {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} because of their low toxicity, reactivity and <b>flammability.</b> Every permutation of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized. Furthermore, many examples are known for higher numbers of carbon as well as related compounds containing bromine. Uses include refrigerants, blowing agents, propellants in medicinal applications and degreasing solvents.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the G3M and G4M contributed to a demand for great range in a fighter aircraft. This partly drove the {{requirements}} for the A6M Zero which was as noteworthy for its range as for its maneuverability. Both qualities were again purchased {{at the expense of}} light construction and <b>flammability</b> that later contributed to the A6M's high casualty rates as the war progressed.|$|E
25|$|Before this accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{issued a}} ruling that {{required}} airlines to upgrade the <b>flammability</b> standards of materials on board, but the USAir plane had been built before the effective date of those requirements and {{had not yet been}} modernized. It was scheduled to be upgraded within the next year. By 2009, all aircraft operating in the United States were compliant.|$|E
25|$|Model {{building}} codes require {{passive fire protection}} and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire. The {{most common form of}} active fire protection is fire sprinklers. To maximize passive fire protection of buildings, building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire-resistance, combustibility and <b>flammability.</b> Upholstery, carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene foams are {{produced}} using blowing agents that form bubbles {{and expand the}} foam. In expanded polystyrene, these are usually hydrocarbons such as pentane, which may pose a <b>flammability</b> hazard in manufacturing or storage of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact. Extruded polystyrene is usually made with hydrofluorocarbons (HFC-134a), which have global warming potentials of approximately 1000–1300 times that of carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Polyurethane polymer is a {{combustible}} {{solid and}} can be ignited if exposed to an open flame. Decomposition from fire can produce significant amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, in addition to nitrogen oxides, isocyanates, and other toxic products. Because of the <b>flammability</b> of the material, {{it has to be}} treated with flame retardants (at least in case of furniture), almost all of which are considered harmful.|$|E
25|$|Temperature, pressure, and the {{concentration}} of the oxidizer also influences <b>flammability</b> limits. Higher temperature or pressure, as well as higher concentration of the oxidizer (primarily oxygen in air), results in lower LFL and higher UFL, hence the gas mixture {{will be easier to}} explode. The effect of pressure is very small at pressures below 10 millibar and difficult to predict, since it has only been studied in internal combustion engines with a turbocharger.|$|E
25|$|A {{full scale}} flying {{reproduction}} was constructed {{by a team}} of enthusiasts, most notably Scotty Wilson and John Lawson. Modern materials were used within reason, allowing for cost and safety. The use of magnesium, named in the original design to save weight, was rejected due to its <b>flammability</b> and cost. A composite wood (DuraKore) was used in place of the original tulipwood, and glued in place with modern epoxy. The doped fabric was replaced with fiberglass.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of <b>flammability</b> with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|Parker Hannifin {{supplies}} the complete fuel package: inerting system, fuel measurement and management systems, mechanical equipment and fuel pumps. The fuel tank inerting system features air-separation modules to generate nitrogen-enriched air {{to reduce the}} <b>flammability</b> of fuel vapour in the tanks. Parker also provides hydraulic power generation and distribution system: reservoirs, manifolds, accumulators, thermal control, isolation, software and new engine- and electric motor-driven pump designs. Parker estimates the contracts will generate more than $2billion in revenues {{over the life of}} the programme.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} basics of fuel combustion, no matter what type of fuel system is used on a given engine, the carburetor's sole job is to provide exactly the correct amount of finely {{atomized}} fuel into a given amount of air that is entering the engine. To be burnable, the {{air to fuel ratio}} must be within the <b>flammability</b> limits of between nine and sixteen pounds of air to one pound of fuel (for gasoline engines). Above or below this ratio, the fuel will not burn.|$|E
25|$|Pioneered by Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain, its {{development}} {{was hailed as}} an anesthetic revolution. Originally thought to possess less hepatotoxicity than chloroform, and without the unpleasant pungency and <b>flammability</b> of ether, TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of cardiac arrhythmias, low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with soda lime used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with soda lime, and evidence of hepatotoxicity as had been found with chloroform.|$|E
25|$|Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene {{is embedded in the}} PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry. When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the <b>flammability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide overcomes many of the {{problems}} with the original industrial process. Because CO2 is a better flame inhibitor than N2, a CO2 environment allows for the use of pure oxygen directly, instead of air, with reduced <b>flammability</b> hazards. The solubility of molecular oxygen in solution is also enhanced in the CO2 environment. Because more oxygen is available to the system, supercritical carbon dioxide (Tc = 31°C) has more complete oxidation with fewer byproducts, lower carbon monoxide production, less decarboxylation and higher purity than the commercial process.|$|E
25|$|Acetylene is {{not just}} flammable; in certain {{conditions}} it is explosive. Although it has an upper <b>flammability</b> limit in air of 81%, acetylene's explosive decomposition behaviour makes this irrelevant. If a detonation wave enters the acetylene tank, the tank will be blown apart by the decomposition. Ordinary check valves that normally prevent back flow cannot stop a detonation wave {{because they are not}} capable of closing before the wave passes around the gate. For that reason a flashback arrestor is needed. It is designed to operate before the detonation wave makes it from the hose side to the supply side.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, Paul Thénard, {{son of the}} French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a {{cold trap}} to {{separate}} diphosphine from phosphine that had been generated from calcium phosphide, thereby demonstrating that P2H4 is responsible for spontaneous <b>flammability</b> associated with PH3, and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine’s formula to be PH2, and thus an intermediate between elemental phosphorus, the higher polymers, and phosphine. Calcium phosphide (nominally Ca3P2) produces more P2H4 than other phosphides because of the preponderance of P-P bonds in the starting material.|$|E
25|$|For farm use, pellets of {{aluminium}} phosphide, calcium phosphide, or zinc phosphide release phosphine upon contact with atmospheric water or rodents' stomach acid. These pellets also contain agents {{to reduce the}} potential for ignition or explosion of the released phosphine. A more recent alternative {{is the use of}} phosphine gas itself which requires dilution with either CO2 or N2 or even air to bring it below the <b>flammability</b> point. Use of the gas avoids the issues related with the solid residues left by metal phosphide and results in faster, more efficient control of the target pests.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{polyester}} polyols {{are based}} on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols {{are based on}} reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent <b>flammability</b> characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.|$|E
25|$|The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) {{commissioned}} “whole system” tests, {{which are}} designed to see how different cladding systems reacted in a fire. Seven combinations were tested and six deemed dangerous. It reported back in August 2017 that there are 228 buildings in the United Kingdom cladded using these methods. The seventh, a combination of aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with a limited <b>flammability</b> filling and stone-wool insulation, was deemed safe. There are no existing buildings in the UK using this combination, {{but it could be}} used to reclad all the buildings that are currently using the other combinations. These findings will used to help revise the Building Regulations.|$|E
