Bahá'í law and teachings do not include details on many aspects of life, and the successive heads of the religion have been reluctant to prescribe specific and detailed codes of Bahá'í behaviour; for example the heads of the religion have stated that details of Bahá'í behaviour, such as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>dress,</b> are a matter of individual choice and not Bahá'í law. This is in contrast to the provisions of Islamic law.|$|E

2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} a garment {{to which the}} Torah obligates a person to attach tzitzit must have three characteristics: (1) it must have four or more corners; (2) it must {{be large enough to}} cover both the head and most of the body of a child who is able to walk on his own in the {{marketplace}} without having someone watch him; and (3) it must be made of either wool or linen. For a garment of wool, the white strands should be made of wool. For a garment of linen, the white strands should be made of linen. For garments of other fabrics, the white strands should be made from the same fabric as the garment. [...] which says, [...] "And you shall see them," [...] implies that the obligation to wear tzitzit applies during the day, but not at night. Nevertheless, a blind man is obligated to wear tzitzit, for even though he does not see them, others see him wearing them. One is permitted to wear tzitzit at night, provided he does not recite a blessing. One should recite the blessing over tzitzit in the morning when the sun has risen so that one can tell the strands of techelet from those that are white. The blessing is: [...] "Blessed are you, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to wrap ourselves with tzitzit." [...] One should recite the blessing anytime he wraps himself in tzitzit during the day. Maimonides taught that the Torah does not require women and children to wear tzitzit, but the Rabbis oblige every boy who knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> himself to wear tzitzit so as to teach him to fulfill commandments. Women who wish to wrap themselves in tzitzit may do so without reciting a blessing, and no one should prevent them. Maimonides taught that there is no obligation to attach tzitzit to a garment that remains folded in place, without a person wearing it. The garment does not require tzitzit. Rather, the person wearing the garment has the obligation. Maimonides taught that even though a person is not obligated to buy a tallit and wrap himself in it so that he must attach tzitzit to it, it is not proper for a person to release himself from the commandment. He should always try to be wrapped in a garment that requires tzitzit so as to fulfill the commandment. In particular, Maimonides taught that one should take care to be wrapped in a tallit during prayer, and it is very shameful for a Torah scholar to pray without being wrapped in a tallit. And Maimonides taught that a person should always be careful regarding the commandment of tzitzit, because [...] which says [...] "And you shall see them and remember all the commandments of God," [...] implies that the commandment of tzitzit is considered equal to all the commandments and all the commandments are considered dependent on it.|$|E
