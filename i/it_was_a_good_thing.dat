Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred [...] "after the horse had been stolen from the barn. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that the Nip air commander was stupid.

[...] There was originally a joke in the episode in which a gay couple walked into [...] "Flaming Moe's", assuming {{that it was a}} gay bar because of the name.

2500|$|Colonel Morris Davis, chief {{prosecutor}} for the US office of Military Commissions, said, [...] "He eventually left Afghanistan and it's my understanding was {{heading back to}} Australia when 9/11 happened. When he heard about 9/11, he said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> (and) {{he went back to}} the battlefield, back to Afghanistan, and reported in to the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and basically said, 'I'm David Hicks and I'm reporting for duty.'" [...] Davis also compared Hicks' alleged actions to that of those who carried out terrorist attacks such as Bali, the London and Madrid bombings, and the Beslan school siege. Terry Hicks, however, claimed that his son seemed at first unaware, then sceptical, of the 11 September attacks when they spoke on a mobile phone in early November 2001. He also noted David Hicks commented about [...] "going off to Kabul to defend it against the Northern Alliance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yamin {{audition}}ed in Boston, Massachusetts, singing Leon Russell's [...] "A Song for You", but his audition was not aired (it {{was later}} aired on October 24, 2009, {{as part of}} the American Idol Rewind - season 5 show). He performed the song again in front of the judges during Hollywood rounds, as well as Rascal Flatts's [...] "Bless the Broken Road". During the group auditions, Yamin and his group performed [...] "It's In Her Kiss" [...] (aka [...] "The Shoop Shoop Song") from Betty Everett; Simon Cowell disliked the group performance, but Randy Jackson said Yamin was the best one in his group, and Paula Abdul said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> she could look past two left feet, in a way of saying he did not dance well but he could definitely sing. He was sent through by the judges and made it through to the finals of the competition.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, {{her talent}} {{led to a}} {{contract}} with Teaspoon Productions, headed by Chris Stokes and Earl Harris, who gave {{her work as a}} backing vocalist for their R boy band Immature, and arranged the production of a demo tape. In 1993, amid ongoing negotiations with East West Records, Norwood's parents organized a recording contract with the Atlantic Recording Corporation after auditioning for the company's director of A Darryl Williams. To manage her daughter, Norwood's mother soon resigned from her job, while Norwood herself dropped out of Hollywood High School later, and was tutored privately from tenth grade on. During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the ABC sitcom Thea, portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian Thea Vidale. Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series' viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. She stated, [...] "I felt bad for everybody else but me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> because I could do what I had to do, because I wanted to sing." ...|$|E

[...] She revealed that she was initially underwhelmed by a photo of Pattinson, but said of his audition, which was a love scene with co-star Kristen Stewart: [...] "It was electric. The room shorted out, the sky opened up, and I was like, 'This {{is going to be}} good.'" [...] Pattinson has admitted; [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} play the part when I went in, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> to find during the audition. I really wanted it after that, but I didn’t really even know what it was. I hadn’t really read any of the books. And just from that, ‘I want this job.’ It was pretty much because of Kristen." [...] In early 2008, Pattinson spoke of a fan backlash against his casting, disclosing Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I stopped reading [...] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else.'" [...] He revealed to the Evening Standard that; [...] "The books have a huge following, and I’ve already got bags of letters from angry fans, telling me that I can’t possibly play Edward, because I’m Diggory.

2500|$|Although the Queen's Canadian titles include Defender of the Faith/Défenseur de la Foi, {{neither the}} monarch {{nor any of}} the viceroys have an {{official}} religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (Fidei defensor, in Latin) signifies the sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of {{the security of the}} Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. Defender of the Faith thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the House of Commons: [...] "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In our countries [...] there are no established churches, but in our countries {{there are people who have}} faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler." ...|$|E

5000|$|That {{is often}} omitted when used to {{introduce}} a subordinate clause—"He told me that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read." [...] {{could just as easily}} be [...] "He told me <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read." [...] Historically, [...] "that" [...] usually followed a comma: [...] "He told me, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read." [...] Middle Modern English grammarian Joseph Robertson recommended in On Punctuation that <b>a</b> comma <b>be</b> used with <b>a</b> conjunction. However, if the subordinate, conjunctional ellipse, null complement, or syntactic pleonasm of [...] "that" [...] <b>is</b> punctuated with <b>a</b> comma, then, in the English grammar, stylistically speaking, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> comma splice, especially in formal writing. Instead, <b>a</b> semicolon should <b>be</b> used to be grammatically correct: He told me; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read. In grammar, the usage of [...] "that" [...] constitutes a that-clause while its absence constitutes a bare clause.|$|R
