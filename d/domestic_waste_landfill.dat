Traditional approaches to waste recycling methods stop meeting the requirements of geoecological safety. The paper offers a methodology of usage of the ferrous industry waste taking into consideration a life cycle of the materials, which comprise the ferrous industry waste. New methodological approaches to evaluate the technologies of waste recycling have been developed. Complex selection criterion for usage technologies of ferrous industry solid waste resource potential is developed taking into consideration ecological, technological and economical factors. A technology of ferrovanadium waste utilization as a free-running material at a solid <b>domestic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>landfill</b> is shown.

40|$|Many {{bird species}} are {{attracted}} to landfills which take <b>domestic</b> or putrescible <b>waste.</b> These sites provide a reliable, rich source of food which can attract large concentrations of birds. The birds may cause conflicts with human interest with respect to noise, birds carrying litter off site, possible transmission of pathogens in bird droppings {{and the potential for}} birdstrikes. In the UK there is an 8 mile safeguarding radius around an airfield, within which any planning applications must pass scrutiny from regulatory bodies to show they will not attract birds into the area and increase the birdstrike risk. Peckfield Landfill site near Leeds, West Yorkshire was chosen for a trial of a netting system designed to exclude birds from <b>domestic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>landfills.</b> The site was assessed for bird numbers before the trial, during the netting trial and after the net had been removed. A ScanCord net was installed for 6 weeks, during which time all household waste was tipped inside the net. Gull numbers decreased on the site from a mean of 1074 per hourly count to 29 per hourly count after two days. The gull numbers increased again after the net had been removed. Bird concentrations in the surroundings were also monitored to assess the effect of the net. Bird numbers in the immediate vicinity of the landfill site were higher than those further away. When the net was installed, the bird concentrations adjacent to the landfill site decreased. Corvids were not affected by the net as they fed on covered waste which was available outside the net throughout the trial. This shows that bird problems on a landfill site are complex, requiring a comprehensive policy of bird control.

40|$|It is the {{objective}} of this study to evaluate the management of air waste, wastewater and solid waste in the prefecture of Larissa, Greece. The levels of air pollution in the prefecture are not so high. Nevertheless, examination has showed that the existent atmospheric pollution is mainly attributed to static sources, such as central heating and industry, especially in the city of Larissa. The study of water pollution includes surface and underground water. The surface water pollution is mainly attributed to industrial wastewater. The pollution of Pineios River is characterized by fluctuations. In some areas of the river, especially after the city of Larissa, the levels of pollution are high. Moreover, the waters of Asmaki canal and Karla Lake are so polluted that there is no possibility of finding life in these water bodies. On the other hand, the groundwater pollution is related to the high concentration of nitrates, caused by over-fertilization of farming lands.

40|$|SUMMARY: The Pusztazámor {{landfill}} is {{the largest}} Hungarian <b>domestic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>landfill</b> site which was built in 2000, employing state-of-the-art technology. The placement of domestic waste started in 2000 and will, in all probability, continue until 2005. In {{the first of three}} placement segments, a gas extraction system with a gas booster station and a flare system was started-up in autumn 2006 in one section to be able to design the final gas utilisation plant with regard to the gas quantity and quality. After a test operation (pumping trail) of only 6 months, {{it turned out that the}} gas quality is suitable for the utilisation in a gas engine, even in accordance with the strict TA air 2002 requirements. However, the usual West-European gas prognosis models cannot fully be applied to Hungary. The conservative designs and calculations regarding the amount of gas will probably be exceeded by a factor of " 1. 5 to 2 ". Reasons for this could be the mild climate and higher water introductions into the landfill body. The effect on the chronological course of the gas production remains to be seen. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} {{results of a}} {{laboratory}} and in situ study of a <b>domestic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>landfill</b> using magnetic resonance measurements. For our study, we used a laboratory Earth's field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument developed at LTHE and a large-scale commercial magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) system NUMISLITE from IRIS Instruments. We show that NMR could be a tool for investigating different processes in water-saturated waste samples. Our results show that domestic waste material contains ferromagnetic or paramagnetic particles that perturb the homogeneity of the geomagnetic field at a microscopic scale and render an NMR signal short. Consequently, only the spin echo technique can be applied for measuring. At a macroscopic scale, waste and different buried objects may also perturb the natural geomagnetic field. While investigating the landfill, we observed that magnetic anomalies (± 2500 nT) are localized around some cells. This is probably linked {{to the presence of}} a higher percentage of metallic objects within the waste disposal. Our first appraisal of the possibility of investigating water-saturated waste in a laboratory using an Earth's field NMR instrument shows that, with existing instruments, waste samples can be studied when the dry density of waste is less than approximately 450 kg/m 3. Because the relaxation times of magnetic resonance signals in landfill may be short (T 2 < 100 ms and T 2 *< 10 ms), existing large-scale MRS instrumentation is not adapted to the investigation of domestic waste landfills...|$|E

Profiles for Na(2 ̆ 7 +), Mg(2 ̆ 72 +), DOC and other soluble species indicate that, at 16 years, contaminants have migrated up to 130 cm from the waste. Profiles for conservative species suggest that Cl(2 ̆ 7 -), (2 ̆ 73) H, (2 ̆ 718) O and (2 ̆ 72) H fronts {{are ahead of}} those of species such as Na(2 ̆ 7 +), K(2 ̆ 7 +) and DOC. In comparison, the heavy metals, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Pb, have migrated only 10 - 20 cm.;Batch equilibrium studies involving Fe(2 ̆ 72 +), Cu(2 ̆ 72 +), Zn(2 ̆ 72 +) and Pb(2 ̆ 72 +) result in classical adsorption-pH curves which show increasing adsorption at higher pH levels and vice versa. The presence of soil carbonates is shown to significantly increase the mass of Pb and Cu removed from domestic landfill leachate.;Highly reducing conditions in the top 50 cm of the contaminated barrier clay are inferred from laboratory-measured redox potentials. Reduced species of nitrogen (NH(, 4) (2 ̆ 7 +) -ammonium) relative to oxidized species (NO(, 2) (2 ̆ 7 -) (nitrite) and NO(, 3) (2 ̆ 7 -) (nitrate)) is also much more abundant in this zone. Corresponding pH values show little variation in the profile, increasing from about 7. 8 at the clay-waste interface to 8. 2 {{in the rest of}} the profile. Soil bacteriological studies suggest that a higher microbial population exists in the interface region probably due to increased availability of nutrients. It is suggested that a greater depletion of oxygen has, consequently, occurred near the interface.;Combination of E(,h) -pH and selective dissolution data with thermodynamic calculations lead to the evidence that carbonates may be controlling the solubilities of heavy metals in the clay pore water. With the exception of Cu(OH) (, 2), the pore water is found to be undersaturated with respect to metal hydroxides. The presence of insoluble metal-organic complexes is also inferred from the selective dissolution analysis.;Volume estimates based on chemical precipitates indicate that soil porosity decreases only slightly from 0. 39 at 20 cm and greater depths to 0. 375 at the interface.

Several laboratory-scale experiments have been conducted to optimize the kinetic conditions for enhanced leaching, which were later applied to pilot scale reactors to ensure effectual settlement of waste and subsequent flushing of total and volatile solids from the waste matrix. The optimum kinetic conditions obtained from the laboratory experiments were intermittent downward leachate recirculation through a compacted waste of density 500 kg/m 3 with a periodic leachate displacement by fresh water. The pilot scale reactor showed a waste settlement of 66 % within a period of one week.

40|$|We used various {{approaches}} {{to establish a}} comprehensive budget of methane (CH 4) emissions from the Seine basin, including direct emissions from livestock and soils as well as emissions from the drainage network. For the direct emissions from livestock, we used official livestock census numbers and emission factors (CH 4 emitted by each animal species per head per year) available in the literature. For the emissions from soils, we based our estimates on experimental measurements in closed chambers installed on different agricultural plots, forest, and grasslands in 2008 and 2009. The results were extrapolated to the whole Seine basin, including grassland, cropland, and forest soil distributions in the Seine basin. The CH 4 emissions from the Seine drainage network were also based on measurements of sampled waters in various rivers and streams (from headwaters to estuary) during different seasons in 2007, 2008, and 2010. After chemical analysis of CH 4 concentrations in the water samples using a gas chromatographic technique and calculation of the CH 4 supersaturation by stream order in rivers of the Seine basin (from 1 to 8) and by season we could estimate the CH 4 emissions for the whole water surface area of the Seine drainage network. The livestock of the Seine basin produce CH 4 emissions amounting to 166 × 106 kg C year− 1, among which cattle are responsible for 85 %. The total CH 4 emission from the Seine drainage network was estimated at 0. 3 × 106 kg C year− 1, large rivers being responsible for the largest proportion. Ebullition could account for an additional 0. 2 × 106 kg C year− 1. Soils of the Seine basin are a net sink for CH 4 (9. 4 × 106 kg C year− 1). The water and soils fluxes are low with regard to emissions by livestock, but <b>domestic</b> <b>waste,</b> through <b>landfills,</b> could contribute an additional 40 × 106 kg C year− 1...|$|R
