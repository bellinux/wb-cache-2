The {{ability of a}} <b>dendrite</b> to initiate an action potential is not only highly dependent on synaptic input {{but also on the}} number of voltage-gated channels and density of voltage-gated channels present in the membrane.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} <b>dendrites</b> present on {{pyramidal}} cells are apical and basal <b>dendrites.</b> Apical <b>dendrites</b> {{can be divided}} into two categories: distal and proximal. The longer distal apical <b>dendrites</b> project from the pyramidal cell body (soma) opposite from the axon. Distal apical <b>dendrites</b> form non-local synapses. Shorter proximal apical <b>dendrites</b> project radially to local pyramidal cells and interneurons. Pyramidal neurons segregate their inputs using proximal and apical <b>dendrites.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compartmental {{modelling}} of <b>dendrites</b> {{deals with}} multi-compartment modelling of the <b>dendrites,</b> {{to make the}} understanding of the electrical behavior of complex <b>dendrites</b> easier. Basically, compartmental modelling of <b>dendrites</b> is a very helpful tool to develop new biological neuron models. <b>Dendrites</b> are very important because they occupy the most membrane area in many of the neurons and give the neuron an ability to connect to thousands of other cells. Originally the <b>dendrites</b> were thought to have constant conductance and current but now it has been understood that they may have active Voltage-gated ion channels, which influences the firing properties of the neuron and also the response of neuron to synaptic inputs. Many mathematical models have been developed to understand the electric behavior of the <b>dendrites.</b> <b>Dendrites</b> tend to be very branchy and complex, so the compartmental approach to understand the electrical behavior of the <b>dendrites</b> makes it very useful.|$|R
40|$|Explants from {{embryonic}} chick tectum {{maintained in}} culture {{for at least}} two weeks contained presynaptic <b>dendrites,</b> characterised by focal presynaptic specialisations in addition to the usual fine structural features of <b>dendrites.</b> The explants also contained bouton-like structures with both pre- and postsynaptic specialisations, interpreted as the terminal parts and appendages of the presynaptic <b>dendrites.</b> The <b>dendrites</b> and their appendages engaged in various serial synapses including triplet and reciprocal synapses. Although it is known that cells which do not normally have presynaptic <b>dendrites</b> may be induced to develop them under abnormal developmental or pathological conditions, the development of presynaptic <b>dendrites</b> in the present material {{is more likely to be}} a manifestation of organotypic development, since the adult avian tectum normally contains cells with presynaptic <b>dendrites...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{dendritic}} spine (or spine) {{is a small}} membranous protrusion from a neuron's <b>dendrite</b> that typically receives input from a single axon at the synapse. Dendritic spines serve as a storage site for synaptic strength and help transmit electrical signals to the neuron's cell body. Most spines have a bulbous head (the spine head), and a thin neck that connects {{the head of the}} spine to the shaft of the <b>dendrite.</b> The dendrites of a single neuron can contain hundreds to thousands of spines. In addition to spines providing an anatomical substrate for memory storage and synaptic transmission, they may also serve {{to increase the number of}} possible contacts between neurons.|$|E

40|$|Responses evoked in Purkinje cell <b>dendrites</b> by {{parallel}} fibre volleys and climbing fibre impulses were investigated by intra- and extracellular recording from cat cerebellar cortex. The depth distribution of recording sites {{suggested that the}} intracellular recordings were predominantly from proximal <b>dendrites</b> whereas the extracellular recordings were predominantly from distal <b>dendrites.</b> Parallel fibre stimulation evoked monosynaptic excitation and disynaptic inhibition in the <b>dendrites</b> and, at higher strength, prolonged plateau-like responses in distal <b>dendrites</b> but only rarely in proximal <b>dendrites.</b> However, when the inhibitory synapses were blocked with topically applied picrotoxin, {{parallel fibre}} volleys evoked plateau potentials also in proximal <b>dendrites.</b> The duration of the parallel-fibre-evoked plateau potentials in distal <b>dendrites</b> was prolonged by increasing {{the intensity of the}} eliciting stimulus or by increasing the number of stimuli. A similar prolongation in the duration of climbing-fibre-evoked plateau potentials was observed when brief repetitive stimulation was applied to the inferior olive. The investigation provided evidence that under physiological conditions plateau potentials in Purkinje cell <b>dendrites</b> are exclusively evoked by climbing fibre impulses...|$|R

25|$|The {{various types}} of {{voltage-gated}} calcium channels result in two forms of voltage activation: low-voltage-activated (LVA) and high-voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents. In deep cerebellar nuclei, calcium currents are not uniformly distributed along a <b>dendrite.</b> The relative strength of LVA calcium currents are significantly more concentrated at the distal end of dendrites. The uneven distribution of LVA calcium currents suggests {{the important role of}} LVA calcium currents in dendritic integration at synaptic inputs.|$|E
25|$|Insects have {{a complex}} nervous system which {{incorporates}} {{a variety of}} internal physiological information as well as external sensory information. As {{in the case of}} vertebrates, the basic component is the neuron or nerve cell. This is made up of a <b>dendrite</b> with two projections that receive stimuli and an axon, which transmits information to another neuron or organ, like a muscle. As for vertebrates, chemicals (neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine) are released at synapses.|$|E
40|$|Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) may exert contrasting effects depending on its different subcellular sites of action (soma, <b>dendrites,</b> axons). These contrasting effects may explain contradictory findings, for example that BDNF may favour or oppose epileptogenesis. We determined {{the distribution of}} five BDNF splice variants in the soma and <b>dendrites</b> of rat hippocampal principal neurons, after application of stimuli that prompt BDNF mRNA accumulation in <b>dendrites</b> (epileptogenic seizures). Under basal conditions, no BDNF mRNA splice variant was detectable in <b>dendrites,</b> while specific splice variants were found in <b>dendrites</b> in response to epileptogenic seizures. Three h after pilocarpine administration, exon VI and exon II splice variants were found in <b>dendrites,</b> while exons I and IV transcripts displayed a strictly somatic localization. Three h after kainate administration, only exon VI was found in <b>dendrites.</b> These {{data suggest that the}} regulated expression of different splice variants may provide a code to ensure the delivery of BDNF to precise destinations in the cell soma or along the <b>dendrites...</b>|$|R
50|$|Which cells {{contribute}} to the slow field variations {{is determined by the}} geometric configuration of the cells themselves. In some cells, the <b>dendrites</b> face one direction and the soma another, such as the pyramidal cells. This is known as an open field geometrical arrangement. When there is simultaneous activation of the <b>dendrites</b> a strong dipole is produced. In cells where the <b>dendrites</b> are arranged more radially, the potential difference between individual <b>dendrites</b> and the soma tend to cancel out with diametrically opposite <b>dendrites.</b> As a result the net potential difference over the whole cell when the <b>dendrites</b> are simultaneously activated tends to be very small. Thus changes in the local field potential represent simultaneous dendritic events in cells in the open field configuration.|$|R

With regard to the applications, this article mainly focuses on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, catalysis, superhydrophobic surface and surface enhanced fluorescence by using Ag <b>dendrites.</b> The remaining issues of the preparation methods, which impede the practical applications of Ag <b>dendrites,</b> are pointed out to enlighten their future research...|$|R
25|$|The SDS {{model was}} {{intended}} as a computationally simple version of the full Baer and Rinzel model. It was designed to be analytically tractable and have as few free parameters as possible while retaining those of greatest significance, such as spine neck resistance. The model drops the continuum approximation and instead uses a passive <b>dendrite</b> coupled to excitable spines at discrete points. Membrane dynamics in the spines are modelled using integrate and fire processes. The spike events are modelled in a discrete fashion with the wave form conventionally represented as a rectangular function.|$|E
25|$|Action {{potentials}} {{initiated in}} the axon normally travel down the axon {{away from the}} soma. However, {{it is also possible}} for an action potential to travel in the opposite direction, invade the soma, and then travel down the <b>dendrite</b> as a dendritic spike. This retrograde signal provides information to the synapse that the neuron has fired an output. The efficacy of the signal varies among different neuronal types. For example, backward propagation of action potentials is very limited in cerebellar Purkinje cells but is quite prevalent in interneurons of the medium ganglionic layer of the cerebellum-like lobe of some fish.|$|E
25|$|A {{dendritic}} spike is {{initiated in}} the same manner as that of an axonal action potential. Depolarization of the dendritic membrane causes sodium and potassium voltage-gated ion channels to open. The influx of sodium ions causes an increase in voltage. If the voltage increases past a certain threshold, the sodium current activates other voltage-gated sodium channels transmitting a current along the <b>dendrite.</b> Dendritic spikes can be generated through both sodium and calcium voltage-gated channels. Dendritic spikes usually transmit signals at a much slower rate than axonal action potentials. Local voltage thresholds for dendritic spike initiation are usually higher than that of action potential initiation in the axon; therefore, spike initiation usually requires a strong input.|$|E
50|$|Pyramidal neurons, {{like other}} neurons, have {{numerous}} voltage-gated ion channels. In pyramidal cells, {{there is an}} abundance of Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels in the <b>dendrites,</b> and some channels in the soma. Ion channels within pyramidal cell <b>dendrites</b> have different properties from the same ion channel type within the pyramidal cell soma. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in pyramidal cell <b>dendrites</b> are activated by subthreshold EPSPs and by back-propagating action potentials. The extent of back-propagation of action potentials within pyramidal <b>dendrites</b> depends upon the K+ channels. K+ channels in pyramidal cell <b>dendrites</b> provide a mechanism for controlling the amplitude of action potentials.|$|R

25|$|Neurons {{communicate}} with one another via synapses, where the axon terminal or en passant bouton (a type of terminals located {{along the length of the}} axon) of one cell contacts another neuron's <b>dendrite,</b> soma or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus, have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses. Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory and either increase or decrease activity in the target neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically conductive junctions between cells.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} {{is concerned}} with how the brain {{is affected by the}} stimulation of its information processing provided by its surroundings (including the opportunity to interact socially). Brains in richer, more-stimulating environments, have increased numbers of synapses, and the <b>dendrite</b> arbors upon which they reside are more complex. This effect happens particularly during neurodevelopment, but also to a lesser degree in adulthood. With extra synapses there is also increased synapse activity and so increased size and number of glial energy-support cells. Capillary vasculation also is greater to provide the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The neuropil (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands making the cortex thicker. There may also exist (at least in rodents) more neurons.|$|E
25|$|Ventromedial {{nucleus of}} the {{hypothalamus}} (VMN) has long been considered as a sexually dimorphic nucleus. It is an important region for regulating the sexual responses in female rodents. The neurons within VMN have significant estrogen-dependent functional and structural plasticity. The synaptic organization of the VMN is sexually dimorphic. Females have more <b>dendrite</b> chemical synapses within VMN while males have more somatic synapses within that region. In addition, the size of postsynaptic densities of axospinous and axosomatic synapses is sexually dimorphic, with males having larger density than females. Estrogen {{plays an important role}} in modulating the sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity of VMN. Estradiol levels are high on proestrus rats and return to low levels on diestrus rats. The volume of cell bodies within VMN in proestrus rats and male rats is larger than diestrus rats. Also, proestrus rats have significantly higher synapse density in VMN than diestrus rats. Moreover, Gamma-aminobutyric acid plays a role in VMN development such as sexual differentiation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dendrites</b> are {{extensions}} of the cell body of the neuron specialized for receiving and processing {{the vast majority of}} excitatory synaptic inputs. <b>Dendrites</b> exhibit enormously diverse forms. In many cases the shape of the dendritic arbor can be related to the mode of connectivity between neurons, with <b>dendrites</b> often ramifying in characteristic spatial domains where they receive specific inputs. At the ultrastructural level, <b>dendrites</b> are distinct from axons and astroglia processes, having a characteristic composition of subcellular organelles. Synapses occur directly on the shaft of some <b>dendrites,</b> but other <b>dendrites</b> have specialized enlargements and protrusions to receive synaptic input. These synaptic specializations also occur in many different forms. The use of serial electron microscopy to obtain detailed quantitative data on these structures has shown that different synaptic specializations have different intracellular organelles and synaptic compositions. Understanding the structural diversity of both dendritic arbors and synaptic specializations will be essential for understanding the intricacies of dendritic function and the contribution <b>dendrites</b> make to mental processes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dendrites</b> of {{the same}} neuron usually avoid each other. Some neurons also repel similar neurons through dendrite-dendrite {{interaction}} to tile the receptive field. Non-overlapping coverage based on such contact-dependent repulsion requires <b>dendrites</b> to compete for limited space. Here we show that Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) neurons, which tile the larval body wall, grow their <b>dendrites</b> mainly in a two-dimensional (2 D) space on the extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by the epidermis. Removing neuronal integrins or blocking epidermal laminin production causes <b>dendrites</b> to grow into the epidermis, suggesting that integrin-laminin interaction attaches <b>dendrites</b> to the ECM. We further show {{that some of the}} previously identified tiling mutants fail to confine <b>dendrites</b> in a 2 D plane. Expansion of these mutant <b>dendrites</b> in three dimensions results in overlap of dendritic fields. Moreover, overexpression of integrins in these mutant neurons effectively reduces dendritic crossing and restores tiling, revealing a novel mechanism for tiling...|$|R
50|$|Like <b>dendrites</b> in {{most other}} neurons, the <b>dendrites</b> are {{generally}} the input areas of the neuron, while the axon is the neuron’s output. Both axons and <b>dendrites</b> are highly branched. The large amount of branching allows the neuron to send and receive signals to and from many different neurons.|$|R
25|$|Distribution of {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels {{along the}} dendritic membrane plays {{a crucial role}} in a dendrites ability to propagate a signal. High dendritic membrane thresholds often make it harder for initiation of dendritic spikes. However, increased density of voltage-gated sodium channels may reduce the amplitude of a signal needed to initiate a spike. Clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels have been observed at the synapses of the globus pallidus neuron. It has also been demonstrated through dendritic computational models that the threshold amplitude of a synaptic conductance needed to generate a dendritic spike is significantly less if the voltage-gated sodium channels are clustered at the synapse. The same type of voltage-gated channels may differ in distribution between the soma and <b>dendrite</b> within the same neuron. There seems to be no general pattern of distribution for voltage-gated channels within dendrites. Different neuronal dendrites exhibit different density patterns which are subject to change during development and can be modulated by neurotransmitters.|$|E
25|$|A typical neuron {{is divided}} into three parts: the soma or cell body, {{dendrites}}, and axon. The soma is usually compact; the axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it. Dendrites typically branch profusely, getting thinner with each branching, and extending their farthest branches a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock, and can extend for great distances, giving rise to hundreds of branches. Unlike dendrites, an axon usually maintains the same diameter as it extends. The soma may give rise to numerous dendrites, but never to more than one axon. Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites; signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon. A typical synapse, then, is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a <b>dendrite</b> or soma of another. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory. If the net excitation received by a neuron over {{a short period of time}} is large enough, the neuron generates a brief pulse called an action potential, which originates at the soma and propagates rapidly along the axon, activating synapses onto other neurons as it goes.|$|E
500|$|Nedd9 {{expression}} may {{be important}} for recovery from stroke. [...] Nedd9 is upregulated in the neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus after transient global ischemia in rats. Induced Nedd9 is tyrosine phosphorylated, bound to FAK in <b>dendrite</b> and soma of neurons, and promotes neurite outgrowth, contributing into recovery of neurologic function after cerebral ischemia. Nedd9 has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). NEDD9 expression is elevated in human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and in mouse ADPKD models, and ADPKD-prone mice lacking NEDD9 developed a more severe form of ADPKD than those with normal NEDD9.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 Wilfrid Rall, Gordon Shepard, Thomas Reese, and Milton Brightman found a novel pathway, <b>dendrites</b> that {{signaled}} to <b>dendrites.</b> While studying the mammalian olfactory bulb, {{they found that}} there were active <b>dendrites</b> that couple and send signals to each other.

40|$|Axons and <b>dendrites</b> {{of neurons}} {{differ in the}} {{polarity}} orientation of their microtubules. Whereas the polarity orientation of microtubules in axons is uniform, with all plus ends distal, that in <b>dendrites</b> is nonuniform. The mechanisms responsible for establishment and maintenance of microtubule polarity orientation in neuronal processes remain unclear, however. We previously described a culture system in which <b>dendrites</b> of rat cortical neurons convert to axons. In the present study, we examined changes in microtubule polarity orientation in such <b>dendrites.</b> With {{the use of the}} hooking procedure and electron microscopy, we found that microtubule polarity orientation changed from nonuniform to uniform, with a plus end-distal arrangement, in <b>dendrites</b> that gave rise to axons during culture of neurons for 24 h. Microtubule polarity orientation remained nonuniform in <b>dendrites</b> that did not elongate. Axon regeneration at the dendritic tip thus triggered the disappearance of minus end-distal microtubules from <b>dendrites.</b> These minus end-distal microtubules also disappeared from <b>dendrites</b> during axon regeneration in the presence of inhibitors of actin polymerization, suggesting that actin-dependent transport of microtubules is not required for this process and implicating a previously unidentified mechanism in the establishment and maintenance of microtubule polarity orientation in neuronal processes...|$|R
