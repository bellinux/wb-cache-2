500|$|In 1983, Bill Parcells' {{first year}} as head coach, Woolfolk gained 1,225yards from {{scrimmage}} for the Giants (857yards rushing and 368yards receiving) -- more yards than any Giants running back in the previous ten years. [...] He also set the NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 43carries (for 159yards) on November 20, 1983. Woolfolk gained 115yards on 26carries {{in the first half}} alone and said after the game: [...] "I'm not as tired as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> when somebody told me how many carries I had." [...] Ironically, Woolfolk's 43-carry record was broken in 1988 by Jamie Morris, the same player who also broke Woolfolk's career rushing record at the University of Michigan.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1969 film, Yawar Mallku/Sangre de cóndor/Blood of the Condor, Bolivian {{director}} Jorge Sanjinés portrayed Peace Corps {{volunteers in}} the camp as arrogant, ethnocentric, and narrow-minded imperialists out to destroy Indian culture. One particularly powerful scene showed Indians attacking a clinic while the volunteers inside sterilized Indian women against their will. The film {{is thought to be}} at least partially responsible for the expulsion of the Peace Corps from Bolivia in 1971. Peace Corps volunteer Fred Krieger who was serving in Bolivia at the time said, [...] "It was an effective movie – emotionally very arousing – and it directly targeted Peace Corps volunteers. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lynched before getting out of the theatre.

I have so many of his, you know, so that I wouldn't miss one; but still it was one I loved very much, and so I felt that that love made it worth while. That is, I felt that on second thought. At first, Aunt Emmy, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ashamed to offer Miss Mitchell a shabby old book, worn with much reading and all marked over with father's notes and pencillings. I was afraid she would think it queer of me to give her such a present. And yet somehow {{it seemed to me}} that it was better than {{something}} brand new and unmellowed--that old book which father had loved and which I loved. So I gave it to her, and she understood. I think it pleased her so much, the real meaning in it. She said it was like being given something out of another's heart and life.|$|E

5000|$|Still, {{the sea was}} {{not ideal}} for landing craft. The diary of one RCN LCA bowman states: [...] At 12:15 a.m., we were lowered away. It was pretty grim, since {{there was a great}} wind and the davits {{themselves}} were shaking. When we hit the water our LCAs really took a beating... The soldiers were very seasick and for the first time, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a victim. Up in the bow, I swallowed more salt water than I thought existed. However these unfavourable conditions had a beneficial side effect - the enemy relaxed their guard in the belief that a landing in such conditions was not likely and initial resistance proved less than expected.Newer craft were used in the Sicily invasion such as the DUKW amphibious truck; the Landing Craft Infantry (Large) (LCI(L)), and, {{for the first time in}} numbers, the much larger Landing Ship Tank (LST Mk 2). None of these supplanted the LCA in its designed role; none of these new types was intended for the initial assault and the LCA was still vital for first wave transportation on contested shores.|$|E
5000|$|According to the song's co-producer and co-writer Bob Esty, Paul Jabara {{had locked}} Summer in a Puerto Rico hotel {{bathroom}} and {{forced her to}} listen to a cassette of him singing a rough version of [...] "Last Dance." [...] Summer liked the song and Jabara asked Esty to work with him on an arrangement for Summer to make her recording. Esty recalls: [...] I changed some of the chords and extended the 'hook' to repeat three times to finish the last phrase of the chorus. I also added a bridge to build to a climax and suggested a ballad intro à la [...] "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" [...] and another ballad {{in the middle of the}} song building again to a high note for the last chorus ending. To our knowledge, this had never been done in a disco track[...].We did the piano/vocal with Donna and me of the full version including the two ballad sections and the ending in one 'pass'...I recorded the full track in one day, rhythm in the morning, horns and strings during the day. That same night, Giorgio Moroder recorded Donna's vocal exactly as she sang the demo, in two takes, and banning me from attending the session. In spite of the fact Giorgio didn't like the song and didn't want Donna to sing in a full voice style, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> at least credited for co-producing the track and co-writing the song with Paul. He ultimately took credit for it. And Paul Jabara took the Oscar. I learned a bitter lesson from that. Bob Esty ...|$|E
