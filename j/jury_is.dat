5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
5|$|The trial opens as {{originally}} scheduled, {{but the two}} Finley & Figg partners prove unequal to the task. During opening statements, Oscar suffers a myocardial infarction. Wally attempts {{to make light of}} the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading to the need to pick a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> seated and for the first day of testimony. The next day, the recovering alcoholic Figg is nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff Vodka is.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that six-member <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> {{sufficient}} and that five-member <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> not. Verdict unanimity {{is not required}} for twelve-member <b>juries,</b> but <b>is</b> required for six-member juries.|$|R

25|$|Each {{state may}} {{determine}} the extent to which the use of a <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> used. The use of a <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> optional for civil trials in any Australian state. The use of a jury in criminal trials is generally by unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict. Sometimes a state law may allow an accused person to elect to use a judge-only trial rather than the default jury provision.|$|E
2500|$|In Canada, <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> {{also allowed}} to make {{suggestions}} for sentencing periods {{at the time of}} sentencing. [...] The suggestions of the <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor(s) before the sentence is handed down. [...] In a small number of U.S. jurisdictions, including the states of Tennessee and Texas, <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> charged both with the task of finding guilt or innocence as well assessing and fixing sentences.|$|R
50|$|<b>Juries</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} from a <b>jury</b> panel, which <b>is</b> picked at random by the county registrar from the electoral register. The principal statute regulating the selection, obligations and conduct of <b>juries</b> <b>is</b> the <b>Juries</b> Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008, which scrapped the upper age limit of 70. <b>Juries</b> <b>are</b> not paid, nor do they receive travel expenses. They do receive lunch for the days that they are serving; however, for jurors in employment, their employer is required to pay {{them as if they}} were present at work.|$|R
50|$|In June 2008, a grand <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> empaneled to {{consider}} criminal indictments against officials {{involved in the}} firings.

5000|$|Socrates on Trial {{strongly}} encourages audience participation. During Socrates’ day, <b>juries</b> <b>were</b> {{much larger}} than they <b>are</b> today. <b>Juries</b> of several hundred, or even several thousand, were not uncommon.

25|$|Juries do {{not make}} a {{recommendation}} as {{to the length of}} sentence, except for parole ineligibility for second-degree murder (but the judge is not bound by the jury's recommendation, and the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> not required to make a recommendation).|$|E

25|$|When an {{insufficient}} number of summoned jurors {{appear in court}} to handle a matter, the law in many jurisdictions empowers the jury commissioner or other official convening the jury to involuntarily impress bystanders {{in the vicinity of}} the place where the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> to be convened to serve on the jury.|$|E

25|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause {{encompasses}} four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, {{and multiple}} punishment {{in the same}} indictment.

25|$|The {{example of}} early 18th century England legal reform shows how civic lotteries {{can be used}} to {{organize}} the duties and responsibilities of the citizen body in relation to the state. It established the impartiality and neutrality of juries as well as reiterating the dual nature of the citizen-state relationship. The need for a leader/organizer in a <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> very important, {{in order to get a}} proper and agreed verdict.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of each event, the Festival's board of directors appoints the juries who hold sole responsibility for choosing which films will receive a Cannes award. Jurors are chosen {{from a wide range of}} international artists, based on their body of work and respect from their peers.

25|$|The Judiciary Law {{states that}} all litigants (who {{have the right}} to a jury trial) {{have the right to}} juries {{selected}} from a fair cross section of the community and that all eligible citizens shall have both the opportunity and the obligation to serve. Potential jurors are randomly selected from lists of registered voters, holders of a driver's licenses or ID issued by the Division of Motor Vehicles, New York state income tax filers, recipients of unemployment insurance or family assistance, and from volunteers. The grand <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> organized pursuant to article 190 of the Criminal Procedure Law.|$|E
25|$|In a sense, {{the concept}} of being judged by one's peers exists on both {{the first and second}} tier of the Norwegian court system: In Tingretten, one judge and two lay judges preside, and in Lagmannsretten three judges and four lay judges preside (if a <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> not used). The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification, and {{represent}} the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the Supreme Court, only trained lawyers are seated.|$|E
25|$|Leibniz {{also wrote}} a short paper, Primae veritates, first {{published}} by Louis Couturat in 1903 (pp.518–523) summarizing {{his views on}} metaphysics. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90. Couturat's reading {{of this paper was}} the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> still out.|$|E
