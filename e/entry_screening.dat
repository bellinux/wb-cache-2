5000|$|Semple {{became known}} to a lay {{audience}} {{while working as}} a Boston Marathon race co-director. He had been in the long-time habit of physically attacking those he perceived to be [...] "non serious" [...] runners competing in the race, whether officially entered or running the course unofficially. In a 1968 interview with Sports Illustrated, he called them [...] "These screwballs! These weirdies! These MIT boys! These Tufts characters! These Harvard guys!" [...] According to fellow race official Will Cloney: [...] "He hurls not only his body at them, but also a rather choice array of epithets... Jock's method of attack is apt to vary." [...] In 1957, Semple had narrowly escaped arrest for assault after attempting to tackle a runner in swim fins and a snorkeling mask. In the 1967 Boston Marathon, one woman, Bobbi Gibb, ran and finished unofficially, as she had the previous year, because women were not allowed to participate. When another, Kathrine Switzer, entered the race officially, through an [...] "oversight" [...] in the <b>entry</b> <b>screening</b> process, Semple tried to stop her as she ran. Switzer wrote in her memoir [...] "A big man, a huge man, with bared teeth was set to pounce, and before I could react he grabbed my shoulder and flung me back, screaming, 'Get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers!'" [...] Switzer's boyfriend managed to shove Semple aside. Photographs of Semple attempting to rip Switzer's number off were widespread in the media.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of <b>entry</b> <b>screening</b> for tuberculosis and biannual follow-up screening among new immigrants in The Netherlands. To achieve this, the present authors analysed screening, prevalence and incidence data of 68, 122 immigrants, who were followed for 29 months. Patients diagnosed within 5 months and 6 - 29 months after <b>entry</b> <b>screening</b> were considered to be detected at entry and during the follow-up period, respectively. Coverage of the second to fifth screening rounds was 59, 46, 36 and 34 %, respectively. Yield of <b>entry</b> <b>screening</b> was 119 per 100, 000 individuals, and prevalence at entry was 131 per 100, 000. Average yield of follow-up screening was highest among immigrants with abnormalities on chest radiography (CXR) at entry (902 per 100, 000 individuals). When excluding these, yield of follow-up screening was 9, 37 and 97 per 100, 000 screenings for immigrants from countries with tuberculosis incidences of 200 per 100, 000, respectively. The incidence during follow-up in individuals with a normal CXR was 11, 58 and 145 per 100, 000 person-yrs follow-up in these groups.

In China, age distribution and transmission dynamic characteristics were similar to those in Northern Hemisphere temperate countries. The epidemic was focused in children, with an effective reproduction number of ≈ 1. 2 – 1. 3.

40|$|Background: In {{the early}} stages of Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009, border control {{measures}} were taken by quarantine stations to block the entry of infected individuals into Japan and community containment measures were implemented to prevent the spreading. The objectives of this study were to describe these measures and the characteristics of infected individuals, and to assess the measures ’ effectiveness. Methodology/Principal Findings: Border control and community containment measures implemented from April to June (Period I: April 28 –May 21, Period II: May 22 –June 18) 2009 were described. Number of individuals identified and disease characteristics were analyzed. For <b>entry</b> <b>screening,</b> a health declaration form and an infrared thermoscanner were used to detect symptomatic passengers. Passengers indicated for the rapid influenza test underwent the test followed by RT-PCR. Patients positive for H 1 N 1 were isolated, and close contacts were quarantined. Entry cards were handed out to all asymptomatic passengers informing them about how to contact a health center in case they developed symptoms. Nine individuals were identified by <b>entry</b> <b>screening</b> and 1 during quarantine to have Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009. Health monitoring by health centers was performed in period I for passengers arriving from affected countries and in period II for those who had come into contact with the individuals identified by <b>entry</b> <b>screening.</b> Health monitoring identified 3 infected individuals among 129, 546 in Period I and 5 among 746 in Period II.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Entry</b> <b>screening</b> {{tends to}} start with a search for febrile {{international}} passengers, and infrared thermoscanners have been employed for fever screening in Japan. We aimed to retrospectively assess the feasibility of detecting influenza cases based on fever screening as a sole measure. Methods Two datasets were collected at Narita International Airport during the 2009 pandemic. The first contained confirmed influenza cases (n = 16) whose diagnosis took place at the airport during {{the early stages of the}} pandemic, and the second contained a selected and suspected fraction of passengers (self-reported or detected by an infrared thermoscanner; n = 1, 049) screened from September 2009 to January 2010. The sensitivity of fever (38. 0 °C) for detecting H 1 N 1 - 2009 was estimated, and the diagnostic performances of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting hyperthermia at cut-off levels of 37. 5 °C, 38. 0 °C and 38. 5 °C were also estimated. Results The sensitivity of fever for detecting H 1 N 1 - 2009 cases upon arrival was estimated to be 22. 2 % (95 % confidence interval: 0, 55. 6) among nine confirmed H 1 N 1 - 2009 cases, and 55. 6 % of the H 1 N 1 - 2009 cases were under antipyretic medications upon arrival. The sensitivity and specificity of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting hyperthermia ranged from 50. 8 - 70. 4 % and 63. 6 - 81. 7 %, respectively. The positive predictive value appeared to be as low as 37. 3 - 68. 0 %. Conclusions The sensitivity of <b>entry</b> <b>screening</b> is a product of the sensitivity of fever for detecting influenza cases and the sensitivity of the infrared thermoscanners in detecting fever.
