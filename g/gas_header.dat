40|$|Safe {{operation}} of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities require design consideration {{of a sudden}} catastrophic loss of vacuum (SCLV) adjacent with liquid helium (LHe) vessels and subsequent dangers. An experiment is discussed to test the longitudinal effects of SCLV along the beam line {{of a string of}} scaled SRF cavities. Each scaled cavity includes one segment of beam tube within a LHe vessel containing 2 K saturated LHe, and a riser pipe connecting the LHe vessel to a common <b>gas</b> <b>header.</b> At the beam tube inlet is a fast acting solenoid valve to simulate SCLV and a high/low range orifice plate flow-meter to measure air influx to the cavity. The <b>gas</b> <b>header</b> exit also has an orifice plate flow-meter to measure helium venting the system at the relief pressure of 0. 4 MPa. Each cavity is instrumented with Validyne pressure transducers and Cernox thermometers. The purpose of this experiment is to quantify the time required to spoil the beam vacuum and the effects of transient heat and mass transfer on the helium system. Heat transfer data is expected to reveal a longitudinal effect due to the geometry of the experiment. Details of the experimental design criteria and objectives are presented.

40|$|In {{industrial}} {{fuel gas}} preparation, several compositional properties must be controlled within specified limits. This allows client plants {{to burn the}} gas safely and with consistent heat production. The variables to be controlled are the higher heating value (HHV), Wobbe index (WI), flame speed index (FSI), and header pressure. A plant in which six feed gasses are blended is considered. Four of the feeds are well-defined makeup streams (costly but always available) {{and the other two}} are byproducts that would otherwise be flared. The six feed rates comprise the manipulated variables (MVs) used to regulate the four controlled variables (CVs) while minimising the cost of the gas blend. The control system must compensate for feed composition and fuel gas demand variability. The development and validation of an industrial fuel <b>gas</b> <b>header</b> model is described, followed by a simulation study comparing three Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies. It is shown that when iterative linearisation is used to update the prediction model and real-time optimisation (RTO) is used to update the CV and MV targets used in the MPC cost function, the plant is driven reliably to the optimal steady-state. ai 201...|$|E
40|$|Mine {{ventilation}} systems provide air to underground mines through large fan systems {{and a series}} of raises and tunnels. Doors and barricades are put in to direct the flow of fresh air to the places it is needed in a mine. At present, the solution to meeting TLV’s limits has been to increase the volume of air entering the mine to dilute it appropriately. As the pressure to improve the underground environment has been mounting the idea of magnetizing fuels for providing more complete combustion has been a potential solution that needed a fresh look. Demystifying magnetization and how it works to provide more complete combustion has been the major stumbling block to understanding the value of this idea. This paper describes two experiments that were done {{over the last two years}} to improve our understanding of how magnetization can make a potential difference. The first experiment involved testing a diesel engine in a controlled environment without and with magnets. The results while not totally conclusive did indicate something significant was happening. Due to these results a different experiment needed to be done on a larger scale. It was decided that a larger quantity of fuel being combusted continuously would speed getting results. Therefore, a heater house used for winter heating of mine ventilation air was selected. The results of magnetizing natural <b>gas</b> <b>headers</b> in a heater house were substantial. Over a two-year test period, a total of 11. 95 % less gas was used to heat the mine air. This paper will provide background for the reader into fuel magnetization theory, the initial diesel combustion experiment, the McCreedy East mine experience and then discuss the potential of this exciting new technology and future work that will be undertaken...|$|R
50|$|Small boats with {{outboard}} engines and PWCs tend to ingest water {{simply because they}} run in and around it. During a rollover, or when a wave washes over the craft, its engine can hydrolock, though severe damage is rare due to the special air intakes and low rotating inertia of small marine engines. Inboard marine engines have a different vulnerability as these often have their cooling water mixed with the exhaust <b>gases</b> in the <b>header</b> to quiet the engine. Rusted out exhaust headers or lengthy periods of turning the starter can cause water to build up in the exhaust line to the point it back-flows through the exhaust manifold and fills the cylinders.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the premature failure of a gas-header at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) natural gas production facility. A wide variety of possible failure mechanisms were considered: design of the header, deviation from normal pipe alloy composition, physical orientation of the <b>header,</b> <b>gas</b> composition and flow rate, type of corrosion, protectiveness of the interior oxide film, time of wetness, and erosion-corrosion. The failed header was examined using metallographic techniques, scanning electron microscopy, and microanalysis. A comparison of the failure site and an analogous site that had not failed, but exhibited similar metal thinning was also performed. From these studies {{it was concluded that}} failure resulted from erosion-corrosion, and that design elements of the header and orientation with respect to gas flow contributed to the mass loss at the failure point...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} {{fuel gas}} preparation, {{there are several}} compositional properties that must be controlled within specified limits. This allows client plants to use the fuel gas mixture safely without having to adjust and control the composition themselves. The variables to be controlled are the Higher Heating Value (HHV), Wobbe Index (WI), Flame Speed Index (FSI), and Pressure (P). These variables are controlled by adjusting the volumetric flow rates of several inlet gas streams of which some are makeup streams (always available) and some are wild streams that vary in composition and availability (by-products of plants). The inlet streams need to be adjusted in the correct ratios to keep all the controlled variables (CVs) within limits while minimising {{the cost of the}} gas blend. Furthermore, the controller needs to compensate for fluctuations in inlet stream compositions and total fuel gas demand (the total discharge from the header). This dissertation describes the modelling and model validation of an industrial fuel <b>gas</b> <b>header</b> as well as a simulation study of three different Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies for controlling the system while minimising the overall operating cost.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. This {{research}} {{work has been}} carried out to enhance the performance of the membrane unit of an Autothermal Reforming (ATR) plant. The plant in question refers to the ATR plant of one of the leading petrochemical industries in South Africa. The membrane is used to separate hydrogen from a feed of hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture (reformed gas) containing gases such as carbon dioxide and small amounts of methane, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, water, ammonia and hydrogen cyanide. The exit streams from the membrane are permeate (hydrogen gas) and non-permeate (synthesis gas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) with trace quantities of the other aforementioned gases. This dissertation investigated into the causes of decreasing membrane hydrogen (permeate) purity and insufficient membrane capacity to achieve the required synthesis gas (non-permeate) ratio. High differential pressure across the membranes as well the presence of ammonia and water in the feed gas to the membrane fibres were some of the causes of the membranes' low performance. Others include high speed of the membrane feed gas, the presence of strongly adsorbed gas - methane and insufficient heating of the feed gas by the preheaters. These led to broken and twisted membrane fibres. As a result, carbon monoxide and other constituents of the feed slipped into the permeate stream. From the {{research work}}, ways of enhancing the performance of the membrane unit were proffered. They include integrating a Pressure Swing Adsorption unit (upstream) with the membrane unit, recycling the permeate back to the feed stream, increasing the temperature of the feed gas and lowering the differential pressure across the membranes. Furthermore, the condensate should be prevented from getting to the membrane fibres by installing a drying unit, a demister unit or drains in the membrane feed <b>gas</b> <b>header.</b> In addition, periodic maintenance and backwashing should be carried out on the membranes. However, recommendations were made on further study regarding the cost impacts of implementing the ways of optimizing the membrane unit and simulation of the membrane unit's operation. The latter was suggested in order to obtain the process variables and parameters for improving the performance of the unit in question. Master...|$|E
40|$|Delivering <b>gas</b> {{to final}} <b>header</b> storage tanks or end user {{locations}} {{require the use}} of pipelines and a means of transporting the gas through the lines. A gas compressor is employed satisfactorily to such needs. Gas compressor types vary (from the dynamic type to the positive displacement type) and which to apply for a particular service requirement will depend on the process conditions. For high pressure delivery, and low gas flow volume process conditions, the positive displacement type of reciprocating compressors is often the choice. Matching the compressor equipment manufacturer’s available equipment designs to the various process conditions involves several parameters and requires a detailed selection process conducted by the Engineer. A computer program in Microsoft Excel TM to handle the selection process is described here, with the equations to develop one...|$|R
