5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2009 after South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{approached}} Obsidian {{about making a}} role-playing game designed to look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> television series. Parker and Stone were involved throughout the game's production: they wrote its script, consulted on the design, and as in the television program they voiced many of the characters. The Stick of Truths production was turbulent; following the bankruptcy of the original publisher, THQ, {{the rights to the}} game were acquired by Ubisoft in early 2013, and its release date was postponed several times from its initial date in March 2013 to its eventual release in March 2014, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E
60|$|But little Miss Julia, {{though she}} had not <b>exactly</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> nature of Mr. Thorne's attention, was {{accustomed}} to be played with by gentlemen, and did not relish {{the idea of being}} sent so soon to her aunt.|$|R

25|$|Finance Chairman is {{appointed}} <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Executive Director. The main duty of this {{officer is}} {{to raise funds for}} the Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|A second golden spike, <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{one from}} the ceremony, was cast and {{engraved}} at the same time. It was held, unknown to the public, by the Hewes family until 2005. This second spike is now on permanent display, along with Thomas Hill's famous painting The Last Spike, at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento.|$|E
30|$|Arguing <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> {{proof of}} Lemma  5.2 in [6] (see also Lemma  22.20 in [40]), {{we get the}} {{following}} result.|$|R
60|$|Felix went back, {{flushed with}} gratification, and yet, {{to a certain}} degree, with confusion, and not <b>exactly</b> <b>liking</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} of being interrogated {{as to what the}} Bishop had said to him: indeed, he never told the whole of it to any one but Cherry. Somehow, though Wilmet was his counsellor and mainstay, Geraldine was the sharer of all those confidences that came spontaneously out of the full but reserved heart.|$|R
50|$|One day Rameshan {{happens to}} see {{the body of a}} person killed in a road accident. <b>The</b> person looks <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> him. <b>The</b> rest of the movie is about the mystery {{associated}} with the dead man.|$|R
25|$|He next ran the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park {{which ended}} up being <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Preakness for him. Got in a speed duel on a sloppy track, stuck on the rail and Exaggerator took off to win. He took yet another rest and ran in the Pennsylvania Derby. Finally on a fast track {{for the first time}} since May, {{everyone}} thought this would be the his race to win but he faded to sixth.|$|E
25|$|On {{opening night}} October 9, 2010, the Canucks {{revealed}} jerseys they would wear for select games during their 40th Anniversary season. They look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> jerseys the team wore {{in their early}} years, only {{with the addition of}} Reebok manufacturing the jerseys. The jerseys sport a 40th Anniversary patch on the upper-right chest commemorating their 40th season. Just like the early years, they also bear no player names, only numbers, with permission from the NHL.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Humble Android Bundle 5 in March 2013, the site announced new weekly sales that feature the same pay-what-you-want for a single title, starting with the game Bastion. As with the regular bundles, each weekly sale has several tiered payment options. Aside from only lasting one week instead of two, running consecutively with main bundles, and being based on a singular theme (often a particular developer's games), the sales work <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> bundles.|$|E

50|$|Angélica Vale, {{the star}} of La fea más bella, the second Mexican version of Betty la fea, appears in this episode as a {{character}} who looks <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Lety, <b>the</b> character she played on the aforementioned show.|$|R
30|$|MTS 2 element behaves <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> HYTCOQ but <b>the</b> {{others are}} rather worse {{although}} they are curved and therefore well suited for this example.|$|R
25|$|Promotion is {{effected}} {{by turning the}} piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promoting a piece {{has the effect of}} changing how that piece moves. See below. For example, promoting a kirin turns it into a lion, and thereafter it behaves <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> original lion, even for the lion-trading rules. (Which can be a reason to defer promotion of a kirin.) A rook obtained by promoting a gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still promote (to dragon horse), while the former cannot.|$|E
25|$|With such {{a limited}} time frame to use its budget, the Japanese Navy could not afford the time to design a new ship. Therefore, the {{blueprints}} for the previous Momo-class destroyers were distributed to each shipyard, with the instructions that identical ships be produced, except with sturdier armor and bow construction. Experience with extended overseas deployment in World War I had taught the Japanese Navy that the construction of its destroyers needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. The result was a ship which looked physically almost <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Momo class, but was roughly 15 tons heavier in displacement.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} large {{reference}} to this monument and the laborers who built it in Victoria Hislop's book The Return. A number of rock crosses, free-standing outdoor stone crosses {{are to be found}} in Kerala churches of southern India, many of them from pre-Portuguese times that look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Valle de los Caídos rock cross but much smaller, of a height of 15–35ft. But it is possible that these free standing pillars or Nazraney Sthambas employing the socket and cylinder technique to fit the shaft to the base piece and the arms to the shaft and finally the capital to the arms, altogether a four-piece work of precise architecture may have influenced the Spanish missionaries and scholars.|$|E
50|$|The fifth {{episode is}} Letter by Letter, {{and it is}} <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same <b>like</b> <b>the</b> second challenge.|$|R

25|$|The {{exterior}} of the dorms for habitual sex offenders where Father Joe lives was actually an apartment complex in Vancouver that was slated for demolition while the production crew were filming there. Snow {{that can be seen}} outside the dorms was actually fake snow that was imported by the crew and fabricated by the film's Special Effects Department. Bill Roe and Mark Freeborn worked together to create a creepy green glow on the location using green lights. The production crew also created their own factory smoke for chimneys in the background, as Carter came to the opinion that the smoking chimneys made the location look like London. The interior of Joe's apartment was another set and was <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> real apartment except that it was slightly bigger. A trans-light was incorporated into the set to resemble daylight visible through a window of the apartment. The set also had a porch that was used for some shots in the scene where Mulder and Scully were outside the apartment. Additional filming was done in Coquitlam, another Vancouver suburb, at Riverview Hospital's Unit 8 building.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling {{might be taken}} to mean fractal dimensions measure density, {{but that is not}} so; the two are not strictly correlated. Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity. These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might {{hope to be able to}} measure their length or slope, as with ordinary lines. But we cannot do either of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary lines lack. The self-similarity lies in the infinite scaling, and the detail in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is undefined because the curves are theoretical constructs that never stop repeating themselves. Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be characterized by finding their lengths or slopes. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1938 Hordern's {{father had}} sold the family home and had bought a cottage in Holt, near Bath, Somerset. The {{arrangement}} was convenient for the young actor, who used the premises as a base while he appeared in shows with the Rapier Players. [...] One such piece was an adaption of [...] Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm, which starred Mabel Constanduros, who had adapted the book with Gibbons' permission. Hordern was cast in the supporting role of Seth, a part he described as being fun to perform. The modernised script was [...] "adored" [...] by the cast, according to Hordern, but loathed by the audience who {{expected it to be}} <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E
5000|$|Cher [...] "Cheer" [...] Leader is a {{cheerleader}} in Mr. Mufflin's class. She is a triplet and sometimes appears with her 2 other cheerleader sisters, who look <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> her. <b>The</b> triplets were voiced by Kari Wahlgren in [...] "Fanboy Stinks", but Cher is voiced by Candi Milo {{in all other}} appearances.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} know," [...] said Jumper, [...] "that Snipper has a cousin who looks almost <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> him with <b>the</b> {{exception}} of two white bars on each wing. He {{is called the}} White-winged Crossbill." ...|$|R
50|$|Rose, Jackie, and the Doctor {{visit the}} British Museum where Mickey has {{discovered}} {{a statue of}} the goddess Fortuna from second-century Rome, which looks <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> Rose. So <b>the</b> Doctor and Rose head off for Rome.|$|R
500|$|The oratorio spans eleven {{movements}} {{in two parts}} to be performed {{before and after the}} sermon, 1–6 before the sermon and 7–11 after the sermon. It takes about half an hour to perform. The title on the first page of the autograph reads: [...] "J.J." [...] is short for [...] "Jesu juva" [...] (Jesus, help), a formula which Bach and others often wrote {{at the beginning of a}} sacred piece. The title in Latin translates to [...] "Oratorio for the feast of the Ascension of Christ", and the scoring in a mixture of French and Italian names the parts and instruments as four vocal parts, three trumpets (Tr), timpani, two flauti traversi (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vn), viola (Va) and basso continuo (Bc) by Bach. The voices are soprano, alto, tenor and bass, forming a four-part choir (SATB). The work is festively scored, <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Christmas Oratorio.|$|E
500|$|Moreover, Michael {{would not}} be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 {{counterpart}} who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield. The Dr. Loomis character was also to be more intertwined with that of Michael; Zombie reasoned that the character's role in the original was [...] "showing up merely to say something dramatic". Although Zombie added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched). Production officially began on January 29, 2007. Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask and commented, [...] "It looks perfect, <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> original. Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good". Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original Halloween.|$|E
500|$|Dodner {{said that}} during {{development}} of the game, she travelled to New Zealand once a month with builds of the game for the filmmakers to play, and on which to give their feedback, and that in total, EA had acquired {{a quarter of a}} million different assets from the production. Schofield further pointed out [...] "we even hired the same stunt doubles from the movie to help us render the most realistic movements in the game." [...] Dobner also said [...] "we want the game to not just look like the films but to be <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> films." [...] She commented that no details in the game were made up; [...] "when we were reproducing Minas Tirith [...] we felt the team would benefit from being able to see and feel a piece of the actual movie set. Unfortunately, the set had already been dismantled. So, while in New Zealand, I searched the various warehouses to find remnants of the dismantled set. After much work, I returned to San Francisco proudly bearing four bricks from the Minas Tirith set." ...|$|E

50|$|The new object 'porsche911' {{started out}} <b>exactly</b> <b>like</b> 'sportsCar', but <b>the</b> last message changed {{the value of}} its 'name' slot. Note that both still have exactly the same slots even though one of them has a {{different}} value.|$|R
