40|$|Many Decision Analysis {{interventions}} can {{be thought}} of as helping people to discuss what constitutes value for their organization. One approach to Decision Analysis which takes this view particularly seriously is Decision Conferencing, where valuations assessed locally within particular organizational units may require the assessment of “within-criterion weights” to arrive at a <b>global</b> <b>value</b> <b>scale.</b> The Within-criterion weighting (WCW) process presupposes that organizational preferences can be represented as an additive value model, and as such, the formal conditions for the validity of the approach echo the standard conditions underlying additive separability in Multi-Attribute Value Theory. However, in WCW the dimensions on which the objects of choice are assessed correspond to the organizational unit doing the assessment, rather than organizational objectives. We illustrate the significance of this point by developing an error model approach to exploring a key structuring decision in a decision conferencing intervention which has no natural multi-attribute interpretation...|$|E

The pilot study utilized NEOWAVE to model propagation of tsunamis {{across the ocean}} and inundation at the shores of Pago Pago, which is home to key infrastructure of the territory. While the framework is compact and computationally efficient, it takes into account important near-field sources along the Tonga-Kermadec trench that significantly influence the 100 and 500 -year inundation. The annual exceedance probability of the earthquake is determined from either the moment magnitude, Mw, or the observed rate of occurrence. The regional rate of Mw 9 + earthquakes is derived from observed <b>global</b> <b>values</b> <b>scaled</b> by local tectonic parameters such as the relative length, convergence rate, and obliquity of convergence of the fault; the rate of Mw 7. 3 - 8. 9 earthquakes {{is based on the}} global Gutenberg-Richter rate scaled by local tectonic parameters except for Mw 7. 3 - 7. 4 and 8. 0 - 8. 4, which are functions of the local observed values in historical events. A sensitivity analysis shows that tsunami inundation from far-field, Pacific Rim sources only have secondary effects in the probabilistic framework. The modeled far-field tsunamis with the most impact on American Samoa provide a basis for emergency response in the case of large Mw 9 + earthquakes in the those regions. The 100 and 500 -year inundation zones provide a rational account of the exposure to tsunamis, and the analysis lays for the groundwork for conducting a full regional PTHA of American Samoa...|$|R

40|$|As a stark {{contrast}} to the diminishing media profile of the UN climate change talks, the global manufacturers appear to have become more carbon aware than ever before. Carbon audits have been carried out within many corporations to assess the carbon intensity of production processes. This is partly to address cost issues of the present (i. e. the recent rise in fossil fuel prices) and of the future (e. g. new carbon related taxes and trade tariffs). Moreover, the adoption of low carbon, clean manufacturing processes has become an increasingly prominent part of branding for many products, which could affect market share and business performance in ways that go beyond questions of cost competitiveness. How will this carbon awareness affect the configuration of the <b>value</b> chains of <b>global</b> manufacturing? Will the individual manufacturers' decisions lead to an effective reduction of total carbon emissions at the <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain <b>scale?</b> Our paper aims to answer these questions through developing a theoretical model and testing it empirically through case studies of <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains. The model accounts explicitly costs of energy, carbon, other intermediate inputs and primary inputs in the production and transport of each component, product assembly and delivery to the market. Much work has been done on the value chain location problem - e. g. on the production unbundling among different countries from a macro-economic perspective, or on operations management at the microscopic or individual manufacturer level. It is only until recently that the economic and technology aspects have been combined in the study of <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains (for example in the paper by Baldwin and Venables in last year's ERSA Congress). The appropriate spatial scale for our research questions would appear to be at a meso-level: i. e. the model goes beyond the micro-level operational analysis of a single plant to cover the entire value chain for a given product, but does not cover the full interactions at the macro level. This perspective is relatively rare in the literature and provides a tool that connects the micro level and macro level perspectives...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} {{theoretical}} framework to explain and predict governance patterns in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains. It draws on three streams of literature, transaction costs economics, production networks, and technological capability and firm-level learning to identify three variables that play {{a large role in}} determining how <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains are governed. These are 1) the complexity of transactions, 2) the ability to codify transactions, and 3) the capabilities in the supply-base. The theory predicts how governance patterns in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains are expected to change in accordance with these variables. The paper highlights the dynamism and complexity of <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains through four brief industry case studies: apparel, bicycles, horticulture and electronics. A parsimonious theory cannot explain and predict all outcomes. Institutions, geographic and social contexts and path dependence have profound effects on the governance and change in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains. Nevertheless, the theory advances previous formulations of <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain theory.

40|$|PURPOSE – The {{main purpose}} of this article is to {{identify}} some emergent issues when sustainability is introduced into <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains. These issues deal with the conditions under which a sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain might gain international competitiveness. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – An exploratory research was conducted, based on a case study. The main players of the JOBEK's <b>Global</b> <b>Value</b> Chain were identified and interviews were carried out with representatives of these players. A thematic content analysis was developed, supported by Atlas TI software, using interview data and documents. FINDINGS – Three main themes have emerged, which can be considered as underlying issues of an emerging concept that the authors call the “sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain”. These are: bargaining power between the chain's players; a differentiation strategy along the <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain; and a collaborative awareness-building process along the <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – Although the findings result from a single case study, the characteristics of this case have allowed the authors to suggest an emergent concept for the field of international business: the concept of a sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. This has implications for the development of a new research field and for the introduction of some ethical concerns into this field. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – Managers of organizations that participate in sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains may consider the emerging concepts and their interrelationships as a guideline for strategic decision-making. In particular, managers need to be aware of how the relationships between power balance, CSR product differentiation strategies and awareness building may influence the competitiveness of their sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – The article proposes the emergence of a new concept that has important ethical implications for international business: the sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. The authors suggest that the further development of this new concept is likely to stimulate the development of an emergent research field. Luciano Barin Cruz and Dirk Michael Boeh...|$|R

40|$|Histories. (Under the {{direction}} of Thomas M. Conte.) Value prediction is a speculative technique to break true data dependencies by using history to predict values before they are computed. Previous research focused on exploiting two types of value locality (computation-based and context-based) in the local value history, which is the value sequence produced by the same instruction that is being predicted. Besides local value history, value locality also exists in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> history, which is the value sequence produced by all dynamic instructions according to their execution order. In this thesis, {{a new type of}} value locality, computational locality in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> history is studied. A prediction scheme, called gDiff, is designed to exploit one special and most common case of this computational model, the stride-based computation, in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> history. Experiments show that there exists very strong stride type of locality in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> sequences and ideally the gDiff predictor can achieve 73 % prediction accuracy for all value producing instructions without any hybrid scheme, much higher than local stride and local context prediction schemes.

40|$|Galaxy {{counts and}} recent {{measurements}} of the luminosity density in the near-infrared (NIR) have indicated {{the possibility that the}} local universe may be under-dense on scales of several hundred megaparsecs. The presence of a large-scale under-density in the local universe could introduce significant biases into the interpretation of cosmological observables, and, in particular, into the inferred effects of dark energy on the expansion rate. Here we measure the K-band luminosity density as a function of redshift to test for such a local under-density. In this effort, we combine photometry from UKIDSS and 2 MASS with redshifts from the SDSS, 2 DFGRS, 6 DFGRS, 2 MR, and GAMA surveys. We find that the overall shape of the z= 0 rest-frame K-band luminosity function (M* = - 22. 15 +/- 0. 04 and alpha = - 1. 02 +/- 0. 03) appears to be relatively constant as a function of environment and redshift out to z ~ 0. 2. We find a local (z 0. 1. This suggests that the stellar mass density as a function of redshift follows a similar trend. Assuming that luminous matter traces the underlying dark matter distribution, this implies that the local mass density of the universe may be lower than the <b>global</b> <b>value</b> on a <b>scale</b> and amplitude sufficient to introduce significant biases into the determination of basic cosmological observables, such as the expansion rate.
