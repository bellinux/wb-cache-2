5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn <b>decisions</b> of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court <b>decisions</b> as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the <b>decisions</b> of the Oregon Supreme Court for <b>decisions</b> based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and <b>decisions</b> of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
