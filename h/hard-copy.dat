Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the <b>hard-copy</b> of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make.

25|$|Because {{the game}} {{could only be}} played during certain {{predetermined}} hours due to constraints imposed {{by the use of}} SoundLink content, game data was saved to 8M Memory Packs as temporary files that were originally intended to be deleted and over-written with later game data.

50|$|Soil survey, soil mapping, is {{the process}} of {{classifying}} soil types and other soil properties in a given area and geo-encoding such information.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the merging of}} the two fields of Coulomb drag and mesoscopic physics. The thesis presents a theory for Coulomb drag between two mesoscopic systems based on linear-response theory. The formalism expresses the drag in terms of either scattering matrices and wave functions or Green functions, and its range of validity covers both ballistic and disordered phase-coherent systems. The consequences are worked out either by analytic means, such as the random matrix theory, or by numerical simulations. The formalism is applied to i) drag between mesoscopic quantum wires and ii) drag between mesoscopic quantum dots. In these systems {{it is found that}} for even weak disorder the mesoscopic sample-to-sample fluctuations of the drag conductance can be of the order of - or even exceed - the mean value. Depending on the particular disorder configuration this is giving rise to a possible sign change of the induced current. Comment: Ph. D.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermal equilibrium properties of kinks in a classical ^ 4 field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. From large scale Langevin simulations we identify the temperature below which a dilute gas description of kinks is valid. The standard dilute gas/WKB description {{is shown to}} be remarkably accurate below this temperature. At higher, "intermediate" temperatures, where kinks still exist, this description breaks down. By introducing a double Gaussian variational ansatz for the eigenfunctions of the statistical transfer operator for the system, {{we are able to}} study this region analytically. In particular, our predictions for the number of kinks and the correlation length are in agreement with the simulations. The double Gaussian prediction for the characteristic temperature at which the kink description ultimately breaks down is also in accord with the simulations. We also analytically calculate the internal energy and demonstrate that the peak in the specific heat near the kink characteristic temperature is indeed due to kinks. In the neighborhood of this temperature there appears to be an intricate energy sharing mechanism operating between nonlinear phonons and kinks.

40|$|We have {{exploited}} {{a variety}} of techniques to study the universality and stability of the scaling properties of Harper's equation, the equation for a particle moving on a tight-binding square lattice {{in the presence of a}} gauge field, when coupling to next nearest sites is added. We find, from numerical and analytical studies, that the scaling behavior of the total width of the spectrum and the multifractal nature of the spectrum are unchanged, provided the next nearest neighbor coupling terms are below a certain threshold value. The full square symmetry of the Hamiltonian is not required for criticality, but the square diagonals should remain as reflection lines. A bicritical line is found at the boundary between the region in which the nearest neighbor terms dominate and the region in which the next nearest neighbor terms dominate. On the bicritical line a different critical exponent for the width of the spectrum and different multifractal behavior are found. In the region in which the next nearest neighbor terms dominate the behavior is still critical if the Hamiltonian is invariant under reflection in the directions parallel to the sides of the square, but a new length scale enters, and the behavior is no longer universal but shows strongly oscillatory behavior. For a flux per unit cell equal to $ 1 /q$ the measure of the spectrum is proportional to $ 1 /q$ in this region, but if it is a ratio of Fibonacci numbers the measure decreases with a rather higher inverse power of the denominator.
