50|$|As {{it turned}} out, {{this would be}} the last game Harrick would coach in Westwood. Shortly {{before the start of the}} 1996-97 season, he was accused of falsifying {{receipts}} at a student-athlete recruiting dinner when two current players, Cameron Dollar and Charles O'Bannon, joined the table. Since Harrick paid for the entire meal, it amounted to an improper extra benefit for Dollar and O'Bannon. To cover up their presence, Harrick included the names of his wife and the wife of newly hired assistant Michael Holton on the <b>expense</b> <b>report.</b> When the school investigated, Harrick told Holton to tell athletic director Peter Dalis that Holton's wife was at the meal. However, a day later, Holton confessed that wasn't true. On November 6, 1996, Dalis and school chancellor Chuck Young gave Harrick an ultimatum: resign by the next morning or be fired. Harrick opted to take the firing. Although picking up the tab for Dollar and O'Bannon was a secondary violation at best, Young and Dalis felt Harrick's attempted cover-up was unforgivable. However, Harrick claims that the NCAA has cleared him of wrongdoing.|$|E

The Chicago Tribune reported that a Redflex 'consultant' had been making improper payments to a City of Chicago transportation official, John Bills, {{who was responsible for}} overseeing the awarding of contracts for the installation and operation of the widely hated red light camera system. The consultant, Marty O'Malley, who was a long time friend of Bills hired to oversee the Chicago contract, had received [...] in commissions for the contract which had provided approximately [...] million in revenue for Redflex. A hired investigator found that Redflex had provided Bills with lavish vacations expensed directly on the <b>expense</b> <b>report</b> of Redflex Executive Vice-President Aaron Rosenberg, who had also 'gifted' Bills with trips to the Super Bowl and White Sox spring training over many years, valued at up to US$2 million.

Hoffman also found that Redflex's president had knowledge of the arrangement and had lied to Chicago's administration about the extent of the wrongdoing. On 20 February, Redflex fired Rosenberg and filed a lawsuit against him alleging [...] "dishonest and unethical conduct". In a 1 March email addressed to all employees, Redflex Holdings chief executive officer and President Robert DeVincenzi, who took over the company in September 2012, announced the resignations of three top executives in its Phoenix, Arizona headquarters: former President & CEO Karen Finley; Redflex's General Legal Counsel Andrejs Bunkse and Chief Financial Officer Sean Nolen.
