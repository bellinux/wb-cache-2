The drug target hematin is host-derived and largely outside the genetic control of the parasite, which makes the development of drug resistance more difficult. Many clinically used drugs are thought to act by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin in the food vacuole. This prevents the detoxification of the heme released in this compartment, and kills the parasite.|$|E

It is turning one's attention to one's true Self, one's inner world, experiencing and examining self. It {{is a step}} of self extraction and abstraction. Pratyahara is not consciously closing one's eyes to the sensory world, it is consciously closing one's mind processes to the sensory world. Pratyahara empowers one to stop being controlled by the external world, fetch one's attention to seek self-knowledge and experience the freedom innate in one's inner world.|$|E

25|$|Osteen has {{generally}} avoided discussing controversial {{issues such as}} gay marriage, abortion, and politics. However, when asked, Osteen {{said that he is}} opposed to same-sex marriage. Osteen refuses to preach about homosexuality due to his belief that God likes, accepts, and approves of all people. When asked if he thought God approves of homosexuality, Osteen said homosexuality is a sin according to the Scripture, but gay people are welcome in his church. He has said sin is human nature, nobody's perfect, and he is not judging but, God is the judge. Osteen has also stated he believes a person can be freed from a lifestyle of homosexuality; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> and God can free anyone of any sin or addiction. Osteen has also stressed he does not approve of homophobia, but his faith is based on his reading of the Scriptures. He has said the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others.|$|E

Approach: <b>A</b> qualitative research <b>was</b> used for the study of conservation, renewability and development of cultural landscapes of Pabung Patham Flood Plains in the Chi river basin by community participation. The sample was three groups consisted of 30 key informants, 159 casual informants and 42 general informants. Three research areas were Khon Kaen, Mahasarakham and Yasothon. Results: The result of the study were as follows: (1) at present Pabung Patham have been fading away from new generation memories because they have known only community forest or Pa Chum Chon many kinds of plants, herbs, aquatic animals, wild animals and Insects are reduced. Furthermore some kinds of them are become extent in the future if no conservation.

C: Control, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of constructing the ways to control the project. For this research the controlled factor was planting three kinds of tree and gaining four uses according to the feature of cultural landscapes of flood plains that consisted of planting trees for construction, trees for fruit and trees for fuel. Forest enhanced ecological balance in these ways: (1) enhancing oxygen for human beings (2) enhancing water for human beings (3) enhancing the fertility of soil land (4) enhancing the diversities of culture in case of the forest that Located in different ecology. Four cultural uses that we gained from forest classified into: (1) food was gained from plants, insects, wild animals, aquatic animals. (2) Herbal medicine (3) fuel was gained from trees (4) construction parts were gained from trees. Conclusion/Recommendations: Planting three kinds of tree and gaining four uses enhanced a lot of usefulness for community and reduced effectively the awful situation of global warming, drought storm and flood...|$|R
