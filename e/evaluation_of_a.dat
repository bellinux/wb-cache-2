5|$|The post-conventional level, {{also known}} as the principled level, is marked by a growing {{realization}} that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.|$|E

A single intravenous infusion of autologous CD4 T cells genetically modified with VRX496 was well tolerated.

25|$|Modeling dietary {{exposure}} {{is important to}} support dietary risk assessments. Validated {{dietary exposure}} models {{can be used in}} total ingestion studies which focus on the level of exposure to a contaminant from all food sources and they can also be used in aggregate exposure models which may include exposure to a chemical or contaminant through additional means of exposure such as inhalation and dermal or skin contact exposure. In addition, dietary exposure models are useful for identifying at risk populations and potential exposure “hot-spots”. For government agencies, modeling dietary exposure is especially useful in estimating possible exposure to a chemical during a pre-market review.

25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm. Levels measured ranged from 0.003 ppm to 0.59 ppm.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Dover Area School District {{agreed to}} {{participate}} in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate teachers that, in part, takes into account student achievement.

Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective).
