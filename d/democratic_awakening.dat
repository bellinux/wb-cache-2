[...] He contributed to the new party's {{programme}} and served as its first vice-chairman. [...] He represented <b>Democratic</b> <b>Awakening</b> at several of the East German Round Table sessions and served on various related investigatory commissions. [...] A (relatively) young fellow activist in <b>Democratic</b> <b>Awakening</b> was Angela Merkel who later became Chancellor of Germany. [...] Finding himself out of sympathy with what he saw {{at the time a}} shift towards the political right, in January 1990 Neubert resigned from <b>Democratic</b> <b>Awakening.</b> The crunch issue appears to have been the issue of its developing political alliances, notably with the CDU (party): Merkel stayed. [...] After reunification, which formally took place in the late summer of 1990, in 1992 he {{became a member of the}} Brandenburg branch of the Alliance 90 (political party).|$|E

5000|$|Round table {{refers to}} the Central Round Table (Zentraler Runder Tisch) that convened in East Berlin on December 7, 1989, the day after Egon Krenz, {{the new head of}} the Socialist Unity Party (SED) government, resigned. This Round Table, modeled after the Polish Round Table convened in April 1989, was {{initiated}} by the group Democracy Now. It was set up as a forum in which members of East German government organizations (such as the so-called block parties, trade unions, the women’s league, etc.) came together with representatives of the new citizens’ movements (such as Democracy Now, <b>Democratic</b> <b>Awakening,</b> and New Forum) to discuss and advance reforms in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), advising the executive until new national elections could be held. There were 39 representatives at the Central Round Table, 33 with voting rights. Seventeen of them represented new oppositional groups and political parties, and 16 were from political parties and organizations that {{had been part of the}} official East German government. Three, representing women, consumers and environmentalists, had observer status. The final three members were the moderators, all clergymen, from the Protestant, Catholic and Methodist churches, who did not have the right to vote. At first most participants hoped to reform the East German government and thus retain the country’s independence, but as popular opinion moved towards rapid unification with West Germany, these hopes were dashed.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{addresses}} the interpretative implications of German unification. First, the precise {{interaction between the}} international framework of détente and the internal dynamics of the <b>democratic</b> <b>awakening</b> has to be traced in order to explain the surprising overthrow of Communism {{and the return of}} a German national state. Therefore part {{of the history of the}} years 1990 - 2010 in Germany, sometimes referred to as the 'Berlin Republic', can be understood as working out the consequences of unification. But then it must also be realized, that a growing part is also composed of other issues such as globalization, immigration and educational reform. Hence the resumption of the national narrative is a backward-looking perspective that blocks the recognition of more recent problem areas that cannot be dealt with by telling a success story about the Federal Republic. Instead a history of the present require an engagement with new transnational issues of postmodern modernity. " (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|Post-conflict African {{states such}} as Sierra Leone, face {{critical}} challenges as they embark on the complex tasks of reconciliation, peace and the rebuilding of war-torn societies. Conflict transformation ultimately depends on the democratisation of society, in ways that promote equitable inclusiveness in the political process, social justice {{and the promotion of}} citizenship rights. This collection of three essays explores the significance of Sierra Leone's 2007 elections {{in the light of the}} quest of the people for a democracy that is responsive to social demands, welfare and popular aspirations. It provides first-hand information and analysis of the struggles of the Sierra Leonean citizens to overcome the legacy of a traumatic past, by using their vote to sanction bad governance, and choose a path to a good life and sustainable democracy as the most viable guarantee for peace and development.

Kjarni þessara krafna var þó hinn sami: meira lýðræði þýddi aukin áhrif almennings á ákvarðanir og stefnumótun. Þannig undirstrikaði hin almenna umræða um lýðræði þann skilning að virkt samráð við almenning sé nauðsynlegur hluti lýðræðislegra stjórnarhátta. Í þessari grein er gerð tilraun til að varpa ljósi á ólíkt inntak lýðræðiskröfunnar eftir málefnum hverju sinni og athyglinni einkkum beint að þekkingarmiðuðu lýðræði. Því er haldið fram að þótt enn sé ekki hægt að segja að þekkingarmiðað lýðræði byggi á veigamiklum empíriskum rökum, þá bjóði það upp á áhugaverðustu leið samtímans til að hugsa um lýðræðisnýjungar. During the <b>democratic</b> <b>awakening</b> in Iceland {{during and}} after the {{financial}} crisis of 2008 it was evident that different groups based their demands for more or deeper democracy on different conceptions of democracy. Yet their demands had a common core: more democracy meant greater public influence on policy- and decision-making. Thus public discussion insisted on a conception of democracy according to which public consultation is a necessary part of democratic governance. This paper discusses different kinds of consultation depending on the particular demands in each case with particular emphasis on epistemic democracy. I argue that even though it can hardly be said that epistemic democracy is based on much empirical evidence yet, its approach is the most promising way to think about future democratic.

40|$|The African renaissance - the {{renewal of}} the continent - {{effectively}} started {{in the last decade}} of the second millennium. A critical element is the increasing and widespread <b>democratic</b> <b>awakening</b> in all parts of Africa since the early 1990 s as evidenced by the number of multi-party elections. Demonstrating their commitment to democracy, African leaders, under the auspices of regional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union (AU), have increasingly made a number of treaties, declarations and other political commitments in the field of democracy and good governance (including the New Partnership for Africa 9 ̆ 2 s Development (NEPAD) and the Declaration on Africa 9 ̆ 2 s Response to Unconstitutional Changes of Government). Significantly, the recent politico-constitutional crisis in Togo, occasioned by the sudden death of President Gnassingbe Eyadema in early February 2005, after he had ruled the country with an iron-fist for 38 years, and the interim succession of his son, Faure Gnassingbe, to the presidency, raised issues of democracy and good governance and provided an opportunity for African countries to test the effectiveness of the various democracy-related instruments. Adopting a legal-jurisprudential perspective, the author skillfully examines the contradictions between the regional-international legal instruments that permit interference in the internal affairs of a Member State of ECOWAS and AU and the principles of international law that provide for sovereign equality of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State. Undoubtedly, this work will interest scholars, students and researchers in international law, international politics and international relations as well as general readers, especially those interested in African affairs.
