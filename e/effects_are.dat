50|$|There {{are many}} reasons to think this <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> real. Firstly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in such {{a wide range of}} patients, medical and surgical, unselected and selected. Secondly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> very {{consistent}} in terms of the degree of difference (10-15%). Thirdly, the <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> seen in many developed countries on several continents, all of which have a ‘Saturday/Sunday weekend concept’.|$|R

5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such <b>effects</b> <b>are</b> not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E

50|$|The {{next set}} of {{substituent}}s are the halogens, for which the substituent <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still positive but much more modest. The {{reason for this is}} that while the inductive <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> still negative, the mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, the meta <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> much larger than the para effect, due to the fact that the mesomeric <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} semantically related primes and phonologically similar primes were investigated. Tasks for {{processing}} targets were either lexical decision or vowel detection. SOA's (stimulus onset asynchrony) were 200 ms or 800 ms. The reaction time {{results indicated that}} semantic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> found only in lexical decision tasks and phonological priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> only in vowel detection tasks. It was also revealed that only semantic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> found in shorter SOA conditions, and both semantic and phonemic priming <b>effects</b> <b>were</b> shown in longer SOA conditions.

50|$|This {{interesting}} <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered by}} Joaquim da Costa Ribeiro in 1944. The Brazilian physicist observed that solidification and melting of many dielectrics {{are accompanied by}} charge separation.

This <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> observed during water freezing period, electrical storm <b>effects</b> can <b>be</b> caused by this strange phenomenon. <b>Effect</b> <b>was</b> measured by many researches - Bernhard Gross, Armando Dias Tavares, Sergio Mascarenhas etc. César Lattes (co-discoverer of the pion) supposed that this <b>was</b> the only <b>effect</b> ever to <b>be</b> discovered entirely in Brasil.|$|R
