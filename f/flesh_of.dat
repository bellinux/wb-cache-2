5|$|Fruit {{bodies are}} {{commonly}} parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum, transforming {{them into an}} edible known as a lobster mushroom. In this form, {{the surface of the}} fruit body develops into a hard, thin crust dotted with minute pimples, and the gills are reduced to blunt ridges. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom—normally brittle and crumbly—becomes compacted and less breakable.|$|E
5|$|The Russulaceae are {{a diverse}} family of fungi {{in the order}} Russulales, with roughly 1,900 known species and a {{worldwide}} distribution. They comprise the brittlegills and the milk-caps, well-known mushroom-forming fungi that include some edible species. These gilled mushrooms are characterised by the brittle <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> their fruitbodies.|$|E

5|$|The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the cap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10µm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3µm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520µm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8µm. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the gills {{is similar to that of}} the lower cap.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the {{mushroom}} is smooth, thin and white. The taste and odor are mild {{and have no}} distinct smell. When treated with a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sulfuric acid, the flesh turns reddish. The spore print of H.olivaceoalbus is white.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 5–6.5μm, broadly , smooth, and {{strongly}} amyloid (it turns black when treated with Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) {{are embedded in}} the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26–36 by 5–10μm, and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the gills is homogeneous, and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the cap has a distinct , a well-differentiated hypoderm (a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle), and a filamentous tramal body (gill tissue); it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain.|$|E

5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> {{horseshoe}} crabs, {{and used}} the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|Mycena adscendens {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are broadly , amyloid, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6.5µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14–17 by 7–9µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) {{may be present}} or absent. If present, they {{are similar to the}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28–44 by 8–12µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a swollen center) or with 2–3 needle-like projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small warts), and all but the verrucose cells are -brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E

5|$|Spores of Hydnellum {{are almost}} spherical to oblong and tuberculate, and are brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{narrowly}} club-shaped and usually four-spored; {{there are no}} cystidia in Hydnellum. Three types of hyphae {{are found in the}} <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> Hydnellum: generative hyphae (thin-walled, not inflated); skeletal hyphae (thick-walled and narrow); and thin-walled gloeoplerous-like hyphae, which stain with methyl blue.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces strobilaceus {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} {{because of its}} rough scaly cap and lacerated margin, but may be distinguished from B.ananas by smooth stem without a ring, different spores, and flesh that is less tough. The Australian species Boletellus ananiceps has spores with narrow longitudinal ribs {{that do not have}} cross-striae. B.dissiliens has colors that are not red as in B.ananas, and pores that can become reddish in maturity. Further, the cap <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> B.dissiliens turns blue upon exposure to air.|$|E

5|$|The Costa Rican bolete Leccinum neotropicalis is {{a closely}} allied species. It is {{distinguished}} from L.rugosiceps by its dark brown to dark reddish-brown color, and flesh {{that does not}} stain with injury. L.viscosum, found in Belize, features a similar cap and scaber pigmentation on the stipe, and similar color changes in response to injury in the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the cap and {{the apex of the}} stipe; unlike L.rugosiceps, however, it also stains at the stipe base, and the cap is sticky rather than dry.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but {{can usually}} be distinguished by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the colour change of the stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former are red and the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> latter has a bitter taste.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E
5|$|Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as Boletus piperatus, {{it is only}} distantly {{related to}} {{other members of the}} genus Boletus and was {{reclassified}} as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908. The genus Chalciporus was an early branching lineage in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with parasitic properties. Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal (a symbiotic relationship that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), C.piperatus is now suspected of being parasitic on Amanita muscaria. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> C.piperatus has a very peppery taste, and {{can be used as a}} condiment or flavouring.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in {{the early history of}} the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E
