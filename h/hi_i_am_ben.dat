60|$|He said, <b>‘I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not ungenerous to you, Rosa.’ He {{called her}} Pussy no more. Never again.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hi,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Emily and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> from Los Angeles. The Republican Party {{once stood}} for limited government, which meant reduce federal {{spending}} because it cost less {{and we spent}} less. However, over the past decade, real discretionary federal spending has in fact increased 40 percent, {{more than half of}} which has been non-defense related. So my question is: What are the names of the top three federal programs you would reduce in size in order to decrease...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> sir,' {{returned}} Wegg, with obstinate magnanimity. 'I am {{acquainted with}} my faults. <b>I</b> always <b>was,</b> from a child, too sensitive.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} school,' said Clara, {{as they passed}} along {{familiar}} streets; 'then, at least, some one would pity me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wolves tear your throats!' muttered Sikes, {{grinding}} his teeth. <b>'I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{among some}} of you; you'd howl the hoarser for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not mistaken,' said a very engaging, affectionate voice. 'It {{is quite}} {{shocking}} {{to have to}} introduce myself to you--Lady Conway--' ...|$|R
6000|$|She did so on his neck, and, still {{clinging}} there, {{laughed a}} little when she said, <b>'I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ready now for Thirdly, John.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I?</b> Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying nothing,' {{answered}} the fox drearily. 'Just carry me to your cave and eat me up {{as quick as}} you can.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{like looking}} forward,' said Anne; <b>'I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too happy, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{afraid to look}} forward; any change of any sort must bring sorrow with it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sensible, sir,' <b>I</b> replied, 'that I {{have some}} {{knowledge}} and practice to acquire, and must stoop {{for that in}} the first place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure--' said James, with a start. 'I declare his folly {{is capable}} of anything! Why did I not think of it sooner?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ill; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> cold,' he said, {{and signing}} to the bearers, {{he drew the}} curtains, and was carried through the forest right inside his own house.|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> principally {{going to}} smoke a cigar. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> {{in all the}} morning, and {{on a day like}} this one gets restless after a time.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{such that}} F = H1, G = Hk, and each <b>Hi,</b> <b>i</b> < k, <b>is</b> {{incident}} with its successor.|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more frightened than in love,' faintly said Mrs. Egremont. 'At least I didn't know it <b>was</b> love, <b>I</b> {{thought he}} <b>was</b> only kind to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am to myself,' she said, {{wounded and}} mortified. <b>'I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not to anybody else. You {{only wanted to}} BULLY me--you never cared for my happiness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I?</b> Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Hob Hogward's lad,' he {{answered}} {{in an odd}} off-hand tone, before whooping again his answer to the shouts of Hob, which were coming nearer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed!' said Coningsby: <b>'I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> long {{prepared}} for it. And {{it seems to}} me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every one must approve.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{justified}} {{in making the}} promise after {{what you said about}} the pleasure it would be to help me. You remember, that day on the hilltop?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>am</b> of Mrs. Waterbrook's opinion,' said Mr. Waterbrook, {{with his}} wine-glass at his eye. 'Other things {{are all very}} well in their way, but give me Blood!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> forgive; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sorry for}} you, my poor child. Mind, Dynevor Terrace is still your home, {{if you do}} not find the {{happiness}} you expect in your chosen lot.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What ails thee, {{what ails}} thee, friend Athanarich? [...] What makes thee look so pale?' <b>'I</b> fear <b>I</b> <b>am</b> poisoned, thou cunning Kaiser, [...] For I feel my heart-strings fail.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What, Lucy Grafton!' exclaimed the Duke. <b>'I</b> remember; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> his fag at Eton. He was a {{handsome}} dog; but I doubt whether he deserves such a wife. Introduce me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is no sadness {{where there}} is sympathy,' said Tancred, in a low voice. <b>'I</b> have <b>been,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sad, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> alone: but when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> with you, my spirit is sustained, and would be, come what might.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes! and I dreamt it last night, too,' {{continued}} Cadurcis. <b>'I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{sleeping in}} the uninhabited rooms here, and the door opened, and you walked in with a light.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not the law, sir!’ said <b>I.</b> <b>‘I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{too good}} a subject for that. But for a nameless fellow with a bald head {{and a pair of}} gingham small-clothes, why certainly! ’Tis my {{birthright}} as an Englishman. Where’s Magna Charta, else?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Havill {{clapped his}} hand to his pocket, {{examined}} the book Dare held out to him, and took it with thanks. <b>'I</b> see <b>I</b> <b>am</b> speaking to the artist, archaeologist, Gothic photographer--Mr. Dare.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Am I?--faith, I believe I am,' said Ewart. <b>'I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>were</b> INLAWED {{again with}} all my heart. But come along, we must get all ready for our {{peremptory}} gentleman, I suppose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hear ME, sir,' {{said the}} Wanderer, {{stepping}} forward; <b>'I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the mark you aim at--I surrender myself willingly, to save these gentlemen's danger--let this at least avail in their favour.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'When {{he wakes}} {{ask him to}} come to me,' the man said. <b>'I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dying, but <b>I</b> want to see him first. If he can't come, let {{somebody}} else come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{doing wrong}} in letting {{you love me}} without telling you my story; and yet I feared to do so, Elfie. I dreaded to lose you, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> cowardly on that account.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'I</b> know'd <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{never wanted}} before!' cried Mrs. Gummidge, with a pitiable whimper, 'and now I'm told so! How could <b>I</b> expect to <b>be</b> wanted, being so lone and lorn, and so contrary!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Mrs Gamp, {{coming out}} of the chair with an {{impatient}} shiver; <b>'I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a-sleepin' too pleasant to last! The devil's in the night, I think, it's turned so chilly!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dearest Venetia! it is, it is,' exclaimed Lord Cadurcis; then {{checking}} himself, as if {{frightened by}} his boldness, he {{added in a}} more subdued tone, <b>'I</b> feel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not worthy of you.' ...|$|R
