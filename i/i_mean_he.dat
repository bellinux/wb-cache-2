500|$|As {{with the}} rest of the cast, Yelchin was allowed to choose what {{elements}} there were from their predecessor's performances. Yelchin decided to carry on Walter Koenig's speech patterns of replacing [...] "v"s with [...] "w"s, although he and Abrams felt this was a trait more common of Polish accents than Russian ones. He described Chekov as an odd character, being a Russian who was brought on to the show [...] "in the middle of the Cold War." [...] He recalled a [...] "scene where they're talking to Apollo , 'I am Apollo.' And Chekov is like, 'And I am the czar of all the Russias.' [...] They gave him these lines. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> really is the weirdest, weirdest character." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Young's {{streak of}} 25 {{consecutive}} road starts without a loss was broken that {{day by the}} Dodgers win. The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. [...] "I was terrible," [...] Young said. [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put the guys in a hole {{early in the game}} and it was just too much to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn looked jealous, {{with a small}} hot jealousy. She hastened on with: [...] "Of course, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he's</b> {{just like}} a big brother. To all of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He's</b> just as grumpy as Dr Gruffen, and thinks {{everybody}} {{is to do}} what he tells them. Of course, you take his part." ...|$|R
5000|$|We still {{disagree}} about everything. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he's</b> more conservative politically and {{also is a}} pragmatist. He's very pragmatic and wants everything to line up {{and put in a}} box. And I'm a little bit looser. Tommy Smothers (on his brother Dick),from a 2006 interview.|$|R
500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling about him." [...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E
500|$|Bostic's {{physical}} {{style of play}} was respected by his peers: Lester Hayes said Raider tight end Todd Christensen is the best receiving tight end and that [...] "The only guy I've ever seen cover Todd is my son, Keith Bostic...Bostic's the only guy I've ever seen pulverize him. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> really pulverized him. I call Bostic and Frank Minnifield (Cleveland cornerback) my sons, my sons of dirt." [...] Hayes meant that Bostic and Minnifield played a {{physical style}}, just like Hayes. [...] Bostic {{is known as a}} big hitter blessed with athletic ability. [...] He combined strength and speed to play his physical style according to Ozzie Newsome: [...] "He's as strong as any linebacker and can run like any of the guys on the corner." [...] Bostic earned the nickname [...] "Batman" [...] for his style of play. [...] Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to [...] "...pick the three toughest guys. If somebody throws a grenade into a room, they're the ones who'll jump on it." [...] Bostic was the player chosen from the Oilers' defense. [...] Although much is made of his strength and toughness, it should also be mentioned that he once collared Tony Dorsett from behind in a footrace. [...] At one point in Bostic's career, while Glanville was still defensive coordinator, the Oilers considered moving him to cornerback because of his speed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] {{interrupted}} Elsie. [...] "We must camp. Don't {{think of}} putting us under a roof." [...] A little later she said, {{in a low}} voice: [...] "Father is in Chicago, and expects {{to be out here}} later. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he's</b> coming to make a tour of the State." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Speckylated it!" [...] said Kipps, with an illustrative {{flourish}} of the arm, {{that failed}} to illustrate. [...] "Bort things dear and sold 'em cheap, and played the 'ankey-pankey jackass with everything we got. That's what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>'e's</b> done, Ann." [...] He repeated this last sentence {{with the addition of}} violent adverbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lenore, I like Mr. Dorn," [...] she said, meditatively. [...] "He has {{an old-fashioned}} manner {{that reminds me}} of my boy friends when I was a girl. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he's</b> more courteous and dignified than boys are nowadays. A splendid-looking boy, too. Only his face is so sad. When he smiles he seems another person." ...|$|R
500|$|The cliffhanger, {{in which}} Rousseau and Karl are killed and Alex calls out in desperation {{that she is}} Ben's daughter, gained a mixed response. In an 8.8 out of 10 review, IGN's Chris Carabott called the scene [...] "completely out of place … tacked on and anticlimactic" [...] as it [...] "came at the strangest moment". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post deemed the cliffhanger [...] "a shocker"; he asked [...] "do we really care ? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> did have a nice new haircut and all, but he really wasn't too {{interesting}} of a character." [...] Despite his assessment that [...] "this impressive episode was a fitting midseason finale", Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones wrote that the [...] "climax wasn't as effective as one could have hoped for, as the collective fates of Alex, Danielle and the ultra-expendable Karl don't rouse {{a great deal of}} interest." [...] Grading the episode as a [...] "B", Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen was also unimpressed with the cliffhanger and the characters carrying it; he felt that network executives were partially to blame for going against the wish of the show's creative team to broadcast [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] as a midseason premiere as opposed to a midseason finale. Jensen criticized the episode's unique flashback format, commenting that it lacked the usual [...] "deeper, more immersive experience [...] embellishes the sophistication of the storytelling" [...] of Lost.|$|E
500|$|There are {{frequent}} references to Star Wars in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens. There is also reference to Star Wars when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In [...] "The Head and the Hair", Liz tells Jenna that [...] "The Head" [...] asked her out and says [...] "I had to say yes. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> looked at me with those handsome guys eyes. It was like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon was...", until Jenna interrupts her and says [...] "No Liz, do not talk about that stuff on your date. Guys like that do not like Star Trek", to which Liz corrects [...] "Wars!". Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to executive producer and writer Robert Carlock, whom she described as [...] "the resident expert".|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience." [...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
5000|$|Charles's anguish was {{recorded}} in his private comments to Prince William, caught on a microphone during a press photo-call in 2005 and published in the national press. After a question from the BBC's royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, Charles muttered: [...] "These bloody people. I can't bear that man. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he's</b> so awful, he really is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's hateful," [...] {{repeated}} Molly. [...] "So is <b>he,</b> Sir Thomas, <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>He's</b> one {{of those}} fussy, bullying little men. They both bully poor Lord Dreever till I wonder he doesn't rebel. They treat him like a school-boy. It makes me wild. It's such a shame--he's so nice and good-natured! I am so sorry for him!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Malden died at {{his home}} in Los Angeles on July 1, 2009, at the age of 97. He is said to have died of natural causes. Malden's manager said, [...] "It could be many things. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> was 97 years old!" [...] He {{is said to have been}} in poor health for several years.|$|E
2500|$|Perry's overall {{performance}} was criticised. His speech was so garbled that Mark Hemingway of the Weekly Standard {{asked if he}} had suffered a stroke, and Brit Hume of Fox News stated that Perry, [...] "at a time when he needed to raise his game, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> did worse, it seems to me, than he had done in previous debates." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for me to think of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> likes being with them. He likes being kidded-he likes being teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. [...] He never asked for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.|$|E

25|$|Well, no, no, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he's</b> {{making an}} appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone {{watching}} what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.|$|R
2500|$|Thompson had an 86.1% {{lifetime}} (1995–2002) American Conservative Union vote rating, {{compared to}} 89.3 for Bill Frist and 82.3 for John McCain. [...] Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) characterized her colleague this way: [...] "I believe that Fred is a fearless senator. By that <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> was never afraid {{to cast a}} vote or take a stand, regardless of the political consequences." [...] Thompson was [...] "on the short end of a couple of 99–1 votes", voting against those who wanted to federalize matters that he believed were properly left to state and local officials.|$|E
2500|$|LaMarr {{auditioned for}} Tarantino because both {{had done a}} show for the Groundlings, an improv group, {{a few months before}} casting of the film began. In the audition, he read for Jules Winnfield and Brett. He {{described}} the filming experience of Pulp Fiction as [...] "the coolest, most easygoing, fun set I've ever been on ... Tarantino was fantastic. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> can be almost unbearable as a person. At a party, you can't get a word in edgewise for, like, an hour. But as a director, he is so completely open and just... present. And he treated everybody on set well." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{fans have}} heatedly debated his sexual orientation, Shawn Pyfrom has denied that Andrew is totally homosexual, {{implying}} he is bisexual. When asked whether Andrew was specifically gay or bisexual, Pyfrom stated [...] "I really don’t even {{know at this}} point. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> did make that statement [...] I think he’s a little more gay than he is straight, though." [...] In [...] "My Husband, the Pig", he refers to Austin as a [...] "dog" [...] and himself as a [...] "dog-lover". Whatever Andrew is, {{he is one of}} a few LGBT teens on television secure with his sexuality. Marc Cherry has commented, [...] "Andrew Van de Kamp is perhaps the most empowered gay teen in the history of television. He's gay and he doesn't care." ...|$|E

5000|$|His guitar playing {{is known}} to consist of full six string barre chords {{and be able to}} keep up speed while not sacrificing {{accuracy}}. Ian Mackaye has stated [...] "Lyle Preslar, the guitar player, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he's</b> one of the most unsung guitar players. He's playing full, six-string-position barre chords at that speed-- that's just insane. His accuracy and his rhythms are so incredible." ...|$|R
2500|$|On February 27, 1991, Widlar {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} at the age of 53, in Puerto Vallarta. David Liddle said in 2009 that [...] "the {{untimely}} early death of ... Robert Widlar is a whole story in itself". Early reports incorrectly said that Widlar died while jogging on a beach. Later sources corrected the mistake: he was running up a hill. Bob Pease wrote more precisely: [...] "Apparently he had been jogging on a sidewalk, in a steep hilly section of Puerta Vallarta. Bob was, in recent years, pretty much into fitness, and he worked hard at his running ... I'm no doctor. But he did not die drunk, which may have amazed a number of his colleagues". Jack Gifford concurred: [...] "He didn't die as a derelict. He wasn't, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>he</b> was fine. He was coherent. Probably leading the most, he was down in Mexico, living in Mexico, but he was sober and leading a reasonable life for him at that point when he died".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1967 interview, Borges said, [...] "Perón was a humbug, {{and he knew}} it, and {{everybody}} knew it. But Perón could be very cruel. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> had people tortured, killed. And his wife was a common prostitute." [...] When Perón returned from exile in 1973 and regained the Presidency, Borges was enraged. In a 1975 interview for National Geographic, he said [...] "Damn, the snobs {{are back in the}} saddle. If their posters and slogans again defile the city, I'll be glad I've lost my sight. Well, they can't humiliate me as they did before my books sold well." [...] After being accused of being unforgiving, Borges quipped, [...] "I resented Perón's making Argentina look ridiculous to the world... as in 1951, when he announced control over thermonuclear fusion, which still hasn't happened anywhere but in the sun and the stars. For a time, Argentines hesitated to wear band aids for fear friends would ask, 'Did the atomic bomb go off in your hand?' A shame, because Argentina really has world-class scientists." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} book, Rowling {{establishes}} that Voldemort hates non-pure-blood wizards, despite being a half-blood himself. In a 2000 {{interview with the}} BBC, Rowling described Voldemort as a self-hating bully: [...] "Well I think it {{is often the case}} that the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other and that's what Voldemort does." [...] In the same year, Rowling became more precise about Voldemort. She began to link him to real-life tyrants, describing him as [...] "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering". In 2004, though, Rowling said that she did not base Voldemort on any real person. In 2006, Rowling told an interviewer that Voldemort at his core has a human fear: the fear of death. She said: [...] "Voldemort's fear is death, ignominious death. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it's a shameful human weakness, as you know. His worst fear is death." ...|$|E
