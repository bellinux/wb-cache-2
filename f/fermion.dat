5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a <b>fermion,</b> and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E

In other words, a <b>fermion</b> needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} for the pion multiplet {{calculated}} using both unimproved staggered <b>fermions</b> and improved HYP-smeared staggered <b>fermions.</b> In the case of unimproved staggered <b>fermions,</b> we observe (consistent with previous work) that O(a 2) taste symmetry breaking effects are large and comparable to the ≈ O(p 2) contributions to their masses. Higher order O(a 2 p 2) effects are also substantial enough to be seen. For HYP-smeared staggered <b>fermions,</b> we find that taste breaking is much reduced. The O(a 2) effects are observable, but are noticeably smaller than those obtained with AsqTad-improved staggered <b>fermions,</b> and much smaller than those obtained using unimproved staggered <b>fermions,</b> while O(a 2 p 2) effects are suppressed to level that we cannot observe them given our statistical errors.

40|$|We study a many-body {{mixture of}} {{an equal number}} of bosons and two-component <b>fermions</b> with a strong contact attraction. In this system bosons and <b>fermions</b> can be paired into {{composite}} <b>fermions.</b> We construct a large N extension where both bosons and <b>fermions</b> have the extra large N degrees of freedom and the boson-fermion interaction is extended to a four-point contact interaction which is invariant under the O(N) group transformation, so that the composite <b>fermions</b> become singlet in terms of the O(N) group. It is shown that such O(N) singlet fields have controllable quantum fluctuations suppressed by 1 /N factors and yield a systematic 1 /N-expansion in terms of composite <b>fermions.</b> We derive an effective action described by composite <b>fermions</b> up to the next-to-leading-order terms in the large N expansion, and show that there can be the BCS superfluidity of composite <b>fermions</b> at sufficiently low temperatures.

25|$|Most GUT models {{require a}} {{threefold}} replication {{of the matter}} fields. As such, they do not explain why there are three generations of fermions. Most GUT models also fail to explain the little hierarchy between the <b>fermion</b> masses for different generations.|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{describes}} <b>fermion</b> masses {{through the}} Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson has a Yukawa coupling to the left- and right-handed top quarks.

50|$|Particles which exhibit antisymmetric {{states are}} called <b>fermions.</b> Antisymmetry {{gives rise to}} the Pauli {{exclusion}} principle, which forbids identical <b>fermions</b> from sharing the same quantum state.

40|$|Recently, type-II Dirac <b>fermions</b> {{characterized}} by strongly titled Dirac cones have been proposed. The new <b>fermions</b> exhibit unique physical properties {{different from the}} type-I Dirac <b>fermions</b> in graphene, and thus attract tremendous attentions. Up to date, all type-II <b>fermions</b> are only found in the heavy compounds with strong spin obit coupling. Here, we propose that both type-I and type-II Dirac <b>fermions</b> can exist in the graphene embedding nitrogen-molecule line defects (NMLDs). While the types of Dirac <b>fermions</b> {{are determined by the}} size W of graphene nanoribbons between the line defects. By comparing the two types of Dirac <b>fermions,</b> their different physical properties and originations are revealed directly. Remarkably, the type-I Dirac points induce one Fermi arc corresponding to edge states along the armchair direction, while the type-II Dirac points induce two Fermi arcs corresponding to two sets of edge states along the zigzag direction. These results not only expand our views on the Dirac <b>fermions</b> in two-dimensional structures, but also extend their applications in electronics...|$|R

25|$|The quantum {{mechanical}} {{effects on}} helium-3 and helium-4 are significantly different because with two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, helium-4 has an overall spin of zero, {{making it a}} boson, but with one fewer neutron, helium-3 has an overall spin of one half, making it a <b>fermion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fermions {{are one of}} the two {{fundamental}} classes of particles, the other being bosons. <b>Fermion</b> particles are described by Fermi–Dirac statistics and have quantum numbers described by the Pauli exclusion principle.

25|$|In the Standard Model, {{all of the}} quark and lepton Yukawa {{couplings}} {{are small}} compared to the top quark Yukawa coupling. Understanding this hierarchy in the <b>fermion</b> masses is an open problem in theoretical physics.

40|$|The boson-fermion model, {{describing}} {{a mixture of}} <b>fermions</b> and bosons is analyzed on a small, two-site lattice.

Additionally, the Hamiltonian includes a term that describes a conversion {{of a pair of}} opposite-spin <b>fermions</b> into a boson and vice versa. We show how this conversion depends on the model parameters...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fermions</b> {{therefore}} obey different statistics (called Fermi-Dirac statistics) than bosons (which obey Bose-Einstein statistics). One of {{the consequences}} of Fermi-Dirac statistics is the exclusion principle for fermions—no two identical <b>fermions</b> can share the same quantum state (in other words, the wave function of two identical <b>fermions</b> in the same state is zero). This in turn results in degeneracy pressure for fermions—the strong resistance of <b>fermions</b> to compression into smaller volume. This resistance gives rise to the “stiffness” or “rigidity” of ordinary atomic matter (as atoms contain electrons which are <b>fermions).</b>|$|R
50|$|In physics, {{degenerate}} matter {{refers to the}} ground state of a gas of <b>fermions</b> at a temperature near absolute zero. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that only two <b>fermions</b> can occupy a quantum state, one spin-up and the other spin-down. Hence, at zero temperature, the <b>fermions</b> fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermions—and {{in the case of}} many <b>fermions,</b> the maximum kinetic energy (called the Fermi energy) and the pressure of the gas becomes very large, and depends on the number of <b>fermions</b> rather than the temperature, unlike normal states of matter.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} version of string theory was bosonic string theory, but this version described only bosons, {{a class of}} particles which transmit forces between the matter particles, or fermions. Bosonic string theory was eventually superseded by theories called superstring theories. These theories describe both bosons and fermions, and they incorporate a theoretical idea called supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between the bosons and fermions. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a <b>fermion,</b> and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The above second-quantized model {{takes the}} {{particles}} to be bosons. If the particles {{are taken to}} be fermions, then the Pauli exclusion principle prohibits multi-particle states which include squares of primes. By the spin-statistics theorem, field states with an even number of particles are bosons, while those with an odd number of particles are fermions. The <b>fermion</b> operator (1)F has a very concrete realization in this model as the Möbius function , in that the Möbius function is positive for bosons, negative for fermions, and zero on exclusion-principle-prohibited states.|$|E
25|$|GUT models which {{aim to be}} {{completely}} realistic are quite complicated, even compared to the Standard Model, because they need to introduce additional fields and interactions, or even additional dimensions of space. The main reason for this complexity lies in the difficulty of reproducing the observed <b>fermion</b> masses and mixing angles which {{may be related to}} an existence of some additional family symmetries beyond the conventional GUT models. Due to this difficulty, and {{due to the lack of}} any observed effect of grand unification so far, there is no generally accepted GUT model.|$|E
