Hypothetical aero-sols with 12 generalized size distributions typical of the method of aerosol generation (conden-sation, aged condensation, mechanical low energy, mechanical high energy and mixtures thereof) were assumed. Using previously reported models for sampler penetration and pulmonary deposition, Monte Carlo simulations of actual mass dose to pulmonary tissues {{in comparison to the}} dose estimate from an ideal respirable aerosol sampler were carried out. Measurement-based indicated doses were used to classify exposures into five exposure categories and these classifications were compared with the ‘true ’ classifications from the dose-based exposure estimates. Misclassification rates were generally severe and were greatest for aerosols with mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) 15 µm.

40|$|International audienceCharacterizing aerosol sources {{emission}} profiles is {{a central}} problem in risk prevention, although it is very tricky to achieve in practice. When concentration measurements {{are available in the}} far-field, this can be done indirectly through the use of so-called inverse methods. Thus M.

The approach has proven itself successful, and we propose in this paper to extend its scope to aerosol pollutants emitted. The evaluation procedure of aerosol emission is based on the use of a mathematical algorithm which allows reconstructing the emission rate by inverting a relationship (called impedance) linking the aerosol source and concentration measurements. This procedure includes two distinct steps. The first step consists in determining the impedance using a known source of aerosols and the corresponding <b>dust</b> <b>measurements.</b> In a second step, an unknown source of aerosols is reconstructed from the model inversion and <b>dust</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|R

Collection efficiencies are presented for a filter-holder dust sampler now being used for <b>dust</b> <b>measurements</b> at British coke ovens. When the holder faces the wind, efficiency initially increases with particle size to above 100 per cent, but above about 15 nm efficiency falls. It probably increases again at larger particle sizes. Efficiency rapidly falls with increasing particle size when the holder is side-on to the wind. <b>Dust</b> <b>measurements</b> were made in a dusty place on a coke oven, with one sampler facing, and another side-on to, a 2 - 6 m s- 1 wind. The ratio of the concentrations measured by the two samplers was about 4 for total dust, but only about 1 - 5 for the benzene-soluble matter (BSM), suggesting that the BSM was concentrated on the smaller particles. These ratios are probably overestimates of the normal sampling errors. The errors are clearly important, however, although less so than with more open filter holders.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Occupational hygiene {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of the mining industry for centuries; however its importance has grown with developments in mechanisation. While the focus in the past has quite correctly been on improving the controls on dust exposure, the future lies in identifying the efficiency of installed controls on operating longwalls, evaluating them through robust and quantitative sampling methods to ensure the most effective controls are in place to prevent occupational disease from occurring. The current statutory testing regime identifies the exposure levels of personnel on an operating face, which gives a snapshot of the dust that these persons will be exposed to over the duration of a mining shift. Although this testing process clearly determines exposure levels, it does not give mine operators any indication of where dust is produced, how much dust is produced nor how efficient the installed controls are at mitigating produced dust. This paper proposes a new testing methodology to determine installed control efficiency for both respirable and inhalable dust and reports the initial <b>dust</b> <b>measurement</b> results based on this methodology.

40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to hand-arm vibration and dust {{have been shown}} to have deleterious human health effects. Exposure to vibration from pneumatic tools can result in Hand-arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), which is a collection of vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal disorders. Exposure to dust can result in a variety of adverse respiratory symptoms. The use of a low-frequency, high-magnitude sand rammer tool during mold-making processes at a foundry could result in significant exposure to these hazards, thus it is important to mitigate the associated risks in order to ensure worker safety. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether different pneumatic pressure levels and sand rammer types have an effect on reducing hand-arm vibration and dust exposures at a foundry. Vibration and <b>dust</b> <b>measurements</b> were obtained at three different pneumatic pressure levels (90 psi, 80 psi, 70 psi) and for three different sand rammer types (LM, SM, T). The primary concern of the study was reducing hand-arm vibration exposure. Measurements were taken in compliance with ISO 5349 - 1 resulting in frequency-weighted, root-mean-square (rms) acceleration values (m/s 2). Significant differences in mean rms acceleration were observed across all pneumatic pressure levels and sand rammer types. At 90 psi the mean rms acceleration value was 25. 53 m/s 2, decreasing to 19. 58 m/s 2 at 80 psi, and further decreasing to 18. 38 m/s 2 at 70 psi. The mean rms acceleration values were 19. 63 m/s 2 for sand rammer LM, 21. 46 m/s 2 for SM, and 19. 95 m/s 2 for T. The results of this study indicate that reducing pneumatic pressure levels can reduce vibration exposure in the workplace when using low-frequency, high-magnitude tools. The results also indicate that the use of different sand rammer types produces differences in vibration exposure when tested across all pneumatic pressure levels. <b>Dust</b> <b>measurements</b> were taken concurrently with vibration measurements. The number of dust particles was counted for each pneumatic pressure level and sand rammer type. Overall, the mean particle count for the <b>dust</b> <b>measurements</b> was the highest at 90 psi (41, 681) followed by 70 psi (33, 514), and 80 psi (26, 047).

This fraction of coarse mining dust is considered to be non-respirable, therefore catch less attention than respirable dust. The necessity of the research were analyzed by doing a literature study, and dust collectors that could be available for the future study on coarse mining dust were listed in the report. Laboratory work was carried out to analyze the dust samples collected from residential area close to LKAB mining site. At last, a future plan was figured out to give guidance for the continuous further study on current subject. The conclusion of the literature study showed that there is an urgent need to start the study on coarse dust around mining area, and the inverted frisbee and marble dust collector are two promising ones with improved catching efficiencies on dust collection therefore should be further tested both experimentally and practically. The tested results from laboratory work showed the dust contains metals indicating the dust origin from mining site, and the particles from mining site are coarser than natural soil. The two significant dust sources in this mining site are the dam and the huge open pit. Lots of actions could be done for dust control purposes. And to improve the dust monitoring, a wind anemometer and a horizontal gauge should be added to the station where dust collected, and a more efficient dust collector of inverted frisbee is suggested to replace NILU collector. The future plan was compiled in three aspects including <b>dust</b> <b>measurement,</b> dust origin as well as dust generation, spreading and settling. The suggestions in future plan offer a general direction in which we should mainly endeavor to. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

The literature search is the basic data and concepts from areas combine harvesters, noise and <b>dust.</b> The actual <b>measurements</b> were carried out on the land at the four farmers. Measured the machines were different dates of manufacture. These are machines Fortschritt E 512 (1983), Fortschritt E 514 (1989), IH 2188 (1998) and Claas Avero 240 (2011). The results of measurement were graphically displayed and compared each other. The measured values were compared with the current legislation. These measurements showed that the noise does not just limit oldest machine. Dustiness been in this job for guidance only.

We interviewed 546 workers exposed to wood dust and 565 control subjects using a respiratory health questionnaire. Inhalable <b>dust</b> <b>measurements</b> were collected for 106 workers. The dust exposure was high, and job title–based geometric mean exposure levels ranged from 2. 9 to 22. 8 mg/m 3.
