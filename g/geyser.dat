5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known <b>geyser</b> at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone <b>geyser.</b> Grand <b>Geyser,</b> the tallest predictable <b>geyser</b> on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain <b>geyser.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the water}} {{remaining}} in the <b>geyser</b> cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from <b>geyser</b> to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts {{for a few seconds}} every few minutes, while Grand <b>Geyser</b> in the United States erupts for up to 10minutes every 8–12hours.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geysers</b> are {{temporary}} geological features. <b>Geysers</b> {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam {{and water to}} the surface through the <b>geyser's</b> internal plumbing. The formation of <b>geysers</b> specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain.|$|R
5|$|There {{are various}} {{other types of}} <b>geysers</b> which are {{different}} in nature compared to the normal steam-driven <b>geysers.</b> These <b>geysers</b> differ not only in their style of eruption {{but also in the}} cause that makes them erupt.|$|R

5|$|On 25 September, 2017, it was {{reported}} that Morgan <b>Geyser,</b> then 15, had agreed to plead guilty to attempting to commit first-degree homicide in an arrangement that would allow her avoid jail time.

50|$|These {{intriguing}} high latitude {{features are}} associated with the Martian <b>Geysers.</b> The <b>geysers</b> themselves (if that is what they are) are thought to be results of dry ice turning to gas, and the dark spots and flow like features are thought to be debris from the <b>geysers.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2008, AltaRock {{started a}} {{demonstration}} project at The <b>Geysers</b> geothermal field. The <b>Geysers</b> field has hundreds of megawatts of unused electric power generating capacity {{due to the}} lack of steam caused by several decades of reservoir depletion. At The <b>Geysers</b> demonstration, AltaRock intended to re-drill a well originally drilled in 1988 and used for years to inject water to produce steam for the existing geothermal power plants. Three attempts were made to re-drill the well from various depths but the drilling assembly became stuck each time in unstable serpentinite formation. Drilling at The <b>Geysers</b> demonstration site has been suspended while the company evaluates a number of alternative well locations at the <b>Geysers</b> and elsewhere for demonstrating this technology.|$|R

5|$|The water {{ejected from}} a <b>geyser</b> travels {{underground}} through deep, pressurized fissures in the Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the <b>geyser</b> rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the <b>geyser</b> vent.|$|E
5000|$|By 1999 {{the steam}} to power {{extraction}} {{had begun to}} deplete the <b>Geysers</b> steam field and production began to drop. However, since October 16, 1997, the <b>Geysers</b> steam field has been recharged by injection of treated sewage effluent, producing approximately 77 megawatts of capacity in 2004. The effluent is piped up to 50 mi from its source at the Lake County Sanitation waste water treatment plants and added to the <b>Geysers</b> steam field via geothermal injection. [...] In 2004, 85% of the effluent produced by four waste-water treatment plants serving 10 Lake County communities was diverted to the <b>Geysers</b> steam field. [...] Injecting treated water into the <b>Geysers</b> field increases the amount of power that can be generated.|$|R
40|$|We present updated time-series and {{velocities}} {{based on}} survey (episodic) Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements across the geothermal field at The <b>Geysers,</b> California. These {{surveys show that}} a slowing of the rapid rate of subsidence and contraction seen across The <b>Geysers</b> has occurred {{since the start of}} the Southeast <b>Geysers</b> Effluent Pipeline (SEGEP) in October 1997 and the Santa Rosa <b>Geysers</b> Recharge Pipeline (SRGRP) in September 2003, most significantly in areas close to high volume injector wells, although subsidence is still occurring. We also introduce the first continuous GPS sites in The <b>Geysers,</b> which were installed in December 2012 and January 2013. These continuous sites are intended to capture and monitor transient deformation associated with Calpine's Enhanced Geothermal Systems demonstration projects...|$|R
40|$|<b>Geysers</b> {{are unique}} and {{precious}} phenomenon in our planet. Especially hot <b>geysers</b> are originated only in localities {{where there are}} harmony of conditions, which are essential for their development. The main conditions are source of water, source of heat and unique system of rifts. Rifts bring the water to the chamber and vent ejects hot water to the surface. Most of cold <b>geysers</b> are drilled holes. Their vicinity are dappered by human, and they often look like fountains. In the introduciton of this bachelor thesis groundwater and it's movements and properties are presented. Additionally the rock environment and mineral water are covered. <b>Geysers,</b> the main topic of this thesis, are described as a seperate chapter. Different chapters explain how <b>geysers</b> work and other processes that accompany them...|$|R

5|$|The first soldier cabins {{were built}} in 1886 as part of Camp Sheridan {{and all of these}} were later removed. Cabins were also built at the Lower <b>Geyser</b> Basin, Upper <b>Geyser</b> Basin, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Riverside and at Soda Butte. As more {{outposts}} were needed over the years cabins were constructed at Lake Outlet (1887), Snake River (Polecat Creek), West Thumb and Riverside (1892), Mud <b>Geyser</b> (1895), Norris and Thumb Bay (1897), Lake (1899), Snake River (1902), Gardiner (1903), West Thumb, Syvan Pass and Soda Butte (1904), Tower (1907), Crevice Mountain (1912), Snake River (1914), and Aster Creek, Cabin Creek, Harebell, and Thorofare (1915). Snowshoe cabins in existence in 1899 included small structures at Astringent Creek, Bartlet, Boundary Creek, Coulter Creek, Hellroaring Creek, Lewis River, Park Point, Proposition, Trappers Creek, Trout Creek and Willow Creek. While none of the aforementioned structures are still in existence, four remote structures remain. They include the Buffalo Lake snowshoe cabin (Bldg 234) and the Norris and Bechler River soldier stations (Bldgs 111 and 231). The Norris soldier station currently houses the Museum of the National Park Ranger. Additionally, the Bechler River barn (Bldg 232) is still in existence.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the <b>geyser</b> to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.|$|E
40|$|The Southeast <b>Geysers</b> Cooperative Tracer Evaluation Program {{has been}} a joint project located in the SE part of the <b>Geysers</b> {{geothermal}} field, in Lake and Sonoma Counties, California. A new generation of environmentally benign vapor-phase tracers {{has been used to}} estimate the varying degrees to which injectate is being recovered following the significant increase of injected volumes within the Southeast <b>Geysers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Geothermal power {{stations}} can also disrupt the natural cycles of <b>geysers.</b> For example, the Beowawe, Nevada <b>geysers,</b> which were uncapped geothermal wells, stopped erupting {{due to the}} development of the dual-flash station.|$|R

5|$|At least 1,283 geysers have {{erupted in}} Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, {{and an average}} of 465 geysers are active there in a given year. A geyser's eruptive {{activity}} may change or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the <b>geyser</b> plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention.|$|E
5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a <b>geyser</b> of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though {{no one on the}} ground is known to have witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive <b>geyser</b> of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by <b>geyser</b> activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
50|$|There are <b>geysers</b> 80 km {{from the}} town of San Pedro de Atacama. There are about 80 <b>geysers</b> that lie in a valley. They are closer to the town of Chiu Chiu.|$|R
5|$|This is {{a natural}} hot spring that spouts water {{constantly}} without stopping for recharge. Some of these are incorrectly called <b>geysers,</b> {{but because they are}} not periodic in nature they are not considered true <b>geysers.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of seismicity at The <b>Geysers</b> {{and in the}} surrounding region indicates {{that the rate of}} seismicity at The <b>Geysers</b> is 45 times the regional rate and that clustering of events in space and time is more prevalent in the region area than at The <b>Geysers.</b> Temporally clustered seismic events that occurred at The <b>Geysers</b> from September 1975 through September 1976 appear linked to regional temporal clusters located {{at the southern end of}} Clear Lake. During this period, a characteristic 2 - to 6 -day time lapse separated temporal clusters at The <b>Geysers</b> from those at Clear Lake. The two areas where these correlated clusters occurred lie on either side of a presumed magma body. Correlation between clusters in the two areas disappears after September 1976. During the period of correlated seismic episodes, regional stress changes may have been transmitted between the two areas by aseismic creep...|$|R
5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a <b>geyser,</b> a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system {{are essential to the}} building up of pressure before an eruption.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a <b>geyser</b> to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.|$|E
5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water table {{to the point that}} <b>geyser</b> activity could no longer be sustained.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{plants at}} the <b>Geysers</b> {{are of the}} dry steam power plant type, where the steam {{directly}} powers the generator. In general, the <b>Geysers</b> has [...] of active installed capacity with an average production factor of 63% (955 MW).|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to water, these <b>geysers</b> from vents near {{the south pole}} contained small amounts of salt, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and volatile hydrocarbons. The melting of the ocean water and the <b>geysers</b> appear {{to be driven by}} tidal flux from Saturn.|$|R
50|$|Until 1946 Ustinova {{remained}} on the Kamchatka peninsula, researching Valley of <b>Geysers.</b> She gave the names to {{the most powerful and}} impressive hot springs there. Later on she worked in Chişinău. In 1951, she published a book <b>Geysers</b> of Kamchatka.|$|R
