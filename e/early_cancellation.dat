5|$|Zinta {{has taken}} part in several stage shows and world tours since 2001. Her first world tour, a series of concerts called Craze 2001, was {{performed}} across the US alongside Anil Kapoor, Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Gracy Singh. The show faced <b>early</b> <b>cancellation</b> due to the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the team prepared to return to India as soon as possible. However, the shows continued successfully in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an <b>early</b> <b>cancellation.</b> The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing Emilio, Gamma {{arranges}} to {{have the}} Ring of the Dead removed from his body by an old friend, mad scientist Nazna Gemini. The characters are brought to Gemini's lab by Angelle Cooney, a young girl {{with the power of}} teleportation. Once there, Gemini agrees to operate to remove the ring from Emilio in exchange for a year of experimentation rights on Wolfina. Due to the series' <b>early</b> <b>cancellation,</b> Zombiepowder. is ended without a solid conclusion. The final chapter shows Gamma and Smith leaving Elwood and Wolfina behind as they depart the Gemini Laboratory, whose staff have just begun the operation to save Emilio. It is left ambiguous whether Elwood chooses to follow Gamma and Smith, stay with Wolfina and Emilio, or become a powder hunter in his own right.|$|E

2500|$|One of the cited {{reasons for}} its <b>early</b> <b>cancellation</b> was its {{inability}} to gain an audience due to its [...] "erratic scheduling" [...] and poor time slots, competing with the high-rated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. The producers created a website for the series, but NBC would not share its URL because [...] "they didn't {{want people to know}} the Internet existed. They were worried about losing viewers to it" [...] as explained by Judd Apatow. Freaks and Geeks was only averaging under 7 million viewers, while other NBC series such as Frasier and Friends were averaging over 14 million viewers each.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Early</b> <b>cancellations</b> {{were all}} applied by hand, {{commonly}} using hand stamps. Where hand stamps were not available, stamps often were cancelled by marking over the stamp with pen, such as writing an [...] "x".

50|$|During the 1980s, Berry battled drug {{addiction}} and alcoholism. He revived {{the character of}} Rerun in the series What's Happening Now!!, but he was only on that show for a year. Berry asked for {{more money than the}} rest of the cast (believing he was the reason people tuned in). Berry's widow, Essie Berry, told Urbanite magazine at Georgia State University that their unwillingness to pay Fred Berry his due in both shows led to their <b>early</b> <b>cancellations.</b> During the 1990s, Berry became a Baptist minister and lost 100 lbs after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He made a living during this time mostly through making public appearances as Rerun.|$|R
500|$|Despite the <b>earlier</b> <b>cancellation</b> announcement, {{the players}} and the league hoped that a full 82-game {{schedule}} could be salvaged if a deal is reached in time.

He said that Hunter was unwilling [...] "to go a penny below 52%" [...] on BRI, while Hunter said, [...] "We made a lot of concessions, but unfortunately at this time it's not enough." [...] Stern indicated that an 82-game season was no longer possible. He added that tentative agreement was reached for maximum contract lengths of five years for players staying with their teams or four years when signing with another team.|$|R

50|$|Cricket {{is quite}} popular in both nations and teams of both {{countries}} have competed {{against each other in}} international matches.

In 2008, when Pakistan was hosting the Champions Trophy, New Zealand toured Pakistan to play three matches following Australia's decision to postpone their tour until March 2009. However, in 2009, following the attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore, Pakistan, New Zealand Cricket announced it would most likely call off its December tour of Pakistan.|$|R

5000|$|Berry's departure, however, {{was more}} acrimonious. After the first season, Berry {{went to the}} {{producers}} {{and asked for a}} significant raise. Due to the popularity of his character, Berry believed he was the only reason viewers tuned in every week and that it should be reflected in his salary. Berry quit the series when the producers would not acede to his demands, and in retaliation the writers removed Rerun from the series continuity altogether (a practice referred to as [...] "Chuck Cunningham syndrome", where a character is dropped from a series and then treated as if he/she never existed). Berry's widow, Essie Berry, told Urbanite magazine at Georgia State University that their unwillingness to pay Fred Berry his due in both shows led to their <b>early</b> <b>cancellations.</b>|$|R

50|$|By 2014-15, {{the court}} show {{made it to}} its 16th season, making Mathis the longest serving African American court show {{arbitrator}}, beating out Judge Joe Brown whose program lasted 15 seasons. Moreover, Mathis holds a record of second longest serving court show arbitrator ever, just behind Judith Sheindlin of the court show Judge Judy. Judge Mathis is among few courtroom programs able to boast a long, successful run as most court shows suffer the fate of <b>early</b> <b>cancellations.</b> It is the fourth longest running courtroom series behind Divorce Court, The People's Court, and Judge Judy, respectively. Though both Divorce Court and The People's Court have suffered cancellation(s) and shifting arbitrators, Judge Mathis has not. Consequently, of the court shows with only one production life, Judge Mathis is the second longest running, second only to Judge Judy.|$|R

500|$|For {{many years}} {{it was assumed that}} Monteverdi had written much of the music for Licori before its sudden cancellation; Redlich says the music was {{finished}} by 10 September 1627. The work's rejection and subsequent disappearance have been blamed on Striggio's disregard for Monteverdi's efforts. However, Tomlinson's reading of the correspondence suggests a different conclusion: Monteverdi, in his view, [...] "did not even come close to completing the score" [...] and may have written very little of the music. It is likely that he stopped composing at the end of July, having become suspicious of Striggio's true commitment to the work. Tomlinson suggests that, mindful of Mantua's <b>earlier</b> <b>cancellation</b> of Le nozze di Tetide, Monteverdi avoided extending himself on the new project, while maintaining a diplomatic impression of activity. Tomlinson writes: [...] "t would hardly be surprising if Monteverdi were preternaturally sensitive to signs of Mantuan vacillation [...] if, at the first such signs in 1627, he decided to move cautiously in the composition of Licori." [...] Strozzi's libretto has vanished along with whatever music Monteverdi managed to write, but Strozzi wrote a second libretto under the same name, which was set by Francesco Sacrati and produced in Venice in 1641.|$|R
40|$|In, 2008 and 2009 {{a series}} of online {{professional}} development communities for groups of teacher-leaders in digital pedagogy was run. In {{each of the first}} two iterations, there was an early dropout of individuals who felt they ‘did not belong’. Contributing to this sense of isolation was the immediate emergence of online networks in the introductions forums. These networks grew between individuals who were either more extrovert online communicators, or who had pre-existing networks that were re-connected through community membership. In subsequent communities, a social networking approach to pairing and grouping teachers was taken. The results indicated that the targeted group of individuals in the paired groups felt comfortable, welcome and supported within the community. In all groups in which the partnerships were established, there were no <b>early</b> <b>cancellations</b> of enrolment. In this paper I argue that it is likely that a group of individuals in an online environment community through either facilitated or non-facilitated networking with a small group/individual focus can successfully develop the potential to support engagement in community activity with a whole-group focus. I also contend that it is critical to distinguish networking activity from episodes of community formation, as the purposes and goals of each of these activity types are quite different...|$|R
