40|$|The {{ability of}} {{angiotensin}} I (Ang I) and II (Ang II) to induce directly protein degradation in skeletal muscle {{has been studied}} in murine myotubes. Angiotensin I stimulated protein degradation with a parabolic dose–response curve and with a maximal effect between 0. 05 and 0. 1 [*]μM. The effect was attenuated by coincubation with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>imidaprilat,</b> suggesting that angiotensin I stimulated protein degradation through conversion to Ang II. Angiotensin II also stimulated protein breakdown with a similar dose–response curve, and with a maximal effect between 1 and 2. 5 [*]μM. Total protein degradation, induced by both Ang I and Ang II, was attenuated by the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin (5 [*]μM) and MG 132 (10 [*]μM), suggesting that the effect was mediated through upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome proteolytic pathway. Both Ang I and Ang II stimulated an increased proteasome ‘chymotrypsin-like' enzyme activity {{as well as an}} increase in protein expression of 20 S proteasome α-subunits, the 19 S subunits MSS 1 and p 42, at the same concentrations as those inducing protein degradation. The effect of Ang I was attenuated by <b>imidaprilat,</b> confirming that it arose from conversion to Ang II. These results suggest that Ang II stimulates protein degradation in myotubes through induction of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Protein degradation induced by Ang II was inhibited by insulin-like growth factor and by the polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid. These results suggest that Ang II has the potential to cause muscle atrophy through an increase in protein degradation. The highly lipophilic ACE inhibitor imidapril (Vitor™) (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) attenuated the development of weight loss in mice bearing the MAC 16 tumour, suggesting that Ang II {{may play a role in}} the development of cachexia in this model...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II (Ang II) {{has been}} implicated in muscle protein loss in cachexia. To {{determine}} whether the Ang I/II system directly inhibits protein synthesis in muscle their effect has been monitored in vitro using murine myotubes as a surrogate model system. Ang I inhibited protein synthesis by 40 - 50 % over the concentration range of 0. 05 - 2. 5 μM within 30 min of addition, and the inhibition remained relatively constant over 24 h. The effect was attenuated by co-incubation with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor <b>imidaprilat</b> (50 μM) suggesting that inhibition of protein synthesis {{was due to the}} formation of Ang II. Ang II also inhibited protein synthesis by 40 - 50 % over the concentration range of 0. 1 - 5 μM, and the inhibition also remained relatively constant between 30 min and 24 h after addition. The effect was attenuated by insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) (25 - 100 ng/ml). Thus, Ang I/II have the ability to induce muscle atrophy through inhibition of protein synthesis. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) {{have been}} identified in human carboxylesterases (Kim et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2008; Yamada et al., 2010). Some of the SNPs are localized in the promoter or coding regions that affect protein expression or enzyme activity. Particularly, a coding SNP (GGG to GAG) in CES 1 exon 4 results in Gly 143 Glu substitution. Gly 143 resides in the oxyanion hole-forming domain (HGGG 143) that {{plays an important role in}} CES 1 catalytic activity. Ectopic expression of CES 1 carrying this mutation confirmed significant reduction of its esterase activity in vitro (Zhu et al., 2008). The minor allele frequency of Gly 143 Glu was determined to be 3.7 %, 4.3 %, 2.0 %, and 0 % in Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations, respectively. A deletion in exon 6 at codon 260 results in a frameshift mutation and complete loss of hydrolytic activity. The Asp 260 fs appears to be a very rare mutation (Zhu et al., 2008). A SNP A(− 816)C localized in the promoter region of CES 1 gene increases transcriptional efficiency (Geshi et al., 2005). Patients carrying the A(− 816)C SNP showed enhanced anti-hypertension response to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor imidapril, which is converted to its active metabolite, <b>imidaprilat,</b> by CES 1 (Geshi et al., 2005). CES 1 inactivates the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel through ester hydrolysis. The A(− 816)C variation attenuates responsiveness to clopidogrel in patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The A(− 816)C polymorphism was not observed to be significantly associated with stent thrombosis occurrence in this study (Xie et al., 2014).|$|E
