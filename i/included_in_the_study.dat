The monotypic section Meristocaulis was not <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> so its place in this system is unclear. More recent studies have placed this group near section Bryastrum, so it is placed there below. Also of note, the placement of the section Regiae in relation to Aldrovanda and Dionaea is uncertain. Since the section Drosera is polyphyletic, it shows up multiple times in the cladogram (*).|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test were <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they {{were found to have}} dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
5|$|Voalavo {{is part of}} the {{subfamily}} Nesomyinae, {{which includes}} nine genera that are all restricted to Madagascar. Before the discoveries of Monticolomys (published in 1996) and Voalavo (1998), all of the known genera within Nesomyinae were quite distinct from each other, so much so that phylogenetic relationships among them long remained obscure. Like Monticolomys (closely related to Macrotarsomys), however, Voalavo shows clear similarities to another nesomyine genus, Eliurus. In their description of Voalavo, Carleton and Goodman argued that, although closely related, Eliurus and Voalavo form separate monophyletic groups; but a 1999 molecular phylogenetic study by Sharon Jansa and colleagues, who compared cytochrome b sequences among nesomyines and other rodents, found that northern voalavo was more closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat than to other species of Eliurus. This finding called into question the separate generic status of Voalavo. However, tissue samples of Petter's tufted-tailed rat, a species that is thought to be closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, were not available, so this species could not be <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Data from nuclear genes also supports the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) {{began an}} ambitious pay for {{performance}} initiative in 2004, {{known as the}} Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). General practitioners agreed to increases in existing income according to performance with respect to 146 quality indicators covering clinical care for 10 chronic diseases, organization of care, and patient experience. Unlike proposed quality incentive programs in the United States, funding for primary care was increased 20% over previous levels. This allowed practices to invest in extra staff and technology; 90% of general practitioners use the NHS Electronic Prescription Service, and up to 50% use electronic health records {{for the majority of}} clinical care. Early analysis showed that substantially increasing physicians' pay based on their success in meeting quality performance measures is successful.

25|$|The {{figure in}} the drawing relates to a woman seated in the lower left {{foreground}} of the painting. <b>Included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> are narrative details such as the nails of the cross, held in her left hand, and the crown of thorns in her right. Although the drawing's attribution has been doubted, it is now accepted as authentic. The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model. The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light bistre, and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink. Lateral strokes were placed at the bottom to indicate the ground plane, and touches of white body color were added to details of the figure. Rare for a drawing by Michelangelo is the pink ground, in this case achieved by rubbing crushed red chalk onto the paper.|$|E

25|$|The International Anthropomorphic Research Project, a team {{of social}} {{scientists}} from various disciplines led by Plante, Reysen, Roberts, and Gerbasi, has been collecting data on the furry fandom using numerous methodologies. Their 2016 publication collects several peer-reviewed and self-published studies into a single volume. Among their findings: The average adult furry is between 23–27 years of age, with more than 75% of adult furries reporting being 25 {{years of age or}} younger, and 88% of adult furries being under the age of 30. Minors were not <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> for professional ethics reasons. Gender identity: 78-85% of furries identify as male, nearly 2% of furries identify as transgender, the remaining identify as female. Ethnicity: 83-90% of furries self-identify as White, with small minorities of furries self-identifying as Asian (2-4%), Black (2-3%), and Hispanic (3%). Furries' participation in other fandoms: 21% of furries consider themselves to be a , 44% consider themselves to be anime fans, and 11% consider themselves sport fans. Furries, as a group, are more politically liberal and less religious than the average American or other comparable fan groups such as anime fans, while still containing contentious groups such as neo-Nazis and alt-right activists whose affiliation is partly in jest and partly in earnest. Religion: 54% of furries self-identified as atheist or agnostic, 23% as Christian, 4% as Pagan, 2% as Wiccan, and the remainder identified with other religions. Approximately 70% of adult furries have either completed, or are currently completing post-secondary education.|$|E
25|$|It is a predatory species, {{with several}} studies {{conducted}} to determine its diet and feeding habits. A study in the Cape Blanc region found Branchiostoma lanceolatum (a cephalochordate), euphausiids, small fish and other small crustaceans were the predominantly taken food items, with a surprising absence of copepods which other small species <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> did take. This lack of copepods in the false scad's diet was also noticed in an earlier similar study, which looked at the diet of slightly smaller fish. A much later study in the same location found similar results, with fish being the most common prey followed by crustaceans including shrimps and mysids, molluscs and annelids. There {{is a change in}} the diet of the species as it grows, with one study finding 23 to 30cm long fish took Branchiostoma lanceolatum predominantly, 30 to 35cm fish took euphausiids and mysids, while 35 to 55cm fish consumed small fishes of the families Maurolicidae and Carangidae predominantly. A similar pattern has been seen in other studies, with a general pattern of decreasing amounts of crustaceans and increasing amounts of small fish consumed as the fish grows. Seasonal variation in prey items is also known, with crustaceans dominating the diet during autumn and winter, while small fish are more frequently taken in summer. The feeding intensity of the species is lowest during the winter months, with the species feeding predominantly around mid day, and not at all during the night.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Eric Pasquet, et al. {{published}} a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species. Though S. leucopsis was not <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> {{it found that}} within the nuthatch group covered, S. przewalskii is basal—an ancestor at the base (or root)—to the nuthatch evolutionary family tree, and thus [...] "sister to all other nuthatches, without any close relatives". The findings resulted from phylogenetic analyses (employing Bayesian inference and the maximum likelihood methods). A biogeographical analysis (using the dispersal-extinction–cladogenesis model) was then performed. The cladogram drawn from the evidence indicates that the first clade and closest descendants of Przevalski's nuthatch are the North American white-breasted nuthatch and the giant nuthatch (S. magna), dispelling the hypothesis that S. przewalskii could {{belong to the same}} species as S. carolinensis.|$|E

500|$|A 1998 genetic {{study of}} species {{boundaries}} in Australian free-tailed bats (Family Mollossidae) {{indicated that the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat (referred to as Mormopterus sp 6) {{was one of a}} group of eight distinct and unresolved genetic groups in the Australian Mormopterus. Mormopterus sp 6 was genetically distinct from all other types, however only a single specimen from central Australia was <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> [...] Accumulation of additional specimens (n=24) in Museum collections and targeted trapping facilitated formal description of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat in 2008 on the basis of morphology, the results of allozyme electrophoresis and investigation of echolocation call characteristics. Further resolution of the Australian Molossidae has shown that the bristle-faced free-tailed bat and the east-coast free-tailed bat (Mormopterus norfolkensis) are only distantly related to other Australian Mollosid taxa, and the differences between these two species and remaining taxa in the Mormopterus 'planiceps group lead to the erection of three new subgenera in 2014. These subgenera include Setirostris (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for Mormopterus eleryi, Micronomus (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for Mormopterus norfolkensis and Ozimops (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for the remaining seven Australian taxa and several Indo-Papuan forms formerly in the planiceps group. The subgeneric name Setirostris (seta + rostrum) refers to the characteristic bristles on the face of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat [...] and the specific name eleryi is for Elery Hamilton-Smith in recognition of contributions to bat research and conservation.|$|E
