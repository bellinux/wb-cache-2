2500|$|There are two ideas {{fundamental}} to duality theory. One {{is the fact}} that (for the symmetric dual) the dual of a dual linear program is the original primal linear program. Additionally, every feasible solution for a linear program gives a bound on the optimal value of the objective function of its dual. [...] The weak <b>duality</b> <b>theorem</b> states that the objective function value of the dual at any feasible solution is always {{greater than or equal to}} the objective function value of the primal at any feasible solution.

2500|$|A linear {{program can}} also be {{unbounded}} or infeasible. Duality theory tells us that if the primal is unbounded then the dual is infeasible by the weak <b>duality</b> <b>theorem.</b> Likewise, if the dual is unbounded, then the primal must be infeasible. However, {{it is possible for}} both the dual and the primal to be infeasible. As an example, consider the linear program: ...|$|E

2500|$|In other words, {{each group}} element [...] is {{identified}} to the evaluation character on the dual. This is strongly {{analogous to the}} canonical isomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space and its double dual, [...] However, {{there is also a}} difference: [...] is isomorphic to its dual space , although not canonically so, while many groups are not isomorphic to their dual groups (for instance [...] but [...] as topological groups). If [...] is a finite abelian group, then [...] but this isomorphism is not canonical. Making this statement precise (in general) requires thinking about dualizing not only on groups, but also on maps [...] between the groups, in order to treat dualization as a functor and prove the identity functor and the dualization functor are not naturally equivalent. Also {{it should be noted that}} the <b>duality</b> <b>theorem</b> implies that for any group (not necessarily finite) the dualization functor is an exact functor.|$|E

30|$|The {{necessary}} and sufficient conditions for generalized minimax programming were first developed by Schmitendorf [5].
