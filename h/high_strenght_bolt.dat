40|$|Abstract. Laser welding is a {{well known}} process, so is GMAW. But the joining of the processes, the so called laser hybrid welding is not that known, yet. Looking into the laser welding we realise, after many years use {{that there are some}} {{limitations}} to the process. One of the most significant is that the process deals poorly with the ability to bridge gaps between plates that are to be joined. This has its drawbacks on welding economy, the tolerances on ingoing parts has to be very high, the laser process can not tolerate more than 0, 1 mm gap between the plates. The GMAW process on the other hand has the ability to deal with the joint tolerances in a better way, the backside is of course the productivity and the penetration properties. In the laser hybrid process where the two processes are joined in the same welding head, we are experienceing a great improvement in several properties. Gaps are no longer a big problem, the process can deal with gaps up to 2, 0 mm with the present technology, (it is possible to coop with larger gaps using an oscillation of the laser beam, but this is only on experimental stage yet). This now means that costs for ingoing parts will be reduced. Process stability at high welding speeds is acchived. There are many advantages in <b>high</b> <b>strenght</b> steels that are sensitive to heat input; better mechanical properties are possible to obtain. Looking at the stainless materials the process has many advantages, {{one of the most important}} is the joint volume reduction in thicker materials, another is the ability to weld in duplex stainless steels...|$|R

Initial response of joints with one bolt was studied, which {{is connected with}} plastic transformation of the material of plate {{in front of the}} bolt at low load due to high bearing pressures. The phenomena of the initial stiffness of bolts in bearing is described. For the analysis of the parameters, which effect the stiffness, a numerical parametric study was made. The initial stiffness of connections, defined by standard SIST EN 1993 - 1 - 8 was compared with actual response. A new formula of nominal elastic stiffness of connections was designed, which is appropriate also for connections with more then one bolt. To decribe global plastic response of bolted connections, deformation capacity of connections in bearing with one bolt was studied. With the analysis of the test specimens (Može, 2008, Remic, 2011) the displacement at maximum resistance of connections was evaluated. The main parameter is the end distance in the direction perpendicular to loading. In {{the second part of the}} thesis the behaviour of long bolted connections was studied.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well-known}} {{from the literature}} that an interaction effect on crack propagation arises when a specimen or a component is subjected to variable amplitude loading. In dependence of the applied load sequence, {{a certain amount of}} retardation or acceleration onto fatigue crack growth rate can then be observed if compared to the constant amplitude case. In the case of structural ductile materials, the interaction phenomenon is mainly addressed by the local plasticity at the crack tip and can be explained, from a global point of view, by adopting the crack closure concept. Considering the applicative case of railway axles, a good correlation between crack growth interaction effects under variable amplitude loading and the amount of plasticity-induced crack closure has been previously derived by the authors, relatively to the standardized EA 1 N steel. The other standardized European steel for railway axles, a 25 CrMo 4 grade named EA 4 T, is instead considered in the present research, as well as an <b>high</b> <b>strenght</b> steel grade. An experimental campaign was carried on this material, using SE(T) specimens, in order to understand and quantify the interaction effects arising from relevant load sequences derived from service. Firstly, tests were performed directly applying the acquired load time history. Eventually, the load history was transformed into an equivalent block loading sequence and applied to different specimens varying the number of cycles of each single block. Finally, the experimental outcomes were modeled adopting both a strip yield model and a simple no-interaction approach, in order to quantify the possible interaction effects. The modeling was carried out considering different experimental techniques for deriving the crack growth and threshold behaviors of the material, i. e. the traditional ΔK-decreasing technique and the compression pre-cracking one...|$|R

[2]It is based on well-known selective permeation process of gas through a polymer, whose selectivity for two different gas is the ratio of their permeability coefficients P. In the last years have been developed methods to fabricate ultra-thin membrane,[3] but there’s no estimation of P. Moreover, even if for thick membrane there is some results, the dependence of P from the thickness is generally poorly investigated. Here we present a novel method to fabricate stable and resistant ultra thin PDMS membranes, and we show their gas permeation characteristics as function of the membrane thickness {{and the type of}} gas: CO 2 and He. The membranes have been fabricated by spin coating with thickness in the range between few micron and 500 nm. Afterwards, in order to guarantee the necessary mechanical stability, they have been transferred on SiN membrane previously drilled by focused ion beam with a number of apertures such that to have an appropriate permeation area (Fig. 1). Permeability measurements have been performed in high vacuum chamber, where the membranes have been exposed to 105 Pa of pressure differential without rupturing or stretching, proving their <b>high</b> <b>strenght.</b> The results confirm the higher permeability of the carbon dioxide respect to those of helium, whereas the value of P decreases unexpectedly with the membrane thickness, on the contrary of the CO 2 /He selectivity that remains constant.

Rare earth element (REE), Cr-Ni, and Th/Sc-Sc systematics is equivalent for both facies and consistent with a dominantly post-Archean source area. Detrital monazite chemical ages restrict major provenance for the Appekunny and Grinnell sandstones and argillites to Paleoproterozoic terranes at ~ 1800 - 1600 Ma, minor contributions at ~ 1600 - 1500 Ma, and marginal contributions from Archean terranes at ~ 2600, likely in Laurentia. Similar detrital age spectra for monazites of argillites and sandstones of the Appekunny Formation are consistent with a common provenance for the two facies. The Belt-Purcell sequence records three major diagenetic stages displayed in argillites and sandstones: (1) K-addition and rare earth element post-Archean upper continental crust (PA-UCC) -like pattern; (2) a stage characterized by heavy REE enrichment relative to light REE and HFSE fractionation, and U and Ce mobility; and (3) local dolomitization with REE and <b>high</b> field <b>strenght</b> elements (HFSE) mobility. REE and HFSE mobility are interpreted {{as the result of}} oxidized alkaline brines developed by dissolution of evaporites. Monazites from the Appekunny and Grinnell formations differ compositionally and texturally in two groups. Rounded or inclusions with ages >~ 1400 Ma, interpreted as detrital, have higher Th 2 O, Y 2 O 3 and lower LREE/HREE contents than euhedral individual monazite grains with chemical age...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{formulate}} a development strategy of tourism management of Saluopa Water Fall in Poso. This research was conducted {{in the village of}} Wera Pamona Puselemba in Poso Regency. The data were collected through direct interview with the key informants and observations. The data is then analyzed by SWOT analysis. The results show that the <b>highest</b> of <b>strenght</b> factor is the object of the waterfall itself with a score of 0. 7. While, the potential of natural resources of flora and fauna have not been optimally utilized with a score of 0. 696667. It is categorised as the highest of weakness factor. In addition, the waterfall is located close to the cocoa plantations so that it is an opportunity for developing agro-tourism package and it may employee the local people. The score for this opportunity is 0. 926829. However, the security issue is the highest threat of Wera Saluopa waterfall management. The {{reason for this is that}} the area has still been affected by the trauma of social conflict with a score of 0. 893023. The results of SWOT analysis strategy show that the development of Wera Saluopa management is a strategy that supports the aggressive growth. Therefore, the potential attractions around the waterfall area and the utilization of cacao plantations should be maintained and preserved because the area can developed as agro-tourism package and has conomic value added for local communities...|$|R
40|$|SUBCELLULAR FRACTIONATION OF RAT LIVER REVEALED THAT THE MAIN HEPATIC PHOSPHORΥLASE KINASE ACTIVITY WAS LOCALIZED IN SOLUBLE CYTOSOL WHILE A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE ENZYME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SMOOTH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM MEMBRANES,NO ACTIVΙTY COULD BE DETECTED IN MEMBRANES OF ROUGH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM,PLASMA MEMBRANES,NUCLEI AND MITOCHONDRIA. THE MEMBRANE ASSOCIATION OF PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE WAS WEAK AND MOST OF THE ENZYME ACTIVITY WAS RELEASED TO SUPERΝATANT BY WASHING THE MEMBRANES IN A NEUTRAL BUFFER. THE AMOUNT OF THE ENZYME EXTRACTED FROM THE MEMBRANES WAS INCREASED IN THE PRESENCE OF <b>HIGH</b> IONIC <b>STRENGHT</b> IN THE DILUTION BUFFER,BUT EVEN IN THIS CASE A SMALL ACTIVITY WAS REMAINED TO ΤΗΕ FINAL MEMBRANE PELLET. PHOSPHORYLASE ΚΙΝASE MOLECULES ATTACHED TO THE MEMBRANE MOST PROBABLY REPRESENT A DIFFERENT POPULATION WITH HYDROPHOBIC CHARACTERISTICS. THIS TIGHT ASSOCIATION WAS CONFIRMED WITH THE USE OF NON-IONIC DETERGENTS SUCH AS TRITON X- 100,TRITON X- 114,SODIUM DEOXYCHOLATE. WITH THIS METHOD A SMALL ONLY AMOUNT OF THE ENZYME WAS EXTRACTED. THE BINDING OF KINASE TO THE MEMBRANES WAS DIRECT AND NOT INDERMEDIATE THROUGH GLYCOGEN THAT COEXISTS IN THE CELL. THIS WAS PROVED BY COMPARING A) THE ENZYME ACTIVITY IN NORMAL AND 48 H FASTED RATS (WHERE GLYCOGEN WAS COMPLETELY DEPLETED). THE AMOUNT OF PHOSPHOLYRASE KINASE IN SMOOTH ENDOPLASMIC MEMBRANES IN THESE TWO CASES WAS SIMILAR,B) INCUBATION OF THE MEMBRANES WITH A-AMYLASE (AMYLOLISIS) DIDN'T SIGNIFIGANTLY ALTER THIS RESULT. SEVERAL DIFFERENCES IN STRUCTURAL AND CATALYTICAL RPOPERTIES OF CATOSOLIC AND MEMBRANE ENZYME WERE EXAMINED. IN CONCLUSION,IT MUST BE EMP...|$|R
