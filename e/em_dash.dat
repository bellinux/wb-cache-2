5|$|Fields with an <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> (—) are not applicable.|$|E
5|$|Statistics {{above are}} current as of January8, 2017. An <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> (—) {{indicates}} that the category is not applicable.|$|E
25|$|When an <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> is {{unavailable}} in {{a particular}} character encoding environment—as in the ASCII character set—it has usually been approximated as a double(--) or triple(---) hyphen-minus. The two-hyphen <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> proxy is perhaps more common, being a widespread convention in the typewriting era. (It is still described for hard copy manuscript preparation in the Chicago Manual of Style as of the 16th edition, although the manual conveys that typewritten manuscript and copyediting on paper are now dated practices). The three-hyphen <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> proxy was popular with various publishers because the sequence of one, two, or three hyphens could then correspond to the hyphen, en dash, and <b>em</b> <b>dash,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|In Spanish, <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> {{can be used}} to mark off parenthetical phrases. Unlike in English, the <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> are spaced like brackets, i.e., {{there is}} a space between main {{sentence}} and dash, but not between parenthetical phrase and dash.Una bandada de gorriones —algunos de ellos jóvenes— se posó y cantó.|$|R
25|$|Three <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> {{might be}} used to {{indicate}} a completely missing word.|$|R
2500|$|Compare commas, <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> and {{parentheses}} (respectively) when no internal commas intervene: ...|$|R
25|$|The en dash – {{always with}} spaces in running text when, as {{discussed}} in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced <b>em</b> <b>dash.</b> Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the not spaced <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated {{by the use of}} thin spaces, hair spaces, or even zero-width spaces {{on the sides of the}} <b>em</b> <b>dash.</b> This provides the appearance of a not spaced <b>em</b> <b>dash,</b> but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.|$|E
25|$|Either an {{ellipsis}} or an <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> can indicate aposiopesis, {{the rhetorical}} device {{by which a}} sentence is stopped short not because of interruption, but because the speaker is too emotional or pensive to continue. Because the ellipsis is the more common choice, an <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> for this purpose may be ambiguous in expository text, as many readers would assume interruption, {{although it may be}} used to indicate great emotion in dramatic monologue.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no support}} in the {{standard}} TeX fonts, but one can use \hbox{---}\kern-.5em--- instead, or just use an <b>em</b> <b>dash.</b>|$|E
25|$|Three <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> {{can be used}} in a footnote, endnote, or {{bibliography}} {{to indicate}} repetition of the same author, like Ibid.|$|R
2500|$|In Middle Modern English {{texts and}} afterward, <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> {{have been used}} to add long pauses (as noted by Joseph Robertson's 1785 An Essay On Punctuation): ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its suite of syntax usage, Textile automatically inserts character entity references for apostrophes, opening and closing single and double quotation marks, ellipses and <b>em</b> <b>dashes,</b> to name a few.|$|R
25|$|The en dash is {{wider than}} the hyphen but not {{as wide as the}} <b>em</b> <b>dash.</b> An em width is defined as the point size of the {{currently}} used font, since the M character is not always the width of the point size. In running text, various dash conventions are employed: an em dash—like so—or a spaced <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> — like so — or a spaced en dash – like so – can be seen in contemporary publications.|$|E
25|$|On a {{practical}} note, when the <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> is set closed (not surrounded by spaces), it makes highlighting in ebooks difficult, as two words are often treated as conjoined.|$|E
25|$|In TeX, an <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> (—) is typed {{as three}} hyphen‐minuses (---), an en dash (–) as two hyphen‐minuses (--), and a hyphen (‐) as one hyphen‐minus (-). Mathematical minus (−) is {{signified}} as $-$ or \(-\).|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, the Style manual (For authors, {{editors and}} printers, Sixth edition), also {{specifies}} that <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> inserted between words, {{a word and}} numeral, or two numerals, should be set closed. A section on the 2-em rule (⸺) also explains that the 2-em {{can be used to}} mark an abrupt break in direct or reported speech, but a space is used before the 2-em if a complete word is missing, while no space is used if part of a word exists before the sudden break. Two examples of this are as follows (properly typeset 2-em and 3-em dashes should appear as a single dash, but they may show on this page as several <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> with spaces in between): ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Text from Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde as {{it might}} appear in a professionally {{published}} edition in the United States today, featuring one-sentence paragraphs, sentences beginning with the conjunctions [...] "but" [...] and [...] "and", single sentence spacing, hyphens and <b>em</b> <b>dashes,</b> and typographic quotation marks.|$|R
50|$|Also built in, is {{a support}} of long words {{division}} (with respect for language rules), roll-over images, clickable emails and URL (emails are obfuscated against spambots) and auto-correct tool for several typographic issues: national single and double quotation marks, ellipses, <b>em</b> <b>dashes,</b> dimension sign, nonbreakable spaces (e.g. in phone numbers), acronyms, arrows and many others.|$|R
25|$|Cells {{marked with}} an <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> (—) {{indicate}} the player {{did not participate}} in that competition because the club did not qualify, was eliminated, or the player was no longer with the club {{before the start of the}} competition.|$|E
25|$|Either the en dash or the <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> {{may be used}} as {{a bullet}} at the start of each item in a bulleted list, but a plain hyphen is more {{commonly}} used (and even mandatory in formats like Markdown).|$|E
25|$|In many languages, such as Polish, the <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> {{is used as}} {{an opening}} {{quotation}} mark. There is no matching closing quotation mark; typically a new paragraph will be started, introduced by a dash, for each turn in the dialog.|$|E
25|$|Typewriters {{and early}} {{computers}} have traditionally {{had only a}} limited character set, often having no key that produces a dash. In consequence, it became common to substitute the nearest available punctuation mark or symbol. <b>Em</b> <b>dashes</b> are often represented in British usage by a single hyphen-minus surrounded by spaces, or in American usage by two hyphen-minuses surrounded by spaces.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{computer}} software typically has support {{for many more}} characters and is usually capable of rendering both the en and <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> correctly—albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit character encoding, and when unencodable characters are entered—for example by pasting from the clipboard—they are often blindly converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to <b>em</b> and en <b>dashes,</b> even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.|$|R
5000|$|Mojibake in English texts {{generally}} {{occurs in}} punctuation, such as <b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> ( [...] - [...] ), en dashes ( [...] - [...] ), and curly quotes (“,”,‘,’), but rarely in character text, since most encodings agree with ASCII on the encoding of the English alphabet. For example, the pound sign [...] "£" [...] will appear as [...] "Â£" [...] {{if it was}} encoded by the sender as UTF-8 but interpreted by the recipient as CP1252 or ISO 8859-1. If iterated, {{this can lead to}} [...] "Ã‚Â£", [...] "Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£", [...] "ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£", etc.|$|R
25|$|An <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> (or an en dash) denotes a {{break in}} a {{sentence}} or to set off parenthetical statements. Glitter, felt, yarn, and buttons—his kitchen looked as if a clown had exploded.A flock of sparrows—some of them juveniles—alighted and sang.|$|E
25|$|Because early {{comic book}} letterers {{were not aware}} of the typographic {{convention}} of replacing a typewritten double hyphen with an <b>em</b> <b>dash,</b> the double hyphen became traditional in American comics. This practice has continued despite the development of computer lettering.|$|E
25|$|Any kind of dash {{can be used}} {{directly}} in an HTML document, but HTML also lets them be entered using character references. The <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> and the en dash are special in {{that they can be}} written using character entity references as &mdash; and &ndash;, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In GNU/Linux, under recent {{versions}} of GTK+, {{there are various}} methods of producing these <b>dashes.</b> For <b>em</b> <b>dashes,</b> one may use the compose key followed by three presses of the hyphen character. For en dashes, one may press the compose key followed by two hyphens and a period. For all dashes, one may press and hold ctrl and shift and then press u (and release them all) after which an underlined u appears. Then, type the Unicode number (i.e., 2015) for the appropriate dash and press enter or the space bar. Also, other keys may be remapped to create dashes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Em</b> <b>dashes</b> used as parenthetical dividers, and en dashes {{when used}} as word joiners, are usually set {{continuous}} with the text. However, such a dash can optionally be surrounded with a hair space, U+200A, or thin space, U+2009. The hair space {{can be written}} in HTML by using the numeric character references [...] or , or the named entity , but is not universally supported in browsers yet, [...] The thin space is named entity [...] and numeric references [...] or [...] These spaces are much thinner than a normal space (except in a monospaced (non-proportional) font), with the hair space being the thinner of the two.|$|R
25|$|In French, <b>em</b> or en <b>dashes</b> {{can be used}} as {{parentheses}} (brackets), but the use of {{a second}} dash as a closing parenthesis is optional. When a closing dash is not used the sentence is ended with a period (full-stop) as usual. Dashes are, however, much less common than parentheses.|$|R
25|$|In Canada, The Canadian Style (A Guide to Writing and Editing), The Oxford Canadian A to Z of Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation, Guide to Canadian English Usage (Second Edition), Editing Canadian English Manual, and the Canadian Oxford Dictionary all specify that an <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> {{should be}} set closed when used between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals.|$|E
25|$|An <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> {{may be used}} to {{indicate}} omitted letters in a word redacted to an initial or single letter or to fillet a word, by leaving the start and end letters whilst replacing the middle letters with a dash or dashes (for the purposes of censorship or simply data anonymization). In this use, it is sometimes doubled.|$|E
25|$|The <b>em</b> <b>dash</b> is used {{in several}} ways: {{primarily}} in places where a set of parentheses or a colon might otherwise be used, it can show an abrupt change in thought or be used where a full stop (period) is too strong and a comma too weak. Em dashes are also used to set off summaries or definitions. Common uses and definitions are cited below with examples.|$|E
50|$|ISO/IEC 9995-10 {{specifies}} several symbols {{to enable}} the unique identification of characters on keytops which otherwise can easily be misidentified (as <b>em</b> vs. en <b>dashes).</b> Also, it specifies a way to present diacritical marks, especially on dead keys. There is a publicly available listing of these symbols in a proposal to encode them as Unicode characters (which is still pending, as of March 2017).|$|R
40|$|The {{workshops}} {{taken at}} the SFU Summer School were all very good and, for the most part, very applicable to my job at AU as a communication officer/writer. Six of the seven courses were equally useful for writing as they were for editing. Each successive course built on the previous ones. There was usually some useful review {{at the beginning of}} each course. The first course was Copyediting and Proofreading. The instructor was Ruth Wilson. Copyediting comes after the substantive edit (re-writing and organizing major parts of a document) and, as such, deals primarily with correcting grammar and usage. Much of the class covered elements of grammar such as spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, number styles, punctuation, wordiness, common writing errors (and non-errors), usage, and also samples of style sheets and how to develop them. Much of this information would be repeated in subsequent courses and this served as an excellent introduction. We learned proper editing and proofreading symbols as well as a useful list of frequently misspelled words. In this course there was a great deal of discussion of the role and responsibility of the editor and how much (and how) the editor might change the writer’s work. The proofreading section dealt with the nuts and bolts required for proofreading (style sheet, quiet, concentration, good light, printed copy of document, ruler, dictionary, style guide) and the kinds of elements to look for in the first, second and third edits. We were also introduced to “Professional Editorials Standards” (2009) from the Editors’ Association of Canada (EAC). The next five courses were of the greatest use to me as a writer and as an editor. The courses included grammar, punctuation and mechanics, usage, style and syntax, all of which are related. This provided more review of grammar and application. The instructor for the grammar course was Vlad Konieczny. In any grammar course there is always something new and some review, as was the case here. My general difficulty with grammar is that while I (usually) know when something is correct or incorrect, I often don’t know the grammatical basis for it; I cannot analyze the sentence. While that is fine as a writer, as an editor, if I’m going to change someone else’s material, I should be able to justify or explain why I’m doing it. This was a very helpful course. The instructor for the next four courses, Frances Peck, is a very knowledgeable and experienced editor and writer. She has an excellent idea of how to apply the material for professional writers and editors. She stressed the importance of consistency. A number of uses, spellings, and style issues were covered which can be correctly handled in a number of different ways. She said the important thing is to choose a style and use it consistently. It is important for an institution, writer, or editor to develop a style sheet (either for the institution or for the particular project) which outlines what style and spellings have been used and the reference material that has been used. I also learned the importance of referring to good style and usage guides such as Fowler’s Modern English Usage and the Chicago Style Guide (Communication and Creative Services at AU uses the Canadian Press Style Guide but the Chicago Style Guide is much more comprehensive.) Usage is the correct application of grammar, how to use the elements of language, and how usage changes over time, such as; -Do not use “action” as a verb as in; It is imperative that you action these items as soon as possible. -You can possibly use (i. e. acceptance is in transition) “access” as a verb as in; You can access the full range of services here. -You can now use “liaise” as a verb (meaning to interact or communicate with) as in; Diane will liaise with the department on this project. The grammar course reviewed accurate usage, commonly misused and confused words and phrases (such as full and fulsome, historic and historical, intense and intensive) and myths, such as never starting a sentence with because and as being more correct than like. As with all of Peck’s classes, exercises were used as the basis for teaching and discussion. Punctuation and mechanics deals with interpretation (punctuation) and esthetics (mechanics). The course started with grammar: parts of speech; clauses and phrases; commas (when superfluous and when needed); comma splices; semicolons; colons; lists; italics; quotation marks; hyphens and <b>dashes</b> (<b>em</b> <b>dashes</b> and en dashes); and apostrophes. Style started with a quick grammar review and defining the steps in the writing process. The course covered consistency (in verb tense, in voice, in person and number, in style or tone), parallelism, flow, transitions, verbs, sentence length and structure, coordination and subordination, passive and active voice, and conciseness. Syntax is the word order within a sentence and the meaning that resides in the way the subject and verb are combined with other words and phrases. Some aspects covered were; the inverted sentence; passive and active voice; rhythm and sentence length, sentence openings, sentence type; flow and content; echo words; emphasis; and special techniques such as isolation and ellipses. Breaking down the various aspects of writing this way was very helpful to isolate and concentrate on one subject at a time. By the end of these five courses, a good review had taken place and a solid foundation had been developed. The last course, Developmental Editing, was the least useful only because it is not something I will ever do. I thought developmental editing was the same things as substantive editing but it is not. In developmental editing, the editor works with a subject matter expert who is not a strong writer and guides them through the writing process. Nonetheless, the instructor, Joy Gugeler, was very knowledgeable and experienced. The discussion of structure, style and organization was helpful to some extent in terms of writing. The discussion of particular books and elements such as plot, character, narrative, genre, etc., was very interesting from a reader’s point of view. In all of the courses, there were a number of good resources (print and online) recommended which will provide excellent reference material. Follow up for me will include the following: -Develop a style sheet which I will use consistently for my writing and which could be used as the basis of a style sheet for the department and/or university; -Organize the material from these courses into some format for easy reference (perhaps alphabetical list or subject matter list); -Purchase some of the resource material for the office; -Find ways to continue to improve my familiarity and knowledge of grammar and my knowledge of available grammar resources. Copy Editing and Proofreading: (2 days) This two-day workshop is ideal for anyone wanting an introduction to the world of publishing or communications, or for anyone currently called upon to improve the writing of others in their organization. The class incorporates group discussion and hands-on exercises while covering the following topics: editing marks; copyeditor’s responsibilities; finding and noting mistakes in spelling, punctuation, and grammar; striving for consistency; preparing style sheets; proofreading marks; the proofreader’s responsibilities; the proofreading process; technology and proofreading. Fundamentals of Grammar: (1 day) One of the best ways to increase confidence as a writer or editor is to gain a good command of grammar. If you find yourself occasionally confused by participles and gerunds, puzzled by dangling and squinting modifiers, and confounded by which and that or who and whom, this one-day workshop is for you. You will spend the morning reviewing the parts of speech, as well as phrases and clauses, punctuation, and sentence structure. The afternoon will be devoted to analyzing and correcting common errors. Punctuation and Mechanics: (1 day) Anyone who has agonized over a comma or a hyphen knows how tricky the details of punctuation and mechanics can be. We’ll take a systematic approach to the troublesome areas of punctuation and mechanics, focusing on commas (always the source of debate), semicolons, colons, bullet points, quotation marks, italics, apostrophes, and <b>dashes</b> (<b>em</b> and en). We’ll cover the most recent rules, discuss when more than one approach might be correct, and examine the leading style guides. Be prepared to practice, and bring along your most challenging questions. Punctuation and Mechanics will benefit editors and writers who need a refresher on the tricky areas of punctuation and mechanics. Usage Woes and Myths: (1 day) Word usage is an ever-changing area. First it’s wrong to use impact as a verb; then it’s okay. The distinction between fewer and less seems clear, but specific examples make you hesitate. You wonder about debated words such as hopefully and presently, and confusing words such as may and might. You’ve heard that you should never start a sentence with however, but, or because, but you’re not sure. If you are intent on preventing (not avoiding) word errors and avoiding (not preventing) usage myths, this workshop will help. Through discussion, examples, and exercises, we will review some of the most contentious points of English usage. Come prepared with your own usage questions and examples to share with the group. Usage Woes and Myths will benefit editors and writers who need an intensive review of recent changes and errors in word usage. Clear and Concise - Guidelines for Style: (1 day) Clear, concise writing may seem like the product of magic, instinct, or luck, but the pros know that it’s the result of learned techniques. This workshop covers tried-and-true revision techniques that improve consistency, clarity, flow, and conciseness. We’ll identify and eliminate shifts, link ideas using parallelism and subordination, trim wordy structures, and unearth the power of verbs. Through discussion, examples, and exercises, you’ll amass an arsenal of methods for making every word count. Clear and Concise will benefit writers and editors who want to know the best practical techniques for streamlining prose. The Secrets of Syntax: (1 day) This workshop looks at syntax from various angles, including how to shape it for different documents and audiences. Topics include subordination and coordination, periodic versus cumulative sentences, proximity of subject and verb, echo words, and special techniques such as ellipsis and isolation.  The Secrets of Syntax will benefit writers and editors who want a more systematic understanding of how reshaping language can make it clearer and more powerful. Developmental Editing for Fiction and Non-fiction: (2 days) This two-day workshop will demonstrate how assessment criteria, a survey of alternative options, market research, and some astute analysis can turn a half-baked idea into a fully cooked work that reaches readers. Using examples taken from students’ own works and before-and-after demos of real books and edits, you will be able to see how to apply judgment and new skills to the work at hand...|$|R
40|$|As áreas com plantios florestais estão constantemente em expansão, e a interferência das plantas daninhas alteram o crescimento e desenvolvimento de plantas de eucalipto, pois estas competem por água, nutrientes, espaço e luz. Objetivou-se com este estudo avaliar a seletividade do herbicida saflufenacil, aplicado com e sem óleo mineral <b>Dash,</b> <b>em</b> plantas de Eucalyptus urograndis, em diferentes locais de aplicação (planta, solo e solo + planta). O delineamento {{experimental}} adotado foi o inteiramente casualizado, com quatro repetições, constituído de um fatorial 3 x 11, sendo três locais de aplicação do herbicida na planta e 11 doses do herbicida saflufenacil combinadas ou não com o adjuvante Dash. Cada parcela constou de um vaso com uma planta. Os tratamentos usados foram: 0, 25, 25 +Dash (0, 5 % v/v), 50, 50 +Dash (0, 5 % v/v), 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 e 200 g i. a. ha- 1. Foram realizadas avaliações visuais de fitointoxicação durante 56 dias após aplicação (DAA). Avaliouse, ainda, a altura, o diâmetro de caule e a biomassa seca das plantas. Todas as doses testadas de saflufenacil sem adjuvante mostraram-se seletivas às plantas de E. urograndis, independentemente do local de aplicação. A adição de Dash aos tratamentos proporcionou injúrias severas às plantas nas avaliações iniciais, quando aplicado sobre as plantas, com a recuperação total destas no fim do ensaio, aos 56 DAA. A aplicação do herbicida em mistura com adjuvante somente no solo não causou intoxicação às plantas de eucalipto. Forest plantation {{areas are}} constantly expanding. However, weed interference affects {{the growth and}} development of eucalyptus plants, as they compete for water, nutrients, space, and light. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the selectivity of the herbicide saflufenacil, applied with or without the mineral oil Dash, on Eucalyptus urograndis at different application sites (plant, soil and soil + plant). The experimental design was completely randomized, with four replications, consisting of a 3 x 11 factorial, with three sites for herbicide application on the plant and eleven saflufenacil doses combined or not with the adjuvant Dash. Each plot consisted of a vase with a plant. Treatments were 0, 25, 25 + Dash (0. 5 % v/v), 50, 50 + Dash (0. 5 % v/v), 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200 g a. i. ha- 1. Visual evaluations of plant intoxication were carried out for 56 days after application (DAA). Height, stem diameter, and dry biomass of the plants were also evaluated. The saflufenacil doses tested without adjuvant proved to be selective for the plants of E. urograndis, independent of the application site. The addition of Dash to the treatments caused severe injuries to the plants at the initial assessments, when applied on the plants, with full recovery at the end of the test at 56 DAA. Herbicide application combined with the adjuvant only in the soil did not cause plant toxicity to the eucalyptus plants...|$|R
