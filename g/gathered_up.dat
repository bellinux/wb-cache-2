5|$|Over the summer, Stephen {{intensified}} the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{marked the}} end of Bryennios's revolt, {{although}} Nikephoros Basilakes <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> much of Bryennios's defeated army and attempted to claim the throne for himself. He too was defeated by Alexios Komnenos, who then proceeded to expel the Pechenegs from Thrace. The elder Bryennios was blinded on Botaneiates's orders, but the emperor later took pity on him and restored him his titles and his fortune. After Alexios Komnenos seized the throne himself in 1081, Bryennios was further honoured with high dignities. He even held command during Alexios's campaigns against the Pechenegs, and defended Adrianople from a rebel attack in 1095. His son or grandson, Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, was married to Alexios's daughter Anna Komnene. He became a prominent general of Alexios's reign, eventually raised to the rank of Caesar, and a historian.|$|E
5|$|Internazionale had {{the first}} attack of the match. With Renato Cappellini running down the wing and {{supplying}} a cross to Sandro Mazzola whose header hit Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson's knees. Internazionale won a penalty moments later. Jim Craig fouled Cappellini in the box, and Mazzola converted to put Inter in front after only six minutes. Once they had taken the lead, Internazionale retreated back into their defensive style, which allowed Celtic to attack. However, they struggled to get through Internazionale's defensive wall and were mainly restricted to long shots from outside the box. Bertie Auld hit the crossbar then a cross from Jimmy Johnstone was <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> by Giuliano Sarti, who then tipped a header from the same player over the crossbar. Internazionale pulled nine men back, but Celtic kept attacking them. Tommy Gemmell's dangerous free-kick was saved by Sarti, he then speculatively attempted to lob the Inter 'keeper and hit the bar. Despite Celtic's inability to break through their opponents defence they were in complete control of the match and Internazionale {{were not able to}} attack. Inter had not had another chance since their goal, whilst Celtic found themselves foiled time and again by outstanding goalkeeping from Sarti.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} held Hill 314 for {{the next}} six days and <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> a large amount of North Korean equipment and ammunition. The North Korean soldiers on Hill 314 wore American uniforms, helmets, and combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 North Korean dead were on the hill. Of the other 500 estimated to have been there, most of them had been wounded or were missing. Several war crimes committed by the North Koreans came to light during the action on Hill 314. On September 12 while the final action on the hill was taking place, troops discovered an American officer who had been bound, gasoline poured over him, and burned. Two days later members of the battalion found on the hill the bodies of four other American soldiers with their hands tied. The bodies bore evidence that the men had been bayoneted and shot while bound.|$|E

He was soon joined by Hohenzollern's force. Lipthay soon abandoned Peschiera, pursued by the French.

25|$|Artemis {{may have}} been {{represented}} as a supporter of Troy because her brother Apollo was the patron god {{of the city and}} she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the Iliad she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> the bow and arrows.|$|E

25|$|Under {{orders from}} King Frederick William III of Prussia to march for the Oder, Hohenlohe's corps {{set out from}} Magdeburg {{on the morning of}} 21 October. He {{reinforced}} the garrison with 9,000 men, but in the confusion other units and 39 field guns stayed in the fortress so that 25,000 troops were left behind. That evening, Hohenlohe reached Burg bei Magdeburg where he <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> Kalckreuth's column. His main body arrived at Genthin on the evening of the 22nd and Rathenow at nightfall on the 23rd. In order to feed his troops better, he split his command up into several columns.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two years}} after 1934, {{progressive}} Taiwanese writers <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> and established the Association of Taiwanese Literature and Art and New Taiwanese Literature. This literature and art movement was political in its implications. Also many historians highlights developments in modern drama and literature with the intimate integration between the art worlds of Tokyo and Taipei in the 1930s. From 1935 literacy writers and visual artists began to closely stimulate each other and looked to society for support. Mostly the novels were renowned for its distinct nationalist and social realistic expression whilst painting haven't produced works that merely decorators of the colonial period.|$|E
25|$|Having {{successfully}} escaped, Frank James joined Jesse in Nashville, Tennessee, {{where they}} spent {{the next three years}} living peacefully. Frank in particular seems to have thrived in his new life farming in the Whites Creek area. Jesse, however, did not adapt well to peace. Accordingly, he <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> new recruits, formed a new gang and returned to a life of crime. On October 8, 1879, Jesse and his gang robbed the Chicago and Alton Railroad near Glendale, Missouri. Unfortunately for Jesse, one of the men, Tucker Basham, was captured by a posse. He told authorities he had been recruited by Bill Ryan.|$|E

25|$|On {{the advice}} of {{acoustics}} firm, Kirkegaard Associates, the lack of reverberation and the difficult performance conditions for musicians were corrected by changes {{in the fabric of}} the auditorium. Surfaces that had previously absorbed sound were transformed to support and sustain that sound. The tapestries on the back walls of the boxes were <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> to increase reverberation, but can be redeployed, together with additional absorbent blinds above the stage and around the Hall whenever needed. The wooden wall panels of the Hall were relined to change their acoustic qualities and the undulating plaster ceiling panels were completely reconstructed using more robust materials to provide greater warmth of sound and support for bass frequencies.|$|E
25|$|While at Naco, Villa {{requested}} that several hundred of his wounded be trasported by rail through the United States to Juarez, Chiahuahua, as Carranza {{had been allowed}} to transport troops and supplies; that request was denied. After resting his troops at Naco, Villa <b>gathered</b> <b>up</b> the remainder of his forces and attacked the town of Hermosillo, Sonora, on November 21, 1915. In order to try to restore the morale of his troops, he promised them that after they took the city, they could do whatever they wanted with the town and its inhabitants. This actually ended up causing the attack to fail, as his men almost immediately turned to looting and rape rather than fighting, which allowed the defending forces to reorganize and drive the Villistas out.|$|E
