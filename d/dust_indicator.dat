These SFGs were targeted for spectroscopy as a result of their photometric redshifts. The VUDS spectra are used to measure the UV spectral slopes (beta) as well as Ly alpha equivalent widths (EW). On average, the spectroscopically measured beta (- 1. 36 +/- 0. 02), is comparable to the photometrically measured beta (- 1. 32 +/- 0. 02), and has smaller measurement uncertainties. The positive correlation of beta with the spectral energy distribution (SED) -based measurement of dust extinction E-s(B-V) emphasizes the importance of beta as an alternative <b>dust</b> <b>indicator</b> at high redshifts. To make a proper comparison, we divide these SFGs into three subgroups based on their rest-frame Ly alpha EW: SFGs with no Ly alpha emission (SFGN; EW = 0 angstrom), SFGs with Ly alpha emission (SFG(L); EW 0 angstrom), and Ly alpha emitters (LAEs; EW = 20 angstrom). The fraction of LAEs at these redshifts is beta 10...|$|E
40|$|Aerosols {{with large}} particles, such as dust or sea salt, can exert {{significant}} amounts of direct infrared (IR) forcing at the surface. For example, recent observations from Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE) -Asia indicate that the aerosol IR forcing at the surface can be a few Wm- 2 up to almost 10 Wm- 2 (Vogelmann et al. 2003, Markowicz et al. 2003). Further investigation indicates that the IR forcing pattern tends to correlate with the surface concentrations of submicron Ca ++, which {{may serve as a}} <b>dust</b> <b>indicator.</b> Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) observations of aerosol concentrations at Barrow indicate that submicron Ca ++ as well as Cl- concentrations can be large. This suggests that it may be possible that dust and sea salt exact a significant IR forcing at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site. We investigated this possibility using atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (AERI) observations and Line-by-Line Radiative Transfer Model (LBLRTM) calculations. We culled the aerosol observations for high and low concentrations of submicron Ca ++ and Cl-, and selected periods when the active remote sensing cloud layer (ARSCL) indicated clear-skies. LBLRTM calculations for an arctic winter atmosphere indicate that the 10 -µm window is most sensitive to the estimated uncertainties in the temperature profile, with a secondary uncertainty for the water vapor profile (due to the dry arcti...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{a sample of}} 2099 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars with z = 1. 7 - 2. 2 built from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven and the Wide-field Infrared Survey. This sample is collected from two BAL quasar samples in the literature and is refined by our new algorithm. Correlations of outflow velocity and strength with a hot <b>dust</b> <b>indicator</b> (beta(NIR)) and other quasar physical parameters-such as an Eddington ratio, luminosity, and a UV continuum slope-are explored in order {{to figure out which}} parameters drive outflows. Here beta(NIR) is the near-infrared continuum slope, which is a good indicator of the amount of hot dust emission relative to the accretion disk emission. We confirm previous findings that outflow properties moderately or weakly depend on the Eddington ratio, UV slope, and luminosity. For the first time, we report moderate and significant correlations of outflow strength and velocity with beta(NIR) in BAL quasars. It is consistent with the behavior of blueshifted broad emission lines in non-BAL quasars. The statistical analysis and composite spectra study both reveal that outflow strength and velocity are more strongly correlated with beta(NIR) than the Eddington ratio, luminosity, and UV slope. In particular, the composites show that the entire C iv absorption profile shifts blueward and broadens as beta(NIR) increases, while the Eddington ratio and UV slope only affect the high and low velocity part of outflows, respectively. We discuss several potential processes and suggest that the dusty outflow scenario, i. e., that dust is intrinsic to outflows and may contribute to the outflow acceleration, is most likely...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric dust is an {{important}} feedback in the climate system, potentially affecting the radiative balance and chemical composition of the atmosphere and providing nutrients to terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Yet {{the potential impact of}} dust on the climate system, both in the anthropogenically disturbed future and the naturally varying past, remains to be quantified. The geologic record of dust provides the opportunity to test earth system models designed to simulate dust. Records of dust can be obtained from ice cores, marine sediments, and terrestrial (loess) deposits. Although rarely unequivocal, these records document a variety of processes (source, transport and deposition) in the dust cycle, stored in each archive as changes in clay mineralogy, isotopes, grain size, and concentration of terrigenous materials. Although the extraction of information from each type of archive is slightly different, the basic controls on these <b>dust</b> <b>indicators</b> are the same. Changes in the dust flux and particle size might be controlled by a combination of (a) source area extent, (b) dust emission efficiency (wind speed) and atmospheric transport, (c) atmospheric residence time of dust, and/or (d) relative contributions of dry settling and rainout of dust. Similarly, changes in mineralogy reflect (a) source area mineralogy and weathering and (b) shifts in atmospheric transport. The combination of these geological data with process-based, forward-modelling schemes in global earth system models provides an excellent means of achieving a comprehensive picture of the global pattern of dust accumulation rates, their controlling mechanisms, and how those mechanisms may vary regionally.

40|$|Loess and the <b>Dust</b> <b>Indicators</b> and Records of Terrestrial and Marine Palaeoenvironments (DIRTMAP) databaseThe conterminous United States {{contains}} an extensive and generally well-studied record of Last Glacial loess. The loess occurs in diverse physiographic provinces, and under {{a wide range}} of climatic and ecological conditions. Both glacial and non-glacial loess sources are present, and many properties of the loess vary systematically with distance from loess sources. United States' mid-continent Last Glacial loess is probably the thickest in the world, and our calculated mass accumulation rates (MARS) are as high as 17, 500 g/m(2) /yr at the Bignell Hill locality in Nebraska, and many near-source localities have MARS greater than 1500 g/m(2) /yr. These MARS are high relative to rates calculated in other loess provinces around the world. Recent models of Last Glacial dust sources fail to predict the extent and magnitude of dust flux from the mid-continent of the United States. A better understanding of linkages between climate, ice sheet behaviour, routing of glacial meltwater, land surface processes beyond the ice margin, and vegetation is needed to improve the predictive capabilities of models simulating dust flux from this region.

Located {{in the path of}} the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds and in the source region of dust deposited in Antarctica during Glacial periods, southern Patagonia is a vantage point to reconstruct past changes in aeolian activity. Here we use high-resolution rock-magnetic and physical grain size data from site 2 of the International Continental scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) Potrok Aike maar lake Sediment Archive Drilling prOject (PASADO) in order to develop magnetic proxies of dust and wind intensity at 52 ◦S since 51, 200 cal BP. Rock-magnetic analysis indicates the magnetic mineral assemblage is dominated by detrital magnetite. Based on the estimated flux of magnetite to the lake and comparison with distal dust records from the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, kLF is interpreted as a <b>dust</b> <b>indicator</b> in the dust source of southern Patagonia at the millennial time scale, when ferrimagnetic grain size and coercivity influence are minimal. Comparison to physical grain- size data indicates that the median destructive field of isothermal remanent magnetization (MDFIRM) mostly reflects medium to coarse magnetite bearing silts typically transported by winds for short-term suspension. Comparison with wind-intensity proxies from the Southern Hemisphere during the last Glacial period and with regional records from Patagonia since the last deglaciation including marine, lacustrine and peat bog sediments as well as speleothems reveals similar variability with MDFIRM up to the centennial time scale.

Fe intensity data {{have been used to}} build a 91 meter composite depth record that has been astronomically tuned allowing the development of a detailed age model from 6. 2 to 1. 8 Ma. Based on this new stratigraphy we studied the variations of Ti/Al, Ti/Ca and Al/Si ratios, proxies for aeolian vs. fluvial supply, as <b>dust</b> <b>indicator</b> and fine vs. coarse grain size, respectively. We discuss sedimentation patterns at ODP Site 959 associated to the environmental changes from the late Miocene until the early Pleistocene. During the interval corresponding to the earlier stages of the Messinian Salinity Crisis our proxy records indicate enhanced run-off from the West African continent and major supply of fine material at ODP Site 959, suggesting a stronger monsoon and increased precipitation during eccentricity minima. A long-term decrease of river supply is documented after 5. 4 Ma towards the early Pleistocene. From the increased values and variability of Ti/Al ratios we suggest that after 3. 8 Ma dust started to reach the study site probably {{as a result of the}} southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during winter. Between 3. 2 and 2. 9 Ma ODP Site 959 Ti/Ca ratios exhibit three maxima corresponding to eccentricity maxima similarly to other dust records of northern Africa.

During this time planets are believed to form in the dense midplane by growth, sedimentation and aggregation of <b>dust.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of disk evolution, such as holes and gaps, can be traced in the spectral energy distribution (SED) and spatially resolved images. We aim to construct a self-consistent model of HH 30 by fitting all available continuum observations simultaneously. New data sets not available in previous studies, such as high-resolution interferometric imaging with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) at lambda = 1. 3 mm and SED measured with IRS on the Spitzer Space Telescope in the mid-infrared, put strong constraints on predictions and are likely to provide new insights into the evolutionary state of this object. A parameter study based on simulated annealing was performed to find unbiased best-fit models for independent observations made in the wavelength domain lambda ~ 1 micron [...] . 4 mm. The method essentially creates a Markov chain through parameter space by comparing predictions generated by our self-consistent continuum radiation transfer code MC 3 D with observations. We present models of the edge-on circumstellar disk of HH 30 based on observations from the near-infrared to mm-wavelengths that suggest the presence of an inner depletion zone with about 45 AU radius and a steep decline of mm opacity beyond 140 AU. Our modeling indicates that several modes of dust evolution such as growth, settling, and radial migration are taking place in this object. High-resolution observations of HH 30 at different wavelengths with next-generation observatories such as ALMA and JWST will enable the modeling of inhomogeneous dust properties and significantly expand our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution.

40|$|Mineral dust {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the climate system by interacting with radiation, clouds, and biogeochemical cycles. In addition, natural archives show that the dust cycle experienced variability in the past in response to global and local climate change. The compilation of the DIRTMAP (<b>Dust</b> <b>Indicators</b> and Records from Terrestrial and MArine Palaeoenvironments) paleodust data sets in the last 2 decades provided a benchmark for paleoclimate models that include the dust cycle, following a time slice approach. We propose an innovative framework to organize a paleodust data set that builds on the positive experience of DIRTMAP and takes into account new scientific challenges by providing a concise and accessible data set of temporally resolved records of dust mass accumulation rates and particle grain size distributions. We consider data from ice cores, marine sediments, loess–paleosol sequences, lake sediments, and peat bogs for this compilation, with a temporal focus on the Holocene period. This global compilation allows the investigation of the potential, uncertainties, and confidence level of dust mass accumulation rate reconstructions and highlights the importance of dust particle size information for accurate and quantitative reconstructions of the dust cycle. After applying criteria that help to establish that the data considered represent changes in dust deposition, 45 paleodust records have been identified, with the highest density of dust deposition data occurring in the North Atlantic region. Although the temporal evolution of dust in the North Atlantic appears consistent across several cores and suggests that minimum dust fluxes are likely observed during the early to mid-Holocene period (6000 – 8000 years ago), the magnitude of dust fluxes in these observations is not fully consistent, suggesting that more work needs to be done to synthesize data sets for the Holocene. Based on the data compilation, we used the Community Earth System Model to estimate the mass balance of and variability in the global dust cycle during the Holocene, with dust loads ranging from 17. 2 to 20. 8 Tg between 2000 and 10 000 years ago and with a minimum in the early to mid-Holocene (6000 – 8000 years ago) ...|$|R

40|$|Correlations of hot dust {{emission}} with outflow properties are investigated, {{based on a}} large z similar to 2 non-broad absorption line quasar sample built from the Wide-field Infrared Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data releases. We use the near-infrared slope and the infrared to UV luminosity ratio to indicate the hot {{dust emission}} relative to the emission from the accretion disk. In our luminous quasars, these hot <b>dust</b> emission <b>indicators</b> are almost independent of the fundamental parameters, such as luminosity, Eddington ratio and black hole mass, but moderately dependent on the blueshift and asymmetry index (BAI) and FWHM of C IV lines. Interestingly, the latter two correlations dramatically strengthen with increasing Eddington ratio. We suggest that, in high Eddington ratio quasars, C IV regions are dominated by outflows so the BAI and FWHM (C IV) can reliably reflect the general properties and velocity of outflows, respectively. In low Eddington ratio quasars, on the other hand, C IV lines are primarily emitted by virialized gas so the BAI and FWHM (C IV) become less sensitive to outflows. Therefore, the correlations for the highest Eddington ratio quasars {{are more likely to}} represent the true dependence of hot dust emission on outflows and the correlations for the entire sample are significantly diluted by the low Eddington ratio quasars.

The aim {{of the study was to}} identify better ways to characterize microbial exposure as a predictor of respiratory symptoms and allergies. Methods A birth cohort of 410 children was followed up until 6 years of age. Bacterial endotoxin, 3 -hydroxy fatty acids, N-acetyl-muramic acid, fungal extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from Penicillium and Aspergillus spp., β-D-glucan, ergosterol, and bacterial or fungal quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) were analyzed from dust samples collected at 2 months of age. Asthma, wheezing, cough, and atopic dermatitis were assessed using repeated questionnaires. Specific IgEs were determined at the age of 1 and 6 years. Results Only few associations were found between single microbial markers and the studied outcomes. In contrast, a score for the total quantity of microbial exposure, that is, sum of indicators for fungi (ergosterol), Gram-positive (muramic acid) bacteria, and Gram-negative (endotoxin) bacteria, was significantly (inverted-U shape) associated with asthma incidence (P < 0. 001) : the highest risk was found at medium levels (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2. 24, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 87 - 5. 75 for 3 rd quintile) and the lowest risk at the highest level (aOR 0. 34, 95 % CI 0. 09 - 1. 36 for 5 th quintile). The microbial diversity score, that is, sum of detected qPCRs, was inversely associated with risk of wheezing and was significantly (inverted-U shape) associated with sensitization to inhalant allergens.

Many low-ionization lines including Fe II, Zn II, Mg II, Si II, Al II, Ni II, Mn II, Cr II, Ti II, and Ca II are present in the same absorber which gives rise to the 2175 Å bump. The relative metal abundances (with respect to Zn) demonstrate that the depletion patterns of our 2175 Å dust absorbers resemble that of the Milky Way clouds although some are disk-like and some are halo-like. The 2175 Å dust absorbers have significantly higher depletion levels compared to literature Damped Lyman-α absorbers (DLAs) and subDLAs. The <b>dust</b> depletion level <b>indicator</b> [Fe/Zn] tends to anti-correlate with bump strengths. The velocity profiles from the Keck/ESI spectra also provide kinematical information on the dust absorbers. The dust absorbers are found to have multiple velocity components with velocity widths extending from 100 to 600 km/s, which are larger than those of most DLAs and subDLAs. Assuming the velocity width is a reliable tracer of stellar mass, the host galaxies of 2175 Å dust absorbers are expected to be more massive than DLA/subDLA hosts.

No positive trends with carbon black exposures were noted in the analyses. A nested case control study, however, identified smoking and previous exposures to known carcinogens, such as crystalline silica, received prior {{to work in the}} carbon black industry as important risk factors. We used a Bayesian procedure to adjust the SMR, based on a prior of seven independent parameter distributions describing smoking behaviour and crystalline silica <b>dust</b> exposure (as <b>indicator</b> of a group of correlated carcinogen exposures received previously) in the cohort and population as well as the strength of the relationship of these factors with lung cancer mortality. We implemented the approach by Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods (MCMC) programmed in R, a statistical computing system freely available on the internet, and we provide the program code. Results When putting a flat prior to the SMR a Markov chain of length 1, 000, 000 returned a median posterior SMR estimate (that is, the adjusted SMR) in the range between 1. 32 (95 % posterior interval: 0. 7, 2. 1) and 1. 00 (0. 2, 3. 3) depending on the method of assessing previous exposures. Conclusions Bayesian bias adjustment is an excellent tool to effectively combine data about confounders from different sources.

40|$|Abstract Ferromagnetic grains in {{airborne}} <b>dust</b> {{are important}} <b>indicators</b> of vehicle traffic, some industrial sources and combustion/heating. Settled dust consists mainly of diamagnetic material; therefore accessory ferromagnetic grains are readily indicated by magnetic measurements. In this paper settled dust samples collected {{on a monthly}} basis in the years 2008 – 2011 were studied. Non-destructive magnetic measurements were followed by geochemical and mineralogical analyses. In selected samples we identified airborne anthropogenic materials (e. g. silicate and magnetite spherules), minerals from the natural environment and organic material. Seasonally appearing materials (e. g. soot in winter, plant fragments and pollen in summer) increased the mass of the settled dust, but not the magnetic susceptibility. Thus, we realized that the generally interpreted mass susceptibility in environmental magnetic studies would not always appropriately characterize the magnetic pollution. In the interpretation we gave preference to total susceptibility because of its direct connection to the pollution, except in comparison with metal concentrations. Trends in magnetic pollution were eventually analyzed for 19 sampling sites. Irrespective of the degree and source of the pollution the monthly variation curves of magnetic susceptibility exhibit a general maximum (March-April), followed by gradual decrease. A corresponding peak is observed in the amounts of dust. Both can be explained by re-suspension of dust settled in winter. The additional maxima in the mass of the dust (June and August, respectively) are probably due to contribution from vegetation and/or an artifact from algaecide. For three key sampling sites comparison was made between the concentrations of 12 metals and the respective mass susceptibilities and good linear correlation was found for Fe, Mn and Zn for all, for Cr, Cu, Pb, V, Ba, Sr and Zr for two sampling sites.

In each case, the N(HI) -weighted mean metallicity is higher and shows faster evolution in sub-DLAs than the classical DLA systems. Large grids of photoionisation models over the sub-DLA range with CLOUDY show that the ionisation corrections to the abundances are in general small, however the fraction of ionized H can be up to 90 per cent. The individual spectra have been shifted to the rest frame of the absorber and averaged together to determine the average properties of these systems at z< 1. 5. We find that the average abundance pattern of the Sub-DLA systems {{is similar to the}} gas in the halo of the Milky Way, with an offset of 0. 3 dex in the overall metallicity. Both DLAs and Sub-DLAs show similar characteristics in their relative abundances patterns, although the DLAs have smaller as well as higher and. We calculate the contribution of sub-DLAs to the metal budget of the Universe, and find that the sub-DLA systems at z< 1. 5 contain a comoving density of metals Omega_met (3. 5 - 15. 8) x 10 ^ 5 M_sun Mpc^- 3, at least twice the comoving density of metals in the DLA systems.

40|$|Dust is {{a source}} of {{contamination}} of land, water and the atmosphere, and is of special concern owing to its trace metal content. There is a significant body of literature describing the use of deposited <b>dusts</b> as <b>indicators</b> of environmental pollution, particularly by trace metals. While several authors have identified the need for standardized guidelines on sampling techniques and on analytical procedures, few have addressed the problems in sufficient depth to produce such guidelines. Since some of the early papers on this topic, more is known about the chemical nature of dusts and the association of certain metals with components of the matrix. This information provides useful guidance on analytical techniques and methods for dissolution of samples. In the analysis of trace elements in dusts, a prerequisite is to prepare a solution for analysis. A variety of methods have been used to digest dust samples for determination of trace metals, and this can make it difficult to compare the results from different studies. Whether total or available metal content is determined is just one uncertainty needing resolution. Time requirements range from 15 min to 24 h, and this is another variability that may make results incomparable, while the great amounts of acids and long digestion times may result in contamination. For over 20 years, microwave ovens have found increasing use and have been used to digest various kinds of samples, such as rocks, sediments, ores, soils, coal, fly ash, water, sludge and biological and botanical samples. This article describes the efficiency of various acids for the digestion of dust, both by traditional methods and using amicrowave oven. The latter technique offers an advantageous route for the digestion of dust samples in preparation for trace metal analysis. Speed and good recovery coupled with less risk of contamination through the limited amounts of reagents required combine to make this an excellent choice in the suite of techniques for environmental analysis. General reviews of analytical methods demonstrate the dominance of atomic absorption methods for the analysis of trace metals such as lead and cadmium in a variety of samples. This pattern is generally found for work on metals in dusts, with flame atomic absorption predominating for Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni and Cu. Other techniques have included neutron activation (NA) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES). Polarography in the form of differential-pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) is suitable for the simultaneous determination of trace quantities of Pb and Cd in dust. The method gives good reproducibility and has the added advantages of being relatively cheap, quick and simple. Interferences and means for overcoming their effects will be outlined. The aim of analysis of dusts is to represent environmental quality. This necessitates appropriate presentation of the data from the analysis, and some issues relating to this will be outlined. Dusts will always present a potential route of contamination by trace metals and organic substances and the need for future work in this area will not diminish. Only by the application of good quality control, the use of reference materials and reliable techniques and an understanding of the significance of the results can confidence be placed in a useful approach to environmental quality assessment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Airborne {{mycotoxin}} exposure Fungi {{are found}} {{everywhere in the}} environment, and exposure to these organisms is inevitable. Many species of fungi produce mycotoxins: secondary metabolites, toxic to higher vertebrates. There are several routes via which exposure to these mycotoxins occurs: oral, dermal and inhalation. The last route is the least studied, and therefore presents a relatively unknown health risk. This report aims to investigate this airborne exposure to mycotoxins by answering several questions. 1. 	What are {{the sources of the}} mycotoxins? 2. 	What are the concentrations of mycotoxins in the air? 3. 	What is the human exposure to these mycotoxin concentrations? 4. 	What is the dose of mycotoxins, which reaches the target organs? 5. 	What are the health effects of these mycotoxins? The answers to these questions should provide the answer to the main research question: what is the risk of airborne exposure to mycotoxins? The sources of the mycotoxins are the fungi themselves, so in essence every place that can support fungal growth can be a (potential) source for mycotoxins. However, fungi do not always produce mycotoxins, complicating the answer to this question. Most studies do not measure mycotoxins directly from the air, but rather extract mycotoxins from (settled) dust samples. Studies providing quantitative data about airborne mycotoxin concentrations are rare; most studies describe method testing, or have performed qualitative testing. The results of these studies have to be validated by further research to gain more credibility for use in studies investigating airborne mycotoxins concentrations. In exposure assessment most studies focus on dust samples; however, studies, which researched the possibility of mycotoxin exposure by contact with parts of the fungi (conidia) have also been performed. These studies concluded that exposure via conidia is possible. Most studies however, focus on <b>dust</b> as an <b>indicator</b> for airborne mycotoxin exposure. Mycotoxins have very varied chemical properties, and consequently also varied health effects. Some only cause for example vomiting, while another has been labeled one of the most carcinogenic naturally occurring substances. There are several difficulties in assessment of the health risk in airborne mycotoxins and a detailed risk assessment method is needed; the variability of properties of mycotoxins is one of these. There are large differences not only in chemical properties but also in toxicity. This should also be taken into account when performing a sound risk assessment. Although there is a general lack of concrete scientific data about most aspects of this risk assessment current studies do offer some insight. However, {{there is a need for}} more compatibility between the various studies; a more uniform approach could help to combine data and lead to a well-based risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the cosmic}} star {{formation}} {{history of the}} Universe is fundamental for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. While surveys now suggest that the "epoch" of galaxy formation occurred more than 6 billion years ago, our measurements still suff er from signi ficant scatter and uncertainties due {{to the use of}} diff erent <b>indicators,</b> <b>dust</b> extinction and the e ffects of cosmic variance in the current samples. Furthermore, understanding galaxy formation and evolution require us to go much beyond simply determining the star formation history of the Universe with high accuracy: what are the physical mechanisms driving the strong evolution that we observe? How does star formation depend on stellar mass and environment and how does that change with cosmic time? This thesis presents both a completely self-consistent determination of the star formation history of the Universe (based on a single, sensitive and well-calibrated star formation indicator up to redshift z ~ 2 : 3 : the H α luminosity) and investigates its drivers by exploring large area surveys (probing a range of environments and overcoming cosmic variance) obtained with the High-redshift Emission Line Survey (HiZELS). HiZELS is a panoramic extragalactic survey using the WFCAM instrument on the 3. 8 -m UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) which utilizes a set of existing and custom-made narrow-band filters in the J, H and K bands to detect emission line galaxies (main targets are H α emitters at z = 0 : 84, z = 1 : 47 and z = 2 : 23) up to z ~ 9 over square degree areas of extragalactic sky. Detailed measurements of the H α luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are presented, revealing a signi ficant luminosity evolution. The clustering properties of H α emitters at high-redshift are quantifi ed and investigated for the first time, revealing that these distant galaxies reside in Milky-Way type dark matter haloes at z ~ 1. Mass and environment are found to have important and inter-dependent roles on star formation at high-z and the results are able to reconcile previously contradictory results in the literature. Furthermore, by conducting a novel double-narrow band survey at z = 1 : 47, the relationship between the [Oii] 3727 and H α emission lines is studied in detail and directly compared to z ~ 0, showing no signifi cant evolution in the dust properties of star-forming galaxies, despite the very strong luminosity evolution. Finally, this thesis also presents the widest search for very distant Ly α emitters at z ~ 9. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
