5|$|News of Stillman's defeat, the Indian Creek massacre, {{and other}} smaller attacks {{triggered}} panic among the white population. Many settlers fled to Chicago, then a small town, which became overcrowded with hungry refugees. Many Potawatomis also fled towards Chicago, {{not wanting to}} <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the conflict nor be mistaken for hostiles. Throughout the region, settlers hurriedly organized militia units and built small forts.|$|E
5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E
5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the polled variety have no horns at all. Polled Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns that can <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of {{catching}} the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses {{to be used as}} bait throughout these regions.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to}} be any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E

5|$|Michael Tolkin and David Hayter rewrote {{the script}} afterwards, despite {{positive}} {{response from the}} producers over France's script. Tolkin was brought in January 2000, while Hayter was brought in September of that year. Hayter's draft featured The Leader, Zzzax, and the Absorbing Man as the villains, who are depicted as colleagues of Banner and <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the same accident that creates the Hulk. Director Ang Lee and his producing partner James Schamus became involved with the film in January 20, 2001. Lee was dissatisfied with Hayter's script, and commissioned Schamus for a rewrite, merging Banner's father with the Absorbing Man. Lee cited influences from King Kong, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Beauty and the Beast, Faust, and Greek mythology for his interpretation of the story. Schamus said {{he had found the}} storyline that introduced Brian Banner, thus allowing Lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.|$|E
5|$|The Moldavians {{made the}} first move by sending musicians {{to the middle of}} the valley. The sound of drums and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there. Instead, the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian {{professional}} army, which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy. Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and, when they made enough progress, the Moldavian artillery started to fire, followed by archers and handgunners firing from three different directions. The archers could not see the enemy for the fog, and, instead, had to follow the noise of their footsteps. The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops into the valley by making hit-and-run attacks. Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge, causing it to collapse. Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers, and who did not <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the marshes, had to confront the Moldavian army, together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley. The 5,000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7,000 Ottoman infantrymen. Thereafter, they made a slow retreat, as instructed by Stephen, but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi, while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks.|$|E
25|$|Phaedrus {{believes}} {{that one of}} the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> something shameful. To <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{important}} that the stirrup be the correct width for the boot. A stirrup that is too narrow will increase the chance that the boot will <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> it (which would be very dangerous should the rider fall), and a too-wide stirrup makes it harder for a rider to keep it under the foot, and presents some risk that the foot might slip all the way through.

25|$|Having {{started the}} year clearly behind Renault, McLaren {{improved}} in Australia, where Räikkönen finished second after flat spotting a tyre and losing a wing end-plate, which {{caused him to}} fall off the pace somewhat around {{the midpoint of the}} race. Chasing down Alonso during the final stages of the race, he set the fastest lap of the race on the final lap, finishing only 1.8 seconds behind the Spaniard.

Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – {{through no fault of}} their own – to a life without hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays.
