5|$|The {{melodic line}} of part B is {{contrasting}} in both its static {{character and the}} vehemence of the piano accompaniment, and by the double forte dynamics, as much by the double forte dynamics which give a brutal character, as {{by the use of}} sequences (<b>E</b> <b>major</b> to begin with, then B major, G major, <b>E</b> <b>major,</b> etc.). This section ends with a chromatic descent in the accompaniment at quadruple piano dynamic, up to a dominant seventh of G major, to prepare the return of the second section A in the original key.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the second}} movement, {{there is a}} brief fourteen-bar {{transitional}} passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in <b>E</b> <b>major</b> and whose opening {{is marked by a}} trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in G major. The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of <b>E</b> <b>Major.</b> There is almost a small cadenza {{near the end of the}} movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.|$|E
5|$|Over the bridges, the new key is set {{fully in}} the minor mode, {{avoiding}} the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on an E minor chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor in the new key. At {{the end of each}} bridge, the return to the home key is effected via an <b>E</b> <b>major</b> chord, marking the only use of the expected G note in the A major scale.|$|E
5|$|The song uses two-measure phrases that, {{aside from}} the choruses, use a i–III–IV–VI chord progression. The B minor chord is held for 1⅓ of a beat, and a {{relative}} transformation is then used to produce a second-inversion D major chord, which is held for 1⅔ of a beat. In the second measure, a first-inversion <b>E</b> <b>major</b> chord with an added ninth precedes a G major major seventh chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.|$|E

5|$|In late May, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion was {{deployed}} {{to support the}} defensive operations in the Chateau–Thierry Sector. During this time they were employed as a complete unit {{in order to provide}} concentrated fire support at key points along the Allied line. The 77th and 81st Companies were assigned to the right flank while the 15th and 23rd Companies were assigned to the left. Their job was to lay down covering and harassing fire during both defensive and offensive operations. They also assisted the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments in their respective drives through Belleau Wood. On 10 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Major Cole, was mortally wounded and command temporarily passed to Captain Harlan <b>E.</b> <b>Major.</b> Captain George H.

5|$|John Stainer was {{the eighth}} of nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where {{his father was a}} cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in <b>E</b> <b>major</b> at the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|The {{movements}} 1 (Magnificat), 7 (Fecit potentiam) and 12 (Gloria patri) are {{the cornerstones of}} the composition: {{they are}} in the tonic key (<b>E</b> <b>major</b> for BWV 243a, D major for BWV 243), and are the only movements that feature a five-part chorus as well as a tutti orchestra. The chorus also sings in movement 4 (Omnes generationes), accompanied by an orchestra without trumpets and timpani. Each of these four choral movements are, in the version without the Christmas hymns, followed by two movements for a vocal soloist, the second one often with richer scoring. In the movements for vocal soloists the instrumentation is as usual in Bach's cantata's: the soloists are accompanied by an obbligato instrument, only strings and/or continuo. Movement A (Vom Himmel hoch) is the only a cappella movement.|$|E

5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between <b>E</b> <b>major</b> and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E
5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the <b>E</b> <b>major</b> before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, {{the song}} was {{originally}} written and recorded in <b>E</b> <b>major,</b> one semitone lower, then the entire master tape was sped up to place it in F major. Many live performances show the band performing the song in E.|$|E

25|$|The Wagner tuba, a {{modified}} {{member of the}} horn family, appears in Richard Wagner's cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen and several other works by Strauss, Béla Bartók, and others; it has {{a prominent role in}} Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in <b>E</b> <b>Major.</b> Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, Claude Debussy's La Mer, and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz.

25|$|The accompaniment becomes {{gradually}} {{thicker and}} louder until the whole orchestra is {{playing at the}} very end. Just before the end (rehearsal number 18 in the score), there is a sudden change of key to <b>E</b> <b>major,</b> though C major is reestablished after just eight bars. Six bars from the end, the bass drum, cymbals and tam-tam make their first entry, and the trombones play raucous glissandi while the whole orchestra beats out the rhythm that has been played on the snare drum {{from the very first}} bar. Finally, the work descends from a dissonant D-flat chord to a C major chord.|$|E
25|$|A {{borrowed}} chord is {{one from}} a different key than the home key, the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the parallel major or minor key is used. Particularly good examples can be found throughout the works of composers such as Schubert. For instance, for a composer working in the C major key, a major III chord (e.g., an <b>E</b> <b>major</b> chord) would be borrowed, as this chord appears only in the C minor key. Although borrowed chords could theoretically include chords taken from any key other than the home key, {{this is not how}} the term is used when a chord is described in formal musical analysis.|$|E
