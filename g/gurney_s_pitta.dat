50|$|At Eton Brett {{was taught}} by {{influential}} master William Johnson Cory, whose pupils included Rosebery {{and those in}} the highest echelons of society. Rosebery's idealistic learning from romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, the liberal philosopher J S Mill, the chemistry of Leibniz, music of Mozart, and Jeremy Bentham were intellectual influences on the young Regy. Going up to Trinity College, Oxford, Brett was profoundly influenced by William Harcourt the radical lawyer, politician and Professor of International Law. Harcourt controlled Brett's rooms, and lifestyle at Oxford. Brett's father had introduced him to Albert Grey's Committee, but had a long-standing dispute with General Charles Grey, the Queen's Equerry. Brett was admitted to the Society of Apostles, dedicated to emergent philosophies of European atheism; their number included the aristocratic literati of liberalism Frank, Gerald and Eustace Balfour, Frederick and Arthur Myers, Hallam and Lionel Tennyson, Edmund <b>Gurney,</b> <b>S</b> H and J G Butcher. Brett experimented approaching conversion to High Mass from Cardinal Newman on Sundays in London. The Oxford Movement included historians, J Sedgwick and F M Maitland holding an equally profound sway over his youthful scholarship.|$|R

50|$|A Cape Cod Knockabout, or Knockabout, is a one-design {{class of}} 18 ft sail boat sailed {{primarily}} out of Upper Cape harbors in Massachusetts, United States. Knockabouts {{were designed by}} Charles <b>S.</b> <b>Gurney</b> and were popular in the 1940s and well into the 1970s with fleets of 50-60 boats at the annual regatta of the Knockabout Class. There are still active racing fleets in Megansett (North Falmouth), Waquoit (East Falmouth),Lewis Bay (Yarmouth), and Woods Hole (Falmouth). There is also a small racing fleet at the Split Rock Yacht Club in Essex, New York, on Lake Champlain. There are many, many knockabouts throughout Southern New England that are still used for pleasure sailing. The Town of Yarmouth Recreation Dept. owns and runs the Lewis Bay fleet where most of their 15 boats are used for sail training. Hundreds of sailors of all ages {{have gone through the}} Yarmouth program using the knockabout to learn on. Yarmouth also maintains a select group of their knockabouts for their racing program. Thirteen to sixteen Knockabouts race in Woods Hole Harbor every Wednesday, with a ladies race on Thursday,and a Spinnaker race on Sunday afternoons. The Cape Cod Knockabout Association holds an annual regatta each summer which is held at one of the above four Cape Cod locations on a rotating basis. Nearly 20 boats attend this regatta each year. Local fleets are generally increasing their numbers. Cape Cod Ship Building in Wareham manufactures the boat.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast I {{went with}} Mr. <b>Gurney</b> and Mr. <b>S.</b> to Richmond's studio {{to sit for}} a likeness, {{which is to be}} {{presented}} to Mr. S. by several friends. Richmond's name is one which in this London sphere has only to be announced to explain itself; not to know him argues yourself unknown. He {{is one of the most}} successful artists in a certain line of portrait painting that the present day affords. He devotes himself principally to crayon and water-color sketches. His crayon heads are generally the size of life; his water-colors of a small size. He often takes full-lengths in this way, which render not merely the features, but the figure, air, manner, and what is characteristic about the dress. These latter sketches are finished up very highly, with the minuteness of a miniature. His forte consists in seizing and fixing those fleeting traits of countenance, air, and movement, which go so far towards making up our idea of a person's appearance. Many of the engravings of distinguished persons, with which we are familiar, have come from his designs, such as Wilberforce, Sir Powell Buxton, Elizabeth Fry, and others. I found his studio quite a gallery of notabilities, almost all the distingués of the day having sat to him; so I certainly had the satisfaction of feeling myself in good company. Mr. Richmond looks quite youthful, (but I never can judge of any one's age here,) is most agreeable in conversation, full of anecdote in regard to all the moving life of London. I presume his power of entertaining conversation is one secret of his successful likenesses. Some portrait painters keep calling on you for expression all the while, and say nothing in the world to awaken it.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an examination}} of the seven plays written by A. R. Gurney during the 1980 <b>s.</b> <b>Gurney</b> describes his own work as 2 ̆ 2 dancing in chains, 2 ̆ 2 that is, working in a restricted form, yet striving for joyous creative expression. This 2 ̆ 2 dancing in chains 2 ̆ 2 metaphor may also be applied to the 2 ̆ 2 WASP 2 ̆ 2 (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) culture in America, as this culture promotes freedom, yet has definite sets of rules and behavior which can be unnecessarily restrictive and oppressive. Gurney has been dubbed the WASPs 2 ̆ 7 playwright and his plays are examined with this in mind. The decline of the WASPs 2 ̆ 7 cultural influence is also analyzed, as it is represented through the plays. Gurney both praises and condemns the culture and this is examined both as a force for dramatic tension and as a cultural circumstance. ^ Chapters are in order of the plays 2 ̆ 7 copyright dates and are: (1) Ritual in The Dining Room; (2) What I Did Last Summer: Realizing One 2 ̆ 7 s Potential; (3) The Perfect Party: An Examination of the American Dream; (4) Another Antigone: The Clash Between Two Cultures; (5) Sweet Sue: Sketching Perspectives of Relationships; (6) The Cocktail Hour: Dramatizing Family Structures; (7) Love Letters: Two Views of Life. ^ Each chapter includes a brief synopsis of the play, a summary of the reviews and other significant data such as pertinent production information, comparative analyses with other plays or works of literature, et cetera. The following questions are asked concerning each play: (1) What does this play challenge people to examine? (2) How does the play defend the WASP culture? (3) How does the play challenge the WASP culture? (4) What are the realistic aspects of the play? (5) What non-realistic devices does the playwright employ? (6) What comments are made on the structure of the play within the play itself? (7) How does the play present a larger picture of the culture it addresses and/or how does the play focus on a particular aspect of that culture in a significant way?...|$|R
