An orthodox economic policy based on fiscal contraction, a high rate of interest, and incentives to external debt in order to sustain convertibility and free capital flows was a permanent strategy of this model.

Being portfolios built out of other portfolios and assets, FoFs are a special type of investments and therefore have distinct advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other investment vehicles. When reviewing both the academic research related to the unique, or at least distinct, features of FoFs and discussing market developments, we address a good number of interesting questions and challenges. Specifically, we find that classical methods of research and assessment may be insufficient to address these questions in both theoretical and quantitative aspects. The need for a distinct treatment of FoFs is even more evident when focusing on the dynamic nature of financial market developments and increasing global competitiveness. As past research work on FoFs is scarce...|$|R
