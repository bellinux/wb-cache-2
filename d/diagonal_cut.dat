40|$|AIM: This article proposes and {{describes}} the split-increment technique {{as an alternative}} for placement of composite resin in large cervical carious lesions which extend onto the root surface. TECHNIQUE: Two flat 1. 5 mm thick composite resin increments were used to restore these cervical carious lesions. Prior to light-curing, two <b>diagonal</b> <b>cuts</b> were made in each increment in order to split it into four triangular-shaped flat portions. The first increment was applied to cover the entire axial wall and portions of the four surrounding walls. The second increment was applied to fill the cavity completely covering the first one {{and the rest of}} the four surrounding walls as well as sealing all cavity margins. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This technique results in the reduction of the C-factor and the generated shrinkage stresses by directing the shrinking composite resin during curing towards the free, unbonded areas created by the two <b>diagonal</b> <b>cuts.</b> The proposed technique would also produce a more naturally looking restoration by inserting flat dentin and enamel increments of composite resin of a uniform thickness which closely resembles the arrangement of natural tooth structure.

The third in {{difficulty is}} the straight downward cut, {{not in terms of}} the grain {{but in terms of the}} group of muscles involved. The most difficult cut of these four basic cuts is the horizontal direction (against a vertical target) which is directly perpendicular to the grain of the target.|$|E

50|$|Scenery {{and costumes}} for Balanchine's {{production}} were by French artist André Bauchant. Coco Chanel provided new costumes in 1929. Apollo wore a reworked toga with a <b>diagonal</b> <b>cut,</b> a belt, and laced up. The Muses wore a traditional tutus. The decoration was baroque: two large sets, with some rocks and Apollo's chariot. In the dance a certain academicism resurfaced in the stretching out and upward leaping of the body, but the Balanchine bent the angles {{of the arms}} and hands to define instead the genre of neoclassical ballet.|$|E

5000|$|Large sipes {{are usually}} {{built into the}} tread during manufacturing. Sipes may also be cut into the tread at a later date, called [...] "microsiping". Bandag {{developed}} a machine for microsiping which places a curved knife blade at a slight angle on a rotating drum. The drum is placed so when it is pressed against the tread the tire is pressed into an exaggerated hollow, as if driving down a rail. The drum is lubricated and rotated and the knife makes a series of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cuts</b> across the tread. For improved traction, the tire may be siped twice, leaving diamond-shaped blocks. A significant problem with field siping is that the tread picks up rocks, glass, and other hard road debris in use, and even with thorough cleaning the knife service life is often poor.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedVolumetric {{medical data}} is a three {{dimensional}} {{view of the}} object being captured, examples include imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance (MR), computer tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET). For compression of these data, a new 3 -D wavelet-based lossless coding scheme, which is an improved version of 2 -D PROGRES, is developed. In this compression method, a significance map, which consists of dynamic range values of coefficients of a slice, is designed for reconstructing individual voxels. Significance maps allow any region of interest to be decoded by retrieving only necessary wavelet coefficients. This reduces the number of decoded voxels and the decoding time very significantly. A key novelty of the proposed compression scheme is that it achieves random access decoding of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cuts</b> through the compressed data. This allows flexible display, which can be useful for diagnostic, while not requiring manipulation of very large uncompressed data sets...|$|R

The mining house sent Lentz's project to the Dvorska house in Budin. Ferdinand Divald checked the budget and calculated costs. In November, the Dvorska house requested sending the <b>diagonal</b> <b>cut</b> of the building and ratification of the building material and wages of the workers through mining court. The Dvorska house was given the okay to build Kursalón on April 18, 1837.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{a wide variety of}} cuts used on cadavers and {{occasionally}} convicted criminals, from tabi-gata (ankle cut) to O-kesa (<b>diagonal</b> <b>cut</b> from shoulder to opposite hip). The names of the types of cuts on cadavers show exactly where on the body the cut was made. Older swords can still be found today that have inscriptions on their nakago (tang) that say things such as, [...] "5 bodies with Ryu Guruma (hip cut)". Such an inscription, known as a tameshi-mei or saidan-mei (cutting signature) would add greatly to a sword's value, compensating the owner somewhat for the large sums of money typically charged for the test.|$|E
5000|$|The small [...] "B"-unit can {{was often}} made into an improvised field stove {{that could be}} carried in the cargo pockets {{of a set of}} combat fatigues. This was done by making a series of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cuts</b> around the top and bottom edges of the can with a P-38 can opener or a {{standard}} can opener to allow the trioxane fuel tablet to burn evenly and warm the entrée. Small balls of C-4 plastic explosive were often substituted for the fuel tablet, as it produced a hotter flame. The ball was smaller than an inch in diameter with a small tit pinch on it to light it by. [...] Heating of canned meat items was often accomplished by inserting the can into the exhaust of a running truck where it would jam into the curved exhaust pipe end, warming it to a palatable temperature and de-congealing the grease.|$|R

For applications requiring master cards {{to be separated from}} following detail cards, the respective cards had different upper corner diagonal cuts and thus could be separated by a sorter.

A lip-valley flute, it is considered the toughest of the three bamboo flutes (the others being the tumpong and the suling) to use because of the way one must shape one's lips against its tip to make a sound.

40|$|Manipulation of thin sheets by folding {{and cutting}} offers {{opportunity}} to engineer structures with novel mechanical properties, and to prescribe complex force-displacement relationships via material elasticity {{in combination with}} the trajectory imposed by the fold topology. We study the mechanics of cellular Kirigami that rotates upon compression, which we call Flexigami; the addition of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cuts</b> to an equivalent closed cell permits its reversible collapse without incurring significant tensile strains in its panels. Using finite-element modeling and experiment we show how the mechanics of flexigami is governed by the coupled rigidity of the panels and hinges and we design flexigami to achieve reversible force response ranging from smooth mono-stability to sharp bi-stability. We then demonstrate the use of flexigami to construct laminates with multi-stable behavior, a rotary-linear boom actuator, and self-deploying cells with activated hinges. Advanced digital fabrication methods can enable the practical use of flexigami and other metamaterials that share its underlying principles, for applications such as morphing structures, soft robotics and medical devices.

40|$|Detailed {{experimental}} {{information on}} the motion of a nuclear packet on a complex (resonant) anion potential surface is obtained by measuring 2 -dimensional (2 D) electron energy loss spectra. The cross section is plotted {{as a function of}} incident electron energy, which determines which resonant anion state is populated, i. e., along which normal coordinate the wave packet is launched, and of the electron energy loss, which reveals into which final states each specific resonant state decays. The 2 D spectra are presented for acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, at the incident energy range 0. 095 - 1. 0 [*]eV, where the incoming electron is temporarily captured in the lowest π ∗ orbital. The 2 D spectra reveal selectivity patterns with respect to which vibrations are excited in the attachment and de-excited in the detachment. Further insight is gained by recording 1 D spectra measured along horizontal, vertical, and <b>diagonal</b> <b>cuts</b> of the 2 D spectrum. The methyl group in methacrylonitrile increases the resonance width 7 times. This converts the sharp resonances of acrylonitrile into boomerang structures but preserves the essence of the selectivity patterns. Selectivity of vibrational excitation by higher-lying shape resonances up to 8 [*]eV is also reported...|$|R
