2500|$|Many of Takahashi's {{works have}} been {{translated}} into English, {{as well as other}} European languages. Takahashi said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi said [...] "Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'. I suppose the same thing must happen with my books. It's inevitable. And yet, that doesn't mean my books can't be enjoyed by English-speaking readers. I feel confident that there's enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can {{have a lot of fun}} reading them." ...|$|E

50|$|The declension of nouns {{has become}} simpler. Now {{it depends on}} the gender of a noun (smok, o smoku - foka, o foce) (a dragon, about a dragon - a seal, about a seal) and to some extent on the {{hardness}} of a noun's stem (liść, liście - list, listy) (leaf - leaves, letter - letters). Two categories have appeared in the masculine gender: the category of animacy and of personhood (but, widzę but, widzę buty - kot, widzę kota, widzę koty - pilot, widzę pilota, widzę pilotów) (<b>a</b> shoe, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> shoe, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> shoes - <b>a</b> cat, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> cat, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> cats - <b>a</b> pilot, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> pilot, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> pilots).|$|R
