50|$|A popular myth is that rolled <b>knurls</b> are {{somewhat}} more complicated to design than cut <b>knurls</b> because the outer {{diameter of the}} work piece must be chosen to allow the roller to roll an integral number of patterns around the workpiece, in practice if the knurl is applied positively, it will engage with its own impression and create a proper knurl on any diameter of work. The integer number of <b>knurls</b> for any given diameter typically varies by three repetitions from the bottom {{to the top of}} the pattern. By comparison, for cut <b>knurls,</b> the spacing of the cuts is not preset and can be adjusted to allow an integral number of patterns around the workpiece no matter what the diameter of the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Techniques {{have been}} {{designed}} to maintain the general shape of the workpiece during work hardening, including shot peening and equal channel angular extrusion.The range of possible shapes is rather broad, including heads, threads, steps, <b>knurls,</b> chamfers, grooves, undercuts, and tapers.|$|E

During removal, the cutting edges are torn and no longer have full strength to resist unscrewing. ISO standard for Knurled cup point set screw is ISO 4029 ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Knurling</b> is {{also used}} on the grips of darts and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Aside from adding {{functionality}} to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being {{some of the most}} common), <b>knurling</b> also adds a decorative pattern to the material. The <b>knurled</b> nut is one such application, which uses a <b>knurled</b> finish instead of hexagonal or square edges which helps in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The <b>knurled</b> surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a thumb nut. It is mainly used on small diameter bolts.Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles.|$|R

50|$|A <b>knurled</b> nut is a nut with a <b>knurled</b> outside surface. This {{facilitates}} tightening by hand (thumb nut) or secures the nut in a substrate (insertion nut).|$|R
50|$|Knurl point screws are {{generally}} used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the knurl cup set screw helps reduce loosening due to vibration. The knurled point combines digging {{action of the}} cup point with counter-clockwise locking <b>knurls</b> that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.|$|E

40|$|Do <b>knurls</b> improve torque capability? A "pop-bottle " size lid (28 mm diameter, 15 mm high) was {{varied with}} six designs: 1) a smooth lid, 2) a lid with 13 knurls/cm, 3) a lid with 7. 9 knurls/cm, 4) a lid with 3. 9 knurls/cm, 5) a lid with 3. 9 knurls/cm but for only 4 mm of height, and 6) a lid with 2 {{protrusions}} ("radiator type").

50|$|<b>Knurling</b> {{may also}} be used as a repair method: because a rolled-in <b>knurled</b> surface has raised-up areas {{surrounding}} the depressed areas, these raised areas can make up for wear on the part. In the days when labor was cheap and parts expensive, this repair method was feasible on pistons of internal combustion engines, where the skirt of a worn piston was expanded back to the nominal size using a <b>knurling</b> process. As auto parts have become less expensive, <b>knurling</b> has become less prevalent than it once was, and is specifically discouraged by performance engine builders.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} is performed for producing indentations on {{a part of}} a workpiece. <b>Knurling</b> allows hands or fingers to get a better grip on the <b>knurled</b> object than would be provided by the originally smooth metal surface. Occasionally, the <b>knurled</b> pattern is a series of straight ridges or a helix of [...] "straight" [...] ridges rather than the more-usual criss-cross pattern.|$|R
40|$|Over {{its history}} {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) has probably seen {{far and away}} more application in assembling tubes or rings onto (or into) nominally axisymmetric mating elements. The vast majority of these assemblies does not require any significant structural integrity or strength. However, {{a small fraction of}} these are designed and fabricated for mechanically-demanding applications. There are two key factors (which seem to be largely independent) that are key in the design and performance of a crimpedelectromagnetic tube joint. First is the state of residual stress that exists after the crimped joint is created. A natural interference fit seems to be a fairly general feature of EMF crimp joints. This interference gives a backlash-free joint that will not fret. The second key issue is the configuration of the joint. The fabrication of designed interlocking geometries is required to create a joint that maximizes mechanical strength while minimizing the electromagnetic energy and forces required to create it. Both of these issues will be considered here. Here we consider crimping onto textured surfaces such as screw threads and <b>knurls.</b> We show experimentally that approaches of this type can give joints that exceed the strength of the tube both in torsion and axial loading. Analysis methods based on coupling impact-indentation and break-before-strip criteria can be used to compare joints made in this way with those based on the more traditional large scale deformation of the tube. One of the advantages of forming onto 'textured' surfaces is that a number of small pulses (possibly generated by small and inexpensive capacitor banks) can be used to create a joint that has the strength of the parent tube, without any heat affected zones or distortion. Again, the natural interference fit developed by impact eliminates the potential for fretting...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of archaeological rescue works before the A 1 {{motorway}} building in 2008 in Nowa Wieś site 6, Włocławek commune, relics of a late medieval and modern manorial farm and a late medieval manor house were recognized. The most numerous group of artifacts included crushed pottery from among which 12 fragments of so-called Hussite pottery have been distinguished (table I, II). The fragments come from at least 6 containers, including 5 wheel-made ones, made of clay with an admixture of ne-grained sand and one fragment from strongly lathed vessel made of identical ceramic mass as the wheel-made vessels. The containers in the passage between the belly and the short, weakly accentuated necks were decorated with horizontal bands of impressed {{with the use of}} a knurl letters. The preserved edge parts of most probably 4 pots have similarly shaped rims (table I: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, II: 1 – 4, 9). During the ring in reducing atmosphere all the fragments became grey (RAL 7033) to dark grey (RAL 7012) on their inner and outer surfaces. The fractures were 0. 3 – 0. 5 cm thick, in 8 cases were one-coloured (g. 2 : 1), grey (RAL 7033) or darkgrey (RAL 7012), in other cases – two-coloured (g. 2 : 2) with grey-light brown centre (RAL 8001). On all the specimens not big chips in places of white grains of marl or gypsum occurrence were registered (g. 3). No special dispersion of the artifacts has been stated at the site. Only 1 fragment was explored in a pit (object A 219), in the lling containing materials of chronology dened as the 16 th century. The other were registered in objects and cultural layer, which occurred in the late modern period, in llings containing materials dated to the 15 th to 18 th centuries. A characteristic ornament of letters, letter-like signs and letters impressed with a rotary stamp in the described collection appears in 4 variants (g. 4). In 2 cases a full turn of the knurl consists of a row of 5 letters (variants II and III; g. 5 : 1, 2), in one case – 6 signs (variant IV; g. 5 : 3). In the collection from Nowa Wieś most frequent capital letters are: S in a mirror image, G u-turned, M turned left or right at a right angle, B written properly and u-turned, and D impressed properly or u-turned. In the period of the spread of the Hussite ideas in Kuyavia certain sequences of capital letters registered on vessels conveyed denite content to the initiated people. With time, signs transferred by potters {{with the use of a}}nother <b>knurls</b> became only symbols of religious-social movements (in the 16 th century), and later they were only kinds of decoration (cf. Kajzer 1988, 1994; Andrzejewska 1997). It should be emphasized that on one fragment in metopes some signs have been recognized, which accompanied an inscription "maria", registered on a late medieval vessel from Kozi Hrádek in Czech. What is also worth attention is a complicated geometrical ornament and a horizontal band formed by 10 wavy parallel lines identied on a bowl (table III: 1, 2), direct analogies to which are found on late medieval vessels decorated with inscriptions from Czech. Probably not only letters made with the use of a knurl should be treated as an ornament typical of so-called Hussite pottery...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic pulse {{crimping}} of {{form fit}} joints was investigated using tubes with {{a diameter of}} 50 mm and a wall thickness of 1, 5 mm, in the aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060. The tubes were crimped onto steel internal parts, which were designed to bear torsional loads. Grooved, <b>knurl</b> rolled and <b>knurl</b> cut internal workpieces were used. To assess the torque strength of the connections, a torque test set-up was designed and built. In a first test series, grooved internal parts were used. The influence of the internal workpiece design and the energy level on the torque resistance was investigated. Related to the geometry of the internal workpiece, the following parameters were varied: the groove depth, the groove width, the edge radius {{and the number of}} grooves. In a second test series, <b>knurl</b> rolled and <b>knurl</b> cut internal workpieces were used. For the joints with a <b>knurl</b> rolled internal part, the influence of the <b>knurl</b> pattern, defined by the pitch, was investigated.
