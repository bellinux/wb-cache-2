40|$|D. R. Bates (1951) {{proposed}} that a principle cooling {{mechanism for the}} upper atmosphere is the emission from an atomic oxygen magnetic dipole transition at 63 u. Due to the absorption by water vapor this emission is not seeable at ground level, but at 50, 000 feet conditions are such {{that the existence of}} the line is proveable assuming the existence of a filtering device to isolate the line emiss ion. The design considerations and construction of an <b>interference</b> <b>filter</b> using wire mesh as the reflecting surfaces to operate at 63 u is given. Testing of a completed <b>interference</b> <b>filter</b> that operates in second order at 63 u indicates that such a device would give the necessary characteristics - small bandwidth, high transmission - to isolate the line emission from the background radiation. The testing of two reference <b>interference</b> <b>filters</b> that operate in second order at 60 and 66 u is also given. With <b>interference</b> <b>filters</b> designed to isolate a particular order there must be a means of rejecting all other transmission bands. For the <b>interference</b> <b>filters</b> described above a system is described that will eliminate all radiation below 45 u and above 80 u so that the only energy detectable will be the second order transmissions of the three <b>interference</b> <b>filters.</b> Finally the use of the <b>interference</b> <b>filters</b> in an experiment to detect the 63 u atomic oxygen transmission is described. The expected intensities of the line emission and the emission of water vapor at 50, 000 feet (the background) indicated that the use of the <b>interference</b> <b>filters</b> should have proven the existence of the emission line in the upper atmosphere.

The stochastic optimization problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, we utilize the <b>interference</b> <b>filtering</b> property of the CSMA-like MAC protocol and derive a closed-form approximate priority function and the associated error bound using perturbation analysis. Based on the closed-form approximate priority function, we propose a low-complexity power control algorithm solving the per-stage optimization problem. The proposed solution is further shown to be asymptotically optimal for a sufficiently large carrier sensing distance. Finally, the proposed power control scheme is compared with various baselines through simulations, and it is shown that significant performance gain can be achieved.

40|$|The {{additional}} high-frequency (HF) common-mode (CM) {{current of}} inverter-based drive systems can cause parasitic effects such as HF bearing currents. This HF CM current can be significantly reduced by purpose-designed CM chokes that are {{inserted in the}} drive at the inverter output. This paper discusses scaling {{issues related to the}} design of such CM chokes, of both wound and feed-through toroidal types. The requirements for the design of chokes for these applications can differ from those for CM chokes designed for use in the inverter input, such as those used for the purpose of electromagnetic <b>interference</b> <b>filtering.</b> This difference is notably due to the comparatively large magnitude of the currents involved. The developed correlations allow taking full advantage of the possibilities offered by such chokes to reduce the HF CM current and mitigate the resultant parasitic effects.

Therefore, an optional optimized signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and user controlled {{actions on the}} <b>interference</b> <b>filtering</b> are presented in this GOP framework. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation demonstrate that when the ISC is derived from minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) algorithm, the SINR performance of GOP filter is better than both MVDR and oblique projection (OP) filters. Further, an application of GOP filter in ionospheric clutter cancellation in a high frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) system is given. The ISC is designed specifically to introduce an extra coherent loss to the clutters and a satisfying clutter suppression result is achieved. Besides the examples given, more designs of GOP filter can be inspired by the flexibility of ISC.

The most commonly used method to test earthing grids is accurate and reliable, but only for installations with low background noise, a limited number of feeders and a low system impedance. These limitations have motivated research into improvements in testing equipment. A robust current controlled inverter is introduced for use in high noise earthing system tests. This equipment was tested on-site, demonstrating improvements in noise rejection and stability. These improvements had little impact on the accurate measurement of small test signals elsewhere in the test.

40|$|Application of {{adaptive}} matched field processing {{to the problem}} of detecting quiet targets in shallow water is complicated by source motion, both the motion of the target and the motion of discrete interferers. Target motion causes spreading of the target peak, thereby reducing output signal power. Interferer motion increases the dimensionality of the interference subspace, reducing adaptive interference suppression. This paper presents three techniques that mitigate source motion problems in adaptive matched field processing. The first involves rank reduction, which enables adaptive weight computation over short observation intervals where motion effects are less pronounced. The other two techniques specifically compensate for source motion. Explicit target motion compensation reduces target motion mismatch by focusing snapshots according to a target velocity hypothesis. And time-varying <b>interference</b> <b>filtering</b> places time-varying nulls on moving interferers not otherwise suppressed by adaptive weights. The three techniques are applied to volumetric array data from the Santa Barbara Channel Experiment and are shown to improve output signal-to-background-plus-noise ratio by more than 3 dB over the standard minimum-variance, distortionless response adaptive beam-former.

Since most applications are delay-sensitive, {{it is very}} important to consider delay performance in addition to physical layer throughput for D 2 D communications. To improve delay performance it is necessary to dynamically control the radio resource in a cross-layer way according to both the channel fading information and the queue length information. The former allows an observation of good transmission opportunity and the latter provides the urgency of data flows. However, the resource control with delay constraints involves stochastic optimization, which is very challenging.
