40|$|Fumaric acid (FA) is a {{promising}} biomass-derived building-block chemical. Bio-based FA production from renewable feedstock is {{a promising}} and sustainable alternative to petroleum-based chemical synthesis. Here {{we report on}} FA production by direct fermentation using metabolically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{with the aid of}} in silico analysis of a genome-scale metabolic model. First, FUM 1 was selected as the target gene on the basis of extensive literature mining. Flux balance analysis (FBA) revealed that FUM 1 deletion can lead to FA production and slightly lower growth of <b>S.</b> cerevisiae. The <b>engineered</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae strain obtained by deleting FUM 1 can produce FA up to a concentration of 610 ± 31 mg L(- 1) without any apparent change in growth in fed-batch culture. FT-IR and (1) H and (13) C NMR spectra confirmed that FA was synthesized by the <b>engineered</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae strain. FBA identified pyruvate carboxylase as one of the factors limiting higher FA production. When the RoPYC gene was introduced, S. cerevisiae produced 1134 ± 48 mg L(- 1) FA. Furthermore, the final <b>engineered</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae strain was able to produce 1675 ± 52 mg L(- 1) FA in batch culture when the SFC 1 gene encoding a succinate-fumarate transporter was introduced. These results demonstrate that the model shows great predictive capability for metabolic engineering. Moreover, FA production in S. cerevisiae can be efficiently developed with the aid of in silico metabolic engineering...|$|R

40|$|Khipus are knotted-cord devices {{once used}} in the Andes for {{communication}} and recording information. Although numbers can be read on many khipus, it is unknown how other forms of data may have been recorded on the strings. Scholars currently debate whether elements of cord construction, such as the direction of ply, signified meaning on khipus and, if so, how. Testimony from an Aymara-speaking khipu maker, collected in 1895 by Max Uhle and recovered from Uhle's unpublished field notes, combined with the analysis of his actual khipu provides the first direct evidence that ply was a signifying element in khipus.
