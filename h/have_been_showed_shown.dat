The proof required the multi-plicative rational independence of parameters and the calculation of Hausdorff measure. In this paper we present a proof which does not have either of these requirements and so we identify a whole new class of 2 -vertex directed graph IFSs. We extend this result to n-vertex (n> 2, CSSC) directed graph IFSs, defined on the unit interval, with no effective restriction on {{the form of the}} associated directed graph, subject only to a condition regarding level- 1 gap lengths.

40|$|Fourier {{series of}} smooth, non-periodic {{functions}} on [− 1, 1] {{are known to}} exhibit the Gibbs phenomenon, and exhibit overall slow convergence. One way of overcoming these problems is by using a Fourier series on a larger domain, say [−T, T] with T > 1, a technique called Fourier extension or Fourier continuation. When constructed as the discrete least squares minimizer in equidistant points, the Fourier extension <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>shown</b> to converge geometrically in the truncation parameter N. A fast O(N log²N) algorithm <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described to compute Fourier extensions for the case where T = 2, compared to O(N³) for solving the dense discrete least squares problem. We present two O(N log²N) algorithms for the computation of these approximations for the case of general T, made possible by exploiting the connection between Fourier extensions and Prolate Spheroidal Wave theory. The first algorithm {{is based on the}} explicit computation of so-called periodic discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, while the second algorithm is purely algebraic and only implicitly based on the theory. nrpages: 20 status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> Cdc6p <b>shows</b> proto-oncogenic activity. Cdc6 {{overexpression}} {{interferes with}} the expression of INK4/ARF tumor suppressor genes through a mechanism involving the epigenetic modification of chromatin at the INK4/ARF locus. In addition, Cdc6p overexpression in primary cells may promote DNA hyperreplication and induce a senescence response similar to that caused by oncogene activation. These findings indicate that deregulation of CDC6 expression in human cells poses a serious risk of carcinogenesis. Down-regulation of CDC6 in prostate cancer was observed and associated with phenotypic characteristics of aggressive prostate cancer. Furthermore, it has beenobserved that Cdc6 is greatly up-regulated in cervical cancer, lung cancer and brain cancer.|$|R
30|$|Quinones play an {{important}} role in medicine. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production and quenching of free radicals from oxygen species. The mitochondria play a central role in the formation of excess ROS. Quinones can target the mitochondria and re-establish electron transfer in deficiency states. For example, in antiphospholipid syndrome, treatment with co-enzyme Q <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to alter mitochondrial dynamics resulting in lower oxidative stress and slowing of the accelerated atherosclerosis (Perez-Sanchez et al. 2012). Co-enzyme Q <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to prevent retinal cell apoptosis when given as eye drops in mouse models of kainate-induced retinal damage (Lulli et al. 2012). Quinones are also being investigated for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases (Enns et al. 2012) as well as age-related diseases (Skulachev et al. 2009). In one small open-label study, patients with terminal genetic mitochondrial diseases were treated with a para-benzoquinone (alpha-trocotrienol quinone) for 13 weeks as an emergency treatment protocol. This therapy modified disease progression in 90 % of the patients by increasing quality of life and improving central nervous system oxidation state (Enns et al. 2012). This quinone is currently undergoing clinical trials for diseases such as Friedreich’s ataxia, Leigh Syndrome, and Tourette syndrome.|$|R
