50|$|<b>Iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> is an iodine-containing radiocontrast medium used in cholecystography. Both <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and ipodate sodium are potent inhibitors of {{thyroid hormone}} release from thyroid gland, {{as well as}} of {{peripheral}} conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). These compounds inhibit 5'deiodinase (5'DID-1 and 5'DID-2) enzymes, which catalyse T4-T3 conversion in the thyroid cell, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, pituitary. This accounts for the dramatic improvement in both subjective and objective symptoms of hyperthyroidism, particularly when they are used as an adjunctive therapy with thioamides (propylthiouracil, carbimazole). They can be used in the treatment of patients with severe thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm) and significant morbidity (e.g., myocardial infarction, or stroke) for rapid control of elevated plasma triiodothyronine concentrations. The use of <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> for treatment of thyrotoxicosis has been discontinued in the United States.|$|E

To test the hypothesis that the acute decrease in thyrotropin (TSH) after infusion of T 4 into hypothyroid rats requires intrapituitary T 4 to 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyroxine (T 3) conversion, the effect of <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment on the generation of nuclear T 3 from intrapituitary conversion and the response to TSH were compared in control and iopanoic acid-treated animals. 5 mg/ 100 g body weight <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> given 24, 16, and 1. 5 h before administration of 125 I-T 4 reduced the quantity of pituitary nuclear 125 I-T 3 from local (intrapituitary) T 4 to T 3 conversion by 60 - 100 %. In association with inhibition of intrapituitary T 4 to T 3 conversion, there was an increase in the binding of 125 I-T 4 to the nuclear receptor of the pituitary but the total iodothyronine content of the nuclei was still {{less than half of the}} nuclear iodothyronine in control animals. <b>Iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> did not affect the nuclear/plasma ratio of injected 131 I-T 3 in the same animals, but did appear to impair 131 I-T 3 clearance or reduce its distribution volume. Treatment with <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> did not reduce the quantity of nuclear 125 I-T 3 in the liver, kidney, or heart of the same animals more than expected from the changes in serum 125 I-T 3.

40|$|OBJECTIVE Thyroid hormones {{participate}} in GH synthesis and secretion, and an impaired GH response to many pharmacological stimuli, including GH releasing hormone (GHRH), {{has been found}} in thyrotoxicosis, Although the mechanisms involved in this process have not been fully elucidated, there is evidence that thyroid hormones could act at both hypothalamic and pituitary levels, There are no data in the literature about the effect of an acute reduction of circulating T 3 levels on GH secretion in hyperthyroidism, the GH responsiveness to GHRH was therefore evaluated in a group of hyperthyroid patients during short-term treatment with <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> lopanoic acid is a compound that induces a rapid decrease in serum T 3 levels, mainly by inhibition of peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3, To the authors' knowledge, {{there is no evidence of}} a direct effect of <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> on GH secretion. DESIGN Hyperthyroid patients were submitted to a GHRH test (100 mu g. i,v,) before (day 0), and on days 4, 7 and 15 after oral treatment with <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (3 g every 3 days) and propylthiouracil (200 mg every 8 h). A group of normal control subjects was also submitted to a single GHRH test (100 mu g, i. v,). PATIENTS Nine patients with thyrotoxicosis (eight women, one man), with a mean age of 34 years, were studied, All patients had high serum levels of total T 3 and total T 4, and suppressed TSH levels, None of them had taken any medication for at least 3 months before the study. the patients were compared with a group of nine control subjects (five women, four men) with a mean age of 31 years. MEASUREMENTS GH and TSH were measured by immunofluorometric assays. Total T 3, total T 4 and IGF-I were determined by radioimmunoassay. Albumin levels were measured by a colorimetric method. RESULTS lopanoic acid induced a rapid and maintained decrease in serum T 3 concentrations, with a significant reduction on days 4, 7 and 15 compared with pre-treatment values. in hyperthyroidism, peak GH levels (mean +/- SE mU/l) after GHRH were significantly higher on day 15 (24. 4 +/- 13. 8) than those observed on days 0 (14. 2 +/- 1. 6), 4 (15. 2 +/- 3. 0) and 7 (19. 6 +/- 5. 0). There was a 79 % increase in this response on day 15 compared with the pre-treatment period. Hyperthyroid patients had a blunted GH response to GHRH on days 0, 4 and 7 in comparison with control subjects, However, on day 15, no differences were observed between the area under the curve (mean i SE mU/l. 120 min) in thyrotoxic patients (1770 +/- 306) and in the control group (3300 +/- 816), IGF- 1 and albumin levels did not change during <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> administration. CONCLUSIONS the results show that an acute reduction in serum T 3 levels elicits an increase in GH responsiveness to GHRH in hyperthyroidism, Although the mechanisms involved in this process are still unknown, it is possible that T 3 influences GH responsiveness to GHRH via hypothalamic somatostatin release, Alternatively, T 3 could have a direct effect at the pituitary somatotroph, modulating GHRH intracellular pathways.

40|$|Abstract Background Iophenoxic acid is an iodinated {{radiocontrast agent}} that was {{withdrawn}} from clinical use {{because of its}} exceptionally long half-life in the body, which was {{due in part to}} its high-affinity binding to human serum albumin (HSA). It was replaced by <b>Iopanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> which has an amino rather than a hydroxyl group at position 3 on the iodinated benzyl ring and, as a result, binds to albumin with lower affinity and is excreted more rapidly from the body. To understand how iophenoxic acid binds so tightly to albumin, we wanted to examine the structural basis of its interaction with HSA. Results We have determined the co-crystal structure of HSA in complex with iophenoxic acid at 2. 75 Å resolution, revealing a total of four binding sites, two of which - in drugs sites 1 and 2 on the protein - are likely to be occupied at clinical doses. High-affinity binding of iophenoxic acid occurs at drug site 1. The structure reveals that polar and apolar groups on the compound are involved in its interactions with drug site 1. In particular, the 3 -hydroxyl group makes three hydrogen bonds with the side-chains of Tyr 150 and Arg 257. The mode of binding to drug site 2 is similar except for the absence of a binding partner for the hydroxyl group on the benzyl ring of the compound. Conclusions The HSA-iophenoxic acid structure indicates that high-affinity binding to drug site 1 is likely to be due to extensive desolvation of the compound, coupled with the ability of the binding pocket to provide a full set of salt-bridging or hydrogen bonding partners for its polar groups. Consistent with this interpretation, the structure also suggests that the lower-affinity binding of <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> arises because replacement of the 3 -hydroxyl by an amino group eliminates hydrogen bonding to Arg 257. This finding underscores the importance of polar interactions in high-affinity binding to albumin. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid hormone receptors {{generally}} activate transcription {{of target}} {{genes in the}} presence of thyroid hormone (T 3) and repress their transcription in its absence. Here, we investigated the role of unliganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR) during vertebrate development using an amphibian model. Previous studies led to the hypothesis that before production of endogenous T 3, the presence of unliganded receptor is essential for premetamorphic tadpole growth. To test this hypothesis, we generated a Xenopus laevis TR β mutant construct ineffective for gene repression owing to impaired corepressor NCoR recruitment. Overexpression by germinal transgenesis of the mutant receptor leads to lethality during early development with numerous defects in cranio-facial and eye development. These effects correlate with TR expression profiles at these early stages. Molecular analysis of transgenic mutants reveals perturbed expression of genes involved in eye development. Finally, treatment with <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> or NH- 3, modulators of thyroid hormone action, leads to abnormal eye development.

40|$|Amiodarone (AM), {{a potent}} class III {{anti-arrhythmic}} drug, is an iodine-rich compound with a structural resemblance to thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4). At the commonly employed doses, AM causes iodine overload up to 50 - 100 times the optimal daily intake, {{which may be}} responsible of a spectrum of effects on thyroid function often counterbalancing its heart benefits. Although most patients on chronic AM treatment remain euthyroid, a consistent proportion may develop thyrotoxicosis (AM-induced thyrotoxicosis, AIT) or hypothyroidism. AIT is more prevalent in iodine-deficient areas and is currently subdivided in two different clinico-pathological forms (AIT I and AIT II). AIT I develops in subjects with underlying thyroid disease, and is caused by an exacerbation by iodine load of thyroid autonomous function; AIT II occurs in patients with no underlying thyroid disease and is probably consequent to a drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. Mixed or indeterminate forms of AIT encompassing several features of both AIT I and AIT II may be also observed. The differential diagnosis between AIT I and AIT II (which {{is important for the}} choice of the appropriate therapy) is currently made on radioiodine uptake (RAIU), which may be high, normal or low but detectable in AIT I, while is consistently very low or undetectable in AIT II and on colour-flow Doppler sonography (CFDS) showing normal or increased vascularity in AIT I and absent vascularity in AIT II. Quite recently, studies carried out in our Units at the University of Cagliari (Italy) showed that sestaMIBI thyroid scintigraphy may represent the best single test to differentiate AIT I (showing increased MIBI retention) from AIT II (displaying no significant uptake). Treatment of AIT is dependent from its etiology. AIT usually responds to combined thionamides and potassium perchlorate (KClO 4) therapy, AIT II generally responds to glucocorticoids, while indeterminate forms may require both therapeutic approaches. In patients with AIT I definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism by administration of (131) I, initially not feasible for the low RAIU and/or the risk of thyrotoxicosis exacerbation, is advised after normalization of iodine overload. To control severe AIT additional treatment with lithium carbonate, the use of short course of <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and plasmapheresis have been also proposed. In cases resistant to medical treatment and/or in patients with severe cardiac diseases who cannot interrupt AM or require quick AM reintroduction, total thyroidectomy (possibly carried out by minimally invasive video-assisted technique) may be proposed after rapid correction of thyrotoxicosis with combination of thionamides, KClO 4, corticosteroids and a short course of <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{thyroid gland}} synthesizes {{thyroxine}} (T 4), which {{passes through the}} larval tadpole's circulatory system. The enzyme type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D 2) converts thyroxine (T 4) to the active hormone 3, 5, 3 ′-triiodothyronine (T 3) in peripheral tissues. An early response to thyroid hormone (TH) in the Xenopus laevis tadpole is the stimulation of cell division in cells that line the brain ventricles, the lumen of the spinal cord, and the limb buds. These cells express constitutively high levels of D 2 mRNA. Exogenous T 4 induces early DNA synthesis in brain, spinal cord, and limb buds as efficiently as T 3. The deiodinase inhibitor <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> blocks T 4 - but not T 3 -induced cell division. At metamorphic climax, both TH-induced cell division and D 2 expression decrease in the brain. Then D 2 expression appears in late-responding tissues including the anterior pituitary, the intestine, and the tail where cell division is reduced or absent. Therefore, constitutive expression of D 2 occurs in the earliest target tissues of TH that will grow and differentiate, while TH-induced expression of D 2 takes place in late-responding tissues that will remodel or die. This pattern of constitutive and induced D 2 expression contributes to the timing of metamorphic changes in these tissues...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of Osteoarthritis (OA) {{research}} the step from genetics to biological functionality, also named ‘functional genomics’, is necessary to allow valorisation of genetic findings, thereby augmenting the need for functional data of disease relevant tissues. Even so, {{it was estimated that}} pursuing druggable targets directed by genetic studies are twice as often successful as compared to those without it. In this thesis we apply the functional genomics methodology, to proceed from a genetic association to mechanistic understanding of the effect of genetic variation on gene expression and epigenetic regulation contributing to OA susceptibility. Particularly we set out to characterize and validate the pathophysiological processes that underlie the role of DIO 2 /thyroid hormone signalling in the onset of OA after identifying the DIO 2 gene as a OA susceptibility locus. The results in this thesis show that intracellular T 3 levels should be strictly regulated via DIO 2 upon mechanical loading of the cartilage, to ensure cartilage tissue homeostasis. Future endeavours should be designed to demonstrate that local inhibition of DIO 2 by intra-articular admission of a deiodinase-inhibitor (<b>Iopanoic</b> <b>acid),</b> could be an effective therapy to alleviate the burden of OA thereby increasing mobility, well-being and quality of life particularly among elderly...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{mechanisms of}} extrathyroidal thyroid hormone metabolism, conversion of thyroxine (T 4) to 3, 5, 3 ′-triiodothyronine (T 3) and degradation of 3, 3 ′, 5 ′-triiodothyronine (rT 3) were studied in rat liver homogenates. Both reactions were enzymatic. For conversion of T 4 to T 3, the Km of T 4 was 7. 7 μM, and the Vmax was 0. 13 pmol T 3 /min per mg protein. For rT 3 degradation, the Km of rT 3 was 7. 5 nM, and the Vmax was 0. 36 pmol rT 3 /min per mg protein. Production of rT 3 or degradation of T 4 or T 3 was not detected under the conditions employed. rT 3 was a potent competitive inhibitor of T 4 to T 3 conversion with a Ki of 4. 5 nM; 3, 3 ′-diiodothyronine was a less potent inhibitor of this reaction. T 4 was a competitive inhibitor of rT 3 degradation with a Ki of 10. 2 μM. Agents which inhibited both reactions included propylthiouracil, {{which appeared to}} be an allosteric inhibitor, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Sodium diatrizoate had a weak inhibitory effect.

40|$|Thyroid hormone (TH) is an ancestral signal linked to seasonal {{life history}} {{transitions}} throughout vertebrates. TH action depends upon tissue-localized regulation of levels of active TH (triiodothyronine, T 3), through spatiotemporal expression of thyroid hormone deiodinase (dio) genes. We investigated the dio gene family in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr, which prepare for seaward migration {{in the spring}} (smoltification) through TH-dependent changes in physiology. We identified two type 2 deiodinase paralogs, dio 2 a and dio 2 b, responsible for conversion of thyroxine (T 4) to T 3. During smoltification, dio 2 b was induced {{in the brain and}} gills in zones of cell proliferation following increasing day length. Contrastingly, dio 2 a expression was induced in the gills by transfer to salt water (SW), with the magnitude of the response proportional to the plasma chloride level. This response reflected a selective enrichment for osmotic response elements (OREs) in the dio 2 a promoter region. Transcriptomic profiling of gill tissue from fish transferred to SW plus or minus the deiodinase inhibitor, <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> revealed SW-induced increases in cellular respiration as the principal consequence of gill dio 2 activity. Divergent evolution of dio 2 paralogs supports organ-specific timing of the TH-dependent events governing the phenotypic plasticity required for migration to sea...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of isoenzymes mediating {{the conversion of}} thyroxine to 3, 5, 3 ′-triiodothyronine has been studied according to characteristic kinetics and physiological regulation. In this paper, we report the expression of type II 5 ′-deiodinase (5 ′D) activity in oocytes of Xenopus laevis. Oocytes injected with total RNA extracted from rat Harderian gland, and then incubated up to five days demonstrated a progressive increase in 5 ′D activity, reaching a maximal value at 24 h; then, 5 ′D activity remained almost stable for an additional period of four days. Characteristics of the enzyme activity expressed by oocytes included its inhibition by <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> but not by propylthiouracil, and its increase during β-adrenergic agonist treatment and hypothyroidism. The expressed activity manifests characteristics typical of the type II isoenzyme. Deiodinating activity in oocytes also exhibited diurnal variations. In this study, 5 ′D activity expressed in oocytes exhibited low values when animals were killed during the day, and high values when animals were killed at night. Maximal values were reached 3 – 4 h before the nocturnal peak of 5 ′D activity in Harderian gland crude homogenates. Results suggest that the in vivo activation of 5 ′D by isoproterenol, hypothyroidism, or dark exposure {{may be caused by}} an increase in the synthesis and/or maturation of the RNA expressing the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine and spermine {{have been}} thought {{to play an}} {{important}} role in thyroid growth induced by goitrogens. Reduced biosynthesis of these polyamines might play a role in the antigoitrogenic effects of excess iodide. This study was designed to examine the effect of potassium iodide (KI) on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines. Thyroidal ODC activity, protein content and mRNA were increased in rats made hypothyroid by 10 days of propylthiouracil treatment. The increase in ODC activity was suppressed after subcutaneous injection of KI (13 mg/kg body weight); the apparent half-life of ODC activity after the treatment was estimated to be 19 min and the maximum suppression (90 %) was seen 60 min after the treatment. On the other hand, administration of iodine-containing compounds including L-thyroxine, L-di-iodotyrosine, amiodarone, <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and erythrosine showed no significant effect on ODC activity. The inhibitory effect of excess iodide was not reversed by pretreatment with dibutyryl cAMP and theophylline. The amount of immunoreactive ODC protein was reduced by iodide treatment (40 %). However, the decrease was not as great as the decrease in ODC activity (90 %). No significant change in thyroidal ODC mRNA content was seen 1 and 3 h following KI treatment. These results suggest that excess iodide reduces ODC activity in the rat thyroid gland by a post-transcriptional mechanism. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the effects of topically applied {{triiodothyronine}} (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)) on the arterioles of hamster cheek pouch microcirculation in vivo. Microvessels were visualized using a fluorescent microscopy technique. Topical application of T(3) (3. 08, 30. 8, 61. 5, 307, 615, and 6, 150 nM/l) consistently induced dose-dependent dilation of arterioles within 2. 0 +/- 0. 5 min of administration. The application of T(4) (150, 257, 514, and 5, 140 nM/l) caused different dose-dependent effects: dilation at the three lower doses within 16 +/- 2 min and rhythmic diameter changes at the highest dose. Aging of hamsters did not alter the arteriolar responses to T(3) and T(4). T(3) -induced dilation was countered by the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with N(G) -nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester or N(G) -nitro-L-arginine. <b>Iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (IPA), which inhibits types I and II 5 '-deiodinase, abolished the dilation elicited by 514 nM T(4) but did not affect T(3) -dependent dilation. 6 -Propyl- 2 -thiouracil (PTU), which inhibits type I 5 '-deiodinase only, did not affect the dilation induced by T(4). IPA and PTU did not impair arteriolar dilation induced by acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside. These results indicate that T(3) induces arteriolar dilation, likely through nitric oxide release. The local conversion of T(4) to T(3) appears to be crucial for the dilation induced by T(4) ...|$|E
40|$|Our recent in vivo {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that intrapituitary l-thyroxine (T 4) to 3, 5, 3 ′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T 3) conversion with subsequent nuclear binding of T 3 is an important pathway by which circulating T 4 can inhibit thyrotropin release. The present studies were performed to evaluate various physiological and pharmacological influences on these two processes in rat anterior pituitary tissue. Intact pituitary fragments were incubated in buffer— 1 % bovine serum albumin containing 0. 14 ng/ml [131 I]T 3 and 3. 8 ng/ml [125 I]T 4. Nuclei were isolated after 3 h of incubation and the bound iodothyronines identified by paper chromatography. There was 0. 3 - 1 % [125 I]T 3 contaminating the medium [125 I]T 4, and this did not change during incubation. Nuclear [125 I]T 4 was not decreased by 650 -fold excesses of medium T 3 or T 4, suggesting that it was nonspecifically bound. The ratio of nuclear to medium [131 I]- and [125 I]T 3 were expressed as nuclear counts per minute per milligram wet weight of tissue:counts per minute per microliter medium. Intrapituitary T 4 to T 3 conversion was evidenced {{by the fact that the}} nuclear:medium (N:M) ratio for [131 I]T 3 was 0. 45 ± 0. 21, whereas that for [125 I]T 3 was 2. 23 ± 1. 28 (mean±SD, n = 51). A ratio (R), the N:M [125 I]T 3 divided by the N:M [131 I]T 3, was used as an index of intrapituitary T 4 to T 3 conversion. Increasing medium T 3 concentrations up to 50 ng/ml caused a progressive decrease in the N:M ratio for both T 3 isotopes, but no change in the value for R, indicating that both competed for the same limited-capacity nuclear receptors. Increasing concentrations of medium T 4 caused no change in the N:M [131 I]T 3 but did cause a significant decrease in R in three of four experiments. These results suggest saturation of T 4 - 5 ′-monodeiodination occurred at lower T 4 concentrations than saturation of nuclear T 3 binding sites. In hypothyroid rats, the N:M ratios for both [131 I]T 3 and [125 I]T 3 were increased (P < 0. 005), but R was three-fold higher than in controls (P < 0. 005). Animals given 10 μg T 4 / 100 g body wt per d for 5 d had significantly decreased N:M ratios for both [131 I]T 3 and [125 I]T 3, as well as a decreased value for R. In fasted rats, neither N:M ratio was depressed, although hepatic T 4 to T 3 conversion in the same animals was 50 % of control (P < 0. 005). <b>Iopanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (13 μM), but not 6 -n-propylthiouracil (29 μM), decreased the N:M [125 I]T 3 with a significant decrease in the value for R (P < 0. 025 or less). Neither sodium iodide (6 μM) nor thyrotropin-releasing hormone (7 - 700 nM) affected the T 3 N:M ratios. These results indicate that intrapituitary T 4 to T 3 conversion is stimulated in hypothyroidism and depressed in T 4 -treated animals, whereas opposite changes occur in hepatic T 4 - 5 ′-monodeiodination. Unlike liver, anterior pituitary T 4 - 5 ′-monodeiodination is not affected by fasting or incubation with 6 -n-propyl- 2 -thiouracil, but T 4 to T 3 conversion is inhibited in both by <b>iopanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> These results indicate that there are important differences between anterior pituitary and other tissues in the regulation of T 4 - 5 ′-monodeiodination...|$|E
