50|$|<b>Demographic</b> <b>segmentation</b> is the {{division}} of the market based on an individual's sex, age, income and life style. <b>Demographic</b> <b>segmentation</b> is used the most frequently by businesses in comparison to the other market segments. This is possibly because of the ability to easily collect this kind of information. The national census of a country collects this kind of information. <b>Demographic</b> <b>segmentation</b> has been challenged with scholars stating that demographic segmentations such as age and sex are poor behaviour predictors. However, other studies have showed that <b>demographic</b> <b>segmentation</b> is accurate and effective when analysed as a group rather than looking at an individual's behaviour.|$|E

In addition to country- wide, time- wise, and product or industry-wise differences, there are <b>demographic</b> market <b>segmentation</b> studies in different methodologies. Thus, this study is conducted in cloth usage in Ampara District of Sri Lanka in 2015 using discriminant analysis. This study attempts to examine significant differences exist among the low usage group and high usage group in terms of <b>demographic</b> market <b>segmentation</b> and to develop a discriminant model between <b>demographic</b> market <b>segmentation</b> variables and usage groups. Based on previous empirical findings, a conceptual model is titled as selected <b>demographic</b> market <b>segmentation</b> variables and usage. This study considers 98 cloth marketers in Ampara District of Sri Lanka. This study adopted a non- probability sampling technique of convenience sampling. This study used a discriminant analysis as a new technique for <b>demographic</b> market <b>segmentation.</b> Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation were used in this study. Wilky‘s Lambda and discriminant functional analysis were also made in this study. SPSS having the version of 22. 0 was used in this study. It is found that there is significant difference among the low usage group and high usage group in terms of <b>demographic</b> market <b>segmentation</b> variables such as income, family size and age.

The research follows a grounded theory approach, guided by Strauss and Corbin (1998). The primary research was conducted in Tokyo.

However, use of these devices differed among <b>demographic</b> <b>segmentations</b> and consumers held unfavourable views towards the overload of irrelevant incoming ads. As a result, the recommendations made for the Japanese mobile advertising industry were: (1) for advertisers to use Bayesian Networks to create highly targeted ads; (2) to improve communication between advertisers and mobile phone engineers, and (3) to discontinue lacklustre text only ads and create innovative multimedia ads.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine baby boomers' {{shopping}} behaviours and to investigate their relationships with demographics and personal values. A questionnaire concerning shopping behaviours, personal values and demographics was mailed to a random sample of 2975 people aged 40 - 70 years in Victoria, Australia. Usable questionnaires of 1031 were obtained. Structural equation modelling was employed for data analyses. The analyses revealed that demographics and personal values influenced shopping behaviours via different pathways among male and female baby boomers. For example, self-direction positively impacted on shopping planning for men but negatively influenced price minimization for women. Among women only, age was positively related to shopping planning and negatively to price minimization. Thus, both personal values and demographics influenced baby boomers' shopping behaviours.

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{investigates the}} factors influencing Nigerians’ trust and adoption of mobile banking technology; using an integrative model. Research was conducted using a questionnaire developed and distributed in Nigeria. Out of 2256 returned questionnaires, 1725 were deemed {{to have been}} completed and hence usable. The data was analysed using confirmatory factor analysis and {{the results showed that}} confidentiality, integrity, authentication, access control, best business practices and non-repudiation significantly influenced technology trust with availability showing unsatisfactory values for consideration. In addition, technology trust showed a direct significant influence on perceived ease of use and usefulness. Technology trust also showed an indirect influence on intention to use through its impact on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Also, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness showed significant influence on consumer’s intention to adopt the technology. As a result of increased understanding of customer trust and adoption trends in Nigeria, these findings have important theoretical implications for researchers with interests in technology acceptance trends and the role of external factors, such as trust, in user adoption of technology. Such implications include the provision of empirical data, which highlights the role technology trust, <b>demographic</b> <b>segmentations,</b> perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness play in mobile banking adoption in Nigeria.

The survey instrument was designed based on validated measures and three focus group interviews. Data were collected at supermarkets in the major cities which yielded 935 usable responses. The 23 attributes that measured attitudes were factor analysed and five dimensions were generated. Of these, the strongest dimension was ‘Certification’ which accounted for 24. 7 % {{of the total variance}} of 58. 4 % explained by the five dimensions. This dimension included food safety, government regulations and correct labelling. Chinese consumers are highly concerned about food safety issues relating to personal health. The findings also revealed that gender, age and educational level had no significant relationship in influencing the purchase intentions. However, income, attitudes and pre-purchase intentions all demonstrated weak to moderate significant correlations with purchase intentions of organic food. Gender moderated the relationship between attitudes and purchase intentions. Finally, a cluster analysis was performed which generated three distinct clusters, which we named safety conscious, gastronomes and sceptics. The distinctive features of the profiles of these three clusters are discussed in the paper.

In order to provide a framework for how the database is segmented for product strategy, this research undertook indepth interview and case studies to explore the process. Four main issues were developed for investigation including: what bases and variables, sequence of bases, sources of information and method of segmentation were used during product development. The findings of this research showed that the database is segmented during two stages of product strategy development: product research and testing. The main bases used for research and testing is behavioural data stored in the firm's database. During research and testing of the product, the database is segmented mainly on behaviour with demographics being added in certain industries. Attitudinal data is merely used to understand the needs of behavioural segments rather than to segment database customers. The sequence of bases applied to egmentation for research and testing is usually that of behaviour followed by <b>demographics.</b> Furthermore, <b>segmentation</b> for idea generation, testing and research is based solely on data from a firm's internal database (to the exclusion of external databases) and only the 'a priori' segmentation method is applied to the database.
