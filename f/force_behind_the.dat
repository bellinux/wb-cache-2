He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, {{at a time when most}} computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) {{became the}} driving <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Counter-Reformation in {{response}} to the Protestant movement.

In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.|$|E

If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E

He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.|$|E

5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as the driving <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses {{over the course of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and {{thousands}} of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or by being the main <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and {{the first few years}} of the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the project}} was closely tied to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the project was a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Burger King's Russell Klein would attribute the three game project as being the driving <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> company's 40% quarterly sales increase.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E
