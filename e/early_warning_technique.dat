50|$|Heaton was {{initially}} interested in earthquake prediction. However, {{one of the}} implications of his now accepted pulse like model for earthquake ruptures is that predicting when an earthquake is going to happen is very difficult if not impossible. This is because it does not require that the background stress on the fault plane to be uniformly high everywhere in order to initiate rupture as pulse like ruptures can propagate in relatively low background stress. Accordingly, stresses need only to be high at isolated locations which may not be accessible to direct observation as those locations are not apriori known. However, the pulse like rupture mode has an inherent merit; it implies that the slip at any point ceases within {{a short period of time}} after the passage of the rupture front at this location and long before the whole earthquake stops. Since scaling relations between slip and total rupture length exist, the pulse like model implies that it may be possible to predict, at least in a probabilistic sense, how long the earthquake rupture could be once the slip values at some points are recorded and in the pulse like model we can have information about final slip values shortly after the initiation of rupture. This opens new premises in the field of earthquake early warnings. The virtual seismologist, which is an innovative earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>technique,</b> is an example of the achievements of Heaton's group in that field.|$|E

The AVHRR time series show differences in these volcanoes' pre- and postexplosive trends: Bezymianny exhibited a thermal precursory signal in all recorded explosions between 1993 and 1998, as well as continued postexplosive activity, and Kliuchevskoi showed only short-lived thermal activity and exhibited precursors before the 1994 paroxysmal explosion. These contrasting characteristics reflect different magma types and eruption styles. At Bezymianny, a persistent thermal signal and precursory thermal increases are due to the slow ascent of andesitic magma, whereas the more rapid rise, effusion, and cooling of basaltic magmas at Kliuchevskoi give rise to a discontinuous thermal pattern. Documentation, analysis, and understanding of these characteristics contribute to the understanding of thermal signals and aid the development of monitoring algorithms and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>techniques.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Drought and {{desertification}} {{are serious}} problems that significantly affect {{hundreds of millions}} of people and ecosystems. When drought occurs, the farm communities are usually the first to be affected because of their heavy dependence on the stored soil water. If the rainfall deficiencies continue, even people who are not directly engaged in agriculture will be affected by drought. This underscores the vulnerability of entire societies to this phenomenon; this vulnerability varies significantly from one nation to another. Although crisis management approach is routinely followed approach for providing relief, the studies on drought, carried out in different parts of the world, suggested that preparedness is better than relief and information is backbone of drought preparedness. However, the efforts have been taken for generating micro-level drought assessment and early warning is least understood until recent years. It was therefore, in this study, an attempt has been made to develop a micro-level drought preparedness framework to support rural farm families. The established practices such as Sources of Agricultural Information management (International/National/Extra-Institutional), Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Enabled Rural Knowledge Centres (RKC), Open and Distance Learning Methods, micro-level drought assessment and <b>early</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>technique</b> have been identified as key components in developing such framework. These components were considered as the objectives of this research study, and conducted series of studies and experiments to understand the existing approaches and needed arrangements in defining and developing proposed framework. For each finding reported in the experimental objectives, a clear chain of evidence was established Abstract supported also by interview statements. The individual micro-level drought preparedness framework components were integrated carefully, based on the series of findings, systemic analysis of the data and the continuous interpretation of the observations, to develop the proposed framework. The study concludes that the proposed framework has shown a way to improve micro-level drought preparedness by bringing various ICT tools, information management techniques, open learning approaches, and micro-level drought assessment technique under one umbrella with an intermediary entity called ICT enabled RKCs owned and run by rural farm families. The usability evaluation studies on individual components revealed that the approaches such as these will have implications in planning micro-level drought preparedness strategies. The vulnerable rural families now have the means to estimate their own vulnerability and can use the information available at ICT enabled RKCs to make more informed decisions, which offers a sounder basis for designing drought preparedness and adaptation strategies...|$|E
40|$|Volcanic eruptions pose a {{significant}} risk to human lives, property and infrastructure, despite rapid advances in monitoring and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> science and technology. Some elements of risk — like {{the number of}} people living close to volcanoes — are increasing, and the unpredictable nature of eruptions may overwhelm the local response capacity, and turn into a disaster, sometimes requiring international assistance. To deal effectively with these crises, the international humanitarian community needs a global, science-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system that should assimilate the state-of-the-art monitoring and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>techniques,</b> as well as being able to provide a preliminary impact assessment and issue appropriate and relevant alerts.

It is designed as a 4 -level system, incorporating the latest monitoring and hazard modelling techniques that are applicable on a global scale. Alerts are mainly based on the predicted humanitarian impact of the modelled hazards. Systematic handling of volcanic manifestations such as thermal signals and ash clouds from space-borne instruments make it possible to create such a system.

40|$|Volcano {{monitoring}} aims at {{the recognition}} of changes in instrumentally observable parameters before hazardous activity in order to alert governmental authorities. Among these parameters seismic data in general and volcanic tremor in particular play a key role. Recent major explosive eruptions such as Okmok (Aleutians) and Chaitén (Chile) in 2008 and numerous smaller events at Mt Etna (Italy), {{have shown that the}} period of premonitory seismic activity can be short (only a few hours), which entails the necessity of effective automatic data processing near on-line. Here we present a synoptic pattern classification analysis based on Self Organizing Maps and Fuzzy Cluster Analysis which is applied to volcanic tremor data recorded during a series of paroxysmal eruptive episodes and a flank eruption at Etna in 2007 – 2008. In total, eight episodes were analyzed; in six of these significant changes in the dynamic regime of the volcano were detected up to 9 h prior to the onset of eruptive activity, and long before changes in volcanic tremor amplitude and spectral content became evident in classical analysis. In two cases, the state transition was b 1 h before the onset of eruptive activity, which we interpret as evidence for very rapid magma ascent through an open conduit. We further detected twenty failed paroxysms, that is episodes of volcanic unrest that did not culminate in eruptive activity, between March and April 2007. As the application of the software for this synoptic pattern classification is straightforward and requires only moderate computational resources, it was possible to exploit it in an on-line application, which was tested and now is in use at the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia in Catania for the monitoring of Etna. We believe that the pattern classification presented here may become a powerful addition to the repertoire of volcano monitoring tools and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>techniques</b> worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Oil {{industry}} is facing with challenging gas hydrates and flow assurance issues in deepwater developments. The {{situation is not}} any better for Brown fields {{as a result of}} increasing water cut. The other factor which is playing an increasing role is product quality and environmental concerns, demanding reduction in chemical usage. The current industry practice for hydrate prevention is injecting hydrate inhibitors at the upstream end of pipelines based on the calculated or measured hydrate phase boundary, water cut, worst pressure and temperature conditions, and the amount of inhibitor lost to non-aqueous phases. In general, systematic ways of controlling and monitoring along the pipeline and/or downstream to examine the degree of inhibition are very limited. Monitoring changes in the pipeline pressure drop is inadequate to provide reliable indicator for hydrate formation and deposition. Therefore, <b>early</b> hydrate <b>warning</b> and online hydrate monitoring techniques are demanded to optimise inhibitor dosage, reduce the risk of gas hydrate formation/deposition and the cost of mitigating the blockage in subsea pipelines. The primary part of this thesis is to develop a new approach for <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system and monitoring against initial hydrate formation. It is known that the formation of hydrates changes the water structure, which is claimed to remain in the aqueous phase {{for a period of time}} even after the dissociation of gas hydrates. This change of water structure is hypothesized to be in the form of water memory. Therefore, two hydrate <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>techniques</b> are investigated based on the presence of water memory resulted from hydrate formation. The techniques investigated in this thesis are dielectric properties and onset of ice formation. In this thesis, the new approach demonstrate that dielectric properties at microwave frequencies has the potential to be used as a downstream and online analysis for detecting the initial hydrate formation and/or presence of hydrate particles and/or changes in water structure due to hydrate formation. Characteristic of onset of ice formation by freezing method for water samples with and without hydrate water memory shows that samples with water memory nucleate faster than that without water memory. It is concluded that the new approach described above have potential to be developed for <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and online hydrate monitoring. The results are very encouraging and could potentially change the industrial approach to gas hydrate control strategy. Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHIs) have been applied in the field to prevent gas hydrate problems by delaying gas hydrate nucleation and/or growth and to prevent agglomeration of hydrates from growing larger enough to plug the flowline. However, the mechanism of hydrate formation and inhibition is still not well understood. It is believed micro-scale investigation could provide vital clues. The second aim of this thesis is to investigate the inhibition mechanism of Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHIs) by visual observation of gas hydrate formation, growth, and morphology by means of high-pressure glass micromodels, multichanel flow conduits, and glass capillary tubes. Extensive novel data and knowledge was generated from these techniques. The finding of this study shows that various hydrate morphologies formed in the presence of different KHIs for Natural Gas Hydrate and Methane Hydrate. It was concluded that these techniques provides a new data to supplement the lacking of knowledge on the kinetics of gas hydrate inhibition and morphologies...|$|R

Their technology started to be developed during the Second World War for <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> radar <b>techniques</b> to identify threats from the skies. Those capable antennas have been deployed over the years in a number of diversified fields to address different applications needs. First employed almost exclusively in the defense and space domains, nowadays the increased need for broadband connectivity in personal communications is leveraging their diffusion to the field of smart antennas for modern wireless communications. This thesis deals with a special way to fully exploit and further enhance the high flexibility of those complex yet very powerful type of antennas, mainly in terms of speed, compactness and cost. A number of fields have benefited the extremely low loss and broad bandwidth of optical communication technology. Especially interesting to us are the capabilities and extended possibilities brought to the world of microwave and antenna engineering by the use of optics and, specifically, of integrated photonics. This field is known as integrated microwave photonics. The huge bandwidth and extreme low loss of optical fibers can be harnessed to implement very capable signal processing circuits for high-frequency electrical signals. In particular, very broadband and continuosly tunable time delay units can be realized optically; those are of fundamental interest in a number of signal processing functionalities.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{feasibility}} of an earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> sys-tem for Taipei, two prototype seismic <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems have been implemented in Hualien, about 120 km away. The Taiwan Rapid Earth-quake Information Release (TREIRS) can routinely determine earthquake location and magnitude in about one minute after the earthquake occurred. However, this reporting time is too long for earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> pur-poses. A dense, real-time monitoring system composed of 8 strong-motion stations was installed in Hualien area for testing earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> capability. For the 27 earthquakes occurred during August 1998 to April 1999, this system has successfully reported earthquake information in about 18 sec after the origin time. Therefore, it provided about 15 sec of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> time before shear waves arrival in the Taipei urban area. Based on our experience of these two systems, we are encouraged to proceed for-ward {{in the development of}} an earthquake <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-exhausting overview of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems for emerging foodborne hazards that are {{operating in the}} various places in the world. Special attention is given to endpoint-focussed <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems (i. e. ECDC, ISIS and GPHIN) and hazard-focussed <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems (i. e. FVO, RASFF and OIE) and their merit to successfully identify a food safety problem in an early stage is discussed. Besides these <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems {{which are based on}} monitoring of either disease symptoms or hazards, also <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems and/or activities that intend to predict the occurrence of a food safety hazard in its very beginning of development or before that are described. Examples are trend analysis, horizon scanning, <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems for mycotoxins in maize and/or wheat and information exchange networks (e. g. OIE and GIEWS). Furthermore, recent initiatives that aim to develop predictive <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems based on the holistic principle are discussed. The assumption of the researchers applying this principle is that developments outside the food production chain that are either directly or indirectly related {{to the development of a}} particular food safety hazard may also provide valuable information to predict the development of this hazard...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines ethnographic, interview, and {{documentary data}} gathered in Ethiopia to analyze famine <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems - large-scale information systems bringing together climate, food production, market, {{and public health}} data, which have become a major focus in international famine prevention efforts since the 1970 s. Famine <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> {{is part of a}} top-down international response that even many <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> experts themselves feel has been unable to solve the problems leading to famine. In Ethiopia, several different international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations with different agendas have developed their own <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems. The information upon which humanitarian agencies act is a product of this complex political environment as well as particular understandings of famine that become fixed in the systems through the choice of indicators and analytic methods. The efforts of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> practitioners and humanitarian agencies to separate technical aspects of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> from their politics enables responses to famine that inevitably fail {{to address the needs of}} famine-affected people. Though the goal of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> is to save lives by providing timely and accurate information, <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> experts have come to value objectivity, consensus, and transparency over accuracy because of constraints and pressures in their organizational environment. This, combined with donor governments' need for information they feel is credible, privileges certain kinds of expertise (that of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> experts) over others (e. g. that of famine-affected people). Therefore, those officially responding to famine see those with the most direct experience of famine as lacking relevant knowledge and thus only capable of participating as passive aid recipients. The needs of famine-affected people can be better addressed by taking their experiences of and responses to famine into account and transforming the endeavors of famine <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and response accordingl...|$|R
40|$|Effective drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> {{systems are}} an {{integral}} part of efforts worldwide to improve drought preparedness. Timely and reliable data and information must be the cornerstone of effective drought policies and plans. In pursuit of the goal of improving the effectiveness of drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems, participants of the experts meeting were asked to address three fundamental questions: 1. What is your assessment of the current status of drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems? 2. What are the shortcomings, limitations, and needs for drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems? 3. How can drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems be improved to better support drought preparedness and mitigation efforts at the local, national, and international level? Participants identified the primary users of data and information derived from drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems as a first step in evaluating the status of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems. Users were diverse, including government agencies, farmers, extension services, insurance companies, media, donors, NGOs, and the general public. Leadership for drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems is provided principally by meteorological or agricultural services. In general, where meteorological services were the lead agency, the information tended to be more meteorologically based. In contrast, leadership for drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems that were more agriculturally based tended to take a more multidisciplinary or integrated approach to monitoring. An integrated approach is considered preferable because information from all elements of the hydrologic system must be considered to obtain a comprehensive assessment of climate and water supply conditions. Although forecasting and monitoring are considered critical components of all <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems, there appeared to be little evidence of the beneficial use of that information by farmers. It was noted that few countries currently have a national drought policy in place. Australia is an exception and progress in South Africa and the United States was noted. It was apparent that other countries were moving in the direction of a national drought policy. In some instances, subnational policies were in existence. Comprehensive <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems should be the foundation on which national drought policies and plans are constructed. Although many countries have some type of drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system in place, these systems are not comprehensive and have very limited financial and human resource inputs...|$|R
