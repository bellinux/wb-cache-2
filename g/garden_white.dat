There are the dancing-girls of Samaris who {{dance in the}} manner of all kinds of birds and beasts. Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper bells. They laugh while they dance, and their {{laughter}} is as clear as the laughter of water. Come with me and I will show them to thee. For what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin? Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater? Is there poison in that which is sweet to drink? Trouble not thyself, but come with me to another city. There is a little city hard by {{in which there is a}} garden of tulip-trees. And there dwell in this comely <b>garden</b> <b>white</b> peacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts. Their tails when they spread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks. And she who feeds them dances for their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on her hands and at other times she dances with her feet. Her eyes are coloured with stibium, and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a swallow. From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is carved out of a pearl. She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings that are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver. And so trouble not thyself any more, but come with me to this city.' ...|$|E

5000|$|When the {{building}} itself had been constructed, Morris set about decorating the interior, however specifically chose to design and create almost everything himself. Only a few exceptions to this were pre-bought as ready-made items, namely the Persian carpets, and blue china or delft. Morris took his painted settle from the Red Lion Square flat and had it transported in pieces to Red House, where it was reassembled in the drawing room. Many other items of furniture were specially designed by Webb, including the oak dining table, other tables, chairs, cupboards, copper candlesticks, fire dogs, and glass tableware. The plastered walls and ceilings were given simple designs in tempera, although more complex designs were planned for the hall and main living rooms. Stained glass windows were installed in the house, with designs created by Burne-Jones and Webb. In reference to the route taken by Medieval pilgrims headed to Canterbury, Morris termed the passage which connects the main hallway to the house's rear entrance, [...] "The Pilgrim's Rest". The garden was similarly unique in its design, with Morris insisting on integration of {{the design of the}} house and garden; the latter was divided into four, small square gardens by trellises on which roses grew. The flower beds were bordered with lavender and rosemary while lilies and sunflowers had also been planted in the <b>garden.</b> <b>White</b> jasmine, roses, honeysuckle and passion flower were planted to climb up the walls of the house.|$|E

A pink blur! That’s a rose <b>garden!</b> <b>White</b> blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty {{miles an hour and}} they jailed him for two days. Isn’t that funny, and sad, too? … Have you seen the two hundred-foot-long bill -boards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last”.|$|E
