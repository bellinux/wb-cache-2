5|$|The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> had between 350,000 and 500,000 {{soldiers}} in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight Republican Guard divisions. Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment; for example, {{most of the}} estimated 1,000 T-72 tanks in the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> {{on the eve of}} the war were in Republican Guard divisions. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the Republican Guard.|$|E

5|$|In early June, insurgents began {{advancing}} {{into the}} central and northern parts of Iraq. On 10 June, Mosul fell to ISIL, a devastating defeat given that there were 30,000 Iraqi troops in the city facing approximately 1,500 ISIL fighters. Most of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> soldiers refused to fight and fled.|$|E

5|$|On 3 July, an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> {{spokesman}} {{claimed the}} military had regained control {{of the town of}} Al-Awja, Saddam Hussein's birthplace, near Tikrit. However, later in the day, two battlefield commanders contradicted him and stated fighting was still continuing on the town's perimeter and in Al-Awja itself.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> invaded and {{occupied}} the neighboring state of Kuwait. The invasion, which followed the inconclusive Iran–Iraq War and {{three decades of}} political conflict with Kuwait, offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait's oil resources to Iraq's own, a boon {{in a time of}} declining petroleum prices.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1933, {{more than}} 600 Assyrians, led by Malik Yaqu, {{crossed the border}} into Syria in hope of {{receiving}} asylum from the French Mandate of Syria. They were, however, disarmed and refused asylum, and were subsequently given light arms and sent back to Iraq on 4 August. They then decided to surrender themselves to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army.</b> While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun, a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> brigade. Despite the advantage of heavy artillery, the Iraqis were driven back to their military base in Dirabun. The Assyrians, convinced that the army had targeted them deliberately, attacked an army barracks with little success. They were driven back to Syria upon the arrival of Iraqi aeroplanes. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> lost 33 soldiers during the fighting while the Assyrian irregulars took fewer casualties. Historians do not agree on who started the clashes at the border. The British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Stafford, wrote that the Assyrians {{had no intention of}} clashing with the Iraqis, while the Iraqi historian Khaldun Husry (son of the prominent Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri) claims that it was Yaqu's men who provoked the army at Dirabun. Husry supported the propaganda rumours, which circulated in the Iraqi nationalist newspapers, of the Assyrians mutilating the bodies of the killed Iraqi soldiers. This further enraged the Iraqi public against the Assyrians.|$|E

5|$|On 27 January 1991, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met in Basra {{with the}} two <b>Iraqi</b> <b>army</b> corps commanders who would lead the operation, and Major General Salah Mahmoud told him that Khafji would be his by 30 January. During his return trip to Baghdad, Saddam Hussein's convoy was {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft; the Iraqi leader escaped unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Stafford blames Arab nationalists, most {{prominently}} Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and Bakr Sidqi. According to him, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> officers despised the Assyrians, and Sidqi {{in particular was}} vocal of his hate for them. This view was also shared by British officials who recommended to Faysal not {{to send him to}} the north during the crisis.|$|E
5|$|The next day, troops {{pulled back}} away from Tikrit to {{the nearby town of}} Dijla, south of the city, in an attempt to regroup after meeting stiff resistance. Fighting also {{continued}} near the university and around the air base, which had reportedly come under army control. During the day's battles, another <b>Iraqi</b> <b>army</b> helicopter was shot down over the city and crashed near a market, while the army sent tanks to join the fighting at the university. An <b>Iraqi</b> <b>army</b> spokesman claimed 70militants had been killed in Tikrit in the previous 24 hours and that the government forces were in control of the university. Neither of the claims were independently confirmed. Later, fierce clashes were reported in an area about 20 kilometers from the city center, toward Samarra. Militants reportedly made an advance but were stopped about 10 kilometers south of Tikrit. That same day, ISIL declared itself a worldwide caliphate.|$|E

50|$|According to Iraqi sources, {{as well as}} to the London-based pro-Saudi Asharq Al-Awsat, the {{different}} militias rely on their own chain of command, and rarely work together or follow regular <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army's</b> orders.|$|R
5|$|U.S. Marine Corps {{reconnaissance}} {{estimated that}} the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, {{in as many as}} 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.|$|E
5|$|Armored and {{mechanized}} divisions normally {{made use}} of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa. Given {{the size of the}} forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army.</b> On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{disbanding}} of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army,</b> insurgent activity increased, {{especially in}} Fallujah. Initially, armed resistance groups could {{be characterized as}} either Sunni nationalists who wanted {{to bring back the}} Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E

5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} {{knew that}} the Israeli army would sooner or later be stronger than his {{and that he had}} to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>army,</b> at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2006, Monsoor's platoon engaged four {{insurgents in}} a firefight, killing one and {{injuring}} another. Anticipating further attacks, Monsoor, three SEAL snipers and three <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> soldiers {{took up a}} rooftop position. Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off the streets, and a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people {{to fight against the}} Americans and the Iraqi soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E
5|$|The brigade again {{deployed}} to Iraq for the OIF 07-09 rotation. This time, the brigade was headquartered in Balad, Iraq. The brigade was given Husky Mine Detection vehicles and Buffalo mine protected carrier vehicles for the deployment. The brigade {{was responsible for}} providing combat, geospatial and general engineering and reconstruction operations in partnership with Provincial Reconstruction Teams, Civil Service Corps, Sons of Iraq and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> engineers, as well as training and assisting the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army</b> and provincial engineers in the rebuilding of the infrastructure of Iraq. As of May 2008, the brigade had constructed 10 major bridges and destroyed or captured IED cells in nine of the country's provinces. During the deployment it was visited by Lieutenant General Lloyd J. Austin III, the commanding general of Multi-National Corps Iraq. The brigade was scheduled to return to Fort Bragg {{in the fall of}} 2008, to be replaced by the 555th Engineer Brigade. This was completed during a transfer of authority ceremony on 29 September 2008. The brigade then began redeploying to Fort Bragg, completing its return by November 2008. A year later, in August 2009, the brigade held a ceremony promoting dozens of its soldiers to the rank of Sergeant.|$|E
50|$|Because Turkey {{refused to}} allow the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division to enter {{northern}} Iraq, the SAD and Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Pershmerga were the entire northern invasion force against Saddam. Still, their efforts kept the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army's</b> 5th Corps from moving to contest the invasion's main force to the southeast.|$|R
50|$|Nasiriyah was the {{headquarters}} of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Army's</b> 3d Corps, composed of the 11th ID, 51st Mech ID, and 6th Armored Division - all at around 50 percent strength.
