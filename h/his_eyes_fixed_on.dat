25|$|A {{photograph}} was taken of Richmond captain-coach Dyer, aged 30 and playing his {{two hundred and}} twenty second game, wearing white strapping on his left thumb, and a dirty knee bandage on his left knee, breaking away from the pack, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the Lake end goals (Dyer went on to kick a goal), {{in the last quarter}} of the 1944 Preliminary Final, held at the Junction Oval, on Saturday 23 September 1944, in which Richmond defeated Essendon, primarily due to Dyer's nine goals.|$|E
2500|$|Recitative and prologue. Hamlet asks Ophélie if he may sit at {{her feet}} (Hamlet: Belle, permettez-nous [...] "Lady, permit me"). She {{responds}} that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a saxophone solo. (According to Annegret Fauser {{this is the first}} instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.) In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez pâlir, dites-le moi! [...] "Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!").|$|E
2500|$|Notorious for {{his defense}} against the pirates, Mangkaw was a known net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses {{clustered}} close to shore around the watchtower. Being {{an expert in the}} art of casting the net, Laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a shoal of fish would be seen by the subtle wave of the surface or quick shifting shadow beneath the surface. The eyes of the pondering datu kept stalking it, interfering with the meeting. Satisfying his unequalled fisherman's instinct, he would leave the meeting unattended and his body language was being watched by the attendees, feasting their eyes on the artful slide of the feet of the datu so as not to disturb the surface, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the school. Then, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of [...] "Sogod, sogod!" [...] (vernacular for [...] "to begin") would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word [...] "Sogod" [...] became the name of the village then and the town as it is today.|$|E
60|$|The {{moment the}} {{landlord}} {{came out and}} saw who it was, <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the cocked hat, and he turned as pale as ashes.|$|R
60|$|Richard kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the Scot's face, beheld and beholding, smiling {{inwardly}} at {{the relief}} {{produced by the}} turn he had given to his general accusation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Macassar merely sighed gently--perhaps {{he had no}} fitting answer; {{perhaps his}} heart was too full for him to answer. He sat with <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hat, which still dangled in his hand; but <b>his</b> mind's <b>eye</b> was far away.|$|R
60|$|The cashier, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the door, {{does not}} answer.|$|E
60|$|Poirot puffed at {{his tiny}} cigarette, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Mool {{answered}} this, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> her {{in grave}} scrutiny.|$|E
60|$|Thereon he scooted with a subdued grin {{round the}} other side of the bush, whence as I knew well he kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> me to be sure that I made no further attempt to take off the Great Medicine.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the man who}} {{had entered}} the shop in company with the goldsmith--a tall figure, about fifty, with a short trimmed beard, wearing an old felt hat and a threadbare mantle--had kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the Greek, and now said abruptly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Roy said; [...] "and some of {{you will}} {{soon be able to}} handle arms in earnest. Who are your leaders?" [...] he asked sharply, as <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> Archie, who had seated himself {{carelessly}} upon a rock at some little distance.|$|R
60|$|Still Gordon was silent, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> her {{expressive}} {{and charming}} face.|$|E
60|$|The captain assented, {{and with}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the mantelpiece smoked in silence.|$|E
60|$|Matteo and I {{looked at}} one another. Checco kept <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the Count.|$|E
60|$|This was too horrid; Father John got up {{and held}} his hand before the father's face, as if to forbid him to finish the curse which {{he was about to}} utter; and the old man trembled like a frightened child upon his seat, and sat silent with <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the priest.|$|R
60|$|He made no reply. <b>His</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>fixed</b> intently <b>on</b> the sea astern, {{suddenly}} flashed.|$|R
60|$|He spoke very simply, as if {{he could}} not help it, with <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the clear eastern sky, and with a tone of grave awe and thankfulness which greatly struck Mr. Ashford, from the {{complete}} absence of self-consciousness, or from any attempt either to magnify or depreciate his sense of the danger.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} curiously and kept <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> me while he {{answered}} my question.|$|E
60|$|Sir James spoke {{slowly and}} low, as if reflectively, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|E
60|$|The priest paused; but Thady sat quite still, listening, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the fender.|$|E
6000|$|As to the carpenters, {{they are}} {{absolutely}} maddening. They are always at work, yet {{never seem to}} do anything. Lillie was down on Friday, and said (<b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> Maidstone, and rubbing his hand to conciliate his moody employer) that [...] "he didn't {{think there would be}} very much left to do after Saturday, the 29th." ...|$|R
60|$|She, seeing <b>his</b> dark <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> her, {{broke off}} from her drying with a laugh.|$|R
60|$|She {{glanced at}} Eliphalet, {{to find that}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the {{approaching}} couple.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grummit, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the other's, backed {{a couple}} of yards and breathed heavily.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few seconds}} Amalatok stood silent; <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the ground {{as if he were}} puzzled.|$|E
60|$|Essper was silent, {{and stood}} with his hands crossed on his breast, and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|E
60|$|At this point, Sam Weller, {{who had had}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> {{hitherto}} <b>on</b> Mr. Namby's shining beaver, interfered.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{moved away}} and Mr. Oliver {{leaned against a}} {{neighboring}} stump with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> thoughtfully <b>on</b> Frank.|$|R
60|$|On {{entering}} his brother's room, he found him raised on one elbow, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> wildly <b>on</b> the door.|$|R
60|$|Horace Pendyce {{subsided}} on {{his pillow}} with a bounce, and he too lay with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was {{watching}} the local doctor narrowly. He still kept <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> him as he spoke.|$|E
60|$|It {{made him}} giddy even to keep <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the {{narrowing}} path before him, and shuffle up, up, up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not, {{most high}} Lord," [...] replied the astrologer, trying to bow with <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> Merytra, who stood by him, the torn wig in her hand, {{in the act}} of striking. [...] "Certainly not, exalted Prince. A {{domestic}} difference, that is all. This wild cat of a woman whom I have married having met with an accident, gave way to her devilish temper." ...|$|R
60|$|Here the {{chairman}} {{glanced at his}} wife, but she was absorbed in watching Mrs. Duncombe's restless hands; and the look was intercepted by Lady Tyrrell's eyes, which flashed back sympathetic amusement, with just such a glance as used to pass between them in old times; but the effect {{was to make the}} Member's face grave and impassive, and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fix</b> <b>on</b> the papers before him.|$|R
60|$|York, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> still <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the old man, {{withdrew the}} hand {{with which he}} had taken his.|$|R
