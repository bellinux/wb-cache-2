40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: This survey aims to {{describe}} and analyse the <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens</b> of antibiotics in French neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). METHODS: Senior doctors from 56 French NICUs were contacted by telephone and/or email to provide their local guidelines for antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: 44 (79 %) NICUs {{agreed to participate in}} this survey. In total, 444 <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens</b> were identified in French NICUs for 41 antibiotics. The number of different <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens</b> varied from 1 to 32 per drug (mean 9, SD 7. 8). 37 % of intravenous <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens</b> used a unique mg/kg dose from preterm to full-term neonates. Doses and/or dosing intervals varied significantly for 12 antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, tobramycin, vancomycin administered as continuous infusion, ceftazidime, cloxacillin, oxacillin, penicillin G, imipenem/cilastatin, clindamycin and metronidazole). Among these antibiotics, 6 were used in more than 70 % of local guidelines and had significant variations in (1) maintenance daily doses for amikacin, imipenem/cilastatin, ceftazidime and metronidazole; (2) loading doses for continuous infusion of vancomycin; and (3) dosing intervals for gentamicin and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable inter-centre variability of <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens</b> of antibiotics exists in French NICUs.

40|$|BACKGROUND Vancomycin is a {{glycopeptide}} antibiotic used in {{the treatment}} of severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. To lower the risk of antibiotic resistance, minimize toxic drug effects and to improve clinical effectiveness, it is recommended to monitor trough levels of vancomycin, with the desired range between 10 – 20 mg/l (15 – 20 mg/l for complicated infections). MATERIALS AND METHODS In the University Medical Center Maribor a new method for monitoring of vancomycin treatment has been accepted. Medical staff can adjust vancomycin <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> using the pharmacokinetic program KINETIDEX ®. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the usability of this program on a population of 28 patients treated with vancomycin in our hospital. After administration of the initial <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> and measuring vancomycin trough level we – when necessary – suggested a new <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> using KINETIDEX®. RESULTS The most common initial <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> (23 out of 28 patients) was 1 g/ 12 h. Nine patients had an impaired renal function before vancomycin treatment, but only 4 of them received an adjusted initial dosage. In 9 patients a serum sample for determining trough concentration was obtained too early, when steady-state conditions had not been reached yet. Twenty out of 28 patients required adjustment of the initial vancomycin <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> – 11 of them needed an increased daily dosage and 9 of them a lower daily dosage. In our research 23 patients out of 28 achieved the desired trough concentrations. In 14 out of 15 patients KINETIDEX® was able to predict a <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> that resulted in the desired trough levels. One patient developed acute kidney failure after initiating vancomycin therapy. CONCLUSIONS Initial <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> of vancomycin should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance − in clinical practice this is not always the case. Three-thirds of patients need modification of the initial vancomycin regimen. Clinical pharmacist can adjust dosage by using pharmacokinetic program KINETIDEX®. For effective dose adjustment of vancomycin, a serum sample should be obtained at appropriate time – just before the application of the next dose at steadystate conditions...|$|E

40|$|Measurement {{of quality}} of life (QOL) as an {{indicator}} of health outcome has become increasingly important in patients with coronary artery disease.

A once daily <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> of isosorbide mononitrate might provide better QOL than conventional multiple daily <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen.</b> To assess this, we performed two studies in patients with angina pectoris. We conclude that replacement of a multiple daily <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> with a once daily <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> results in an improved QOL, anginal NYHA class and exercise capacity. We also conclude that patients with certain cardiac risk factors and co-morbidities might particularly benefit. In a separate chapter we study the influence of pschychological factors on QOL in patients with heart failure and in patients on the waiting list for coronary angiography. Finale we discuss a study concerning early discharge in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with primary PCI. We conclude that hospital discharge on the day after admission in combination with a rehabilitation program is feasible and offers a safe and patient-friendly alternative to the usual 3 to 4 days of in hospital care, without negative effect on QOL or secondary prevention goals.

30|$|Whether lithium <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens,</b> i.e., once-daily vs. divided dose, {{correlate}} with polyuria risk is still debated (Gitlin 1999; Carter et al. 2013).

We assessed patient {{misunderstanding of}} <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> instructions among outpatients in Shambu Primary Hospital. Methods and materials: A facility based cross sectional study was conducted from February 10 to 30, 2013 at Shambu primary hospital, Southwest Ethiopia. Study subjects were selected by random sampling technique and were interviewed face to face at exit site of the outpatient pharmacy using semi structured questionnaire translated into local languages. Direct observations of the medication label were also done to evaluate the drug labeling practices of dispensing pharmacy professionals. Descriptive {{analysis was used to}} describe the percentages and number distributions of variables. Chi square test was used to assess association of variables with primary outcome with a significance level (α) of 0. 05. Results: A total of 400 patients were included in the study and 52. 3 % were female in gender. Around 37 % of respondents were found to be in the age range of 25 to 34 years. Present study revealed that 293 (73. 3 %) of the study participants misunderstood one or more <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> instructions, and 264 (66 %) of the subjects had also misunderstood the frequency of drug administration.

40|$|Treatment of bipolar {{disorder}} with lithium therapy during pregnancy {{is a medical}} challenge.

40|$|Optimal {{drug therapy}} {{can only be}} {{achieved}} if a drug is given in the right <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen.</b> Therefore the <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> needs to be optimized, using the available information of the drug, the patient, and his disease. The optimization of drug therapy comprises two major steps: First, the clinician should define explicit therapeutic goals for each patient individually. Second, a strategy to achieve these goals with the greatest possible precision should be chosen. An overview of the optimization of drug therapy is presented, with special reference to maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) Bayesian fitting. Drug dosage optimization requires 1. measurement of a performance index related to the therapeutic goal, generally one or more plasma concentration measurements, 2. population pharmacokinetic parameters, including mean values, standard deviations, covariances and information on the statistical distribution, and 3. reliable software for adaptive control strategy and optimal <b>dosage</b> <b>regimen</b> calculation. The benefit of optimal drug therapy by adaptive control using MAP Bayesian fitting has been proven, resulting in improved patient outcome by improved efficacy of therapy and a reduction of adverse reactions, and in reduced costs, mainly due to a reduction of hospitalization.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the plasma disposition and tissue distribution of amiodarone and its proximate metabolite, desethylamiodarone, for a single oral dose and short-term oral <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens</b> was conducted in the dog. Four groups of male mongrel dogs (six per group) received {{one of the following}} oral dosage regimens: single dose of 40 mg amiodarone/kg; 40 mg amiodarone/kg/day for 10 days and then 30 mg/kg/day for 4 days; 40 mg amiodarone/kg/day for 10 days, 30 mg/kg/day for 4 days, and then no treatment for 14 days; and 40 mg amiodarone/kg/day for 10 days, 30 mg/kg/day for 4 days, and then 20 mg/kg/day for 5 days/week for 2 weeks. The plasma and tissue amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentra-tions were determined by HPLC. The plasma concentration of amio-darone was greater than that of desethylamiodarone for the four <b>dosage</b> <b>regimens.</b> The apparent plasma elimination half-life of amio-darone was prolonged following repeated drug administration (3. ...|$|R
