2500|$|Taishi Ci died in 206 {{at the age}} of 41 (by East Asian age reckoning). Before his death, <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> and said, [...] "A man {{living in}} this world should aspire to carry a seven chi-long sword and rise to the {{position}} of a Son of Heaven. Now, I have yet to realise my ambition. How unfortunate that I am going to die soon!" [...] Sun Quan deeply mourned Taishi Ci's death.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, when Liu Zan went to battle, {{he always}} {{assembled}} his troops first {{and made them}} sing and roar to boost their morale. He never lost any of the battles he fought in, until his last one. Before his death, <b>he</b> <b>sighed,</b> [...] "I have always fought battles in the same way. Today, because of my illness, I end up in this situation. Such is my destiny!" [...] He was 73 {{years old at the}} time of his death (by East Asian age reckoning). Jiang Ban ordered his head to be cut off and put on display, and confiscated his military seal. Many people lamented his death.|$|E
2500|$|Marlowe is {{adept at}} using liquor to loosen peoples' tongues. An example is in The High Window, when Marlowe finally persuades the detective-lieutenant, whose [...] "solid old face was lined and grey with fatigue", {{to take a}} drink and thereby loosen up and give out. [...] "Breeze looked at me very steadily. Then <b>he</b> <b>sighed.</b> Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again {{and shook his head}} {{sideways}} with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world." ...|$|E

6000|$|Restless, sleepless {{fled the}} night, Sleepless as a sick man's bed, When <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> for morning light, When {{he turns his}} aching head,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... (2.) Death {{is at his}} work, {{cutting of}} him down, hewing both bark and heart, both body and soul asunder. The man groans, but death hears him not; he looks ghastly, carefully, dejectedly; <b>he</b> <b>sighs,</b> <b>he</b> sweats, he trembles, but death matters nothing.|$|R
2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. <b>He</b> <b>sighed,</b> [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When do you think he will leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Wuzong rewarded Li Deyu {{with great}} honors {{in light of}} the victory over Liu Zhen, {{including}} the title of the Duke of Zhao. However, at the same time, Li Deyu was drawing resentment over his domination of the court scene—and was particularly despised in his having Emperor Wuzong issue a posthumous edict condemning the relatives of Wang Yai, Jia Su, and Li Xun, who had fled to Zhaoyi and been protected by Liu Congjian but whom Guo slaughtered after killing Liu Zhen. Further, still resenting Niu and Li Zongmin, Li Deyu accused [...] them of having corroborated with Liu Congjian and Liu Zhen, despite the lack of any evidence. Li Deyu went as far as inducing Liu Zhen's secretary Zheng Qing (鄭慶) into making the statement that whenever Liu Congjian received letters from Niu and Li Zongmin, he would read them and then burn them. Further, he had Lü Shu (呂述) the vice mayor of Luoyang, where Niu was at the time, make the accusation that when Niu heard of Liu Zhen's defeat, <b>he</b> <b>sighed.</b> Li Deyu relayed these accusations to Emperor Wuzong, and, in anger, he exiled both Niu and Li Zongmin. Further, in 845, Li Deyu had Li Shen, who was then the military governor of Huainan, falsely accused the county magistrate Wu Xiang (吳湘)—the nephew of an official that Li Deyu had deeply resented, Wu Wuling (吳武陵)—of forcibly marrying a commoner's daughter. Despite objections by many officials, under Li Deyu's advocacy, Emperor Wuzong ordered Wu Xiang's execution without further review.|$|E

6000|$|But {{he never}} heard me. He had forgot me and {{everything}} else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> {{and shakes his}} head; then sighs again, and says: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sighed</b> from an emotion, partly natural, perhaps, {{and partly}} assumed.|$|E

6000|$|... [But {{she drops}} the book, and MAGGIE fades from the room. It {{is not a}} very clever departure, and the old diplomatist smiles. Then <b>he</b> <b>sighs</b> a {{beautiful}} <b>sigh,</b> for <b>he</b> does all things beautifully.] ...|$|R

6000|$|At length, {{from years}} of anxious toil, Bold Robin seeks his native soil; Wisely {{arranges}} his affairs, And to his native dale repairs.

60|$|Endymion was {{standing}} before the fire, and as nervous as a man could well be. <b>He</b> <b>sighed,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>sighed</b> more than once.
