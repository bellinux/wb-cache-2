50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To disengage the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the <b>engaged</b> <b>position.</b> Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to disengage the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes to disengage the safety.|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights {{in the body of the}} drive unit. When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the <b>engaged</b> <b>position.</b> Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|E
5000|$|The suicide clutch is {{sometimes}} incorrectly called a suicide shifter. The suicide clutch is a foot-operated clutch that {{is mounted on}} the left side of the motorcycle's forward foot controls. The suicide-clutch moniker has derived from difficulties in operating this form of clutch and shifter. On a motorcycle equipped with a conventional hand clutch and foot shifter, the rider places the left foot on the ground when stopped and holds the motorcycle in place with pressure on the rear brake pedal with the right foot, while engaging the clutch with the left hand. On a motorcycle equipped with a suicide clutch, the clutch is held in with the left foot, requiring the right foot to hold the bike in place, with the right hand applying pressure to the front brake. Early Harley Davidson foot clutches used an over-center spring to hold the clutch pedal in the disengaged position and used a friction disc to allow the rider to adjust the sensitivity of the return. Often riders removed the spring to keep the clutch pedal from returning to the disengaged position while riding. While this spring removal allowed for the clutch to stay engaged better, it also removed the safety feature of the clutch pedal holding itself in the disengaged position. With the pedal not returning to its natural disengaged position, the rider must either shift into neutral or hold the clutch pedal with the left foot when coming to a stop. Early Harley Davidson racers removed the clutch return spring to ensure the clutch stayed in the <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> throughout the race. This practice soon caught on with other riders. The term [...] "suicide clutch" [...] was coined by those who could not operate the foot clutch proficiently enough to ride a tank shift (or hand shift) motorcycle in normal traffic.|$|E

40|$|In our {{paper we}} {{address the issue of}} the {{relations}} between knowledge and the sensitive dimension by taking into account and comparing the contribution to the production of a chair deployed by two craftsmen working within the Italian design furniture industry sector. Relying on an ethnographic account of their work, {{we have been able to}} describe in detail the way in which the interaction among the bodies of the two craftsmen and those of the artifacts they contribute to develop takes place and gives way to innovation. By taking into account the role of bodies and the sensitive dimension we outline a contribution to Actor-Network Theory and its theory of knowledge. Indeed, in this article we propose a model of working knowledge in order to account for corporal interaction on the workplace. In our model there are two axes to describe the interactions among bodies. In the first one interaction moves from detail to the whole. In the second, interaction moves from an <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> to a disengaged one. In so doing, we are able to draw a space of corporal knowledge.

The We/l af Saint Clare is not a homogeneous book, it can be devided into two parts, where the first part deals with the impressive themes that are remarked by the parnasist beginnings of Anatole France (his pure aesthetical attitude towards writing is at variance with the attitude of Elin Pelin).

40|$|Literary {{journalism is}} a {{particular}} exercise in subjectivity. The journalist/narrator aims at a more subtle and subjective presentation of characters and their actions, which necessitates in return the bringing in {{of his or her}} own subjectivity into the story (Alexander 2009). This issue is of particular importance in the reflection upon the old and respectable genre of literary travel writing. The tension between the role of the conventional detached journalist - often compared to an ignorant tourist - and the more <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> that travel writers aim at, assumes a special and even paradoxical character when a journalist actually takes to the road and becomes a tourist. How do travelling journalists bring in their own subjectivity in their work, and how do they interact with the characters in their story – without losing their credibility? The case that will be presented in this discussion is ‘Travels without John’ (2012) by the Dutch historian & journalist Geert Mak. The book is one of the sequels of Steinbeck’s Travels with Charley in search for America (1962) and the arduous confrontation with this source text is striking. Each in their way, the narrators in these two stories play a great variety of roles that go far beyond the usual work of observation, interview and documentation. An analysis of the complex roles and evolution of the narrator in both stories can reveal much of the dynamism that marks the different plots. The question as to how both authors/narrators interpret the [partial] failure of their adventure may shed some light on the risks and pitfalls of literary journalism projects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates students’ {{perceptions}} towards English {{classes in}} a Mexican public university. I {{argue that the}} lack of engagement {{of a small group of}} students taking part in English classes which are a compulsory component in their tertiary program is not a product of a lack of interest or ability as would normally be argued. This thesis establishes an alternative possibility. Through an interpretive approach to research using several ethnographic techniques and discourse analysis to make sense of the data, the thesis suggests that in order to sustain an <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> as language learners, students and teachers should construct dialogical spaces that could lead to a better understanding of each other and as a result a more conscious position as engaged learners of a foreign language. The data demonstrate that contradictory discourses within the institution’s policies and those from different departments contribute to a disengaged attitude towards learning English where learning a second language competes with other subjects that are considered central for future professional practice within their disciplines of interest. Data also reveal that aside from the marginalized position that English appears to have, there are issues of students’ marginalization at classroom level which could be the result of monologic positions the teachers and students that participated in this study appear to construct. To better sustain an engaged attitude towards the subject, I suggest that safe spaces could become arenas to raise the awareness of what being a language learner takes. I also suggest that many of the practices within a language classroom stem from monologic discourses and might be considered the source of many of the issues raised in this study. This research challenges some views currently held about motivation as these do not fit with understandings emerging from this study. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the Past is a {{doctoral}} project set around {{the making of}} a series of short, drawn films. Five films have been made in this period. Bully Beef (2006), Off the Record (2008), Heir to the Evangelical Revival (2012), Orlandos Book (2012), and Perth+ 6 hrs (2012). There are four simultaneous lines of research in this project. The first is the desire to find an <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> from which to speak about the past. The second is an attempt to characterize the nature of these short animated films. The third is to articulate methodologies and decision-making in this particular artistic practice. The last is to investigate writing {{as an integral part of}} that practice. The first line of research is the one that was set out at the start of the doctoral project. The task I had set myself was to find a more personal and positioned relationship to the contested histories with which I was wanting to engage. My concern was that I was standing outside of the frame and criticizing European colonial and neo-colonial attitudes towards Africa, without questioning or making visible my own position in those histories. I was keenly aware that my own history as a South African of settler origins put me in a rather delicate position as a critic of colonial and neo-colonial attitudes of another country. I felt that this position needed to be examined and that my films needed to engage more rigorously with my personal relationship to and role in these histories. The second line of research relates to genre and characterizing the nature of my work. Much of the search during this period has been directed towards determining what kind of investigation my films are, and what kind of discourse I enter by making the films. The search has been to locate my work with that of other, similar, practitioners, who may or may not be visual artists. I needed to explore what it was that I have been borrowing from particular genres or disciplines, from documentary, history, fiction, visual poem or film essay. The third line of research is about articulating methodologies and decision-making in this particular artistic practice. It is about making tacit knowledge explicit. There are many elements involved in making a drawing, animating a sequence, editing a film, adding sound or exhibiting a film that are seldom articulated. The research has been an attempt to better understand and communicate the complexities of these processes. The fourth line of research has been to investigate writing as an integral part of this artistic practice. The Postings emerge out of experiments with different kinds of writing. Instead of producing a single work as a thesis I chose to structure reflections on my practice and research in the form of 52 letters. The format of these thought-pieces allowed for a piece-by-piece construction, similar to the manner in which I make the drawings that make up the films. The introduction of a process journal early on in the research process encouraged a form of note-making on issues of relevance to the making of the films. Because these writings are based on the process journal and studio experience, they are intimately connected to practice. It took seven years to get writing to a point where it was a part of this practice rather than an explanation of finished work. Writing now runs alongside and intertwines with drawing and the other activities that are part of the process of making a film. It has become an essential component of my practice.

In one case, a Nationalist division led by Dai Bingnan pretended to surrender, but then arrested the Communist officers who entered Dai's camp to accept. Yan Xishan mistakenly believed the leader of the arrested group, Jin Fu, was the high-ranking Communist leader Hu Yaobang (who the Nationalists believed was active in the region). Yen airlifted the captured group to Chiang Kai-shek, who executed them after they failed to produce important information. Dai himself was rewarded with a large amount of gold for his actions, but was not allowed to be airlifted out of Taiyuan. After the city fell he was captured, tried in a well-propagandized show trial and publicly executed.|$|R
