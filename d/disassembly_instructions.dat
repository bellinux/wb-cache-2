5000|$|Under the Purchase Tax {{system of}} the time cars {{supplied}} as a kit (known as [...] "completely knocked down" [...] or CKD) did not attract the tax surcharge that would apply if sold in assembled form. Tax rules specified assembly instructions could not be included, but as the rules said nothing about the inclusion of <b>disassembly</b> <b>instructions,</b> they were included instead and all the enthusiast {{had to do was}} to follow them in reverse. However, once the UK joined the EEC on 1 January 1973, the VAT system was adopted instead so the tax advantage of the kit-built Lotus Seven came to an end.|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{evaluating}} products in their design phase {{has been developed}} for virtual manufacturing. It is integrated into a CAD/CAM environment {{to calculate the cost}} for assembling and disassembling parts. In our earlier work, a generic assembly and disassembly model was developed to represent operations required for product manufacturing and de-manufacturing. To be useful, the model requires a method for translating high-level instructions from product designers into low-level assembly and <b>disassembly</b> <b>instructions.</b> This paper presents a set of rules for accomplishing this task. The developed rules are used for manipulating strings representing parts and handlers in binary assembly and disassembly operations. A telephone assembly and disassembly simulation is used to illustrate the developed syste...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{property of}} dynamically structured code is that relations between elements of executable code are established at run-time. The word "structured " underlines that these relations {{must be in}} some kind regular. What these relations must and/or may be is a subject for studies. We expect {{that the use of}} dynamically structured codes will allow to reduce the complexity of software and thus improve its safety and reduce its cost. The paper discusses dynamically structured codes in general and proposes three new techniques. Two of them are improvements of the method of data execution (data-driven approach) : execution of data with a customized method of execution, and joint compilation of two data sets into a single data set (and execution of the joint data set). The third technique — dynamic construction of call hierarchy (DCCH 1) — may be used when we need to process a set of records having a complex format (examples: loading an object module, <b>disassembly,</b> <b>instruction</b> set emulation). DCCH 1 is a regular way to build for each such record a customized code that will process that record. 1...|$|R
50|$|Disassembly is not {{an exact}} science: on CISC {{platforms}} with variable-width instructions, with opcode-level programming or {{in the presence of}} self-modifying code, it is possible for a single program to have two or more reasonable <b>disassemblies.</b> Determining which <b>instructions</b> would actually be encountered during a run of the program reduces to the halting problem, which is known to be unsolvable.|$|R
3000|$|In {{the above}} code fragments, the {{constant}} 0 × 114 within the indexed instructions is the offset for the num_symtab member. As {{the methods used}} by compilers can be very different, all possible instruction formats for various architectures must be clarified. Code fragment 4 is again from the module_get_kallsym (...) function, and fragments 5 – 8 illustrate the <b>disassembly</b> of the <b>instruction</b> that accesses the strtab and symtab members of the module for different architectures.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue to {{awareness}} of the environmental and economical reasons the objective of modern technology is turning away from deposition and incineration of end-of-life products towards a far reaching product reuse. Disassembly is the main stage in the product end-of-life treatment. As disassembly process is mainly manual in nature, we assume that ergonomic factors are considered to {{have an effect on the}} process. The aims of this study is to investigate the level of involvement of ergonomic aspects in the disassembly workplace with the effect of their absence on the human performance which in turn may reflect on the losses in the disassembly outcomes and modelling an optimum disassembly plan incorporating the ergonomic factors within the model. This model is trying to find a disassembly scheme which maximizes the output revenue of the process via the minimization of the losses caused by the human error without jeopardizing the logic technical sequence. To investigate the human error in the disassembly workplaces and to develop the disassembly cost index score model, a survey was conducted in a variety of commercial electronic and delicate parts disassembly facilities, especially on the personal computers (PCs) disassembly. Based on this survey a multifactor weighted estimation scheme was proposed with the four factors; the need for special hand manoeuvring, visibility of parts, complexity of <b>disassembly</b> task and <b>instruction</b> of <b>disassembly...</b>|$|R
