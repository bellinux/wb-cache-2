5|$|The Ju 87 was a single-engined {{all-metal}} cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage {{and could}} carry a two-person crew. The main construction material was <b>duralumin,</b> and the external coverings {{were made of}} <b>Duralumin</b> sheeting. Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminum alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{based on}} the M-1, the under-surfaces of the wing were covered with <b>duralumin</b> {{and it had a}} wider engine axis and longer engine nacelles. The demand for a reconnaissance aircraft {{based on the}} M-1 {{led to the development of}} the P-1 variant.|$|E
5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less <b>duralumin</b> to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in <b>duralumin,</b> but covered in fabric. The <b>duralumin</b> N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused {{the underside of the}} rear fuselage to deform because the steel and the <b>duralumin</b> skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque <b>duralumin</b> fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
25|$|PZL Ł.2 was a high-wing braced {{parasol wing}} monoplane, {{conventional}} in layout, of all-metal construction. It had a <b>duralumin</b> framed, canvas covered fuselage (engine part {{was covered with}} <b>duralumin).</b> Crew of two was sitting in tandem in open cockpits, with twin controls. The observer had a 7.7mm Lewis machine gun on a ring mounting. The elliptical wing was two-spar, of <b>duralumin</b> construction, canvas-covered, fitted with slats, flaps and flaperons. Wings could be dismounted for transport. The tail was of <b>duralumin</b> construction, canvas covered. It had a conventional fixed landing gear with a rear skid.|$|E
25|$|Kellner-Béchereau E.D.5:Outwardly dentical to the E.C.4 but {{constructed}} of <b>Duralumin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} was mainly <b>duralumin,</b> with the hull covered with sheet metal and the wings with fabric.|$|E
25|$|The Breguet 670's wing had a {{constant}} thickness centre section, with wing roots faired into the fuselage on its trailing edges, and two outer panels, tapering in both thickness {{and plan to}} semi-elliptical tips. It was a two spar structure, with sheet <b>duralumin,</b> I-section spars which had extruded webs, and was <b>duralumin</b> skinned. Narrow chord slotted ailerons occupied the outer two-thirds of the span and the rest fitted with similar flaps.|$|E
25|$|The wings were {{constructed}} using corrugated <b>duralumin</b> box spars and tubular rib assemblies, with a fabric covering and Frise ailerons {{on the upper}} and lower wings. <b>Duralumin</b> walkways were provided to allow ready access to the engines for maintenance purposes. The tail unit consisted of braced monoplane horizontal and vertical stabilizers; the tailplane was fitted with Flettner-type servo tabs for trimming on the Short Scylla which had the same wings and tail as the Kent.|$|E
25|$|The Short S.7 Mussel was a single-engined two-seat {{monoplane}} {{built by}} Short Brothers {{to test the}} performance of their <b>duralumin</b> monocoque floats. Two were built.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic design}} of the Typhoon was a {{combination}} of traditional Hawker construction (such as used in the earlier Hawker Hurricane) and more modern construction techniques; the front fuselage structure, from the engine mountings {{to the rear of the}} cockpit, was made up of bolted and welded <b>duralumin</b> or steel tubes covered with skin panels, while the rear fuselage was a flush-riveted, semi-monocoque structure. The forward fuselage and cockpit skinning was made up of large, removable <b>duralumin</b> panels, allowing easy external access to the engine and engine accessories and most of the important hydraulic and electrical equipment.|$|E
25|$|The TM-22, {{which was}} based on Thomas's {{unsuccessful}} MB-9 fighter and MB-10 training aircraft, which had both flown in 1921 but had been quickly abandoned. It was of all-metal construction, with corrugated <b>duralumin</b> skinning over a <b>duralumin</b> structure, while its wing featured a distinct hump in the centre above the fuselage. The two prototypes had different wings, with the first prototype having a span of 29ft 0in (8.84m) and a wing area of 174sq ft (16.2m²), while the second had a span of 25ft (7.62m) and an area of 150sq dt (13.9m²). It was powered by a single 600hp (447kW) Packard 1A-2025 V12 engine with its radiator and oil tank in a tubular container beneath the fuselage. The aircraft had a fixed conventional landing gear.|$|E
25|$|The <b>duralumin</b> {{framework}} of Hindenburg was salvaged and shipped back to Germany. There the scrap was recycled {{and used in}} the construction of military aircraft for the Luftwaffe, as were the frames of Graf Zeppelin and Graf Zeppelin II when they were scrapped in 1940.|$|E
25|$|New {{materials}} {{which may}} replace steel car bodies include <b>duralumin,</b> fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing {{more and more}} people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.|$|E
25|$|Ki-84-II: Sometimes {{known as}} the 'Hayate-Kai', the Ki-84-II had certain <b>duralumin</b> {{components}} replaced with ones made of wood and plywood, mainly concerning the rear fuselage, tail unit elements, wing tips, push-pull rods and other, minor components. This model was produced with the designations Ko, Otsu and Hei depending on the armament.|$|E
25|$|Enterprise was the {{smallest}} J-Class to be built, her size being an early {{indication of the}} ruthless efficiency that was employed by the renowned naval architect Starling Burgess. The efficiency of design was coupled {{to a number of}} pioneering features such as the Park Avenue Boom, hidden lightweight winches and the world’s first <b>duralumin</b> mast.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the AIR-9 followed Yavovlev's previous designs with wooden plywood and fabric covered wings, welded steel tube fabric-covered fuselage and <b>Duralumin</b> fabric covered tail surfaces. The fixed spatted main undercarriage was supported by struts, later fitted with trousers as well as spats, with a fixed tail-skid or tailwheel (as exhibited at the 1935 Milan airshow).|$|E
25|$|Though {{they were}} not a {{commercial}} success, the Bloch MB.90 and its variants were notable as the first French all-metal, meaning metal-framed, light aircraft. The MB.90 was a single engine, braced high wing design; the wing was in two parts, each with two I-section spars, constant chord and rounded tips. Their structure was <b>duralumin</b> and their covering fabric.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Duralumin</b> alloys {{had already}} {{demonstrated}} high-strength aluminium alloys. Y alloy's virtue was {{its ability to}} maintain high strength at high temperatures. R.R alloys were developed by Hall & Bradbury at Rolls-Royce, partly to simplify the manufacture of components using them. A deliberate heat treatment process of multiple steps was used to control their physical properties.|$|E
25|$|The Junkers G 31 was an {{advanced}} tri-motor airliner produced in small numbers in Germany in the 1920s. Like other Junkers types, {{it was an}} all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane. Compared to modern aircraft, only the corrugated <b>duralumin</b> metal skin, so typical for Junkers aircraft, seems unusual. However, in the mid-1920s all-metal construction and an aerodynamically 'clean' configuration were remarkable.|$|E
25|$|The {{short and}} broad hull {{accommodating}} {{the flight crew}} supported the engine nacelles and the wing centre section on a frame-work of struts, in similar fashion to the later version of the Rs.II. The high set fuselage had several tasks, providing gun positions for defence, ensuring that the tail unit was as high as possible to reduce damage from spray and {{to act as a}} king-post for the wings landing-wire bracing. Constructed of steel longerons riveted to <b>Duralumin</b> frames and covered with <b>Duralumin</b> sheet over the forward portion and fabric aft it supported the tail unit which consisted of a biplane tail cellule with elevators and a large central rudder, initially with a long central fin, but later with two smaller fixed fins in the tail cellule. At approximately the mid-wing chord position the fuselage had a cockpit with provision for two machine guns and also housed a sound-proof wireless cabin in the nose.|$|E
25|$|The first {{aircraft}} J7765 {{was delivered}} to the A at RAF Martlesham Heath in 1926 and 1927. J7766, delivered the following year, was distinguished by having engine nacelles that extended aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, the wing with <b>duralumin</b> spars and a metal-covered wing centre section, and a more rounded nose shape. The modified nose and nacelle shapes were also introduced on the first prototype.|$|E
25|$|Built {{entirely of}} <b>Duralumin</b> metal, {{it was an}} {{advanced}} design {{at the time of}} its first flight in 1926, but although evaluated by the Belgian Air Force, no orders were placed. Of conventional biplane construction, the C.2, registered as O-BAFX, later OO-AFX, incorporated one unique feature - all four of its wings were identical and interchangeable. The aircraft also included space for cameras, allowing it to be used for photo-reconnaissance.|$|E
25|$|The three-spar wings {{were the}} most {{significant}} new feature on the Yak-1000. Small and rhomboid-shaped, they had an aspect ratio of only 1.46 with 60° leading-edge sweepback with 51°11' sweepback at quarter chord. The thickness/chord ratio was a remarkable 3.4% at the root and 4.5% at the tip. Skin was 1.5mm thick <b>Duralumin.</b> The trailing edge was swept forward 11° and consisted of a full-span flap with inset ailerons.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-4/U8 — The A-4/U8 was the Jabo-Rei (Jagdbomber Reichweite, {{long-range}} fighter-bomber), adding twin standard Luftwaffe 300L (80US gal) drop tanks, {{one under}} each wing, on VTr-Ju 87 racks with <b>duralumin</b> fairings produced by Weserflug, and a centreline bomb rack. The outer wing-mounted 20mm MG FF/M cannon and the cowling-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 were removed to save weight. The A-4/U8 was the precursor of the Fw 190 G-1.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{was delayed}} {{by a number}} of circumstances. Difficulties were {{encountered}} with the fabrication of the <b>duralumin</b> girders for the transverse frames, and there were many changes to the design, including strengthening the hull so that it could be handled safely by inexperienced crews, and replacing the original drive arrangement of paired propellers mounted {{on the sides of the}} hull with swivelling propellers mounted on the gondolas (as used on contemporary British Army dirigibles).|$|E
25|$|Although the Rs.III {{differed}} in appearance from its predecessors, {{it was the}} result of the experience gained from building and flying the Rs.I and Rs.II. The broad hull was retained as well as the push-pull tandem nacelles, but the open framework tail boom was replaced by a steel and <b>Duralumin</b> fuselage that sat on the centreline of the high mounted wing and the substantial tubular trusses supporting the wing were replaced by conventional wire bracing.|$|E
25|$|The {{anodised}} <b>duralumin</b> fuselage {{was mounted}} below the lower wing, with the planing {{bottom of the}} hull made of stainless steel (as on the Singapore II) with a transverse main step. The use of stainless steel reduced the frequency of land inspections of the hull. The bimetallic corrosion problems experienced on the Singapore II hull had been solved; Short Brothers became the first company to master the technique of building seaplane floats and flying boat hulls in this combination of metals.|$|E
25|$|In August 1923, British {{aircraft}} manufacturers {{were invited}} to submit designs to Air Ministry Specification 26/23, which called for a single Rolls Royce Condor-engined two-seat day or night bomber. The Berkeley was Bristol's response, designed largely by W.T. Reid with finishing touches from Bristol's longtime chief designer, Frank Barnwell. It was a fabric-covered all-metal structured three-bay biplane, with equal span, unswept and unstaggered wings with Frise-type ailerons on {{the upper and lower}} planes. Structurally, the wings were of rolled steel and <b>duralumin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1936 Yakovlev {{designed}} a long-range sport aircraft, intended to perform record-breaking long-distance flights. Adhering to his established design methods, the AIR-12 had a welded steel tube covered by removable aluminium panels at the nose, plywood skinning {{back to the}} wing trailing edge and fabric fabric-covered rear fuselage. The plywood skinned wooden wings had a high aspect ratio and were sharply tapered with leading-edge sweep and straight trailing-edges. Control surfaces and tail unit were built up with D1 (<b>Duralumin)</b> and covered with fabric.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} chord wings were gimbal mounted {{to the lower}} fuselage, with pairs of streamlined compression struts from about 30% span to the upper fuselage just ahead of each cockpit. The wing spars were <b>duralumin</b> structures, though {{the first of the}} two Mussels had spruce ribs. The wing section was the untried, thick RAF 33. The wings and empennage were fabric covered; the fin and unbalanced rudder had a shape not unlike the de Haviiland vertical tail and the horizontal tail was externally braced from below.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were built}} in {{standard}} Blackburn fashion with steel spars and <b>duralumin</b> ribs. The biplane was of single-bay construction with equal-span, unstaggered wings. The upper wing was well clear of the fuselage. The monoplane had a high, braced wing. Total wing areas were similar, that of the monoplane some 3% greater. The desire to make the two aircraft as similar as possible somewhat penalised the monoplane because the divided undercarriage that fitted easily on the biplane's lower wing required some elaborate bracing on the monoplane.|$|E
25|$|Captain America's uniform {{is made of}} a {{fire-retardant}} material, and {{he wears}} a lightweight, bulletproof <b>duralumin</b> scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection. Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As {{a member of the}} Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.|$|E
25|$|The wings were {{on top of}} {{the hull}} and were braced with four sets per side of Warren strut style interplane {{structures}} comprising 'V' struts, which obviated the need for drag inducing wire bracing. The wing structure was formed with built-up steel spars, four in the top wing and three in the lower wing, and <b>duralumin</b> ribs riveted to the spars and braced internally. The fuselage was also made up from formed steel members built up into a framework which was then covered with fabric or dural sheeting.|$|E
