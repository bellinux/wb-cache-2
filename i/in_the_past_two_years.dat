25|$|The {{insurance}} {{sector in}} Morocco is witnessing dynamic growth, driven foremost by developments in life insurance, which has superseded motor insurance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> {{as the leading}} segment of the market with around one-third of total premiums. Behind life and auto insurance, accident, work-related accident, fire and transport insurance were the largest contributors.

The insurance penetration rate is 2.87% of GDP, while the insurance density is $69 per person.|$|E
25|$|Cruzado defended MSU's {{hiring and}} {{retention}} practices. In the 2012-2013 school year, she said, MSU paid $178,000 in retention salary bonuses and paid $1.35 million to provide equipment, materials, staff, and travel. Fourteen retention packages were offered to faculty; eight stayed, one left, and five were undecided. That compared, she said, to the 2008-2009 school year, {{in which only}} five faculty were offered retention packages totalling $521,000 (all five stayed). MSU also won state matching funds for all federal EPSCoR monies received, and now also offers bonuses to faculty who win research funding that adds at least 25 percent to their base salary. The university also {{increased the number of}} paid graduate assistants to 616 from 540 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> and added 12 more in the 2012-2013 school year.|$|E

Chinook and Coho salmon returns have been average to good, providing anglers with great salmon fishing from early June through September in the saltchuck and all year round in the lakes and rivers. A team of salmon enhancement volunteers and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have been improving salmon habitat throughout the Alberni Valley, adding a Coho hatchery at the McLean Mill National Historic Site, {{in addition to the}} highly successful Robertson Creek Hatchery on the Stamp River.

25|$|Despite this {{objective}} lack of accountability for policing practice, levels {{of trust in}} police remain amongst {{the highest in the}} EU, only behind Scandinavian countries and Switzerland. This allows Germany to maintain one of the lowest levels of public order and safety spending in the EU, at 1.5 percent of gross domestic profit, as compared to the EU average of 1.8 percent. As a result, Germany has a police force of only 300 officers per 100,000 of its population. These numbers are only less in Scandinavian countries and the UK, highlighting that despite these instances of police brutality, Germany is attempting to build the impression of having a more laissez-faire approach to policing. Additionally, German police officers rarely use their guns, as there have only been 8 fatalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> and only 109 deaths by service weapons since 1998.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the {{economic}} environment remained conducive to further growth of banking activity in Morocco following {{a very good}} year for the sector in 2006. In 2007 macroeconomic growth, excluding the agricultural sector, remained quite robust, providing the background for dynamic growth in banking credits. Total assets of the banking sector increased by 21.6% to MAD 654.7 billion ($85.1 billion), which is above the previous year's high annual growth rate of 18.1%. The structure of the domestic sector has remained steady <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> with the landscape dominated by three major local banks. The state has started to remove itself from the domestic sector by surrendering part of its share capital in public banks. At end-2007 public capital still held controlling stakes in five banks and four financing companies. Meanwhile, foreign ownership in the local financial sector continues to grow, with foreign institutions controlling five banks and eight financing companies as well as holding significant stakes in four banks and three financing companies.|$|E
25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E

What's more, that failure tag is consistently applied by comparisons with his 1982 album, Thriller, which has sold about 100 million copies and its follow-ups, Bad, that sold about 30 million copies.
