5|$|The Soviet Union had 7,192 {{airports}}, {{of which}} 1,163 had paved surface. By the 1980s most airports were having capacity problems, an example being the Lviv airport which <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> {{an average of}} 840 passengers each day, while the airport was built to handle 200. Another daunting problem {{was the lack of}} modernisation, with the Sheremetyevo International Airport (Moscow's main airport) being the only airport in the USSR to have been fully computerised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to the game, both teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> harsh winter weather in the Nashville area. Virginia Tech was forced to move {{practices}} indoors when an ice storm arrived {{on the day before}} Christmas. The storm caused travel delays for fans and players alike. Alabama's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed. The harsh weather continued through the day of the game, and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game. Alabama, meanwhile, drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a practice field that was not covered by ice.|$|E
5|$|McNicoll's career culminated {{with his}} {{promotion}} to vice admiral and appointment as First Naval Member and Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) in February 1965. As CNS, McNicoll <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> significant morale and recruitment issues occasioned by the February 1964 collision between HMAS Melbourne and Voyager and, furthermore, oversaw an extensive modernisation of the Australian fleet. In 1966, he {{presided over the}} RAN contribution to the Vietnam War, and it was during his tenure that the Australian White Ensign was created. McNicoll retired from the RAN in 1968 and was appointed as the inaugural Australian Ambassador to Turkey. He served in the diplomatic post for five years, then retired to Canberra. McNicoll died in 1987 {{at the age of}} 79.|$|E

Homer and Marge <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> Bart, who was two years old at the time. Marge reveals to her husband and their son that she is pregnant again, and points out to Homer that they will probably need a bigger place. After viewing several unsuitable properties, they buy a house on Evergreen Terrace with a $15,000 down payment from the sale of Grampa's house.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
5|$|The war also posed {{problems}} for the army commanders, given that, prior to 1914, the largest formation any serving General in the BEF had commanded on operations was a division. The expansion of the British Army saw some officers promoted from brigade to corps commander {{in less than a}} year. Army commanders also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the new tactics and weapons that were developed. With the move from manoeuvre to trench warfare, both the infantry and the artillery {{had to learn how to}} work together. During an offensive, and when in defence, they learned how to combine forces to defend the front line. Later in the war, when the Machine Gun Corps and the Tank Corps were added to the order of battle, they were also included in the new tactical doctrine.|$|E

5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E
25|$|On the 22 September {{the bulk}} of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade were dropped south of the river.

25|$|In 1970, {{approximately}} 220 {{films were}} made and this figure reached 300 in 1972. Turkish cinema gave birth to its legendary stars during this period, notable examples being Kemal Sunal, Kadir İnanır, Türkan Şoray and Şener Şen. After this period, however, the cinema began to lose its audiences, due to nationwide TV broadcasts. After 1970, a new and younger generation of directors emerged, but they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> an increased demand for video films after 1980.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaur fossils {{have been}} found in regions that were close to the poles at the {{relevant}} times, notably in southeastern Australia, Antarctica and the North Slope of Alaska.

25|$|In his own time, Bach's {{reputation}} equalled {{those of}} Telemann, Graun and Handel. During his life, Bach received public recognition, {{such as the}} title of court composer by Augustus III of Poland, and the appreciation he was shown by Frederick the Great and Herman Karl von Keyserling. Such highly placed appreciation contrasted with the humiliations he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with,</b> for instance in his hometown of Leipzig. Also in the contemporary press, Bach had his detractors, such as Johann Adolf Scheibe, suggesting he write less complex music and his supporters such as Johann Mattheson and Lorenz Christoph Mizler.|$|E

30|$|The guest {{systems in}} clouds often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the {{suboptimal}} network conditions caused by software devices, {{a problem that}} the VEPAd standard tried to solve in 2009.

Depending on the virtualization ratio, one virtual switch could be responsible for up to 64 guest systems. Guest systems frequently <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> packet loss [7] that, when using TCP/IP costs many CPU cycles on systems that are themselves billed according to the available CPU cycles. Packet loss in TCP/IP can easily cause guest systems to grind to a halt.|$|R

25|$|Later historians {{stressed}} {{the fact of}} Henry's early death and the succeeding throne quarrel as a stroke of fate and a major setback {{for the development of}} a German nation state begun under his father Frederick Barbarossa. On the other hand, the emperor's stern measures in Sicily earned him the reputation of a cruel and merciless ruler. Present-day historical research classifies Henry as a man of his time; though a capable ruler he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the centrifugal forces of the disintegrating empire while at the same time he overstretched the Hohenstaufen realm to an extent that finally could not be kept together.|$|E
25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now.
