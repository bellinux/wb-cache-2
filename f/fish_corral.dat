5000|$|Being {{the sole}} outflow of a commercially {{important}} lake, the Pansipit has a rich history {{of management and}} regulation of its aquatic resources. In 1941 fishing in the river and its surrounding waters was banned with a 5-year closed season by the then Commonwealth of the Philippines. [...] During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, the exclusive rights to the river for aquaculture purposes were leased to Santiago Banaag. At the time, a maximum of one <b>fish</b> <b>corral</b> was authorized by the contract, and the structure was to cover only up to two-thirds of {{the width of the}} river, leaving the remaining third for [...] "free navigation and the migration of fishes". After the war, the lease was rescinded in 1949 and fishery rights reverted to the towns of Taal and Lemery.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assist local government units to (a) monitor existing fish corrals within their jurisdictions and (b) identify suitable areas for new establishments, in accordance to the standards stated in the Fisheries Act No. 4003. For the monitoring of fish corrals, the closest distance between each <b>fish</b> <b>corral</b> was determined first. The law imposes that each <b>fish</b> <b>corral</b> must be at least 200 meters apart and fish corrals that have the same owner must be at least 60 meters apart unless if they are not deeper than two meters. It was found that 36 out of 47 fish corrals are within 200 meters from each other's edges, while 100 % of all fish corrals are at least 60 meters away from each other. For the suitability analysis, each <b>fish</b> <b>corral</b> was given a 200 meter radius and these areas were removed from possible areas of establishment. The area was then delimited according to the depth of the water and distance from the land. Based on the interpretation of the extracted features from ten different cites/municipalities, it was found out that the fish corrals are located on areas that are at least 14 meters deep and at a distance of at most 2. 6 kilometers from the land. Using the aforementioned conditions as basis for the area, random points were then generated that are at least 200 meters away from each other. On the first iteration, 53 points were generated which may represent fish corrals that can be established by the city of Victorias. Theoretically, 53 more fish corrals can be added alongside the 47 already existing in the area. For future studies, the status of marine habitats, location of marin...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} assess the capture {{fisheries}} of Naujan Lake with emphasis on commercially important fish species and {{to determine the extent}} of their exploitation. Four major fish landing centers in the municipalities of Socorro, Pola, Victoria and Naujan were surveyed from May 1995 to December 1996. Eight types of fishing gear had been recorded. The most commonly used was gill net or 'pante', followed by fish pot 'bubo', <b>fish</b> <b>corral</b> 'baklad', spear 'salapang', spear gun 'pana', fish trap 'patanga', encircling net 'takilis' and long line 'kitay'. Tilapia comprised 61 % of the total fish production of the lake, followed by therapon (16 %), goby (4 %) and mudfish (2 %). The other species caught were 'pla salid', catfish, mullet, carp, milkfish and shrimp, which contributed 17 % to the total production.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{occurrence}} of {{harmful algal bloom}} (HAB) caused by a non-toxic dinoflagellate, Cochlodinium sp. in Philippine waters, particularly, in Kalangahan Pt. -Manticao Pt., Iligan Bay on March 13 - 18, 2002. Two patches of Cochlodinium sp. bloom, associated with fish kills in Kalangahan Pt. -Mantacao Pt., Iligan Bay, caused localized water discoloration from the usual ocean blue to rusty brown or reddish brown to blackish. The first patch, located near fish-aggregating device (FAD) areas, spanned 2 km wide, while the second patch, located near a <b>fish</b> <b>corral,</b> spanned 500 m wide. These patches occupied the water column from surface to 5 m depth, but a thick mat formed at 0. 5 m to surface. Patches occupied the water column from surface to 5 m depth, but a thick mat formed at 0. 5 m to surface. Patches decreased as the bloom began to decline. The observed dead demersal and pelagic fishes coincided with highest bloom density of 3. 1 x 104 to 3. 8 x 104 cells ml- 1 of Cochlodinium. Dissected gills and stomach contents of fishes killed in HAB-affected areas did not reveal any indication of clogging of gills by Cochlodinium sp. Fishes covered by the “shading effect” of Cochlodinium bloom may have suffered anoxia or asphyxation due to oxygen depletion. No poisoning of people who consumed the dead fishes was reported. Laboratory analyses revealed lower DO values, 2. 4 to 0. 5 mg L- 1 from 2400 to 0600 Hr; 14 N: 1 P ratio; air-water temperature ranged from 28 - 29 °C; pH 7. 89 - 8. 29; and salinity, 33 - 35 °/oo.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the present state}} of marine resources in several coastal barangays of Ibajay and Tangalan, Aklan (Philippines). Field data were obtained from rapid surveys conducted from July to September 1998. Recommendations based on analyses of the data will guide fisherfolk and other stakeholders, particularly the local government units, in their development plans for these neighboring municipalities. Both land and marine products in the area are mainly harvested for the local market. All coastal barangays are dependent on fishing for their livelihood. The medium-scale municipal fishery of Tangalan employs several passive (encircling gill net, bag net, <b>fish</b> <b>corral)</b> and active gears (baby purse seine) compared with the traditional fishing methods employed by Ibajay fishers. Pond aquaculture in mangrove areas is well-developed in Ibajay West (barangays Aquino and Ondoy) and in Tangalan. However, ownership of these ponds is limited to a few individuals and families, unlike in Barangay Bugtong Bato where informal ownership distributed among families has been the traditional rule. Nonetheless, the introduction of so-called environment-friendly methods of utilizing mangroves (e. g., aquasilviculture) and other shared coastal resources may seriously undermine the informal rights-based social structures in the barangays. Without proper rules and enforcement, the application of these methods may be misused, aggravating the already poor overall state of their coastal resources. Major problems affecting their fishing livelihood include siltation of nearshore waters due to illegal deforestation upland, encroachment of municipal fishing grounds by commercial and other fishers elsewhere, and the lack of capital to finance the fishery. Weak inter-organizational links among government and non-government organizations have hampered the implementation of solutions to these common problems in coastal barangays. For instance, a conflict between fishers from these neighboring municipalities over territorial boundaries of common fishing grounds in Pangayawan and Pungtod reefs has not been resolved over the years. Likewise, the introduction of aquasilviculture in mangrove areas may become a potent source of conflict among resource-users who maintain informal rights over the mangrove resource. The overall state of coastal resources in these municipalities is in immediate need of a unified plan to promote both their preservation and conservation. To achieve this end, a joint resource management council representing all resource-users from both municipalities must be organized and convened. To address the presently weak inter-organizational links among existing organizations, this joint council may provide a legitimate forum to identify, resolve, integrate, implement, and enforce guidelines on the common use of resources, both marine and inland. Low estimated yields from the reef fishery, conversion of mangroves for aquaculture beyond the allowable limit, a persistent conflict over fishing rights in several reefs offshore, the limited resources for seaweed and fish mariculture, and threats on existing traditional social structures by progressive resource-users are several issues that require thorough discussions to formulate popularly approved and acceptable management strategies. These strategies include community-based approaches of co-managing resources such as "no-take zones" (sanctuaries), ecotourism development, and livelihood schemes to mitigate, in part, the pressure of over-exploitation of fishery resources...|$|E

Fishing was practiced mostly by adult men, who used 7 fishing arts (gillnetting, hook and line, longline, <b>fish</b> <b>corrals,</b> net of tide canals, casting net, and basket trap), mainly aimed at catching king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), serra Spanish mackerel (S. brasiliensis), king weakfish (Macrodon ancylodon), weakfish (Cynoscion spp.), hake (Cynoscion spp.), catfish (Bagre bagre), and mullet (Mugil spp.). Fishermen observed in the region 5 turtle species, with a more frequent occurrence of Chelonia mydas (100 %), Dermochelys coriacea (66 %), and Eretmochelys imbricata (46 %); the less frequent species are Caretta caretta (16 %) and Lepidochelys olivacea (8 %).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the mechanics {{and implications of}} municipal concessions in the Philippines which govern the use of municipal waters for <b>fish</b> <b>corrals,</b> oyster culture beds and gathering of milkfish fry. These concessions or territorial use rights are awarded annually by the resource owner (the municipality) to the highest bidder. In the case of milkfish fry gathering, the concessionaire assumes monopsonist rights of first purchase from fry gatherers. The implications of this system for economic efficiency and equity are discussed theoretically with supporting data from milkfish fry concessions in Antique Province. It is concluded that the system increases economic efficiency in resource use and generates significant income for municipalities which they can then redistribute as they see fit, and therefore not necessarily for the special benefit of fishermen. 1...|$|R

According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofresí probably worked in a number of <b>fishing</b> <b>corrals</b> in Boquerón Bay. The corrals belonged to Cristóbal Pabón Dávila, a friend of municipal port captain José Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofresí, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco's children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no evidence linking him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofresí's brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, Avispa, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819 Cofresí was registered on Ramona, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to the Mona Passage and Cofresí's recognition by local residents indicate that he occasionally accompanied Avispa That year, Cofresí and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher taxes than the previous year: five reales.|$|R

40|$|Species {{inventories}} {{were recently}} made {{in and around}} the research stations of the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department to facilitate subsequent monitoring. AQD s Tigbauan Main Station (TMS, since 1973) faces the deep open waters of the Panay Gulf and Sulu Sea and is flanked by densely populated fishing villages operating nearshore <b>fish</b> <b>corrals,</b> gillnets, longlines, and beach seines. In 2013 2014, sampling at the sand-gravel intertidal and monitoring of the catch of the various gears showed at least 579 species from 213 families, including 252 species of fishes, 228 mollusks, 48 crustaceans, 12 cnidarians, 9 echinoderms, 16 seaweeds, sea turtles, and sea snakes inhabiting the nearshore areas off TMS. Any adverse effect of the TMS hatcheries and laboratories is difficult to discern on top of the continuous intense fishing and habitat disturbance. AQD s Igang Marine Station (IMS, since 1980) is in a cove under the rocky cliffs of southern Guimaras, behind several islands facing the Panay Gulf and Sulu Sea. IMS includes 40 ha of seagrass beds and sandflats around five rocky islets and two 6 12 m deep basins where broodstock and growout cages are moored. IMS is flanked by many <b>fish</b> <b>corrals</b> operated by fishers who live in villages in nearby coves. Fishers on outrigger boats also use gillnets and spears, and others glean for mollusks and echinoderms inside IMS. In 2011 2012, some 786 species in 261 families were collected or photographed at IMS, including 74 species of fishes, 40 crustaceans, 391 mollusks, 44 echinoderms, 87 cnidarians, 47 poriferans, 24 ascidians, and 12 bryozoans, and sea snakes living among 48 seaweeds and 4 seagrasses. Biodiversity at IMS seems high despite 35 years of operation of the fish cages and the continuous fishing, gleaning, and boating by the locals. Several species of filter-feeding invertebrates grew on the cage nets and platforms but were not found in the natural habitats. The cages provide additional attachment surfaces for many species; these biofoulants presumably reduce water flow into the cages but they also remove nutrients and particulate wastes and help maintain good water quality. Nevertheless, siltation is evident under the cliffs inside the cove, and the sandflats may be expanding over the seagrass beds. AQD s 16 ha Dumangas Brackishwater Station (DBS, since 1998) is flanked by freshwater Talaugis River, by hundreds of hectares of mangrove-derived fish ponds, and by Pulao Creek and an extensive mudflat with fringing mangroves at the northeastern end of Iloilo Strait. In 2009 2010, 16 ponds with water areas from 0. 5 to 0. 9 ha were sampled during harvest of the experimental crops. At least 90 species of non-crop fishes lived in the DBS ponds, along with 35 crustaceans, 60 mollusks, three echinoderms, two cnidarians, and a water snake. The snails Cerithideopsilla spp., Cerithium coralium, and Batillaria spp. were very abundant in the ponds. Almost all the same species in the ponds, plus many others, were found in the adjoining fringing mangroves with ~ 10 species of trees. The ponds serve as proxy for mangrove lagoons that harbor the young of migratory fishes as well as all life stages of resident species. Several non-crop species inside the IMS cages and the DBS ponds are harvested by the pond workers and contribute to nutrition and income.

Among the 14 penaeids, P. semisulcatus, M. ensis and M. palmensis {{were found to be}} the dominant species within each genus. There are seven existing fishing gears for shrimping in the Batan Bay and Tigbauan-Guimbal waters: <b>fish</b> <b>corrals,</b> lift net, filter net, gill net, skimming net, baby trawler and commercial trawler. In general, female penaeids are larger than males. The largest P. monodon female measured was 81 mm in carapace length with 23 g in body weight. The largest male measuring 59 mm in carapace length with 119 g of body weight was caught in Batan Bay. Judging from spermatozoa occurrence on both sexes of P. monodon, the biological minimum size for male is 37 mm in carapace length and 49 mm for female. A total of 133 Penaeus postlarvae obtained from the offshore were identified by comparison with those reared in the laboratory.

The records of the behavior of the calf on the shifts in the nursery, body position and dive time observations were made using specific "ad libitum" with the aid of binoculars and a digital stopwatch. For growth studies, morphometric measures and weight were taken. About the food supply, it was recorded gradual increase in milk consumption, but the calf did not show active interest in any item of plant origin that was offered.

An Olive Ridley Turtle and three Green Turtles were seen nesting at three beaches in southern and western Panay. Nesting of Hawksbill Turtles has been recorded at secluded beaches in Lawi, Guimaras about every three years; several batches of hatchlings have been raised by local residents before being released.

40|$|Abstract only. This paper reviews {{historical}} and recent data on biodiversity, fisheries, exotic fishes, and aquaculture in Philippine {{lakes and rivers}}. The country's lakes and rivers are poor in primary freshwater fishes because the Philippines' only connection with the Asian mainland had been through land bridges between Borneo, the Sulu islands, Mindanao, Palawan and Mindoro - in which islands endemic carps have evolved. Philippine lakes and rivers instead have secondary freshwater fishes such as gobies, migratory marine fishes such as mullets, and some snails, clams, and prawns. Most lakes and rivers have been severely degraded and their biodiversity reduced by siltation, pollution, overfishing, {{and the establishment of}} exotic fishes from other countries or elsewhere in the country. Many fishes first described in the Philippines in 1910 - 1940 by Seale, Herre, and Filipino ichthyologists have not been collected in recent years. The Laguna de Bay fishery in the early 1960 s was largely dependent on the 'ayungin' Therapon plumbeus, 'biyang puti' Glossogobius giurus, and the 'kanduli' Arius manilensis that together comprised 95 % of the annual 83, 000 mt; another 19, 000 mt came from shrimps and 245, 000 mt from snails. Fishing and snail-dredging were so intense that catches declined and the whole lake fishery collapsed around 1970. After the collapse, the primary production of the lake increased and milkfish and tilapia became natural choices for aquaculture. Lake Lanao became famous for its species flock of 18 endemic carps, but these are now extinct, except perhaps two species. In 1963, these carps contributed 981 mt to the fishery, other native fishes 269 mt, shrimps and snails 257 mt, and introduced fishes 479 mt. Twenty years later, endemic carps have made up only 92 mt, native fishes 141 mt, shrimps and snails 164 mt, and introduced fishes 312 mt of the harvest from the lake. The 'kadurog' G. giurus, probably stocked in the lake with milkfish larvae in 1955, proliferated in the 1960 s and apparently drove the endemic carps to extinction. The 'katolong' Hypseleotris agilis was first seen in the lake in 1977 and has since outcompeted the 'kadurog'. In Lakes Taal and Naujan, migratory marine fishes have been caught by <b>fish</b> <b>corrals</b> set across the outlets, but the catch along Pansipit River has fallen {{since the turn of the}} century and that in Butas River fell from 62 mt in 1977 to 17 mt in 1983. Catches of the endemic sardine Harengula tawilis in Lake Taal fluctuated between 4, 400 mt in 1983 to 11, 300 mt in 1990 and 1, 400 mt in 1994. Cage culture of tilapia and milkfish has been going on in Lake Taal for 10 years. In Lakes Buhi and Bato, the endemic 'sinarapan' Mistichthys luzonensis almost disappeared due to fine-net fishing and tilapia stocking; catches have been 50 - 90 mt in 1983 - 93 but zero in 1994...|$|R
50|$|As {{the brown}} pelican flies at a maximum height of 60 to 70 ft above the ocean, it can spot schools of fish while flying. When foraging, it dives bill-first like a kingfisher, often {{submerging}} completely {{below the surface}} momentarily as it snaps up prey. Upon surfacing, it spills {{the water from the}} throat pouch before swallowing its catch. Only the Peruvian pelican shares this active foraging style (although that species never dives from such a great height), while other pelicans forage more inactively by scooping up <b>corralled</b> <b>fish</b> while swimming on the water surface. It is an occasional target of kleptoparasitism by other fish-eating birds such as gulls, skuas, and frigatebirds. A single adult pelican can eat up to 1.8 kg each day. Today, in many coastal areas, the brown pelican loafs around fishing ports and piers in hopes of being fed or stealing scraps of fish, especially if conditioned to do.|$|R
40|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the Philippines was tantamount to a marine capture fishery in the 1950 s to 1960 s. Aquaculture and inland fishery production were not significant. Only during the 1970 s did aquaculture and inland capture fisheries contribute significantly to fish production. From 250 000 t fish production in 1951, this increased substantially to 1. 6 million t in the 1990 s. An average 4. 3 % was contributed by fisheries to {{the gross domestic product}} from 1988 - 98. Fisheries export earnings reached P 12 billion in the 1990 s. Exports of fishery products include tuna, shrimps, prawns and seaweed. Fishing industry employees in the Philippines are distributed thus: 70 % in the municipal (artisanal) sector, 25 % in aquaculture and 5 % in the commercial sector. Fish and fish products comprise more than 50 % of total animal protein intake vis-Î±-vis meat and meat products and poultry. However per capita consumption of food fish decreased from 40 kgâ•–year- 1 in 1988 to 36 kg in 1998. In the Philippines, small scale fishing is defined as fishing within municipal waters using fishing vessels of 3 GT or less, or fishing without vessels. In 1948, there were 63 005 fishers rising to 743 544 in 1995. There was a declining trend in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 2. 10 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1948 to 0. 29 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1985. Time-series data from 1976 - 87 showed that small pelagics accounted for 38 % of total catch followed by demersals, 26 %; tuna, 16 %; seaweeds, 14 %; large pelagics, 6 % and invertebrates, 9 %. The most important fishing gear in terms of contribution to total catch are gillnets (30 %), hook and line (24 %) and beach seine (8 %). Hook and line accounts for almost 60 % of tuna catch while hook and line, gillnets, and <b>fish</b> <b>corrals</b> account for 60 % of demersal catch. Commercial fishing can be classified into: (a) small scale commercial fishing (fishing with passive or active gear and utilizing vessels of 3. 1 GT up to 20 GT); (b) medium-scale commercial fishing (fishing with active gear and utilizing vessels of 20. 1 GT up to 150 GT); and (c) large scale commercial fishing (fishing with active gear and vessels of more than 150 GT). In the 1950 s the three dominant types of gear were bag net, the trawl (including beam and otter types) and the round haul seine. The larger tonnage category (more than 100 GT) became more significant in the 1980 s. There are 35 species comprising 70 - 95 % of total commercial fish production grouped as demersals, small pelagics and large pelagics. Roundscads dominated the small pelagics, followed by slipmouth, a demersal species. Declining catches, disappearance of high value species and increasing volume of juveniles are indications that the fishery is biologically over-fished. This translates as declining profit for the fishery sector. It also means that the fishery employs excess labor and utilizes capital {{that could be used in}} other economic sectors.

2500|$|The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again {{verified}} {{the great}} pottery {{tradition of the}} Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting {{question is whether or}} not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply [...] "made in Luzon." [...] In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified [...] "Imbe" [...] jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ("Chinese Pottery," [...] Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles.

2500|$|When Europeans {{first arrived}} {{at the site of}} present-day Toronto, the {{vicinity}} was inhabited by the Iroquois, who by then had displaced the Wyandot (Huron) people who had occupied the region for centuries before c. 1500. The name Toronto is likely derived from the Iroquois word tkaronto, meaning [...] "place where trees stand in the water". This refers to the northern end of what is now Lake Simcoe, where the Huron had planted tree saplings to <b>corral</b> <b>fish.</b> However, the word [...] "Toronto", meaning [...] "plenty" [...] also appears in a French lexicon of the Huron language in 1632, and appeared on French maps referring to various locations, including Georgian Bay, Lake Simcoe, and several rivers. A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through this point, the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, led to widespread use of the name. In the 1660s, the Iroquois established two villages within what is today Toronto, Ganatsekwyagon {{on the banks of the}} Rouge River and Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. By 1701, the Mississauga had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver Wars.|$|R
50|$|This pelican feeds {{almost entirely}} on fish. Preferred prey species can include common carp (Cyprinus carpio), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), common rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus), eels, catfish (especially silurids during winter), mullet and {{northern}} pike (Esox lucius), the latter having measured up to 50 cm when taken. In the largest remnant colony, located in Greece, the preferred prey is reportedly the native Alburnus belvica. The Dalmatian pelican requires around 1200 g of fish per day and can take locally abundant smaller fish such as gobies, but usually ignore them in lieu of slightly larger fish. It usually forages alone or in groups of only two or three. It normally swims along, placidly and slowly, until it quickly dunks its head underwater and scoops the fish out, along with great masses of water. The water is dumped out of {{the sides of the}} pouch and the fish is swallowed. Occasionally it may feed cooperatively with other pelicans by <b>corralling</b> <b>fish</b> into shallow waters and may even cooperate similarly while fishing alongside cormorants in Greece. Occasionally, the pelican may not immediately eat the fish contained in its gular pouch, so it can save the prey for later consumption. Other small wetlands-dwellers may supplement the diet, including crustaceans, worms, beetles and small water birds, usually nestlings and eggs.|$|R

The clusters containing mature fruits were collected from 25 individuals in floodplain environment in the municipality of Careiro Lowland, Amazonas. Pyrenes and the seeds had a water content of 23, 1 % and 17, 9 %, respectively. The pyrene is oval to elliptical, with core disk formed by sclerified cells thick-walled, however, absent in the region of the germ pore. The seed is eurispermica, being cordate, oblong and elliptical. Shows two to three pores. The integument is thin, consisting of sclerenchyma cells and thickened with phenolic content. The endosperm is homogeneous, white and rigid. The embryo is apical, small, tapered and milky-white, with-embryonic axis oblique and curved, with three leaf primordia. The endosperm storage protein and lipid reserves. The alternating temperature of 26 - 40 ?C was suitable for seed germination, regardless of the level of processing. The progressive drying of pyrene facilitated the extraction of seeds. However, drying and removal of the endocarp reduced germination and vigor. Therefore, the processing is not recommended. The seed soaking for two days enhanced germination. The seed dormancy is not caused by the presence of the endocarp. Germination is adjacent ligulate, cryptocotylar and hypogeal.
