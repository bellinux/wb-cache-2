5|$|The {{basic rules}} of {{probability}} amplitudes {{that will be}} used are that a) if an event can <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of different ways then its probability amplitude is the sum of the probability amplitudes of the possible ways and b) if a process involves a number of independent sub-processes then its probability amplitude is the product of the component probability amplitudes.|$|E
5|$|The factual {{accuracy}} of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury {{not to let the}} series influence their view of trials—referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E

25|$|Acquisition {{of human}} remains by museums can <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of ways, {{some of which}} are {{considered}} to be unethical today. Many museums have human remains in their collections which have been there for over a hundred years, in which case they may likely have been acquired in ethically or morally unsound ways.

Some guidelines for the care of human remains including acceptable means of acquisition can be found below.|$|E

NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement is going to <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E

25|$|The National War Aims Committee {{was set up}} in 1917 {{to focus}} on {{domestic}} propaganda. Caine was recruited for the committee by the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to write the screenplay for the propaganda film Victory and Peace, designed to show what would <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> German invasion. Most of the negative of the newly finished film was destroyed in a fire at the offices of the London Film Company in June 1918. It was re-filmed over four-months, just as the war ended and was never released.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's {{main line}} of {{argument}} was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{short period of time}} by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, a {{relatively}} new law, which {{has been established in}} 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.|$|E

25|$|As well as combating the Neptunists, he also {{opened up}} the concept of deep time for {{scientific}} purposes, in opposition to Catastrophism. Rather than accepting that the earth {{was no more than}} a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past. His main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Before long, scientific inquiries provoked by his claims had pushed back the age of the earth into the millions of yearsstill too short when compared with the accepted 4.6 billion year age in the 21st century, but a distinct improvement.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{can be done}} in case a {{peripheral}} nerve has become cut or otherwise divided. This is called peripheral nerve reconstruction. The injured nerve is identified and exposed so that normal nerve tissue can be examined above and below the level of injury, usually with magnification, using either loupes or an operating microscope. If a large segment of nerve is harmed, as can <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crush or stretch injury, the nerve will need to be exposed over a larger area. Injured portions of the nerve are removed. The cut nerve endings are then carefully reapproximated using very small sutures. The nerve repair must be covered by healthy tissue, which {{can be as simple as}} closing the skin or it can require moving skin or muscle to provide healthy padded coverage over the nerve. The type of anesthesia used depends on the complexity of the injury. A surgical tourniquet is almost always used.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, 5,320 {{churches were}} {{reported}} to be within the UCC, averaging 210 members. Sixteen churches {{were reported to have}} over 2,000 members, but 64% had fewer than 200 members. The latter statistic probably indicates where most of the denomination's declining membership has occurred, in formerly mid-sized congregations between 200 and 500 members or so. The reduction in a typical church's size has also meant that, increasingly, many congregations are no longer able, as they once were, to afford a full-time, seminary-educated pastor, and that some of them have to rely on alternatives such as one of their members serving the church under a license, the use of recently retired clergy on a short-term basis, or ordained ministers serving the church on a half-time (or less) basis while earning their primary income from chaplaincies or other occupations. While this has been occurring to a lesser degree in other mainline denominations as well, the UCC's congregational polity allows for churches to adopt such approaches without ecclesiological restraint, as might <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more hierarchical denominational structure.|$|E
