The gases are transported at extremely <b>high</b> operating <b>pressures</b> that can range from 200 to 1600 PSI depending on the size and length of the <b>line</b> <b>pipe.</b> For operating safety, Hydrostatic test is used for confirming mechanical integrity of <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> and is applied to check for leakages before putting the <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> in use. The test aims to evaluate the point of failure of the material and assess the structural integrity of a welded pipe. In present work, an experiment is carried out to confirm weld integrity of two X 70 grade carbon steel pipes under the manufacturing process of hot rolling with left and right hand spiral plants. The tests are conducted at pressure in excess of the UTS of the steel / pipes and aimed to sustain the pressure as per API convention. Both the pipes attained the expected results; however the results of theoretical predicted pressure minutely diverge as the thickness variation is not considered...|$|R

25|$|Hydrogen {{pipelines}} {{are more}} expensive than even long-distance electric lines. Hydrogen is about three times bulkier in volume than natural gas for the same enthalpy. Hydrogen accelerates the cracking of steel (hydrogen embrittlement), which increases maintenance costs, leakage rates, and material costs. The difference in cost is likely to expand with newer technology: wires suspended in air can use higher voltage with only marginally increased material costs, but <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> require proportionally more material.|$|R
40|$|In most of {{the process}} industries, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> steam is {{utilized}} for many applications. The steam is produced in the boilers and carried through steam <b>pipe</b> <b>lines</b> to the process plants. During their travel through these pipelines, loss may occur due to loss of <b>pressure,</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>line</b> insulation failures and loss of temperature. These are known as losses in steam network. This reduces steam efficiency, thus the quality of steam becomes low at the receiving end. Steam Traps are automatic valves designed to trap steam and remove condensate from the steam lines. Thus a perfect steam trap can minimise steam loss and thus maximise the steam efficiency and quality. The project is focused at steam trap analysis and rectification in the industry through a n exhaustive study of steam network. Based on the study, steam loss is calculated. Thus the investment and its payback period for {{the company is also}} calculated. O bv iously, the longer an efficient trap lasts, the more it reduces energy wasted, fuel burned and pollutants released into the air. The benefits are energy savings and a cleaner, improved environment...|$|R
40|$|The inner {{diameter}} of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> {{has a significant}} effect on the fuel injection process and the performance of a diesel engine. The spray impact force of each nozzle hole of a conventional injection system of pump-line-nozzle for diesel engine (based on the spray momentum flux) and the injection pressure (on a fuel injection pump test rig) were measured. With varying fuel injection quantities and pump speed, the effects of the {{inner diameter}} of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> on fuel injection process and the fuel injection characteristics of each nozzle hole were analyzed. It was noted from experimental results that the fuel injection pressure changes with variations in the inner diameter of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> and also the injection duration gradually increases with increase in the inner diameter. At low injection pump speed, even with the same geometric fuel deliver rate, the injection duration also increases gradually. Due to throttling effect and reduction in injection pressure, the fuel injection quantities of the injection nozzle were relatively minimal when the inner diameters of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> were respectively small and large. The optimum injection pipe inner diameter for the right quantity for fuel injection falls between the two cases (between small and large). In addition, the injection rate of each nozzle hole increases with the decrease in angle between the needle axis and each of the nozzle hole axis. The fuel injection quantity of each nozzle hole increases while their relative difference decreases with increasing pump speed...|$|R
25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems.

A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|R

Hydraulic head is the pressure measurement of water falling in a pipe expressed {{as a function of}} the vertical distance the water falls. This change in elevation is usually measured in feet or meters. A drop of at least 2 feet is required or the system may not be feasible. When quantifying head, both gross and net head must be considered. Gross head approximates power accessibility through the vertical distance measurement alone whereas net head subtracts pressure lost due to friction in piping from the gross head.

The sensors are created inside optical fibres (usually standard telecommunication fibres); the optical fibres technology allows to install the sensors on structures working in harsh environments, since the materials are almost insensitive to corrosion, the monitoring system can be positioned far away from the sensors without sensible signal losses, and there is no risk of electric discharge. FBG sensors can be used to create strain gages, thermometers or accelerometers, depending on the coating on the grating, on the way the grating is fixed to the structure, and on the presence of a specifically designed interface that can act as a transducer.

40|$|Diesel {{combustion}} and {{the formation}} of pollutants are directly influenced by the spatial and temporal distributions of the fuel within the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. The requirements for more efficient and responsive diesel engines have led to the introduction and implementation of multiple injection strategies. However, the effects of such injection modes on the hydraulic systems, such as the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> and fuel injectors, must be thoroughly examined and compensated for. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of fuel injection equipment characterisation and optimisation on diesel combustion and emissions with two-stage fuel injection. The fuel injection system was characterised and optimised through the measurement of the fuel injection rate and quantity, in particular, the interaction between the two injection events was quantified and compensated for. The effects of twin and variable split two-stage injection and dwell angle on diesel combustion and emissions were investigated in a high-speed direct injection single-cylinder optical diesel engine using heat release analysis and high-speed fuel spray and combustion visualisation technique. The results indicated that two-stage injection has the potential for simultaneous reduction of NO and soot emissions. Nevertheless, the studied two-stage strategies resulted in higher soot emission, mainly due to the interaction between two consecutive fuel injection events, whereby the fuel sprays during the second injection were injected into burning regions, generating fuel-rich combustion. In addition, the variable two-stage strategies produced high levels of uHC emission in comparison to single and twin split injection cases. This was mainly attributed to firstly greater fuel quantity injected during the second injection and secondly poor mixing and air utilisation during the second fuel injection event. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The main goal was {{to find out how}} furnace screen heat transfer surface affects the recovery boiler price and performance. Two different boiler sizes were studied. Four different boilers were designed in both boiler sizes. One boiler was designed without furnace screen and three others with different size of furnace screens. The boilers were desinged so that they reached the same performances and were comparable. The furnace screen is an effective heat transfer surface and by adding the furnace screen the furnace can be designed lower. Furnace height has a significant effect on the total price of the boiler. On the other hand, the reduced furnace height yields shorter flue gas residence time, which can lead to incomplete combustion resulting e. g. increased emissions. Combustion air ratio and mixing of reactants with the air jets have a great effect on the combustion efficiency. In this study, the reduced residence time was compensated by the higher combustion air ratio by feeding more combustion air into the furnace. This way the effective mixing and the complete combustion were ensured. In order to find out the required amount of combustion air for the complete combustion CFD simulations and field data analysis were made. The target was to find out the effect of the combustion air ratio and the residence time on the CO emissions.
