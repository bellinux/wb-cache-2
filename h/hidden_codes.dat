40|$|Abstract. Trigger-based malware is {{designed}} to remain dormant and undetected unless a specific trigger occurs. Such behavior occurs in preva-lent threats such as backdoors and environment-dependent (targeted) malware. Currently, trigger-based malicious <b>code</b> is often <b>hidden</b> in rarely exercised code paths in benign host binaries, and relies upon a lack of code inspection to remain undetected. However, recent advances in au-tomatic backdoor detection make this approach unsustainable. We in-troduce a new <b>code</b> <b>hiding</b> approach for trigger-based malware, which conceals malicious code inside spurious code fragments {{in such a way}} that it is invisible to disassemblers and static backdoor detectors. Fur-thermore, we implement stealthy control transfers to the <b>hidden</b> <b>code</b> by crafting trigger-dependent bugs, which jump to the <b>hidden</b> <b>code</b> only if provided with the correct trigger. Thus, the <b>hidden</b> <b>code</b> also remains invisible under dynamic analysis if the correct trigger is unknown. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by crafting a hidden backdoor for the Nginx HTTP server module. ...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the core}} of the {{argument}} is the nature of acceptable evidence used to attribute works to their authors. Anti-Stratfordians rely on what has been called a [...] "rhetoric of accumulation", or what they designate as circumstantial evidence: similarities between the characters and events portrayed in the works and the biography of their preferred candidate; literary parallels with the known works of their candidate; and <b>hidden</b> <b>codes</b> and cryptographic allusions in Shakespeare's own works or texts written by contemporaries. By contrast, academic Shakespeareans and literary historians rely mainly on direct documentary evidence—in the form of title page attributions and government records such as the Stationers' Register and the Accounts of the Revels Office—and contemporary testimony from poets, historians, and those players and playwrights who worked with him, as well as modern stylometric studies. Scholars say all these converge to confirm William Shakespeare's authorship. These criteria are the same as those used to credit works to other authors and are accepted as the standard methodology for authorship attribution.|$|E

40|$|As reverse {{engineering}} becomes a prevalent technique to analyze malware, malware writers leverage various anti-{{reverse engineering}} techniques to <b>hide</b> their <b>code.</b> One technique commonly used is code packing as packed executables hinder code analysis.

In this paper, we propose a fully dynamic approach that captures an intrinsic nature of <b>hidden</b> <b>code</b> execution that the original code should be present in memory and executed at some point at run-time. Thus, this approach monitors program execution and memory writes at run-time, determines if the code under execution is newly generated, and then extracts the <b>hidden</b> <b>code</b> of the executable. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we implement a system, Renovo, and evaluate it {{with a large number}} of real-world malware samples.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that media can strongly influence people’s behaviour towards specific events, making use of explicit statements but also <b>hidden</b> <b>codes</b> based mostly on traditional values. This paper investigates how the dual characteristics of Yin-Yang, a main feature of traditional Korean and East Asian culture, are used to represent the Korean financial crisis through <b>hidden</b> <b>codes</b> on front covers of economic magazines. This was achieved by discussing the contents of 45 covers with four designers working for Korean economic magazines. Images were further investigated based on Barthesian semiotic analysis incorporating denotative, connotative, and mythical structures. The result shows that representative colour and text codes correspond to key symbolic codes on front covers. The duality of Yin-Yang analysis therefore provides a specific angle on a semiotic system of explanation, and understanding semiotics requires attention to this additional set of representative codes in interpreting news features on the Korean peninsula. In this study, I have built up a representative analysis of crisis colours from the aspect of Korean cultural semiotics and reconstructed them as cultural codes which are found to Korean financial crisis by taking examples of economic front cover images, which contain a miniature of contemporary Korean everyday life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Trusted {{software}} execution, {{prevention of}} code and data tampering, authentication, {{and providing a}} secure environment for software {{are some of the}} most important security challenges in the design of embedded systems. This short paper evaluates the performance of a hardware/software co-design methodology for embedded software protection. Secure software is created using a secure compiler that inserts <b>hidden</b> <b>codes</b> into the executable code which are then validated dynamically during execution by a reconfigurable hardware component constructed from Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. While the overall approach has been described in other papers, this paper focuses on security-performance tradeoffs and the effect of using compiler optimizations in such an approach. Our results show that the approach provides software protection with modest performance penalty and hardware overhead. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{paradox of}} the title is that while most historians of medieval {{architecture}} agree {{that a combination of}} geometric and arithmetic methods was generally used to lay out a medieval church, there has been little consensus on the specifics of the process in relation to the design of any particular edifice.

40|$|The idea of emancipated {{instrumental}} music {{is connected to}} the establishment of the modern concept of the Fine Arts, which in turn produced a requirement for the understanding of music as created by some lonely misunderstood genius.

However, it is obvious that our sensory perception is unreliable, incomplete, and limited due to numerous factors (ideological, social, historical, aesthetic, etc.), and thus in need of critical examination. At the same time the understanding of these mechanisms provides only a partial account of music, since they ignore the object of aesthetic contemplation. Therefore, we need a reflection on the systems of the “understanding of musical understanding,” i. e., a wider hermeneutical analysis of the integration of music in a referential context constituted of musical significance, meaning, pleasure and value...|$|E

40|$|Nature is {{paramount}} to our existence. Humankind clearly realised {{the importance of}} nature {{since the beginning of}} our sapient abilities. Archaeological evidence shows how humans revered nature and how natural phenomena were mystified. This mystification of nature inspired animism and many associated religious rites, some of which are still part of our cultural existence. Some of the important results that stemmed from the mystification of nature is that it was seen as either good, being the handiwork of God or Gods, or that it started out as perfect but then became bad after the fall. Scientific research however show that there is no morality or <b>hidden</b> <b>codes</b> in nature, but that nature consists of random events, some which benefit humans, while others do not. Parasitology serves as a good example to show how extremely non-humane nature can be and how naïve and idealised our view of nature is. Not only did parasites exist on the planet since the beginning of life on earth and long before the existence of hominins, but the majority of all known animals are parasites.

I am interested in the home as a locale of cyberspace in regard to the relationship between attaching and detaching, territorializing and de-territorializing, the smooth and the striated.

Through experiments with light, materials and installations, I intend to draw out a tactile perspective on cyberspace and domesticity. In terms of materials, I am particularly interested in the residues in everyday life. Light and materials are considered to be tactile as well as visual. Performativity, Heuristics and Active Documentation are my main methodological approaches. My work does not seek to fix a solution, but open up an area of ongoing discovery. The physical makings are the ignition for later developments. Once the installation has been set up, the performativity is transferred to the audience. The surrounding space becomes activated because of the energy released by the audience's engagement. Heuristic use of intuition and informal experience was applied in my working process to discover imperceptible traits of materials and daily situations.

40|$|Abstract A new {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of high-capacity anti-collusion <b>hiding</b> <b>codes</b> in a large-scale fingerprint-based traitor tracing system is proposed in this work. We consider a <b>hiding</b> <b>code</b> of MN bits, where M bits are used as the user ID and N bits are the length of the spreading codes. Since each user is assigned one out of 2 M ID numbers and one out of N spreading codewords, the total number of users is equal to 2 MN. To accommodate an even larger number of users, we propose a shifted spreading scheme that shifts the spreading codeword circularly by a certain amount. By allowing P shifts (with P mod N), the total number of users increases from 2 MN to 2 MNP. When multiple users perform a weighted collusion attack, we show that the task of identifying colluders and their attack weights can be formulated as a user detection and channel estimation problem in a multiuser wireless communication sys-tem with a multipath fading channel. For the latter, there exist code design techniques that choose the spreading codes carefully so as to reduce multiaccess interference of users with different spreading codewords effectively. By exploiting this analogy, we develop an anti-collusion code called OSIFT (Orthogonal Spreading followed by the Inverse Fourier Transform). We compare several <b>hiding</b> <b>codes</b> in a fingerprinting sys-tem consisting of hundreds of colluders. It is demonstrated by computer simulation that, when the OSIFT code is adopted, colluders and their attack weights can be found by the proposed fingerprinting system more accurately...|$|R
