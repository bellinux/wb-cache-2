Thanks to insightful analysis of the preserved documents, the hackneyed opinion that the first city rights were given to Tykocin in 1425, is being called into question. In the article all the most important documents about this issue were pointed and described. Basing on those documents we cannot define the exact <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> the city status to Tykocin for the first time, but it was before 1423.

40|$|Background: While several socio-demographic {{predictors}} of disability pension have been identified, less {{is known about}} the importance of the medical aspects. The aim of this study was to explore the importance of diagnoses, prognoses, level of care and previous sickness absence as predictors for future disability pension status among long-term sickness absentees. Methods: A representative sample of Norwegian long-term sickness absentees, 2043 women and 1585 men, with detailed diagnostic information (based on International Classification of Primary Care), was followed up for 5 years. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> of disability pension was obtained from the Norwegian disability register and was used as the dependent variable in Cox multivariate regression. Results: Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 5 -year risk of disability pension (1 - survival) were 22. 9 % for the full sample, 22. 5 % for men and 23. 3 % for the women. Men on sick leave for mental health disorders had an increased disability risk. For women a diagnosis of a cardiovascular disorder implied a slightly increased risk, while a pregnancy-related sickness absence carried almost no risk for disability pension during follow-up. Among cases with musculoskeletal disorders (54. 5 % of the sample), subgroups with significantly different disability risks were identified, with a gender-specific pattern. The prognoses formulated by the certifying doctor significantly predicted the outcome. Previous sickness absence days increased the disability risk, but were significant only for total absence above 20 weeks in the 4 years preceding inclusion. The level of care at the eight-week sickness certification did not affect the disability risk. Conclusion: Medical factors were important in identifying cases with an increased risk of disability pension...|$|E

40|$|The "intrinsic value" {{approach}} amortizes {{over the}} life of the option, the difference between the stock price on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grant</b> and the exercise price of the option.

50|$|Until a {{decision}} of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO of 1994, namely G 9/93 (reverting earlier {{decision of the}} same instance of 1985, namely G 1/84), {{it was possible for}} the proprietor of a European patent to oppose its own patent with the aim of centrally limiting it. Decision G 9/93 however deprived patent proprietors of this opportunity. This means that, after G 9/93, the only possibility for the proprietor of a European patent to voluntarily limit the scope conferred by its patent (e.g. for instance to strengthen the patent in view of some newly discovered prior art documents and/or in advance of envisaged litigation) was to request such limitation at the national level, i.e. before the national patent offices or competent courts of the Contracting States, if permitted. The EPC of 1973 made no provision for a limitation procedure, and a fortiori no provision for centrally limiting a European patent before the EPO after the nine-month period for filing an opposition (nine months as from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> the European patent).|$|R

40|$|Various {{theoretical}} models show that managerial compensation schemes {{can reduce the}} distortionary effects of financial leverage. There is mixed evidence as to whether highly levered firms offer less stock-based compensation, a common prediction of such models. Both the theoretical and empirical research, however, have overlooked the leverage provided by executive stock options. In principle, adjusting the exercise prices of executive stock options can mitigate the risk incentive effects of financial leverage. We show that the near-universal practice of setting option exercise prices near the prevailing stock price at the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant</b> effectively undoes most {{of the effects of}} financial leverage. In a large cross-sectional sample of Canadian option-granting firms, we find evidence that executives' incentives to take equity risk are negatively rather than positively related to the leverage of their employers.

50|$|The {{tax benefit}} {{is that on}} {{exercise}} the individual {{does not have to}} pay ordinary income tax (nor employment taxes) on the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares issued (however, the holder may have to pay U.S. alternative minimum tax instead). Instead, if the shares are held for 1 year from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> exercise and 2 years from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant,</b> then the profit (if any) made on sale of the shares is taxed as long-term capital gain. Long-term capital gain is taxed in the U.S. at lower rates than ordinary income. Although ISOs have more favorable tax treatment than non-ISOs (a.k.a. non-statutory stock option (NSO) or non-qualified stock option (NQO or NQSO)), they also require the holder to take on more risk by having to hold onto the stock {{for a longer period of}} time if the holder is to receive optimal tax treatment. However, even if the holder disposes of the stock within a year, it is possible that there will still be marginal tax deferral value (as compared to NQOs) if the holding period, though less than a year, straddles the ending of the taxpayer's taxable reporting period.|$|R
50|$|Longwood is {{recorded}} as a {{possession of the}} Hospital of Crutched Friars of St. John the Baptist, at Newtown Trim, at {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries in 1540. The jurors recorded that at Longwood alias Modarvy there was a castle, six houses, 40 acres arable, 60 acres pasture, moor and underwood, valued at 40 shillings sterling. In 1611-1612 James I granted to Christopher Plunkett, knight, a castle, six houses, 40 acres arable land, 60 acres pasture, bog and underwood in Longwood, otherwise called Mordervie or Moydervy. This grant is remarkably consistent with the description of Longwood some seventy years earlier. As important for the development of Longwood is the fact that James 1st also granted a fair by patent in 1611. Only the fairs at Athboy, Duleek, Ballyboggan, Kells, Navan, Trim and Ratoath are older, some eighteen in Meath are later in <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant.</b> The Down Survey barony map of Moyfenrath outlines the townland of Longwood but does not depict any buildings or features. The Civil Survey, however, mentions a castle, a mill and a weir, and that Longwood is in the possession of Nicholas Plunkett, a Catholic, and presumably a descendant of Christopher Plunkett mentioned above.|$|R
