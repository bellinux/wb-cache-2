5|$|Writer Ron Hauge {{said he got}} {{the idea}} for the episode one day when he was heading to work. He was {{listening}} to the radio and heard of an orphanage getting ripped off, and they were getting back more than they gave.

5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E
5|$|In Granny's Cafe, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) throws darts at {{a picture}} of a deer very accurately. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrives but leaves {{immediately}} because she has not forgiven him for hiding his relationship with Regina (Lana Parrilla). Emma attempts to avoid conversation, but Graham is insistent on explaining to her he feels nothing for Regina. He kisses Emma and suddenly sees a vision of a wolf, only to have Emma push him away. Frustrated by Emma's lack of understanding, Graham later sleeps with Regina. During the night, he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf. When Graham tells Regina that the dream felt like a memory, Regina tries to convince him to stay, but Graham leaves. As Graham attempts to get to his car, the wolf from his visions appears next to him, startling him before it leaves. As he tries to find the wolf in the woods, he runs into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Graham tells him about the wolf, and Mr. Gold suggests to him that <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> memories from another life.|$|E

2500|$|Lucid <b>dreaming</b> <b>is</b> the {{conscious}} perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have {{some degree of}} {{control over their own}} actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. <b>Dream</b> control has <b>been</b> reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> not necessary for a dream to qualify as [...] "lucid" [...] — a lucid <b>dream</b> <b>is</b> any <b>dream</b> during which the dreamer knows they <b>are</b> <b>dreaming.</b> The occurrence of lucid <b>dreaming</b> has <b>been</b> scientifically verified.|$|R

Jacqui violates her prison tag after staying at Tony's house overnight so she is sent back to prison. Sadly, Tony is forced to dump her because he cannot handle the pressure.

25|$|<b>Dreams</b> <b>are</b> {{successions}} of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations {{that occur}} involuntarily {{in the mind}} during certain stages of sleep (mainly the REM stage).

50|$|There {{were two}} types of dreams {{associated}} with medicine: prophetic and diagnostic. Prophetic <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> divine in origin and foretold good or bad tidings for the future. Diagnostic <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> {{a result of the}} soul telling what afflicted the body. If the <b>dreams</b> <b>were</b> of normal everyday events, their body was healthy and in equilibrium. The farther from the norm, and the more chaotic the <b>dreams</b> <b>were,</b> the more ill the patient was. The treatments that were recommended addressed what the dreams showed, and attempted to set the body right through consumption of food that carried the correct humor characteristics.|$|R

25|$|For some people, sensations {{from the}} {{previous}} night's <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> sometimes spontaneously experienced in falling asleep. However they are usually too slight and fleeting to allow dream recall. At least 95% of all <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> not remembered. Certain brain chemicals necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term ones are suppressed during REM sleep. Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, {{the content of the}} dream is not remembered. Recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall. Using technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electromyography (EMG), researchers have been able to record basic dream imagery, dream speech activity and dream motor behavior (such as walking and hand movements).|$|E
25|$|People have {{proposed}} many hypotheses about {{the functions of}} dreaming. Sigmund Freud postulated that <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> the symbolic expression of frustrated desires that have been relegated to the unconscious mind, and he used dream interpretation {{in the form of}} psychoanalysis in attempting to uncover these desires.|$|E

25|$|Dreams occur mainly {{during the}} rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep and are composed of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations. Although more {{research needs to be}} done on this subject, <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> said to be linked to the unconscious mind. Thought suppression has an influence on {{the subject matter of the}} unconscious mind and by trying to restrain particular thoughts, there is a high chance of them showing up in one's dreams.|$|E
25|$|John Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley {{propose that}} <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> {{caused by the}} random firing of neurons in the {{cerebral}} cortex during the REM period. Neatly, this theory helps explain the irrationality of the mind during REM periods, as, according to this theory, the forebrain then creates a story {{in an attempt to}} reconcile and make sense of the nonsensical sensory information presented to it. This would explain the odd nature of many dreams.|$|E

25|$|One {{component}} of Aristotle's theory of dreams introduces {{ideas that are}} contradictory to previously held beliefs. He claimed that <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> not foretelling {{and that they are}} not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations. These ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular modern plays dealing with Elvis {{impersonation}} is Lee Hall's Cooking with Elvis (1999). The comedy centers on the family life of Dad, an Elvis impersonator who was paralyzed in a car crash and is forced {{to spend the rest of}} his life in a wheel chair. Climaxes of the play are surreal fantasy scenes in which Dad's hallucinatory Elvis <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> bursting into popular Presley songs as a reminiscence of his one-time persona of Elvis impersonator.|$|E
25|$|Robert (1886), a {{physician}} from Hamburg, {{was the first}} who suggested that <b>dreams</b> <b>are</b> a need {{and that they have}} the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully developed during the day. By the dream work, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or deepened and included into memory. Robert's ideas were cited repeatedly by Freud in his Die Traumdeutung. Hughlings Jackson (1911) viewed that sleep serves to sweep away unnecessary memories and connections from the day.|$|E
