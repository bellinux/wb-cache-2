500|$|Since {{allowing}} the {{trustee of the}} will to retain the property {{is at the heart}} of the [...] "fraud", it is not clear why courts have considered the appropriate remedy to recognise a trust on behalf of others, rather than a resulting trust in favour of the estate (the residuary legatee). To this it has been argued that, since the testator is dead, a resulting trust is often reversing the beneficiary's claims since the testator cannot make any attempt to revoke or undo the trust terms. Save in case of a will and except the plain reading of clauses within the will, having admitted external evidence as operating under the proper introduction of the doctrine of <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> <b>reference,</b> a conclusive claim that it is necessary to observe further the formality requirement cannot be disregarded, because Will Act clearly set out the requirements of property transfer in case of failure has to be based on result trust that a party ultimately intended.

5000|$|In {{administrative}} law, <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> is a drafting {{tool that}} enables {{federal agencies to}} give legal effect to materials that are already published elsewhere. This is allowed under a provision of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(1). Section 552(a) requires agencies to publish regulations in the Federal Register in order to enforce them. Section 552(a)(1) provides that if material published elsewhere is [...] "reasonably available to the class of persons affected" [...] and the Director of the Federal Register approves its <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> <b>reference,</b> that material will be [...] "deemed published" [...] in the Federal Register. It is most controversially used to incorporate privately authored voluntary consensus standards into health and safety regulations without infringing the standards developers' copyright. Federal law and policy, embodied in the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119, requires federal agencies to use these standards instead of creating [...] "government-unique" [...] technical standards purely to serve regulatory purposes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTranscription of {{endogenous}} {{genes in}} preimplantation 1 - and 2 -cell mouse embryos was determined <b>by</b> monitoring the <b>incorporation</b> of BrUTP <b>by</b> plasma membrane-permeabilized embryos. Incorporation is observed starting by mid-S {{phase in the}} 1 -cell embryo and increases progressively; the amount of <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> the 1 -cell embryo in G 2 is about 20 % that of the 2 -cell embryo in G 2. <b>Incorporation</b> <b>by</b> the male pronucleus is always about {{four to five times}} greater than that of the female pronucleus. Nevertheless, the amount of <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> the female pronucleus present in parthogenetically activated eggs is similar to the total amount of incorporation in inseminated eggs, i. e., the transcriptional capacity of the female pronucleus is not inherently less than that of the male pronucleus. Inhibiting the first round of DNA replication does not prevent the initiation of transcription in the 1 -cell embryo, but does inhibit the extent of BrUTP <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> 35 %. The transcriptional machinery of the 1 -cell embryo appears to be rate-limiting, since the total amount of BrUTP <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> parthenogenetically activated and dispermic eggs is similar to that in monospermic eggs; trispermic eggs incorporate BrUTP to only about 60 % the level of monospermic eggs. A transcriptionally repressive state may start to develop in the 2 -cell embryo, since inhibiting the second round of DNA replication results in an 50 % increase in BrUTP incorporation.

5000|$|The {{court held}} further that the President could, {{on the facts}} of the present case, have {{lawfully}} withdrawn the first proclamation once he realised his mistake, as long as he did so in unambiguous terms, and before July 31. That was not, however, what had happened: The President had issued the second proclamation in which he purported to [...] "amend" [...] the invalid first proclamation. The President did not have the power to amend a nullity. Moreover, the second proclamation did not withdraw the first proclamation; nor, on the face of it, could the legal position with regard to the Amendment Act be determined. No commencement date was {{to be found in the}} text of the second proclamation. One had to rely on the doctrine of <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> and consider the text of the void first proclamation to give the second proclamation meaning. The second proclamation was thus unclear, inconsistent with the rule of law and invalid.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, however, {{a number}} of jurisdictions have {{recognized}} the validity of a pour-over will. In the jurisdictions in the U.S. which allow a pour-over will, testators do not usually put all of their assets into trusts for the reasons of liquidity, convenience, or simply {{because they did not}} get around to do so before they died. A pour-over clause in a will gives probate property to a trustee of the testator's separate trust and must be validated either under <b>incorporation</b> <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> by identifying the previously existing trust which the property will be poured into, or under the doctrine of acts of independent significance by referring to some act that has significance apart from disposing of probate assets, namely, the revocable living trust (inter vivos trust). The testator's property is subject to probate until such time as the pour-over clause is applied, and the estate assets [...] "pour" [...] into the trust. The trust instrument must be either in existence at the time when the will with the pour-over clause is executed, or executed concurrently with the will to be a valid pour-over gift. However, the trust need not be funded inter vivos. The pour-over clause protects property not previously placed in a trust by pouring it into the previously established trust through the vehicle of the will.|$|E
