25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> speaker on the left, the second sound <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E
25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corner {{to the front}} of the net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E

The group discover Sophie in the boot and try and work out what to do with her. Summer suggests that Chris takes her home, while Ed offers to call a taxi and go back with her. Andrew, desperate not to miss the concert, asks Chris to take her in the car, despite knowing that there is not a spare seatbelt. Chris reluctantly agrees and Sophie sits on Summer's lap. Summer asks what time The Jezabels are on stage and Andrew mentions that he wrote it down on his ticket, which is in his wallet inside Summer's bag. As Summer searches for the ticket, she finds the two cheques inside and asks Andrew about them. He tries to get his wallet back, but Summer discovers the cheques are worth $25,000 and Natasha realises he has sold the app.|$|E

Funding <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The study will take approximately a year to complete {{and is expected to}} be completed and released in Fall 2017. The study will look at having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the study will look at the environmental, community and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this study will also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center is supposed to be. The new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This study will not include construction and budget plans as this is just phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second study will put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.|$|E
500|$|Only {{vertebrate}} {{animals have}} ears, though many invertebrates detect sound using {{other kinds of}} sense organs. In insects, tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds. They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family. The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals. The female cricket fly Ormia ochracea has tympanal organs {{on each side of}} her abdomen. They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums, but, because they are linked, they provide acute directional information. The fly uses her [...] "ears" [...] to detect the call of her host, a male cricket. Depending on where the song of the cricket <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from,</b> <b>the</b> fly's hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies. This difference may be as little as 50billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.|$|E

2500|$|In piano technology, swaging {{happens in}} several areas: key leads, underlever leads, and bass strings. Key leads which, in the piano's {{earliest}} history, were actually made using lead, are soft, round chunks that are inserted into holes drilled {{into the side}} of piano keys as a means of balancing actions. Key leads vary in size, generally small, medium, and large. Basically, key leads help to make a keyboard's touch light enough to play. Over time, due to fluctuations in humidity and as the wood ages in piano key-sticks and underlevers, space develops around leads causing them to rattle, tick, or knock. Loose leads in underlevers tend to be the most annoying to pianists because it's difficult to pinpoint where the noise (often a [...] "tick" [...] sound) <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from.</b> <b>The</b> remedy for the noise is swaging—squashing the leads with a short steel rod. Swaging the lead fills the void and eliminates the noise.|$|E

2500|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) {{perceives}} pain from the heart as coming from the somatic portion of the body supplied by the thoracic spinal cord segments 1-4(5).

The pain can radiate to {{the left side of the}} jaw and into the left arm. Myocardial infarction can rarely present as referred pain and this usually occurs in people with [...] diabetes or older age. Also, the dermatomes of this region of the body wall and upper limb have their neuronal cell bodies in the same dorsal root ganglia (T1-5) and synapse in the same second order neurons in the spinal cord segments (T1-5) as the general visceral sensory fibers from the heart. The CNS does not clearly discern whether the pain <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> body wall or from the viscera, but it perceives the pain as coming from somewhere on the body wall, i.e. substernal pain, left arm/hand pain, jaw pain.|$|E

2500|$|Formerly 52. The Brown Line {{ran from}} South Hills Junction low {{platform}} (except {{the first and}} last trips of each rush, which serve the high platform) over Mount Washington and across the Monongahela River to downtown Pittsburgh, terminating at Wood Street.

The line supplements the 46K bus, running 4 times each during the morning rush and 3 times during the evening rush. A throwback to the days of the streetcars, the 52 does not feature stations or street-level boarding stops (which are generally designed like bus shelters in the suburbs, or are concrete island platforms in Beechview) but instead allows for boarding and unloading at designated 46K bus stops. Two inbound and two outbound trips (the first one in and the last one out of each rush) serve South Hills Village via the Blue Line.

2500|$|Unless a horse has severe EIPH, {{with blood}} {{present at the}} {{nostrils}} (known as epistaxis), the main sign is usually poor athletic performance; other signs are generally subtle and not easy to detect. Frequent swallowing and coughing in the immediate post-exercise recovery period, and poor appetite post-performance may be suggestive of EIPH. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by endoscopic examination of the trachea. In the case where no blood is visible in the trachea, EIPH in the small airways may still be present and can be confirmed by a bronchoalveolar lavage. [...] Impaired arterial blood gas (oxygen) tensions during intense exercise, increased blood lactate, and rarely death have been noted (likely due to ruptured chordae tendinae or a different mechanism of lung hemorrhage). Epistaxis is diagnosed when blood is visible at either or both nostrils during or following exercise. [...] To confirm whether the blood <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper or lower airway requires further examination by endoscopy, although {{in some cases it}} is not possible to determine the location. [...] In the majority of epistaxis cases, the blood originates from the lung.
