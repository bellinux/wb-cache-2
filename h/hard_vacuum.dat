5|$|Outer space, or just space, is {{the expanse}} {{that exists between}} {{celestial}} bodies, including Earth. Outer space is not completely empty, but consists of a <b>hard</b> <b>vacuum</b> containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7kelvins (K) (−270.45°C; −454.81°F). Plasma with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins {{in the space between}} galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars and galaxies. Observations indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Other observations indicate {{that the majority of the}} mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.|$|E

500|$|At the time, {{the game}} was known as Blam!, but Bungie had always {{expected}} to replace the working title with something better (Blam! was only used after studio co-founder Jason Jones could {{not bring himself to}} tell his mother their next project was dubbed Monkey Nuts.) Titles such as The Crystal Palace, <b>Hard</b> <b>Vacuum,</b> Star Maker, Star Shield, and The Santa Machine were suggested. Russel suggested calling it Project: Halo because of the ring. Despite concerns that the title seemed too religious or lacked action, the name stuck. In turn, [...] "Halo" [...] became the ring's name as well.|$|E

50|$|CELs {{are only}} seen in gases {{at very low}} densities (typically less than a few {{thousand}} particles per cm³) for forbidden transitions. For allowed transitions, the gas density can be substantially higher. At higher densities, the reverse process of collisional de-excitation suppresses the lines. Even the <b>hardest</b> <b>vacuum</b> produced on earth is still too dense for CELs to be observed. For this reason, when CELs were first observed by William Huggins in the spectrum of the Cat's Eye Nebula, {{he did not know}} what they were, and attributed them to a hypothetical new element called nebulium. However, the lines he observed were later found to be emitted by extremely rarefied oxygen.|$|R
5000|$|Ira Sprague Bowen {{was working}} on UV {{spectroscopy}} and on the calculation of spectra of the light elements of the periodic table when {{he became aware of}} the green lines discovered by Huggins. With this knowledge he was able to suggest that the green lines might be forbidden transitions. They were shown as due to doubly ionized oxygen at extremely low density, rather than the hypothetical nebulium. As Henry Norris Russell put it, [...] "Nebulium has vanished into thin air." [...] Nebulae are typically extremely rarefied, much less dense than the <b>hardest</b> <b>vacuums</b> produced on Earth. In these conditions, lines can form which are suppressed at normal densities. These lines are known as forbidden lines, and are the strongest lines in most nebular spectra.|$|R

Types such as the voltage-regulator tube and thyratron resemble <b>hard</b> <b>vacuum</b> tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still {{be referred to as}} [...] "electron tubes" [...] as they do perform electronic functions.

The suit probably did not reach a <b>hard</b> <b>vacuum,</b> and we began repressurizing the chamber within 15 seconds.

2500|$|A tachyon with an {{electric}} charge would lose energy as Cherenkov radiation—just as ordinary charged particles do when they exceed the local speed of light in a medium (other than a <b>hard</b> <b>vacuum).</b> A charged tachyon traveling in a vacuum, therefore, undergoes a constant proper time acceleration and, by necessity, its worldline forms a hyperbola in space-time. However reducing a tachyon's energy increases its speed, so that the single hyperbola formed is of two oppositely charged tachyons with opposite momenta (same magnitude, opposite sign) which annihilate each other when they simultaneously reach infinite speed {{at the same place}} in space. (At infinite speed, the two tachyons have no energy each and finite momentum of opposite direction, so no conservation laws are violated in their mutual annihilation. The time of annihilation is frame dependent.) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} producing and using atomically neutral heavy ion beams produced from negative ions as drivers for an inertial confinement fusion reactor. Bromine and iodine {{appear to be the}} most attractive elements for the driver beams. Fluorine and chlorine appear to be the most appropriate feedstocks for initial tests of extractable negative ion current densities. With regards to ion sources, photodetachment neutralizers, and vacuum requirements for accelerators and beam transport, this approach appears feasible within existing technology, and the vacuum requirements are essentially identical to those for positive ion drivers except in the target chamber. The principal constraint is that this approach requires <b>harder</b> <b>vacuums</b> in the target chamber than do space-charge-neutralized positive ion drivers. With realistic (but perhaps pessimistic) estimates of the total ionization cross section, limiting the ionization of a neutral beam to less than 5 % while traversing a four -meter path would require a chamber pressure of no more than 5 x 10 {sup - 5 } torr. Alternatively, even at chamber pressures that are too high to allow propagation of atomically neutral beams, the negative ion approach may still have appeal, since it precludes the possibly serious problem of electron contamination of a positive ion beam during acceleration, drift compression, and focusing...|$|R
2500|$|For SEM, a {{specimen}} is normally {{required to be}} completely dry, since the specimen chamber is at high <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Hard,</b> dry materials such as wood, bone, feathers, dried insects, or shells (including egg shells) can be examined with little further treatment, but living cells and tissues and whole, soft-bodied organisms require chemical fixation to preserve and stabilize their structure.|$|R

A small vacuum chamber is needed for de-airing (eliminating air bubbles) for materials prior to their setting. The process is fairly straightforward.

In this paper, we first calculate the primary radiation distribution by employing electromagnetic theory.

This loss is cumulative and could result in the black hole's disappearance over time. The time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole (the equations indicate that the smaller the black hole, the more rapidly it evaporates) but could be on the order of 10100 years for large solar-mass black holes.|$|R

30|$|Comparative {{advantage}} {{has shifted}} significantly in these countries. Mexico has some unique advantages: {{it is the}} only developing country that borders the United States, plus {{it is part of the}} long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement. And yet, manufactures that had been produced and/or assembled in Mexico ten years ago – including telephones, PC monitors, transistors, <b>vacuums,</b> <b>hard</b> discs, and many others - are not made there any longer: most have moved to China (Carrillo, 2010). Mexican firms are succeeding with new products – avocados, for example. For its part, Brazil has faced the rise and fall of its furniture industry. Nowadays, Brazilian firms are succeeding with different new products: among them, jet aircraft, soybeans, and pork (Sabel et al., 2012). South Africa has become a major exporter of fruits and vegetables during the northern hemisphere’s winter season. The point is that comparative advantage changes, and for middle-income countries to succeed (and low-income countries too), they need to be prepared to change along with it.|$|R
40|$|Particle Accelerators require {{high voltage}} and often high power. Typically the high voltage/power {{generation}} utilizes a topology {{with an extra}} energy store and a switching means to extract that stored energy. The switches may be active or passive devices.
