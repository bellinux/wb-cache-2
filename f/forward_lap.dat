40|$|Abstract- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems offered many {{advantages}} in several mapping {{applications such as}} slope mapping, geohazard studies, etc. This study utilizes UAV system for large scale stream mapping by using digital camera attached to the UAV. The digital camera combined with the UAV form a data acquisition system. This study only concentrates on one type of rotor wing UAV. It is becaue rotor wing units are stable and able to capture images easily. Aerial photograph were acquired {{in the form of}} strips which followed the procedure of acquiring aerial photograph where the 60 % <b>forward</b> <b>lap</b> and 30 % sidelap. Secondary data of ground control points and check points established using Total Station technique was used. The digital camera was calibrated using close range photogrammetric software and the recovered camera calibration parameters were then used in the processing of digital images. All the aerial photographs were processed using digital photogrammetric software and the output in the form of orthophoto was produced. The research output is then evaluated for planimetry and vertical accuracy using root mean square error (RMSE). Based on the analysis, sub-meter accuracy is obtained. As conclusion, rotor wing UAV system has potential use for large scale stream mapping or other diversified applications especially for small area which has limited time and less man power.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lately {{the use of}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for {{remote sensing}} has {{attracted}} attention from researchers. This {{can be attributed to}} its low cost and feasibility to automate flight commands along a set of waypoints. Moreover, UAVs has shown promise lately {{in a number of areas}} including monitoring vegetation and soil health, agriculture, forestry and land use. However, little is being done related to coastal management or aquatic monitoring. Most of the remote sensing researches attributed to coastal monitoring and management are usually satellite based or Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). UAVs can fly in place of piloted aircraft to gather remote sensing information on coastal area characteristics from mangroves to seagrass to corals. The type of sensors flown depends on the instrument’s weight limitation, so that, depending on the specification of the UAV, it is possible to acquire video, aerial photographs, multispectral and hyperspectral radiometric, LiDAR, and radar data etc. This study utilizes UAV with a small digital camera for medium scale coastal mapping. The first objective of this study is to investigate the use of lightweight first person view (FPV) raptor UAV for mapped image of coastal body with limited ground control points for generating orthophoto mosaic of the coastal area. Aerial photographs were acquired at an estimated of 60 % <b>forward</b> <b>lap</b> and 40 % side lap specifications. The second objective is to determine the accuracy of the photogrammetric output. It is expected that this survey will provide guidelines for future remote sensing project using low cost digital aerial images. Also the results from this study will serve as an input for further analysis to identify submerged aquatic vegetation like seagrass...|$|E
40|$|Photogrammetry is the {{earliest}} technique {{used to collect}} data for topographic mapping. The recent development in aerial photogrammetry is the used of large format digital aerial camera for producing topographic map. The aerial photograph {{can be in the}} form of metric or non-metric imagery. The cost of mapping using aerial photogrammetry is very expensive. In certain application, {{there is a need to}} map small area with limited budget. Due to the development of technology, small format aerial photogrammetry technology has been introduced and offers many advantages. Currently, digital map can be extracted from digital aerial imagery of small format camera mounted on light weight platform such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This study utilizes UAV system for large scale stream mapping. The first objective of this study is to investigate the use of light weight rotary-wing UAV for stream mapping based on different flying height. Aerial photograph were acquired at 60 % <b>forward</b> <b>lap</b> and 30 % sidelap specifications. Ground control points and check points were established using Total Station technique. The digital camera attached to the UAV was calibrated and the recovered camera calibration parameters were then used in the digital images processing. The second objective is to determine the accuracy of the photogrammetric output. In this study, the photogrammetric output such as stereomodel in three dimensional (3 D), contour lines, digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto were produced from a small stream of 200 m long and 10 m width. The research output is evaluated for planimetry and vertical accuracy using root mean square error (RMSE). Based on the finding, sub-meter accuracy is achieved and the RMSE value decreases as the flying height increases. The difference is relatively small. Finally, this study shows that UAV is very useful platform for obtaining aerial photograph and subsequently used for photogrammetric mapping and other applications...|$|E

40|$|Addressing {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} variability of crops for agricultural management requires intensive and periodical information gathering from the crop fields. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry is a quick and affordable method for information collecting; it provides spectral and spatial information when required with the added value of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) that reconstruct the crop structure in 3 D using “structure from motion” techniques. In the full process from UAV flights to image analysis, DSM generation is one bottle-neck due to its high processing time. Despite its importance, the optimization of the required forward overlap for saving time in DSM generation {{has not yet been}} studied. UAV images were acquired at 50 and 100 m flight altitudes over two olive orchards with the aim of generating DSMs representing the tree crowns. Several DSMs created with different forward laps (in intervals of 5 – 6 % from 58 to 97 %) were evaluated {{in order to determine the}} optimal generation time according to the accuracy of tree crown measurements computed from each DSM. Based on our results, flying at 100 m altitude and with a 95 % <b>forward</b> <b>lap</b> reported the best configuration. From the analysis derived from this configuration, tree volume was estimated with 95 % accuracy. In addition, computing time was 85 % lower in comparison to the maximum overlap studied (97 %). It allowed computing the 3 D features of 600 trees in a 3 -ha parcel in a highly accurate and quick (a few hours after the UAV flights) manner by using a standard computer.

40|$|Final, April 2011 ‐May 2012 In a {{previous}} study, a computational model of child occupants 6 to 10 years old (YO) was validated {{using data from}} a sled test series with the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid‐III ATDs. Simulations using this model were used to identify characteristics of a vehicle seat and belt geometry that would improve occupant protection for older children not using booster seats. The current report presents a series of sled tests {{to examine the effects}} for other occupants using vehicle seats optimized for 6 ‐ to 10 ‐year‐old children. Tests were conducted with a 12 MO CRABI seated in a Graco SnugRide rear‐facing infant restraint and a Hybrid III 50 th male ATD. Seat cushion length was set to 450 mm, 400 mm, and 350 mm. Lap belt conditions included one representing the mid‐range of FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly anchorages,” allowable seat belt anchorage conditions as well as one more forward but closer to the vehicle seat H‐point. Shoulder belt conditions included the standard FMVSS No. 213 shoulder belt anchorage as well as one positioned closer to the adult male shoulder. Vehicle seats from a 2008 Dodge Town and Country were used, and some tests included modifications to make the front support structure of the seat cushion stiffer. The tests with the midsize adult male ATD showed no negative consequences from design changes intended to improve protection for children. Kinematics were similar among all conditions tested. For the rear‐facing infant restraint, none of the tests exceeded the 70 ° rotation angle requirement of FMVSS No. 213, although shorter cushion length and more forward belt locations produced larger rotations. The three tests with the more <b>forward</b> <b>lap</b> belt geometry slightly exceeded the 3 ‐ms‐chest clip acceleration limit of 60 g, but a review of all chest acceleration curves suggests that the vehicle seat may produce higher chest accelerations than the FMVSS No. 213 test bench. In tests with the shortest seat cushion length, the infant seat showed acceptable kinematics even though less than 80 percent of the child restraint base was initially supported on the vehicle seat. These preliminary tests with rear vehicle seat configurations selected to optimize protection for older child occupants produced good restraint kinematics for infants in a rear‐facing only child restraint and for adult mid‐size males. Additional research to identify possible negative consequences for other types of child restraints should be conducted. If shorter cushion lengths are chosen as a safety countermeasure for older children, the current child restraint installation requirement to have at least 80 percent of the base contacting the vehicle seat will need to be addressed...|$|E
50|$|Racing resumed with Chilton in control, but Castroneves {{began to}} duel with Jones for second. Behind them, Sato moved to fourth after passing Davison.

She was entirely open, a long, narrow, bird-headed thing, and the foam she flung off <b>forward</b> seemed to <b>lap</b> over her after-half. A little drenched spritsail was spread from an insignificant mast, and four crouching figures with dusky faces were partly visible amidst the wisps of spray that whirled about her. One of them held a long paddle, and looked fixedly ahead; the others gazed at the Sorata expressionlessly until the craft swooped down between two seas. Jimmy saw his companion's hands clench on the coaming, and the color ebb from her face, and then she gasped as the little strip of canvas swung into sight again.|$|R
50|$|The new Lotus 72 {{was a very}} {{innovative}} car, featuring {{torsion bar}} suspension, hip-mounted radiators, inboard front brakes and an overhanging rear wing. The 72 originally had suspension problems, and Jochen Rindt took a lucky victory in Monaco in the old 49 when Jack Brabham crashed on the last lap while leading. But when antidive and antisquat were designed out of the suspension, the car quickly showed its superiority, and Rindt dominated the championship until he was killed at Monza when a brake shaft broke. Rindt had only recently begun to wear a shoulder harness, but refused to wear crotch straps because he felt they slowed his exit from {{the car in the}} event of fire. When the car hit the barrier head-on, Rindt submarined <b>forward</b> and the <b>lap</b> belt inflicted fatal head and neck injuries.|$|R
