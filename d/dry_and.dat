40|$|Uniaxial {{compression}} test of cement asphalt (CA) mortar specimens, due to <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> wetting cycle of 0, 2, 4 and 8 times, {{is carried out}} by using the electronic universal test machine, with the strain rate ranging from 1 × 10 − 5 [*]s− 1 to 1 × 10 − 2 [*]s− 1. The effects of strain rate <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> wetting cycle time on the compressive strength, elasticity modulus, and stress-strain full curve are investigated. Experimental {{results show that the}} strain-stress full curve of CA mortar is affected obviously by strain rate <b>and</b> <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> wetting cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus increase with the strain rate under the same <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> wetting cycle time. The compressive strength and elasticity modulus decrease with the increase of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> wetting cycle time in the same strain rate. The lower the strain rate is, the greater the compressive strength and elasticity modulus of CA mortar decrease.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> ripeninig conditions (traditional and industrial) {{in the production}} of dry fermented sausage Petrovská klobása, on fatty-acid composition and oxidative changes in lipids, during 7 months of storage, was investigated. During the storage period, the sum of unsaturated fatty acids and the content of free fatty acids were significantly higher (p< 0. 05), while the content of malondialdehyde was significantly lower in the sausage subjected to traditional conditions of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> ripening. At the end of the storage period, contents of pentanal and hexanal in the sausage subjected to traditional conditions of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> ripening (4. 03 μg/g and 1. 67 μg/g, respectively) were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in comparison with these contents in the sausage subjected to industrial conditions of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> ripening.

30|$|Recently, the {{combined}} treatment of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> heat treatment using superheated steam (SHS) for green wood has been studied.

The combined treatment of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> heat treatment using SHS, which is called to “combined treatment”, for green wood is the method that <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> heat treatment are carried out simultaneously using SHS at a high temperature and high pressure. Park et al.

Because the combined treatment simultaneously carries out the two processes of <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> heat treatment in one reactor removed oxygen, it can decrease the time and energy required for the <b>drying</b> process <b>and</b> prevent fires.|$|R

40|$|Polyacrylamide (PAAm) -multi walled carbon {{nanotube}} (MWNT) composites were prepared by free radical cross-linking copolymerization in water. Ammonium persulfate and N,N'-methylenebis (acrylamide) (BIS) {{were used as}} a free radical initiator and a crosslinker, respectively. The <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> swelling processes of disc shaped PAAm-MWNT composites were monitored by the steady-state fluorescence technique at various temperatures. Disc shaped composite gels were prepared with pyranine (P) doped as a fluorescence probe. Scattered, I-sc, and emission light, I-em, intensities were monitored during <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> swelling of these gels. Since the decrease and increase in I-sc corresponds to the decrease and increase in turbidity of the <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> swelling hydrogel, respectively, the corrected fluorescence intensity, I was introduced to analyse the <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> swelling processes. The Stern-Volmer equation combined with moving boundary and Li-Tanaka models were used to explain the behavior of I during <b>drying</b> <b>and</b> swelling processes, respectively. Results indicated that the desorption coefficient, D-d decreased by increasing MWNT content, until 1 weight percentage of MWNT is reached and then increased above 1 wt% MWNT for a given temperature during drying.
