40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the impact of the Food Fun Program on participants. Specifically, this {{qualitative}} evaluation explored what program experiences children aged 8 - 12 integrated into their lives at home, as well as what inhibited and facilitated integration. The Food Fun Program aimed to teach children basic food preparation and cooking skills, food and kitchen safety, and basic nutrition in a fun,safe, and interactive manner. Food preparation and cooking, games, crafts, outside activities, food experiments, and field trips were the basis of daily activities in this one week summer day camp. Participant observation of the camps, focus groups with children, document review, and interviews with the Nutrition Resource and Volunteer Centre director and camp counselors were used to gain an understanding of the program, to establish rapport with the interview participants, and to obtain information for subsequent interviews with parents and children. Qualitative interviews were the main source of data collection for exploring the research questions. Children and/or their parents were interviewed six weeks after children participated in the camp. Interviews were conducted with children and parents, individually, in their homes. Observations were recorded using field notes and were analyzed for key program activities. Interviews and focus groups were tape-recorded and interviews were transcribed verbatim. Parent and child interviews were separately analyzed for common themes and categories. The results indicate that children integrated camp recipes into their lives at home and that children were more confident, involved in different food related activities, more aware of nutrition, and more willing to try new foods after the camp. The results indicate that lack of time, involvement in other activities, and parents' restriction of food-related activities may have inhibited <b>integration</b> of <b>camp</b> experiences. The results also indicate that encouragement and help from parents and the hands-on nature of the Food Fun Program may have facilitated <b>integration</b> of <b>camp</b> experiences into life at home. The findings suggest that hands-on cooking experiences and parent involvement are important components of nutrition programs for children.

40|$|Opposing {{mitochondrial}} fission and fusion reactions {{determine the}} shape and interconnectivity of mitochondria. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp 1) is an ancient mechanoenzyme that uses GTP hydrolysis to power the constriction and division of mitochondria. Although Drp 1 -mediated mitochondrial fragmentation is recognized as an early event in the apoptotic programme, acute regulation of Drp 1 activity is poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial phosphorylation site that is conserved in all metazoan Drp 1 orthologues. Ser 656 is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and dephosphorylated by calcineurin, and its phosphorylation state is controlled by sympathetic tone, calcium levels and cell viability. Pseudophosphorylation of Drp 1 by mutation of Ser 656 to aspartic acid leads to the elongation of mitochondria and confers resistance to various pro-apoptotic insults. Conversely, the constitutively dephosphorylated Ser 656 Ala mutant Drp 1 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation and increases cell vulnerability. Thus, Drp 1 phosphorylation at Ser 656 provides a mechanism for the <b>integration</b> of <b>cAMP</b> and calcium signals in the control of mitochondrial shape, apoptosis {{and other aspects of}} mitochondrial function...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{program was}} {{intended}} as (1) a community-based inclusion program to promote physical, social and emotional development for children with special needs, (2) a training program for physical and occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, special educators and psychologists (3) an experiential learning opportunity for graduate students, (4) a venue for therapeutic outcomes research for children with developmental disabilities. Background. Children diagnosed with developmental disabilities constitute a growing population in need of specialized services. <b>Camp</b> <b>Integrations</b> was a collaborative, interdisciplinary effort among therapists, university faculty, students, and community partners to provide therapeutic services to children with developmental disabilities, within a typical summer camp environment. The program provided therapeutic interventions {{through a variety of}} age-appropriate physical and social activities (horseback riding, swimming, team sports, music and dancing). The providers (therapists and graduate students) received extensive training, and served as camp staff and research assistants. Methods. Outcomes research was performed during the 2007 and 2008 summer sessions. The research design was a concurrent mixed methods approach, converging quantitative and qualitative data. Data collection methods included parent questionnaires, focus group interviews, the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, and the Social Skills Rating Scale. Results.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the role of}} phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the <b>integration</b> of <b>cAMP</b> signals and protein kinase A (PKA) activity following beta-adrenergic stimulation, by carrying out real-time imaging of male mouse pyramidal cortical neurons expressing biosensors to monitor cAMP levels (Epac 1 -camps and Epac 2 -camps 300) or PKA activity (AKAR 2). In the soma, isoproterenol (ISO) increased the PKA signal to approximately half the maximal response obtained with forskolin, with a characteristic beta(1) pharmacology and an EC(50) of 4. 5 nm. This response was related to free cAMP levels in the submicromolar range. The specific type 4 PDE (PDE 4) inhibitor rolipram had a very small effect alone, but strongly potentiated the PKA response to ISO. Blockers of other PDEs had no effect. PDE 4 thus acts as a brake in the propagation of the beta(1) -adrenergic signal from the membrane to the bulk somatic cytosol. The results for a submembrane domain were markedly different, whether recorded with a PKA-sensitive potassium current related to the slow AHP or by two-photon imaging of small distal dendrites. The responses to ISO were stronger than in the bulk cytosol. This {{is consistent with the}} cAMP/PKA signal being strong at the membrane, as shown by electrophysiology, and favored in cellular domains with a high surface area to volume ratio, in which this signal was detected by imaging. Rolipram alone also produced a strong cAMP/PKA signal, revealing tonic cAMP production. PDE 4 thus appears as a crucial integrator with different physiological implications in different subcellular domains...|$|R

30|$|Although the {{recovery}} of camel husbandry is rather limited {{in terms of the}} numbers of refugees and camels involved, it is likely to continue into the future as refugees continue to break the chains of food dependency, as long as it can be sustained by rains, and as long as access to camels and to the liberated territories remain assured. The strategy that refugees pursue leads towards greater <b>integration</b> of refugee <b>camps</b> with wider economic and social networks, but this depends on the continued existence of the camps and of international aid. As long as this trend continues, there will be an increasing number of camels and greater integration between refugees and nomads (often within extended families), creating a single productive network between the refugee camps and the liberated territories. If the referendum for Sahrawi self-determination is eventually heldm and refugees move back to Western Sahara, some refugees might return to nomadism, merging with nomads on both side of the berm and using Western Sahara towns as commercial hubs. In this scenario, the Polisario Front might redistribute its camels to refugees, in a sort of concluding cycle in which the herds that the Polisario acquired from disbanding nomads {{at the beginning of the}} war and used to support refugees in the decades of exile, once again become the basis for a return to desert nomadic pastoralism.|$|R

40|$|In the {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} bachelor thesis I focus on explaining the notion of zootherapy. It is possible to encounter various kinds of animals, which are used for the therapies. It is not necessarily always animals, but also plants. Furthermore, I deal with the problematic of canistherapy. Canistherapy deals with the interaction between man and dog. History of this therapy {{can be traced back}} into the ancient times. In the Czech Republic, canistherapy started developing around the 90 ?s. There are many methods and ways of canistherapy, depending {{on the use of the}} dog, number of people, place and on the actual situation in which canistherapy is undertaken. In my theoretical part of this work I also try to explain notions, which have been included into physical handicap, and which have changed quite rapidly over the past few years. Just as the topic of canistherapy is up-to-date nowadays, such are the topics of integration and inclusion. These two are processes, which are trying to incorporate persons with disabilities into common situations in everyday life. In the practical part I focus on stating the aim and research issues. The aim of the work was to find out the possibilities of using canistherapy within the integration of children with disabilities. The research issues are for example, whether canistherapy has any influence on social behaviour of a group of children, in which the process of integration is under way. Further in this part I dedicate my attention to describing the process of research and its outcomes. For realisation of the research I chose methods of qualitative research. I performed the research on the Summer <b>Integration</b> Canistherapeutical <b>Camp</b> in 2011. According to the results of the research it is possible to say that canistherapy positively influences the proces of integration and helps towards a better incorporation of persons with disabilities and not only to those. It is also necessary to point out, that an adequate cooperation and information flow among all the members who take part in the integration process is essential. I believe that this work can be of use to some institutions, dealing with this problematic, and therefore help with spreading the possibilities of using canistherapy. It can also be used as a source of information for those interested in the issue...|$|R
40|$|International audienceType 10 A {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE 10 A) {{is highly}} {{expressed in the}} striatum, in striatonigral and striatopallidal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), which express D 1 and D 2 dopamine receptors, respectively. PDE 10 A inhibitors have pharmacological and behavioral effects suggesting an antipsychotic profile, but the cellular bases of these effects are unclear. We analyzed the effects of PDE 10 A inhibition in vivo by immunohistochemistry, and imaged cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and cGMP signals with biosensors in mouse brain slices. PDE 10 A inhibition in mouse striatal slices produced a steady-state increase in intracellular cAMP concentration in D 1 and D 2 MSNs, demonstrating that PDE 10 A regulates basal cAMP levels. Surprisingly, the PKA-dependent AKAR 3 phosphorylation signal was strong in D 2 MSNs, whereas D 1 MSNs remained unresponsive. This effect was also observed in adult mice in vivo since PDE 10 A inhibition increased phospho-histone H 3 immunoreactivity selectively in D 2 MSNs in the dorsomedial striatum. The PKA-dependent effects in D 2 MSNs were prevented in brain slices and in vivo by mutation of the PKA-regulated phosphorylation site of 32 kDa dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP- 32), which is required for protein phosphatase- 1 inhibition. These data highlight differences in the <b>integration</b> of the <b>cAMP</b> signal in D 1 and D 2 MSNs, resulting from stronger inhibition of protein phosphatase- 1 by DARPP- 32 in D 2 MSNs than in D 1 MSNs. This study shows that PDE 10 A inhibitors share with antipsychotic medications the property of activating preferentially PKA-dependent signaling in D 2 MSNs...|$|R
40|$|As cities {{evolve in}} size and complexity, their {{component}} systems become more interconnected. Comprehensive modeling and simulation is needed to capture interactions and correctly {{assess the impact of}} changes. This thesis presents a methodology for modeling cities from a systems of systems perspective. The framework supplies general modeling guidelines and key steps. Also addressed are the importance of stakeholder interactions, creating the model structure, using smart city sensor data, and applying the methodology to larger, traditional cities. As an initial step, four city modeling including CityNet, CityOne, Sim City 4, and SoSAT software programs were evaluated from both a user and mathematical perspective. From the assessments, a list was developed of features critical to successful city modeling software including visualization, a streamlined user interface, accurate mathematics, the ability to specify systems and attributes, and the ability to model interconnections between systems. SoSAT was selected as the modeling tool for the case study, which involved modeling the Army's Base <b>Camp</b> <b>Integration</b> Laboratory. A model of the camp's baseline configuration was built and the camp was simulated for 30 days with results recorded at one hour intervals. 100 trials were run with averaged results presented by time intervals and for the total simulation time. Results were presented at all levels of structural aggregation. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of maintenance personnel and the frequency of potable water deliveries. Adding or subtracting a maintenance person impacted the availability of the generator systems that were being serviced, in turn impacting the performance of the micro grid. Extending the time between deliveries by 24 and 48 hours revealed two systems experienced resource depletions. Lastly, two technology insertions cases were conducted {{to assess the impact of}} adding a laundry water reuse system (LWRS) and a solar powered hot water heater (SHWH). The LWRS provided 70 % of the laundry system's water needs, significantly reducing dependency upon deliveries. The SHWH was expected to decrease electricity consumption and increase fuel consumption. However, the reduction in energy demand meant fewer generators were needed to power the micro grid and both electricity and fuel consumption decreased. by Amanda M. Wachtel. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|BackgroundThe Intercultural Design Camp (ICDC) is a {{collaboration}} between the Schools of Creative Practice offour European higher education institutions: Linköping University, Sweden; The University of the Westof Scotland; Stuttgart Media University, Germany and Artevelde University College Ghent, Belgium. Emerging from {{the development of a}} joint post-graduate proposal, the ICDC project has grown. Pilotedin 2009 in Muensingen, Germany as a one-week summer school, the focus of the project wasintended to strengthen internalization between the students and staff of the partner Universities. Working to a given theme, and collaborative creative briefs, student participants developed andproduced multimedia solutions and artefacts [1]. This pilot was very successful and acted as a catalyst to staff and student Erasmus exchange and thesharing of best practice in Learning, Teaching and Assessment between the partners. A second selffunded‘pilot’ camp was planned and undertaken in Dumfries, Scotland in 2010. Discussions continuedregarding the extension of the ICDC project to become a two-week event in order to allow studentparticipants the time to develop and produce an extended piece of cross-media product [1]. The cost for realizing an extended concept would be high. An application for funding within the EULife-Long-Learning-Programme was successfully made. A third, this time EU funded Design Camptook place in Grebbestad (Sweden) in August 2011 [2]. Further EU funding allowed realizing a fourthICDC in Kemmel, Belgium, August 2012. Learning Teaching, Assessment and FeedbackThe content of the ICDC is designed to extend and further the student’s abilities and participation incontemporary methods and practices associated with creative media practice and convergentproduction. At the camp, and in response to given thematic briefs, an International group of studentswith divergent backgrounds and skill-sets, come together in small creative teams to develop andproduce a collaborative project in which a range of ideas, experience and technologies converge. These Collaborative Projects often have an on-line output, whether through products devised forstreaming, pod-casting or interactive broadcast. An innovative variety of projects are encouraged. These could include digital photography and the moving image, interactive design and performance,site-specific installations and exhibitions. Students are also encouraged to experience contemporary creative context within the areas ofpractice while at the camp. This is delivered via lectures given by the visiting and host staff. Studentsare also encouraged to evaluate the benefits of a variety of production approaches and techniques. The project addresses the interface between research and practice in creative media practice andencourages participants to gain solid experience of working in interdisciplinary creative teams.
