2500|$|In 1983, Rebecca Welles {{arranged}} {{to see her}} mother {{for the first time}} in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. [...] "Rita barely knows me now," [...] Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. [...] "When it was over, I came over to her table and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 28th May, 1719. I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
60|$|Then Charmion {{drew near}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> too, was weeping.|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. I think I know. The {{last time}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> lady, <b>she</b> did {{something}} I {{should not have}} thought possible.|$|R
60|$|Then I rose {{up in my}} {{rage and}} cursed her heavily, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> was not stopped this woman's tongue would bring us all to ruin.|$|R
60|$|Her manner was as strangely altered as her looks. <b>That</b> <b>she</b> {{was beside}} {{herself for the}} moment, <b>I</b> clearly <b>saw.</b> <b>That</b> <b>she</b> had {{answered}} me unreservedly, {{it was impossible to}} believe. I began to feel angry, when I ought to have made allowances for her.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{putting in a}} bit of the old drenched-irises stuff.|$|E
60|$|Then {{we turned}} to Foulata. The poor girl was stabbed in the body, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not live long.|$|E
60|$|Soon she came, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was rather}} pale and languid, {{owing to the}} heat, perhaps, but that {{otherwise}} she looked much as usual.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was {{a fashionable}} girl, from her using the French {{language}} in this way.|$|R
60|$|I {{had sought}} to lead her to what my aunt had hinted at; for, sharply painful to me as it must be to receive that confidence, I was to {{discipline}} my heart, and do my duty to her. <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was uneasy, and I let it pass.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked across}} the room curiously. There {{was not a single}} redeeming feature in the man's face except, perhaps, the {{suggestion}} of brute, passionate force which still lingered about his thick, straight lips and heavy jaw. The woman by his side seemed incomprehensible. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> now <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had eyes of turquoise blue and a complexion almost waxenlike. She lifted her arms, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> they, too, were covered with bracelets of light-blue stones. Louis, following my eyes, touched me on the arm.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{no longer}} could bear her falsehood, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> but played with me. And so I spoke that which was in my heart: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she only}} waited {{until we were}} again {{swimming}} side by side, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had drawn her long knife, and was holding it between her teeth.|$|E
60|$|At first I deemed {{this to be}} {{uncommon}} nonsense, but as I considered <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was probably}} right again, and I gazed crestfallen at this very clever woman.|$|E
60|$|Filippo {{turned to}} his sister, on whose pale face <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it written <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was as {{convinced}} as any there, and my feelings were those of a dastard who has broken faith {{with the man who}} trusted him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} we had come down again, and had at last sat quietly down, that I noticed Polly's face, and then <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not looking at all herself. She was very pale, and looked, I thought, anxious and flurried.|$|R
6000|$|You see I {{had told}} him nothing about Marion until about {{a week before the}} wedding; both he and my aunt had been taken {{altogether}} by surprise. They couldn't, as people say, [...] "make it out." [...] My aunt was intensely interested, much more than my uncle; it was then, I think, for the first time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> cared for me. She got me alone, I remember, after I had made my announcement. [...] "Now, George," [...] she said, [...] "tell me everything about her. Why didn't you tell--ME at least--before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> liked you, {{and because}} such a {{marriage}} {{would have been}} so suitable. She has all that you want. You know what they say of her now?" ...|$|E
60|$|In the library, one on {{each side}} of the table, under the lamp, Ezra Hutchins and his wife sat reading. Mrs. Hutchins looked up, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had divined.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head aside, and {{when she looked up}} again <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was weeping, really weeping this time, not just making her eyes swim, as she did before.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{turned and}} <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had {{deliberately}} slipped {{to the ground}} in the very path of the cruel demons who pursued us, thinking that by lightening the burden of my mount it might thus be enabled to bear me to the safety of the hills. Poor child! She should have known John Carter better than that.|$|R
60|$|D'you think I haven't got eyes in my head? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>that</b> day <b>she</b> came here. D'you {{suppose she}} came to see me? She despises me. I'm not a lady. She came here to please you. She was polite to me to please you. She {{asked me to go}} and see her to please you.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very strange," [...] {{she said}} with a sudden access of womanlike {{trembling}} and agitation which seemed out of place in this awful woman--"but once I knew a scarab like to that. It--hung round the neck--of one I loved," [...] and she gave a little sob, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> after all <b>she</b> was only a woman, although she might be a very old one.|$|R
60|$|However, {{the moment}} she came in, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had {{something}} very important to tell. Her bright face was quite pale with excitement, and her whole figure was in a nervous tremble.|$|E
60|$|She walked {{before me}} into the living-room of the chalet, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> gripped her riding-whip very tightly in her hand. She looked about her for a moment,--and then at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shut the}} book," [...] the {{minister}} said, [...] "when I {{came to the}} end of the chapter, and then <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was dead. It is my belief that her heart broke one-and-twenty years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did {{not know}} me in the least and thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had never seen me before, in short, that her mind had gone, exactly as Ayesha had {{said that it would}} do. By way of making {{conversation}} I asked her if she felt well. She replied, Oh, yes, she had never felt better, then added, ...|$|R
60|$|Presently the {{residence}} of the Archdeacon began to heave in sight. A chaise and four smoking horses stood by the steps, and made way for us on our approach; and even as we alighted there appeared from {{the interior of the}} house a tall ecclesiastic, and beside him a little, headstrong, ruddy man, in a towering passion, and brandishing over his head a roll of paper. At sight of him Miss Dorothy flung herself on her knees with the most moving adjurations, calling him father, assuring him she was wholly cured and entirely repentant of her disobedience, and entreating forgiveness; and <b>I</b> soon <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> need fear no great severity from Mr. Greensleeves, who showed himself extraordinarily fond, loud, greedy of caresses and prodigal of tears.|$|R
60|$|Shaking off my presentiments of evil, I {{entered the}} centre hut. Mr. Carson was {{resting on the}} sofa, and by him knelt Stella holding his hand, and her head resting on his breast. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been telling him of what had come about between us; nor was I sorry, for it is a task that a would-be {{son-in-law}} is generally glad to do by deputy.|$|R
60|$|I turned round quickly, for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was looking}} behind me. Standing on the {{threshold}} of his inner room was the tall, dark figure of Mr. Ravenor, handsomer than ever, it seemed to me, in his plain evening dress.|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had tricked me, {{and taken}} her watch at night. For I slept like a trooper after a day's forage. As to what I {{might have said}} in my dreams--that thought made me red as an apple.|$|E
60|$|On she tottered, her apparel hanging {{round her}} in red rags, a hundred wounds upon {{her face and}} form. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was dying, but life still flickered in her, and the fire of hate burned in her snaky eyes.|$|E
60|$|I {{resisted}} her offer, however, {{of treating}} {{us for the}} whole week; and I opposed it so long <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> evidently <b>that</b> <b>she</b> took it ill, and would have thought herself slighted {{if we had not}} accepted it. So I said no more, but let her go on, only told her I would be even with her; and so I was. However, for <b>that</b> week <b>she</b> treated us as she said she would, and did it so very fine, and with such a profusion of all sorts of good things, that the greatest burthen to her was how to dispose of things that were left; for she never let anything, how dainty or however large, be so much as seen twice among us.|$|R
40|$|Melissa was {{the most}} {{interesting}} person that I got the opportunity to meet. She is very religious, there were book cases, a piano top, and desktops full of bible books, song hymns, and Seven Day Adventist paraphernalia surround me. As Jan had told me <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> for myself <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was indeed a purist. She was very open about her life style the only thing <b>she</b> consumes <b>that</b> comes as an animal is eggs...|$|R
60|$|But this day, as I noted them pacing up and down, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> it was <b>she</b> who {{terminated}} the walk. They came up {{to where}} I {{was standing by the}} entrance to the companion-way. Though she betrayed it by no outward sign, I felt, somehow, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was greatly perturbed. She made some idle remark, looking at me, and laughed lightly enough; but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her eyes return to his, involuntarily, as though fascinated; then they fell, but not swiftly enough to veil the rush of terror that filled them.|$|R
