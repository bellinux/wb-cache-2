Three dimensional nonlinear analyses for a single pile and pile groups were carried out for a specific case and some case studies as well. Contrary to simplified conventional analysis in which the predictions are usually overestimated and could be considered as an upper limit, it was found that the dragload of a pile in a group depends on the surface load, the pile configuration, the pile position in a group, the ultimate skin friction and the interface stiffness. It has been demonstrated that for fixed-head <b>friction</b> <b>pile</b> groups the dragload group effect is significantly greater than in the case of free-head end-bearing pile groups.

40|$|Abstract—Nailed-slab System is a {{proposed}} alternative solution for rigid pavement problem on soft soils. Equivalent {{modulus of subgrade reaction}} (k’) {{can be used}} in designing of nailed-slab system. This modular is the cumulative of modulus of subgrade reaction from plate load test (k) and additional modulus of subgrade reaction due to pile installing (∆k). A recent method has used reduction of pile resistance approach in determining ∆k. The relative displacement between pile and soils, and reduction of pile resistance has been identified. In fact, determining of reduction of pile resistance is difficult. This paper proposes an approach by considering tolerable settlement of rigid pavement. Validation is carried out with respect to a loading test of nailed-slab models. The models are presented as strip section of rigid pavement. The theory of beams on elastic foundation is used to calculate the slab deflection by using k’. Proposed approach can results in deflection prediction close to observed one. In practice, the Nailed-slab System would be constructed by multiple-row piles. Designing this system based on one-pile row analysis will give more safety design and will consume less time.

To overcome the {{differential settlement}} problem, engineers have developed different types of bridge approach structure and improved design procedures.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the interaction between the piles in a group with a rigid head and correlate the response of a group of piles to that of the single pile. For this purpose, an intensive parametric 3 -D nonlinear numerical analysis was carried out for different pile group arrangements in clayey soils. The responses of the groups of piles are compared to that of the single pile and the variation of the settlement amplification factor Ra was then quantified. The influence of the number of piles, the spacing and the deformation level to the group response is discussed while the effect of the settlement level was also revealed. A previously proposed relationship for predicting a group of piles response based on its configuration and the response of the single pile has been adjusted to extent its applicability for any pile spacing. The proposed relationship provides a reasonable prediction for various group configurations in clayey soils and can be considered satisfactory for the design of most superstructures.

40|$|Expansion joints {{increase}} {{both the}} initial cost {{and the maintenance}} cost of bridges. Integral abutment bridges provide an attractive design alternative because expansion joints are eliminated from the bridge itself. However, the piles in these bridges are subjected to horizontal movement as the bridge expands and contracts during temperature changes. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a method of designing piles for these conditions. Separate field tests simulating a pile and a bridge girder were conducted for three loading cases: (1) vertical load only, (2) horizontal displacement of pile head only, and (3) combined horizontal displacement of pile head with subsequent vertical load. Both tests (1) and (3) reached the same ultimate vertical load, that is, the horizontal displacement had no effect on the vertical load capacity. Several model tests were conducted in sand with a scale factor of about 1 : 10. Experimental results from both the field and model tests were used to develop the vertical and horizontal load-displacement properties of the soil. These properties were input into the finite element computer program Integral Abutment Bridge Two-Dimensional (IAB 2 D), which was developed under a previous research contract. Experimental and analytical results compared well for the test cases. Two alternative design methods, both based upon the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Specification, were developed. Alternative One is quite conservative relative to IAB 2 D results and does not permit plastic redistribution of forces. Alternative Two is also conservative when compared to IAB 2 D, but plastic redistribution is permitted.

40|$|Leda clay, {{which is}} a type of {{sensitive}} marine clay in Canada, is a hazardous soil that could undergo sudden collapse and flow upon wetting and remolding. This type of soil causes many landslide disasters and foundation damage. The existence of Leda clay at or near the proximities of developed cities makes it challenging for infrastructure expansion, and therefore, challenging for geotechnical engineers. At the location where this sensitive marine clay exists, many foundation designers have adopted the use of deep foundations, such as pile foundations to support heavy structures. The shear behavior and strength parameters at the interface between the (<b>friction)</b> <b>pile</b> and soil are key design parameters. A sufficient knowledge of these interface shear behaviors and strength parameters is also essential for the safe and cost-effective design of several other geotechnical structures (e. g., retaining walls, reinforced soils, and buried structures). However, no studies have yet been implemented on the interface shear behavior between Leda clay and structural material. There is therefore, a need to generate more knowledge about the interface shear behavior of Leda clay. This thesis deals with an experimental study of the shear behavior at the interface between Leda clay and structural material, such as steel and concrete. The effects of several factors, such as surface roughness of the construction material, Leda clay's overconsolidation ratio (OCR), saturation degree, density, and salt content on interface shear behavior are also investigated. Laboratory tests have been carried out by using an automatic direct shear machine connected to a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), loading cell and a data logging system. The results of the interface shear tests show that under consolidated drained (CD) and saturated conditions, the interface friction angle increases with an increase in the clay's OCR. The results also indicate that increasing the salinity of Leda clay's pore water enhances its frictional resistance at the interface. Furthermore, the results reveal that Leda clay with a higher dry density shows higher interface shear resistance. On the other hand, the results also show that the interface shear resistance decreases as the degree of saturation of the Leda clay increases...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of electronic digital calculating {{machines in the}} last decade or two has {{led to the development of}} mathematical models of pile foundations. These models are able to overcome many hitherto intractable analytical problems in pile-soil interaction studies, through the use of numerical methods possible only with the computer. These models fall into two classes; those dealing with an elastic system of both pile and soil, with modifications to allow some non-linear pile-soil interaction, and those using only empirical measured values of soil response, thus permitting full non-linear treatment. The first class of models allows the action of the entire soil-pile system to be taken into account. The second, though better coping with the true non-linear behaviour of the pile-soil system, considers only the effects immediately adjacent to the pile. This thesis presents a new model that incorporates the approaches of each class, thus being a completely non-linear model that accounts for the total behaviour of the soil-mass system. Part I of the thesis is concerned with the development of the model. The pile is considered as a series of elastic elements contained in an elastic soil, but between the soil and the pile a layer of soil with plastic properties is assumed. On the pile sides the layer is thin; below the pile a plastic soil element of finite length and the same section as the pile allows a non-linear base response. The properties of these plastic soil regions are determined from empirical soil tests in situ or in the laboratory. The behaviour of the semi-infinite elastic soil mass outside the plastic soil region is accounted for by the use of equations developed by R. D. Mindlin in 1936. A large section of the first part of the thesis is devoted to a discussion of the Mindlin equations and the solution of singularities that arise in their use. The second part of the thesis first compares the model pile results with field tests for which the relevant model input information is also available. Reasonable agreement between model and test results is demonstrated, although there is clearly a scarcity of the information required for input to the model. The thesis then presents a series of studies on typical, arbitrary piles in a variety of soil types, although the general characteristics of the soils considered are those of clay soils. Characteristics typical of piles of a particular type and in soils of a particular type are considered, in the hope of identifying characteristics typical of such piles or soils in the field. Characteristics identified from the load-settlement curve of the pile top are particularly considered, since many such curves are produced daily in the construction industry. Certain trends in the shape of these load-settlement curves are discerned, but no positive unique characteristic of any one soil or pile type has been found. It appears that the pile load-settlement curve with a marked peak, or change in slope, is typical of the <b>friction</b> <b>pile,</b> with the peak corresponding to development of maximum pile side friction. However the trend is not as yet certain enough to be of practical use. It is concluded that the model is valid, but requires a large reserve of information about soil plastic properties and to a lesser extent elastic properties before substantial use of the model can be made. However it appears that much of this reserve of information can be found from existing tests commonly performed, in particular the conventional shear box test. The movements associated with peak shear in this test are the values required for the assumed model plastic soil properties; such movements though often recorded are rarely published and so this information is lost. A technique is suggested at the end of the thesis for adapting the model to forecast the results of cyclic loading tests. Though of little design value such a model, if accurate, would clearly be reliable for use in general design procedures...|$|E

This limitation will prevent a progressive failure developing between the pile shaft and the surrounding soil.Due to their small diameter, ductile iron piles, like other small diameter piles, have limited capacity to transfer lateral loads. Larger lateral load dissipation can be achieved by passive soil forces or raked piles.Due to the relatively small diameter of TRM piles, buckling of the pile shaft must be considered in soft soil conditions with SPT values of less than 2, a buckling check is required. In cohesive soils with an un-drained shear strength with Cu<15kPa buckling needs to be investigated. In non-cohesive soils it can be assumed that lateral support provided by embedment in generally adequate.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of EngineeringThe two basic types of pile foundations are skin <b>friction</b> <b>piles</b> and end- bearing <b>piles.</b> <b>Friction</b> <b>piles</b> resist the applied vertical load by utilising the shear stresses developed along the pile-soil interface, with the end-bearing {{at the tip of}} pile contributing a small proportion of the total pile resistance. End-bearing piles resist the applied vertical loads mainly by end bearing generated at the tip of pile. There are many instances where end-bearing piles piers are constructed with their tip located inside a cavity made in rock strata: such piles are referred to as rock-socketed piles. The resistance developed by rock-socketed piles and piers is partially due to the shearing stresses generated at the pile rock interface {{on the wall of the}} rock cavity and partially due to the end bearing at the tip of the pile. The load that can be carried by the rock socket is usually underestimated in the design practice due the lack of guidance in relevant codes. This thesis presents the findings of the research focused on computational modeling of rock socketed piles conducted to investigate the behavior of such piles. Ax symmetric finite element analyses were conducted to determine the percentages of load resisted by interface shear along the socket wall and end-bearing at pile tip, for various socket length/pile diameter ratios. Different interface conditions were modelled by varying cohesion and friction parameters input to the interface element, as well as by assuming perfect connection between pile and rock material The finite element results obtained are compared with some available field test data to verify the models. Finally a field test procedure is suggested for deriving load carrying capacity of the socket. Findings and further expansion of this research program would be of immense benefit to state and private organizations involved in deep foundation design and construction. It will highlight whether the use of rock-socketed piles can be economically advantageous over the simple end bearing piles with no sockets, and indicate optimum geometries of rock sockets...|$|R
