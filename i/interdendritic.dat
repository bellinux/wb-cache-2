Thus, the microstructure of specimens heated at 1403 K ~ 1453 K was examined. In the raw material, γ-γ ' eutectic phases, platelet η phases, MC carbide and PFZ were clearly observed in <b>interdendritic</b> regions or near the grain boundary {{and the size of}} primary γ ' precipitates near the <b>interdendritic</b> regions were larger than the core. The primary γ ' precipitated in the dendrite core dissolved early in the bonding process. γ ' precipitated near the <b>interdendritic</b> regions were partially solubilized and their shape was changed. The dissolution rate increased with increasing temperature. Phases in the <b>interdendritic</b> regions or near the grain boundary changed continuously with time at the bonding temperature. At a bonding temperature of 1403 K, the eutectic phases remained, but η phases were transformed from a platelet shape to a needle morphology and the PFZ region widened with time. The <b>interdendritic</b> region and near the grain boundary became partially liquid at 1423 K and fully at 1453 K by the reaction of η phases and PFZ. The <b>interdendritic</b> region and near grain the boundary became liquid and new phases which were mixed with η phases, PFZ and MC carbide crystallized during cooling at 1453 K.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} attempts {{to provide an}} aid {{to the understanding of}} the essence of the gravitational influence on <b>interdendritic</b> flow. An analytic solution of the equations governing <b>interdendritic</b> fluid flow is presented for a simple case, involving a semiinfinite mushy zone whose isotherms are flat, parallel, and inclined at an angle to the force of gravity. It is found that gravity in ingots with narrow mushy zones mainly produces <b>interdendritic</b> flow parallel to the liquidus confined to the vicinity of the liquidus. This flow can be large in comparison to the usual shrinkage-induced flows. Its existence is caused by the rapid increase of permeability with fraction liquid near the liquidus.

40|$|Purpose: The {{knowledge}} of the variation of permeability in <b>interdendritic</b> channels is important in order to analyze {{the ability of the}} liquid flow compensate the shrinkage of the alloy during solidification. In this work the influence of the magnesium content in the permeability of <b>interdendritic</b> channels during unidirectional solidification of Al-Mg alloys is analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Al-Mg alloys with 5, 10 and 15 wt% Mg were submitted to unidirectional solidification leading to a columnar dendritic structure. From the samples obtained, the primary and secondary dendrite arms spacing variations during the solidification process were measured. Applying a heuristic method, developed by some of the authors of this work, the variation of permeability of <b>interdendritic</b> channels for a flow parallel to primary dendrite arms was estimated as function of primary and secondary dendrite arms spacing, and liquid fraction variations during solidification. Findings: From the results obtained for the three alloys with different compositions it was concluded that the behavior of the permeability depends on the relation between secondary and primary dendrite arms spacing and for the same distance from the metal/mould interface the permeability decreases when the magnesium content increase. Research limitations/implications: The magnesium content affects the primary and secondary dendrite arms spacing affecting as consequence the permeability of the <b>interdendritic</b> channels. Both primary and secondary dendrite arm spacing increases with magnesium content. The permeability depends on primary and secondary dendrite arm spacing, but also on the relation between these parameters. Originality/value: It was concluded that, for Al-Mg alloys, the permeability of <b>interdendritic</b> channels decreases as magnesium content increases, indicating that the probability of microporosity formation increases for greater magnesium content...|$|E
40|$|Shrinkage {{porosity}} {{and metal}} expansion penetration are two fundamental defects appearing at production ofcomplex shaped lamellar cast iron components. In previous work {{it has been}} shown that both shrinkageporosity and metal expansion penetration are related to the primary austenite dendrite network and itsformation mechanisms. The purpose of the present work is to study the morphology of primary austenite intest casting with a high tendency to form shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration. Simplified testmodels simulating the thermal and geometrical conditions similar to the conditions existing in complex shapedcasting have been successfully used to provoke shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration. Stereological investigation of the primary dendrite morphology indicates a maximum <b>interdendritic</b> space inconnection to the casting surface where the porosity and the penetration defect appear. Away from the defectformation area the <b>interdendritic</b> space decreases. Furthermore the local solidification times of the investigatedsamples were calculated in a 3 D simulation software. Comparison of the simulated local solidification timesand measured <b>interdendritic</b> space indicates a strong relation of the same shape as it is known from theliterature when dynamic coarsening mechanism is characterized. The main outcome of the present paper is theobserved gradient of increasing <b>interdendritic</b> space from sections with high local solidification to sectionswith low solidification time. The mechanism of increasing the <b>interdendritic</b> phase can be explained by thedynamic ripening process. The unfortunate thermal conditions with the slowest local solidification timesituated in the border between the casting surface and its surrounding are considered the reason to form anaustenite morphology which can promote the mass flow between dendrite provoking shrinkage porosity ormetal expansion penetration.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} Ru on the {{microstructure}} and stress-rupture property were investigated in two experimental Ni-based single crystal superalloys {{with and without}} Ru addition (5. 1 %, mass fraction). The {{results indicate that the}} morphology of γ′ precipitates in the dendrite core and <b>interdendritic</b> region are intermediate and nearly spherical, respectively, in the Ru-free alloy after being aged at 1 100 °C for 8 h. The Re partitioning ratio increases due to Ru addition and Ru partitioned preferentially to the γ phase in both dendrite core and <b>interdendritic</b> region of the Ru-containing alloy, which results in more negative lattice misfit and more cuboidal γ′ precipitates. Meanwhile, the γ′ volume fraction increases while the precipitate size and γ channel width decreases due to Ru addition in both dendrite core and <b>interdendritic</b> region. Ru addition improves the stress-rupture life at 1 100 °C/ 140 MPa significantly due to higher γ′ volume fraction, more negative lattice misfit and a well rafting structure as well as less γ channel width...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} of a hot-chamber die-cast AZ 91 D {{thin plate}} (1. 4 mm in thickness) {{was investigated in}} terms of its microstructure, to elucidate the role of die-chill skin in corrosion. The die-chill skin was composed of a thin layer of chill zone and a thick layer of an <b>interdendritic</b> Al-rich alpha-Mg/Al 12 Mg 17 beta-phase particle/alpha-Mg grain composite microstructures. The chill zone (4 +/- 1 mu m in thickness) had fine columnar and equiaxed grains and contained a distribution of submicron Mg-Al-Zn intermetallic particles. Beneath the chill zone, Al 12 Mg 17 beta particles were irregularly shaped but did not have an <b>interdendritic</b> network morphology. Furthermore, Al-rich alpha phase (also known as eutectic alpha) was in the <b>interdendritic</b> network, which occupied a higher volume fraction than the beta phase in the die-skin layer. Corrosion characteristics were studied via constant-immersion and electrochemical tests. Although previous studies have ascribed the fine microstructure to good corrosion resistance for the AZ 91 D alloy, the present study showed severe corrosion of the sample with a die skin in chloride solution. Moreover, the sample without the die skin on the surface corroded more slowly. The inferior corrosion performance of the die skin was considered {{to be related to the}} high volume fraction of the <b>interdendritic</b> network of Al-rich alpha phase contained in the die skin, owing to the high cooling rate during solidification. The Al-rich alpha phase does not increase the corrosion resistance of the AZ 91 D alloy...|$|E

It is known that for steels with low carbon contents the pearlite that forms on slow cooling does so where the <b>interdendritic</b> liquid was present prior to final solidification. The alloying elements of Nb, Ti, Mn and V segregate into the <b>interdendritic</b> liquid during solidification, while Al preferentially segregates into the solidifying solid phase. The composition analysis on the slab samples verified the predicted element segregation behaviour, with a smaller difference in the concentrations of Mn and V in the pearlite and dendritic ferrite regions being observed compared to the Nb levels. Small (30 – 100 nm) spherical or irregular shaped Nb-rich precipitates (Nb(C, N) and (Nb, V) (C, N)) were mainly found in the pearlite regions, while angular Al-rich (60 – 300 nm) precipitates {{were found in the}} dendritic ferrite regions, in the form of AlN and complex AlN–V(C, N) precipitates. Small isolated ferrite regions surrounded by pearlite were observed in the microstructure and has two origins: one type is dendritic ferrite that appears as an isolated island due to a sectioning effect when observing the two-dimensional microstructure; the other is a ferrite idiomorph that forms in the <b>interdendritic</b> region due to the low carbon content of the steel. Accordingly, in these isolated ferrite islands two different precipitation behaviours are found; predominantly Al-rich particles in the dendritic regions or predominantly Nb-rich precipitates in the <b>interdendritic</b> ferrite idiomorphs. No Al-rich precipitates were observed in the <b>interdendritic</b> regions (pearlite or isolated ferrite idiomorphs) despite the Thermo-Calc predictions indicating a higher volume fraction of AlN in these regions compared to the dendritic regions.

40|$|Abstract. A {{particularly}} important defect related with solute segregation during solidification is the microporosity, which influences mechanical properties of castings. Considering only {{the formation of}} porosity due to shrinkage, during directional solidification, it is necessary a flow of liquid metal into the <b>interdendritic</b> channels to compensate for metal contraction, and pores are formed when the pressure drop in the liquid flow at a point within the mushy zone exceeds the pressure acting at this point. The increase in roughness of the <b>interdendritic</b> channels, caused by the successive ramification of the dendrite arms promotes a pressure drop inside the channel. In this paper a model developed by the authors is used to predict the permeability in directional solidification of Al-Cu and Sn-Pb alloys.

40|$|Abstract. Microsegregation gets {{eliminated}} significantly if subsequent {{hot working}} and/or annealing are done on cast products. Macrosegregation however persists, causing problems in quality, and hence, {{has to be}} attended to. Microsegregation {{is a consequence of}} rejection of solutes by the solid into the <b>interdendritic</b> liquid. Scheil’s quation is mostly employed. However, other equations have been proposed, which take into account diffusion in solid phase and/or incomplete mixing in liquid. Macrosegregation results from movements of microsegregated regions over macroscopic distances due to motion of liquid and free crystals. Motion of impure <b>interdendritic</b> liquid causes regions of positive macrosegregation, whereas purer solid crystals yield negative macrosegregation. Flow of <b>interdendritic</b> liquid is primarily natural convection due to thermal and solutal buoyancy, and partly forced convection due to suction by shrinkage cavity formation etc. The present paper briefly deals with fundamentals of the above and contains some recent studies as well. Experimental investigations in molten alloys do not allow visualization of the complex flow pattern as well as other phenomena, such as dendrite-tip detachment. Experiments with room temperature analogues, and mathematical modelling have supplemented these efforts. However, the complexity of the phenomena demands simplifying assumptions.

40|$|Dendrite {{structures}} of ice produced on undirectional solidification of ternary and quaternary aqueous solutions have been studied. Upon freezing, solutions containing {{more than one}} solute produce plate-shaped dendrites of ice. The spacing between dendrites increase linearly with {{the distance from the}} chill surface and the square root of local solidification time (or square root of inverse freezing rate) for any fixed composition. For fixed freezing conditions, the dendrite spacings from multicomponent aqueous solutions were a function of the concentrations and diffusion coefficients of the individual solutes. The dendrite spacing produced by freezing of a solution was changed by the addition of a solute different from those already present. If the main diffusion coefficient of the added solute is higher than that of solutes already present, the dendrite spacing is increased and vice versa. The dendrite spacing in multi-component systems increases with the total solute concentration if the constituent solutes are present in equal amounts. The dendrite spacing obtained on freezing of these dilute multicomponent solutions can be expressed by regression equations of the type Image Full-size image (2 K) where L is the dendrite spacing in microns, C 1, C 2 and C 3 are concentrations of individual solutes, Θf is the total freezing time and A 1 −A 8 are constants. A Yates analysis of the dendrite spacings in a factorial design of quaternary solutions indicates that there are strong interactions between individual solutes in regard to their effect on the dendrite spacings. A mass transport analysis has been used to calculate the <b>interdendritic</b> supersaturation ΔC of the individual solutes, the supercooling in the <b>interdendritic</b> liquid ΔT, and the transverse growth velocity of the dendrites, VT. In ternary solutions if two solutes are present in equal amount the supersaturation of the solute with higher main diffusion coefficient is lower, and vice versa. If a solute with higher main diffusion coefficient is added to a binary solution, the interface growth velocity, the <b>interdendritic</b> supersaturation of the base solute and the <b>interdendritic</b> supercooling increase with the quantity of solute added...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{models have}} been {{developed}} for the simulation of microstructure formation in Ni-base alloys. The first step consists of a calculation of the segregation of solutal species in the primary solidified γ-phase and formation/dissolution of the <b>interdendritic</b> γ'-phase. Finally, local compositions of solutal species are used to calculate the nucleation, growth and coarsening of γ'-precipitates with a precipitation model...|$|E
