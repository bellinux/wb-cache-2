5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity <b>going</b> <b>down</b> groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in <b>going</b> <b>down</b> a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E
5|$|The trends <b>going</b> <b>down</b> from {{scandium}} and yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} {{more similar}} to those <b>going</b> <b>down</b> groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those <b>going</b> <b>down</b> from scandium and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{commonly}} {{reacts with}} heavier chalcogens. Lead sulfide is a semiconductor, a photoconductor, and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector. The other two chalcogenides, lead selenide and lead telluride, are likewise photoconducting. They are unusual in that their color becomes lighter <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{relatively}} large difference in the electronegativity of lead(II) at 1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33. This difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the +4 oxidation state <b>going</b> <b>down</b> carbon group; tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 oxidation state and 1.96 in the +4 state.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the group for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, {{are similar to those}} found among their group 4–8 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ending}} {{that was in}} the {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it.

American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive.

5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the group. This {{is the result}} of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Wade singing and playing his guitar {{in a hotel}} room. While singing, Wade is seen packing his clothes into a suit case in {{separate}} camera shots. He then leaves the hotel room and it shows a time-lapse scene of a car <b>going</b> <b>down</b> a highway. Then, the video cuts to a restaurant, where Wade is seen lying on a restaurant booth and singing the lyrics of the song. After this, Wade is seen {{with the rest of}} Lifehouse in a concert setting in a restaurant. It then splits to shots of Wade singing the lyrics of the song to the camera. Toward the end of the video, it switches to Lifehouse playing the song in front of a crowd while showing shots of Wade in a car <b>going</b> <b>down</b> a highway. It ends with the scene of Lifehouse in a restaurant and then switches to a camera shot of all of the band members with the video fading out on Wade.|$|E
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. <b>Going</b> <b>down</b> a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in <b>going</b> <b>down</b> a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes <b>going</b> <b>down</b> the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
