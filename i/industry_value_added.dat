ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the short term and long term relation between Co 2 emissions, electricity consumption and industrialization in case of Iran over the period 1980 - 2011. To estimate this relationship The Granger Causality Test, Johansen cointegration test and Vector Error Correction Model are applied. Granger Causality analysis indicates that in short-run there is a bilateral causal relationship between Co 2 emissions and electricity consumption, and a bilateral causal relationship between Co 2 emissions and <b>industry</b> <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> But Granger Causality analysis didn’t show any causal relationship between the <b>industry</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and electricity consumption variables.

40|$|The {{economy of}} Ghana is highly {{vulnerable}} to {{fluctuations in the}} international price of crude oil. This {{is due to the}} fact that oil as a commodity plays a central role in the economic activities of the nation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the dynamic relationship between oil price shocks and macroeconomic variables in the Ghanaian economy. This is achieved through the use of Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Vector Error Correction (VECM) models. The variables considered in the study include: real oil price, real government expenditure, real <b>industry</b> <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> real imports, inflation and the real effective exchange rate. The study points out the asymmetric effects of oil price shocks; for instance, positive as well as negative oil price shocks on the macroeconomic variables used. The empirical findings of this study suggest that both linear and nonlinear oil price shocks have adverse impact on macroeconomic variables in Ghana. Positive oil price shocks are stronger than negative shocks with respect to government expenditure, inflation and the real effective exchange rate. <b>Industry</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and imports have stronger responses to negative oil price shocks. Positive oil price shocks account for about 30 % of fluctuations in government expenditure, 5 % of imports, 6 % of <b>industry</b> <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> 17 % of inflation and 2 % of the real effective exchange rate in the long run. Negative oil price shocks account for about 8 % of fluctuations in government spending, 20 % of imports, 8 % of inflation and 2 % of the real effective exchange rate in the long run.

Using the data from 1971 to 2008, a test was conducted for the cointegration and Granger causality within an error correction model. Results from these tests reveal a bidirectional causality between per capita electricity consumption and per capita GDP. A unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to <b>industry</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> appears in the short run. Economic growth is found to have great effects on electricity consumption and a reverse causality from electricity to economic growth may also appear. In the long run, there is a unidirectional causality between electricity and both GDP and <b>industry</b> <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> From these findings, we conclude that {{the country will be}} energy dependent in the long run and must therefore secure the production network from shortfalls to ensure a sustainable development path. Accordingly, government should adopt policies aimed at increasing the investment in the sector by stepping up electricity production from existing and new energy sources.

In addition, we see that tax effort index in Iran with relatively high oil, are rather than high but is unstable over the 1990 : 1 - 2007 : 4 periods and there is not an increasing trend. By comparing tax effort with oil revenue, we find that there is an inverse relationship between tax effort and oil revenues in Iran. In the periods of 1990 : 1 - 2007 : 4 their trends is same...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{issues involved}} in calculating a <b>value</b> <b>added</b> index {{in order to measure}} real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> at the <b>industry</b> level. Three methods of calculating real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> are considered; the Laspeyres double-deflation method recommended by the Utzired Nations System of Nation Accounts, the commonly used single-deflation method, and the double-deflation Divisia method. Actual data are employed to clarify and illustrate the issues involved, and the paper concludes with a recommenda-tion for an appropriate index to use when calculating <b>industry</b> real <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is the key to understanding the contribution of the primary inputs, the economies of scale, and technical change in the production process.

40|$|The {{study shows}} that the {{exceptional}} drop in volume of Finland's GDP in 2009 - as much as 8 per cent -was {{to a large extent}} due to huge decline in exports and production of one industry, ICT. The contribution of ICT (or electronics and electro-technical industry) to GDP decline was close to two percentage points. The reduction of the <b>industry's</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> resulted, again, from the dramatic deterioration of profits (capital income). Nokia is by far the biggest player in the industry (more than half of the <b>value</b> <b>added),</b> and the decline of profits is mainly due to Nokia. Since 80 - 90 per cent of Nokia's shares is owned by foreigners, the consequences of profit and <b>value</b> <b>added</b> decline are felt mainly outside Finland. Similarly, when the <b>values</b> <b>added</b> and profits grew in the early 2000 s, the contribution to GDP growth was overestimated.

On the basis of comparison of the two sectors, the panel evidence of 131 countries indicates that none of the four components mentioned above is positively associated with the relative development of the tradable sector to the nontradable sector. That is, the tradable sector does not suffer disproportionately (compared to the nontradable sector) from institutional weaknesses. Our results cast skepticism upon one of Rodrik’s explanations on the growth-promoting effects of real undervaluation because the existence of such a distortion is not supported empirically...|$|E

Net taxes on products in intermediate uses are assumed to be nonzero also at the economy level and different industries are allowed to face different tax rates for the same intermediate inputs.

In the case of Törnqvist indices, if double deflation is used, even reallocation of deliveries final demand between industries contributes to the aggregate TFP growth. For <b>value</b> <b>added</b> there are two al-ternatives, the approach based on the production possibilities frontier of the <b>industries</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and the one based on the economy level production function. In the latter case also reallocation of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> be-tween <b>industries</b> contributes to the aggregate TFP growth.
