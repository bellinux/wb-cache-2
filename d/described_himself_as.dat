5|$|Following demobilisation, Maxwell {{worked as}} a {{gardener}} in Canberra, Moree and the Maitland district. Having <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a reporter, Maxwell married 19-year-old tailoress Mabel Maxwell (unrelated) in a Catholic ceremony at Bellevue Hill, Sydney on 14 February 1921. The marriage produced a daughter, Jean, before being dissolved in 1926 upon Mabel's instigation.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{graduated}} from the University of Maryland in May 2009 with a bachelor's degree in government and politics. His strong interest in politics factored into his decision on where to attend college. He chose the University of Maryland partly based on its close proximity to Washington, D.C. Turner's political views are liberal; he is registered as a Democrat, and has <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an idealist.|$|E

5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E
5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{was born}} in Strasbourg, which was then part of Germany, on July 2, 1906, {{the only child of}} Anna (née Kuhn) and Albrecht Bethe, a privatdozent of {{physiology}} at the University of Strasbourg.

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|During the Labour {{leadership}} campaign, he <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a socialist, {{and spoke}} out {{against some of the}} actions of the Blair ministry, including criticising its record on civil liberties and foreign policy. Though he was not yet an MP {{at the time of the}} 2003 vote, Miliband was a strong critic of the Iraq War. He backed UK military action and intervention in Afghanistan and Libya respectively.|$|E

Romero, Leon was portrayed by Brad Renfro.|$|E
5|$|Notable Black Lives Matter activists include {{co-founder of}} the Seattle Black Lives Matter chapter Marissa Johnson, lawyer and {{president}} of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP Nekima Levy-Pounds, and writer Shaun King. In a September 2016 interview with W. Kamau Bell and Hari Kondabolu, King <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> part of the broader Black Lives Matter movement and supportive of the formal organization Black Lives Matter, but not affiliated with the latter.|$|E
5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a quick {{player with}} {{a good sense of}} {{position}} who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), {{where he}} argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise {{the difference between}} the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{king of the}} third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's {{inscription}} was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite {{in the view of}} Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.|$|E
5|$|This German {{immigrant}} <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the Associate Professor of Medical Psychology, Director of the Orgone Institute, President {{and research}} physician of the Wilhelm Reich Foundation and discoverer of biological or life energy. A 1940 security investigation was begun {{to determine the}} extent of Reich's communist commitments. A board of Alien Enemy Hearing judged that Dr. Reich was not a threat to the security of the U.S. In 1947, a security investigation concluded that neither the Orgone Project nor any of its staff were engaged in subversive activities or were in violation of any statute within the jurisdiction of the FBI.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 Farsari had a daughter, Kiku, by a Japanese {{woman whom}} {{he may not}} have married. He <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> living like a misanthrope, associating with very few people outside of business, and his {{correspondence}} indicates that he increasingly hoped to return to Italy. He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States, and he even hoped to be made a cavaliere and thereby join the Italian aristocracy. His success in these endeavours is not clear. Nevertheless, in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy. On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in Vicenza.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} {{on a charge}} of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|John Douglas {{was born}} at Park Cottage, Sandiway, Cheshire, on 11 April 1830 and baptised on 16 May 1830 at St Mary's Church, Weaverham. He was {{the second of the}} four children, and the only son, of John Douglas and his wife Mary née Swindley (1792–1863). John Douglas senior was born in Northampton about 1798–1800 and his wife was born in Aldford, a village on the Eaton estate in Cheshire; her father was the village {{blacksmith}} at Eccleston, another village in the Eaton estate. John Douglas senior was by trade a builder and joiner, and also <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a surveyor and a timber merchant. In 1835 he acted as architect for a house at Hartford, a village between Sandiway and Northwich. At the time of the 1851 census he was employing 48men. He owned land in Sandiway, and a house and land in the neighbouring village of Cuddington.|$|E
