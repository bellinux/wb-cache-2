5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J. Earle, thinking that the Court would be unable to rule without a quorum of Judges. Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The Judges were taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be highly}} desirable, while a {{sensitive}} operation is in progress, {{to have the}} HN conduct distracting operations. The knowledge of the sensitive operation must be tightly held, {{and most of the}} troops carrying out the distraction—which ideally has a result more than mere distraction—will not <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are taking a particular action.|$|E
25|$|Justice O’Connor {{rejected}} the County of Riverside’s claims that “allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct {{and likely to}} be redressed by the requested relief.”; they argued the plaintiffs who were arrested and held without probable cause determination were suffering direct injury (emotional) {{because they were not}} given the reasons for their arrest. The ruling stated that any suspects that are arrested without a warrant by law enforcement have to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are being arrested (determination of probable cause) from a judge within 48 hours, except by emergency circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Shatterstar {{accompanied}} Rictor to the Richter home in Mexico {{to try to}} end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business. Both {{characters have}} since appeared separately so one assumes they succeeded, though it’s not <b>known</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> later parted.|$|R
50|$|People who are {{classified}} with Autistic Spectrum Disorder tend to communicate metaphorically {{rather than with}} common phrases.

25|$|Hitchens was a vocal {{supporter}} of Republicanism in the United Kingdom, advocating {{the abolition of}} the Monarchy, and in 1990 published the book-long polemic The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish. His 1998 documentary Princess Diana: The Mourning After accused the British media of playing an essential role in creating a national, unchallengeable, and at times hysterical cult of personality surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, whereas previously they had been extremely critical of her and the monarchy after she had separated and divorced from Charles, Prince of Wales, and {{was having an affair with}} Egyptian billionaire son Dodi Fayed. Hitchens claimed the public were behaving irrationally, and that many appeared to not even <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were mourning. He also scrutinised the level of censorship against criticism of Diana and the monarchy but was accused, in a review by The Independent, of exaggerating on this point.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf leaves after {{showing the}} group the {{path through the}} forest and warning them never to leave it. After several days, however, the dwarves are running low on supplies, and see a group of Wood Elves enjoying a feast. They run into the forest towards the elves, but become lost and separated. Bilbo {{encounters}} Corwin (Michael Ensign), a man from Lake-town, whose party has been killed by the Great Spiders living in the forest, and who have also taken the dwarves. Bilbo is able to rescue them, {{but as soon as}} he does so, the dwarves are captured by Wood Elves and placed in the dungeons of Thranduil, who wants to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are in the forest. Thorin, however, refuses to say anything, enraging Thranduil. Using the ring, Bilbo enters Thranduil's hall, where he meets Lianna. With her assistance, he is able to free the dwarves by sealing them into barrels which are sent down the river to Lake-town.|$|E
25|$|During the honeymoon, Max {{prepares the}} {{children}} to perform at the Kaltzberg Festival. Herr Zeller, the Gauleiter, demands to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are not flying {{the flag of the}} Third Reich now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of developments, he refuses to allow {{the children to}} sing. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married ("Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)"). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.|$|E
60|$|But {{when they}} set the bier down on the threshold, they looked at one another, and at me, and whispered. I <b>knew</b> <b>why.</b> <b>They</b> {{felt as if it}} were not right to lay him down in the same quiet room.|$|R
60|$|And as {{she peered}} into their smooth, humble faces, {{all at once}} she <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had come. She knew it even before they put their {{proposals}} into words; she <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> the praetorian praefect was so servile, and why my lord Hortensius Martius, despite his obvious weakness, wore an air of triumph.|$|R
50|$|Two disjunct {{subspecies}} of {{the dolphin}} {{are found in}} geographically disparate areas separated by 130° of longitude and about 8500 km; it is not <b>known</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are thus distributed. Global populations are unknown, but the species is accepted to be locally common.|$|R
500|$|A {{woman who}} lost four {{family members in}} the {{incident}} said, [...] "We don't know why this foreign soldier came and killed our innocent family members. Either he was drunk or he enjoyed killing civilians." [...] Abdul Samad, a 60-year-old farmer who lost eleven family members, eight of whom were children, spoke about the incident: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> killed them. Our government told us {{to come back to}} the village, and then they let the Americans kill us." [...] One grieving mother, holding a dead baby in her arms, said, [...] "They killed a child, was this child the Taliban? Believe me, I haven't seen a two-year-old member of the Taliban yet." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{more troops}} were evacuated, more {{were ordered to}} {{withdraw}} from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk. Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British and convince them that nothing was going on. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate. Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly. Washington exclaimed [...] "Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us." [...] Mifflin explained that he had been told that {{it was his turn to}} evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} with IEC {{officials}} on September 13, Galbraith [...] "laid into the commissioners, {{in front of the}} donors and observers" [...] and demanded to <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had not yet started printing ballot papers in preparation for a run-off.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} three tracks and two island platforms. The tile band in this station is Marine Blue and vent {{chambers}} are also present. Strange white walls exist at both platform staircases to the Kingsbridge Road exit. It is not <b>known</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were built.|$|R
50|$|Akutagawa {{begins the}} note by stating his {{reason for his}} decision. He {{mentions}} that the author Reigner wrote {{in one of his}} short stories that no one who commits suicide fully <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> do. “A vague sense of anxiety about my own future” is the reason Akutagawa gives.|$|R
5000|$|Later at home, Sarah Jane reminisces {{over her}} parents. Although {{she could not}} save them, she finally <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> left and is {{incredibly}} proud of them.

2500|$|... "We {{are very}} {{surprised}} by this. All the channels of communications are open {{between our two}} countries. We don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are {{moving out of the}} bilateral relations to make these ... threatening statements.

2500|$|A Mississippi Choctaw veteran stated, [...] "Indians {{were not}} {{supposed}} to go in the military back then ... the military was mainly for whites. My category was white instead of Indian. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> did that. Even though Indians weren't citizens of this country, couldn't register to vote, didn't have a draft card or anything, they took us anyway." ...|$|E
50|$|The Time Out Comedy Awards were {{bestowed}} upon the comedy community by the London listings magazine Time Out.

50|$|Later in the 1925 visit, {{he learned}} from the Chief that his people, like the Elongyi tribe of Kenya, rose {{in the morning and}} spit in their palms, thereby {{presenting}} their soul-stuff to the sun to welcome it in an expression of sympathetic magic. Jung marveled that the people of the pueblo <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were there.|$|R
5000|$|In the [...] "History" [...] Herodotus says, [...] "The gods do {{not like}} happy people". In ancient times, people <b>knew</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> can not {{demonstrate}} their good fortune and happiness: it can cause jealousy and anger of the gods, because they believed that happiness is their, gods, privilege, and daring people who want the same thing, should be punished.|$|R
2500|$|On 24 March, Brigadier General Hakim Jassim, Iraqi {{military}} {{commander of the}} country's territorial waters, gave an interview with Associated Press.

2500|$|She did {{not claim}} that she fought until being wounded, {{but she did}} say her weapon jammed {{immediately}} and {{that she could not}} have done anything anyway.

I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> filmed [...] or why they say these things." [...] She also stated [...] "I did not shoot, not a round, nothing. I went down praying to my knees. And that's the last I remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E
60|$|I was {{standing}} inside {{a circle of}} men. Three of them opposite to me were holding lanterns low down to the ground.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{it seems}} to be a {{necessary}} evil, master," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "But I know what business you've come upon, and we can settle it in five minutes after the moon's well up. I'll just agree to everything you and the other two trustees want. Lord <b>knows</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> ever put me on the school board. Maybe it's because I'm so ornamental. They wanted one good-looking man, I reckon." ...|$|R
2500|$|Paxman {{presented}} his last Newsnight on 21 November 2015 on the BBC News Channel at 23:20 with a Full {{interview with the}} Current Affairs.

[...] The closing theme was replaced with I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing by The New Seekers.

2500|$|Following the invasion, Sir Reader Bullard and Andrey Andreyevich Smirnov, the British and Soviet ambassadors to Iran, were summoned. The Shah {{demanded to}} <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were invading {{his country and}} why they had not {{declared}} war. Both answered {{that it was because}} of [...] "German residents" [...] in Iran. When the Shah asked if the Allies would stop their attack if he expelled the Germans, the ambassadors did not answer. The Shah sent a telegram to the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, pleading with him to stop the invasion. As the neutral United States {{had nothing to do with}} the attack, Roosevelt was not able to grant the Shah's plea but stated that he believed that the [...] "territorial integrity" [...] of Iran should be respected.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, league rules changed {{to make the}} league more [...] "strictly baseball." [...] The bases were pushed back and {{pitchers}} began pitching overhand. Many of the existing female pitchers were {{not strong enough to}} pitch overhand so girls started to be pulled in from third base or the outfield to pitch, and pitchers were rotated to the outfield. If they were unsuccessful in the outfield many would try to pitch for a team in Chicago, where underhand pitching was still used. Thompson played in Chicago for a few years until she decided to retire from baseball and go home. She was disappointed by the way the league changed saying, [...] "They had a great game, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were never satisfied, they just wanted to improve and improve." ...|$|E
60|$|And what notice {{could have}} been taken of two ladies who came from nobody knew where, to live in that wild out-of-the-way place, nobody <b>knew</b> <b>why?</b> <b>They</b> called {{themselves}} mother and daughter, and they called themselves O'Haras;--but {{there was no evidence}} of the truth even of these assertions. They were left therefore in their solitude, and never saw the face of a friend across their door step except that of Father Marty.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a foolish}} question!" [...] cried little Mrs. Whitefoot. [...] "Of course you can. You {{will have to}} help {{take care of these}} babies.
