40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical <b>investigational</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
5000|$|In drug development, the Investigator's Brochure (IB) is a {{comprehensive}} document summarizing the body of information about an <b>investigational</b> <b>product</b> ("IP" [...] or [...] "study drug") obtained during a drug trial. The IB is a document of critical importance throughout the drug development process and is updated with new information as it becomes available. The purpose of the IB is to compile data relevant to studies of the IP in human subjects gathered during preclinical and other clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|GCP {{follows the}} International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) of GCP {{guidelines}}. GCP enforces tight guidelines on ethical {{aspects of a}} clinical study. High standards are required in terms of comprehensive documentation for the clinical protocol, record keeping, training, and facilities, including computers and software. Quality assurance and inspections ensure that these standards are achieved. GCP aims {{to ensure that the}} studies are scientifically authentic and that the clinical properties of the <b>investigational</b> <b>product</b> are properly documented.|$|E
50|$|The {{preclinical}} toxicity {{testing on}} various biological systems reveals the species-, organ- and dose- specific toxic {{effects of an}} <b>investigational</b> <b>product.</b> The toxicity of substances can be observed by (a) studying the accidental exposures to a substance (b) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines (c) in vivo exposure on experimental animals. Toxicity tests are mostly used to examine specific adverse events or specific end points such as cancer, cardiotoxicity, and skin/eye irritation. Toxicity testing also helps calculate the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) dose and is helpful for clinical studies.|$|E

A total of 7 adverse events in 6 subjects were reported (AA, n =  4; EC, n =  2; PL, n =  1).

5000|$|In 2016, Houston {{oncologist}} Dr. Ebrahim Delpassand {{testified to}} a US Senate committee that he treated 78 patients for neuroendocrine cancer with LU-177 octreotate under the Texas Right to Try law, after the FDA refused permission to include those {{patients in the}} clinical trial that he was running. However, the drug's manufacturer, Advanced Accelerator Applications, has made this drug available through an expanded access program for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, so it is disputed {{whether this is a}} substantiated case of a right to try law being used to gain patients access to an <b>investigational</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
50|$|It authorizes {{exemptions}} {{for clinical}} or diagnostic laboratories {{and other institutions}} who possess select agents that are contained in specimens for diagnosis, verification, or proficiency testing, provided that the identification of such agents is reported to DHHS and other authorities, and such agents or toxins are transferred or destroyed in a safe manner set forth by regulation. It authorizes exemptions for products that contain select agents and are cleared, unless DHHS determines that applying additional regulation to a specific product is necessary. It authorizes exemptions for an <b>investigational</b> <b>product</b> that contains a select agent when the product is being used in an investigation authorized under any federal act and the DHHS determines that applying additional regulation to such product is not necessary.|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} in the prior sections, unique features of this clinical trial include the requirement for a two-hour baseline stability period prior to <b>investigational</b> <b>product</b> infusion and the definition of pre-specified infusion associated events.

40|$|The {{safety and}} {{tolerability}} {{of a novel}} formulation of microencapsulated timothy grass pollen extract has been investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I/II trial. The <b>investigational</b> <b>product</b> has been administered orally to patients suffering from allergic rhinitis due to allergy against grass. The dose has been doubled weekly (administered once daily) in cohort A. The highest tolerable dose of at least 64000 BAU has been ascertained.

40|$|Purpose: Investigational drug {{services}} (IDSs) {{are often}} responsible for delivery of <b>investigational</b> <b>product,</b> whether {{to a study}} participant pursuant to a prescription or in bulk to another investigational study site. These deliveries must often cross state borders. For situations in which the study is not conducted under an investigational new drug application, these shipments {{are subject to the}} legislation of the receiving state. Summary: Every state board of pharmacy in the United States was contacted in an effort to compile a single resource describing interstate <b>investigational</b> <b>product</b> shipping regulations for each state. The majority of the states require registration with their board of pharmacy for shipment of medication into the state. Some states will allow for exceptions and/or fee waiver in certain situations. Controlled substances also fall {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Drug Enforcement Administration, with additional constraints placed on their shipment by many states. Conclusion: Knowledge of state legislative requirements surrounding interstate shipment of <b>investigational</b> <b>product</b> is crucial for IDSs to maintain compliance with all regulations. This document provides an important framework for obtaining and interpreting this information. However, as leg-islation changes on a regular basis, current legislation should be reviewed prior to the commencement of interstate shipping...|$|E
