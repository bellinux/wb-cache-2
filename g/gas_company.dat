The NGA required <b>gas</b> <b>companies</b> to file tariffs of their new rates with the FPC, a federal administrative agency, at least thirty days prior to their becoming effective, and authorized the FPC to investigate rates {{to determine if they}} were in the public interest.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{focus on}} global warming and sustainable development in the energy sector, a number of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies</b> have an expressed interest in increasing investments and exposure towards renewable energy [12, 13, 43, 44]. The {{purpose of this study}} is to see if, and how, exposure towards renewable energy will affect the valuation of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies.</b> The main challenges have been to find a suitable metric for exposure to renewable energy, and also the oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies</b> poor reporting practices related to exposure and investments towards renewable energy. To add to the complexity of the process, a number of other factors influence the valuation of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies.</b> Nevertheless, by using Tobin’s q, the ratio between a company’s market value and its replacement cost, as a proxy for company value, we have tested the effect of renewable energy exposure on the company value of a number of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies.</b> The analysis has been performed by use of regression analysis and we have tried to isolate the effect of renewable exposure by adding control variables known to affect the valuation of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Whitby grew in {{size and}} wealth, {{extending}} its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle. Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town's twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the Resolutions catch produced 230tons of oil. The carcases yielded 42tons of whale bone used for 'stays' which {{were used in the}} corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant. Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby Whale Oil and <b>Gas</b> <b>Company</b> changed into the Whitby Coal and <b>Gas</b> <b>Company.</b> As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one whaling ship, the Phoenix, remained.|$|E

The environmental component is reported to be integrated in production, HR, information and other company policies, which results in "greening" both economic cooperation and place of production. The authors report the inverse relation between production dynamics and significance of the impact on water resources...|$|R

5|$|After the Gas Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The <b>gas</b> <b>company</b> provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the few major operations, {{the first decade of}} the boom was {{dominated}} by numerous small producers. As production expanded and new companies were formed, consolidation occurred. By the late 1920s, ten companies produced more than half of the oil in the state: Gulf Production Company, Humble Oil and Refining Company, Southern Crude Oil Purchasing Company (later absorbed by Amoco which was later absorbed by BP), the Texas Company, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Yount-Lee Oil Company, Magnolia Petroleum Company, J. K. Hughes Oil Company, Pure Oil Company, and Mid-Kansas Oil and <b>Gas</b> <b>Company</b> (later Marathon Oil).|$|E
5|$|In the 1910s, several power {{companies}} built lines through the area. The General Pipe Line Company completed an oil pipeline connecting the San Joaquin Valley's Midway-Sunset Oil Field with the port at San Pedro in 1913. Its alignment followed the Ridge Route north of Gorman {{and south of}} Reservoir Summit, a longer distance {{than any of the}} earlier transportation routes, but from Gorman south to the present location of Pyramid Lake, where it turned east to Reservoir Summit, it roughly followed the later Ridge Route Alternate. That same year, the Midway <b>Gas</b> <b>Company</b> opened a natural gas line, and the Pacific Light and Power Company opened a power line, both staying fairly close to the entire Ridge Route.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} Giffnock railway station in 1866 allowed {{business}} people to build sandstone villas and commute daily to the city. At the time, {{it was much}} more desirable to live in Giffnock than to live in the smog-polluted city. By the early 1890s, residential Giffnock began to grow around the railway station and Eastwood Toll, and by 1892 gas was introduced to the area. Gas street lamps were erected by Busby and District <b>Gas</b> <b>Company</b> in 1893; however, these were supported by a voluntary subscription that many households refused to pay, leaving many areas unlit. It was not until October 1896, when Eastwood Parish Council took over street lighting, that the area was consistently lit at night.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{eventually}} {{concentrated on}} the field of law, starting with work on wills and deeds. By 1933, he was senior partner in a 20-man Midtown Manhattan law firm. He developed the business habits of smoking cigars and of answering questions only after taking two puffs. During the Great Depression, O'Malley represented bankrupt companies and enriched himself, while building his thriving law practice. He invested wisely in firms such as the Long Island Rail Road, Brooklyn Borough <b>Gas</b> <b>Company,</b> the New York Subways Advertising Company, a building materials firm, a beer firm and some hotels. His success begot both influence and attention. The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O'Malley.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} of risk disclosures in {{the oil and gas}} companies‟ annual reports. For this study‟s purposes, 11 oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies</b> are examined. The sample consists of five oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies</b> listed on the London Stock Exchange, three oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies</b> listed on the New York Stock Exchange and two dual listed companies (listed on both UK and U. S. stock exchanges). Additionally, one company listed on the Cypriot Stock Exchange is also examined for certain hypotheses. The study‟s purpose is to examine the disclosures of the oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies,</b> and to identify whether there are differences between them due to the different regulatory regimes of their stock exchange. Moreover, the research questions try to identify whether U. S. and dual listed companies contain more risk disclosures and forward looking statements in their reports than UK listed companies. The annual reports of the oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies</b> are used to conduct this research, using content analysis. The annual reports of 2004 and 2008 are used. The 2004 reports are used because in 2005 there was a fatal catastrophe at one of BP‟s refineries which might have affected the quantity of risk disclosures in the annual reports of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>companies.</b> The 2008 reports are used because they are the most recent reports. Finally, most of the hypotheses of this study are rejected since U. S. -listed and dual listed companies do not disclose more risk related information in their reports than UK listed companies...|$|R
