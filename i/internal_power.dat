40|$|The most usual {{formulation}} of the Laws of Thermodynamics {{turns out to be}} suitable for local or simple materials, while for non-local systems there are two different ways: either modify this usual formulation by introducing suitable extra fluxes or express the Laws of Thermodynamics in terms of <b>internal</b> <b>powers</b> directly, as we propose in this paper. The first choice is subject to the criticism that the vector fluxes must be introduced a posteriori in order to obtain the compatibility with the Laws of Thermodynamics. On the contrary, the formulation in terms of <b>internal</b> <b>powers</b> is more general, because it is a priori defined {{on the basis of the}} constitutive equations. Besides it allows to highlight, without ambiguity, the contribution of the <b>internal</b> <b>powers</b> in the variation of the thermodynamic potentials. Finally, in this paper, we consider some examples of non-local materials and derive the proper expressions of their <b>internal</b> <b>powers</b> from the power balance laws.

5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans. With {{support from the}} pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and shifted {{their attention to the}} pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, the Knights gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory was used as a bargaining chip to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the <b>internal</b> <b>power</b> struggle.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{published}} The Messianic Legacy, {{a sequel}} to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.

However, the authors are led to believe by Plantard that he has resigned as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an <b>internal</b> <b>power</b> struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” as well as a campaign of character assassination against Plantard in the press and books written by skeptics.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine correlations between measures of external mechanical <b>power</b> output and <b>internal</b> mechanical joint <b>power</b> output across different loads during a weightlifting exercise. Ten subjects performed 3 sets of the clean exercise at 65, 75, and 85 % of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Peak external mechanical power output was calculated with 4 commonly used methods, whereas an inverse dynamics approach was used to calculate peak <b>internal</b> mechanical <b>power</b> output for the hip, knee, and ankle joints along with the peak of the sum of all <b>internal</b> joint <b>powers.</b> All peak mechanical power outputs were expressed as relative peak power by either ratio (watts per kilogram) or allometrically scaling to body mass (W·kg- 0. 67). Correlation coefficients were used to compare power output measures. The greatest numbers of significant correlations between <b>internal</b> and external <b>power</b> outputs were observed at 85 % of 1 RM, at this load hip and knee joint power outputs were correlated to external mechanical power output when calculated with the traditional work-energy method. In addition, the peak sum of all mechanical joint powers was correlated to mechanical power output when calculated with the impulse-momentum method at loads of 75 and 85 % of the 1 RM. Allometric scaling of power outputs yielded one more significant correlation than did the ratio scaled power outputs. These findings support the use of the work-energy method when making inferences about <b>internal</b> joint <b>powers</b> from external power outputs when loads equal to 85 % of 1 RM are being lifted. In addition, the impulse-momentum method may be used to make inferences about the sum of all <b>internal</b> joint <b>powers</b> from external power outputs when loads between 75 and 85 % of 1 RM are being lifted...|$|R
