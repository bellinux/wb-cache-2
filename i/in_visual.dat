40|$|Knowledge {{management}} (KM) {{is difficult}} to pin down. It means different things in different organisations. The deliberate use of metaphors {{has been used to}} communicate what KM is about. This metaphorical communication can be even more enriched using visual as well as language mechanisms: ”a picture paints a thousand words” suggests we can capture more resonances of a complex subject like KM through visuals than through a description alone. <b>In</b> addition, <b>visuals</b> are perceived to transcend the limitations of language, which can be an obstacle to communication. Yet, no method currently exists that we can use to identify KM metaphors used <b>in</b> <b>visuals.</b> This paper describes our search for a method to analyse metaphors used <b>in</b> <b>visuals</b> about knowledge management. Our objective was threefold: 1) identifying new metaphors for KM <b>in</b> <b>visuals</b> that can enrich KM theorizing, 2) developing a way to identify which visuals are the most powerful in communicating KM theory, and 3) improving the use of visuals as a way of assessing students studying KM. We found that analysing metaphors used <b>in</b> KM <b>visuals</b> is possible using a method that focuses on the dominant metaphors <b>in</b> a <b>visual...</b>|$|R

40|$|When a distractor was {{presented}} simultaneously with or directly following a target, it produced more interference when it {{was presented}} <b>in</b> the same <b>visual</b> hemifield as the target than {{when it was}} presented <b>in</b> the opposite <b>visual</b> field. This result is interpreted in terms of biased competition; there is more competition between stimuli when they are presented <b>in</b> the same <b>visual</b> field, rather than <b>in</b> opposite <b>visual</b> fields. However, when the distractor was presented 125 msec or more prior to the target, this pattern was reversed. In those cases, there was more distractor interference when target and distractor were presented <b>in</b> opposite <b>visual</b> fields. This {{can be explained by}} assuming that attention was captured by the distractor, and that there was an additional cost of reorienting to a location <b>in</b> the opposite <b>visual</b> field. © 2010 The Psychonomic Society, Inc...|$|R
5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite.

40|$|Before the {{completion}} of visual development, visual deprivation impairs synaptic elimination <b>in</b> the <b>visual</b> cortex. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether the distribution of central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) is also altered <b>in</b> the <b>visual</b> cortex <b>in</b> subjects with early-onset blindness. Positron emission tomography was carried out with [(15) O]water and [(11) C]flumazenil on six blind subjects and seven sighted controls at rest. We found that the CBF was significantly higher <b>in</b> the <b>visual</b> cortex for the early-onset blind subjects than for the sighted control subjects. However, there was no significant difference in the BZR distribution <b>in</b> the <b>visual</b> cortex for the subject with early-onset blindness than for the sighted control subjects. These results demonstrated that early visual deprivation does not affect the distribution of GABA(A) receptors <b>in</b> the <b>visual</b> cortex with the sensitivity of our measurements. Synaptic elimination may be independent of <b>visual</b> experience <b>in</b> the GABAergic system of the human visual cortex during visual development...|$|R

5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed. During estrus, females make whistle calls when <b>in</b> <b>visual</b> contact with a male. When exploring new environments and during handling, it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because {{of the amount of}} diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written <b>in</b> <b>Visual</b> Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E
