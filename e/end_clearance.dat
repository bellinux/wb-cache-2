40|$|Hardened {{steel is}} widely used in the {{manufacture}} of dies, mould and automotive components such as bearings, gears and shafts. The continuous improvements and developments in cutting tool technology coupled with the availability of suitable machine tools have made it possible to machine steel in its hardened form thereby eliminating the heat treatment step, which is required in the conventional approach. Commercially available plastic mould steel, Stavax ESR, which is a premium grade stainless tool steel, has been hardened to (43 ~ 45 HRC) and turned using two commercially available cutting tool inserts with various side cutting edge angles and at various cutting speeds and feed rates. Turning was performed dry and a constant depth of cut was set. The cutting tool inserts used were physical vapor deposition (PVD) multi coated TiCN based cermet grade with TiN inner layer, TiCN intermediate layer and a TiN outer layer (KT 315); and a cobalt enriched, multi coated carbide grade with thick moderate temperature chemical vapor deposition (MTCVD) - TiCN inner layer, an Al 2 O 3 intermediate layer and TiCN and TiN outer layers (KC 9110). Tool performance, tool failure modes and wear mechanisms of the said tools were investigated under various cutting conditions. The surface roughness of the turned part and the chip morphology were studied while the cutting forces were also measured. The performance of the cutting tools is described using response surface methodology. The cutting speed and feed are found {{have an effect on the}} various responses investigated. Additionally, the side cutting edge angle is also found to provide secondary contribution to the tool life and surface roughness. The use of - 5 o side cutting edge angle resulted in longest tool and better surface roughness. The mathematical models developed are statistically valid and sound, particularly for Fc. These are verified by the confirmation run experiments and therefore can be used for prediction within the limits of the factors investigated. KC 9110 outperformed KT 315 in terms of tool life for almost all of the cutting conditions tested. The only exception is at a low feed rate of 0. 09 mm/rev and a low cutting speed of 100 m/min where the tool life of KT 315 was more than 30 minutes and this was the longest tool life achievable. For KT 315, flank wear and catastrophic failure are the dominant failure modes whereas for KC 9110 it was <b>end</b> <b>clearance</b> wear and flank wear. Flank and <b>end</b> <b>clearance</b> wear probably occur by both abrasive and adhesive wear mechanisms with abrasive wear being the major source of material removal. Catastrophic failure could be associated with a combination of abrasion, adhesion, diffusion, fracture and plastic deformation wear mechanisms.

Cutting speed, feed and the side cutting edge angle (SCEA) of the tool were the independent variables considered. Regardless of the cutting tool material, cutting speed and feed expectedly {{have an effect on}} tool wear and tool life. Additionally, the SCEA is found to influence the tool life where the tool life increases, as the SCEA was changed from 0 Â° to - 5 Â°. The longest tool life was attainable when cutting with KT 315 at low cutting speed and feed rate when using - 5 Â° SCEA. However, in all other instances, KC 9110 outperforms KT 315. This is particularly evident at medium and high cutting speeds and feed. The constant and exponent for the various Taylor tool life equations have been determined. Flank wear, <b>end</b> <b>clearance</b> wear and catastrophic failure were the main types of tool failure mode determining tool life. The wear mechanisms for the various tool failure modes were suggested.

40|$|Clearance {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in pair-fed rats to examine {{the long-term effects of}} adrenalectomy and selective adrenal corticosteroid replacement in physiological amounts on renal potassium transport. To this <b>end,</b> <b>clearance</b> studies were conducted in rats that were sham operated, or adrenalectomized (ADX). ADX animals were given either vehicle, aldosterone (0. 5 microgram/ 100 g body wt per day), dexamethasone (1. 2 micrograms/ 100 g body wt per day), or aldosterone and dexamethasone, by osmotic minipump for 7 - 9 d whereupon clearance {{experiments were}} conducted. After chronic hormone treatment, during basal conditions when only Ringers solution was infused, all groups excreted similar amounts of potassium. However, in all ADX animals without mineralocorticoid replacement, the maintenance of urinary potassium excretion at control levels was associated with hyperkalemia, increased urine flow, and natriuresis; all are factors known to stimulate urinary potassium excretion. During acute potassium infusion, the increase in urinary potassium excretion was less in ADX rats than in controls. This functional deficiency in potassium excretion was partially corrected by dexamethasone and was uniformly associated with a significant increase in urine flow. Aldosterone replacement or aldosterone and dexamethasone given together chronically, sharply increased potassium excretion but did not restore excretion to control levels. Only acute aldosterone infusion (0. 2 microgram/ 100 g body wt bolus plus 0. 2 microgram/ 100 g body wt per hour), superimposed upon chronic aldosterone and dexamethasone treatment, fully restored potassium excretion to control levels. This aldosterone induced enhancement of potassium excretion, both chronic and acute, was not associated with hyperkalemia, and increased urine flow or natriuresis. Thus, physiological levels of both classes of adrenal corticosteroids stimulate renal potassium excretion albeit by different mechanisms. Mineralocorticoids stimulate tubular potassium excretion directly, whereas glucocorticoids augment excretion indirectly by increasing fluid and sodium delivery along the distal nephron...|$|E

Finally, when AFSCs were co-implanted with human-bone forming cells, a normo-osteosynthesis occurred, the engineered ossicle was hyper-vascularized, but AFSCs were not retrieved in the implant within 2 weeks. We concluded that AFSCs do not contribute to the deposition of new bone, but act as a powerful proinflammatory/proangiogenic boost, driving a host response, <b>ending</b> in AFSC <b>clearance</b> and vascularization of the bone environment.

The analytical model consists of a cantilevered beam, subjected to periodic excitation, and a bar that restrains the amplitude of the beam. Equation of {{the motion of the}} beam is discretised by the finite element method and impacts of the beam are computed by using the coefficient of restitution rule.

Then the responses are inspected with the frequency response curves, the Fourier spectra, the Lyapunov exponents and the principal component analysis. The numerical results are compared with the experimental results that are previously presented by the authors, which verify our numerical results. Effects of the location of the bar and of the clearance between the bar and the beam on the chaotic responses are examined by the numerical results. As the location of the bar becomes farther from the clamped <b>end</b> and the <b>clearance</b> becomes smaller, the frequency region of the impact vibration is enlarged.

For fillet end-mill, because of its complexity geometry in flank and fillet parts, a free-form geometry model is needed for further analysis and optimization. Many research works have been conducted on building geometric model based on grinding tool path. In this thesis, a parametric and easy controlled method is proposed for design and modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface. First, the <b>end</b> and side <b>clearance</b> surface need to be established according to geometric parameters and constraints; Secondly, the fillet cutting edge is designed to achieve the machining requirement of the corner radius geometry, which is critical for the modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface face; Then, the surface of the fillet flank is supported by splines which derived from the customized two-dimensional corner. And a rake angle based method is applied for modeling of the fillet rake surface. A detailed discussion on parametric variables of this method is provided for a more accurate surface.

The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate: 1) the effect of increasing doses of mannitol and repetitive coughing on the sputum physical properties; 2) if the changes in sputum properties can predict the efficacy of mucus clearance measured by radioaerosol technique in bronchiectasis patients. Sputum was collected from 14 patients, age: 63 ± 6 yr, who participated on the mucociliary and cough clearance studies at baseline, with mannitol (160, 320 and 480 mg) and control (Daviskas et al. ERJ 2008; 31 : 765 - 772). Sputum was collected: 1) on the screening visit before and after mannitol challenge (635 mg); 2) at the start and <b>end</b> of each <b>clearance</b> study after 100 repetitive voluntary coughs except on the control study (no mannitol or repetitive coughing). The sputum solids content, surface tension, contact angle and rheology were measured. Mannitol in association with coughing and coughing alone reduced the solids content, surface tension, contact angle and viscoelastic sputum properties (p< 0. 0001) and this effect, unlike mucociliary clearance, was not dose dependent. The control produced no effect. Total mucus clearance correlated only with the percentage reduction in surface tension on 480 mg mannitol and with the reduction in solids content at baseline. In conclusion: Inhaled mannitol and voluntary repetitive coughing improved the sputum physical properties in bronchiectasis patients and this effect was not dose dependent. Changes in sputum properties do not predict efficacy of mucociliary and cough clearance...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Previous {{studies have}} shown {{increased}} ET concentrations in plasma and renal tissues in ischemic or toxic acute renal failure (ARF). These increments were parallel to a reduction of renal blood flow and progression of renal dysfunction. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential beneficial effect of the novel selective ETA antagonist (UK- 350, 926), on tissue damages occurring during the early phase of ischemia-reperfusion induced ARF. Materials & Methods: In pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, I. P) anaesthetized male Charles River rats’ (290 - 340 g) abdomens were opened via a mid abdominal incision. The urinary bladder was cannulated and renal arteries and veins of both kidneys were carefully cleared. After 2 h rest, a 0. 5 h clearance period was taken for basal levels, followed by two 30 min periods, and then a 4 h experimental clearance period was considered. Finally, both kidneys were removed and fixed in paraffin for histological studies. The rats were divided into three groups (n= 6) : 1) Sham Group, 2) Ischemia/reperfusion Group (I/R), in which 30 min after the <b>end</b> of control <b>clearance</b> period, renal ischemia was induced by bilateral renal artery clamp for 30 min, and 3) drug treated Group (I/R+D) in which UK- 350, 926 (50 μg/kg. min) was infused I.

There was marked apoptosis and disappearance of brush border in proximal tubular cells in this group that was not observed in I/R+D and sham group. Conclusion: These findings show that administration of the ETA antagonist, UK- 350, 926, improved the renal tissue damages that were parallel to improved reabsorptive function of the kidney...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the liquid}} that fills the lung of the fetal sheep in late {{gestation}} is cleared by the <b>end</b> of labour. <b>Clearance</b> of this liquid has a beneficial effect on postnatal gas exchange and therefore represents an important adaptation for postnatal life. Despite its importance, there is disagreement about whether clearance begins prior to labour, or occurs entirely within labour. To address this issue, we made serial determinations of lung liquid volume by indicator dilution during late gestation and labour in the fetal sheep. Regression analysis demonstrated that lung liquid volume exhibited a plateau level in the near-term fetus before it began to decline. Two models provided a fit to the decline in volume. In one, lung liquid clearance occurred in two linear phases, the first beginning 70 h before the study was terminated when the ewe was in advanced labour, the second occupying the last 8 h of the study period. In the initial phase, average lung liquid volume fell from 38. 3 to 26. 4 ml kg− 1 before a rapid decline {{in the second phase}} reduced the volume to 13. 8 ml kg− 1. An exponential decay model was also found to fit the data; this showed a gradual decline in lung liquid volume in the 2 days preceding onset of labour, followed by a much more rapid decline within labour. The rate of lung liquid secretion also declined in two linear phases, both of which commenced earlier than the changes in lung liquid volume. An exponential decay model also gave a significant fit to the data, but the fit was significantly weaker than that achieved with the two-slope model. We conclude that clearance of lung liquid begins well before commencement of labour in the full term fetal sheep, and then accelerates once labour is established. In our study, lung liquid volume fell {{even in the absence of}} reabsorption of liquid across the pulmonary epithelium, indicating that outflow of liquid through the trachea must have occurred at a rate in excess of the secretion rate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Substantial {{reductions}} in thyroid volume (up to 70 - 80 %) after radioiodine therapy of Graves' hyperthyroidism are common {{and have been}} reported in the literature. A relationship between thyroid volume reduction and outcome of 131 I therapy of Graves' disease has been reported by some authors. This important result could be used to decide individually the optimal radioiodine activity A 0 (MBq) to administer to the patient, but a predictive model relating the change in gland volume to A 0 is required. Recently, a mathematical model of thyroid mass reduction during the clearance phase (30 - 35 days) after 131 I administration to patients with Graves' disease has been published and used as the basis for prescribing the therapeutic thyroid absorbed dose. It is well known that the thyroid volume reduction goes on until 1 year after therapy. In this paper, a mathematical model to predict the final mass of Graves' diseased thyroids submitted to 131 I therapy is presented. This model represents a tentative explanation of what occurs macroscopically after the <b>end</b> of the <b>clearance</b> phase of radioiodine in the gland (the so-called second-order effects). It is shown that the final thyroid mass depends on its basal mass, on the radiation dose absorbed by the gland and on a constant value alpha typical of thyroid tissue. Alpha has been evaluated based on a set of measurements made in 15 reference patients affected by Graves' disease and submitted to 131 I therapy. A predictive equation for the calculation of the final mass of thyroid is presented. It is based on macroscopic parameters measurable after a diagnostic 131 I capsule administration (0. 37 - 1. 85 MBq), before giving the therapy. The final mass calculated using this equation is compared to the final mass of thyroid measured 1 year after therapy administration in 22 Graves' diseased patients. The final masses calculated and measured 1 year after therapy are in fairly good agreement (R = 0. 81). The possibility, for the physician, to decide a therapeutic activity based on the desired decrease of thyroid mass instead of on a fixed thyroid absorbed dose could be a new opportunity to cure Graves' disease...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} iodide- 131 Hippuran {{has been used}} as a tracer to measure {{effective}} renal plasma flow (ERPF). Because of the low renal clearance of free I- 131 -iodide and the inability to count it separately from I- 131 -Hippuran, free I- 131 -iodide will lower the calculated I- 131 -Hippuran clearance, resulting in a lower estimated ERPF. This study was performed to establish the maximum allowable radiochemical impurity of free I- 131 -iodide in I- 131 -Hippuran preparations for ERPF measurements in continuous clearance studies. A known amount of I- 123 -iodide was added to the (I- 131 -iodide-free) I- 131 -Hippuran solution used for continuous infusion clearance studies in nine patients. I- 123 -iodide activity was used because it can be counted separately from (131) -I-Hippuran in the infusion solutions and plasma samples while it behaves exactly like I- 131 -iodide, so that the results obtained with I- 123 -iodide can be extrapolated to I- 131 -iodide. After performing the clearance studies, the ERPF was calculated firstly with I- 131 -Hippuran activity only (=true ERPF) and secondly including the free radioactive iodide activity (=false ERPF) in the clearance formula, As expected, if free I- 131 -iodide is present in the infusion solution, its concentration in plasma will be highest at the <b>end</b> of the <b>clearance</b> study. The I- 131 -iodide concentration in plasma relative to the I- 131 -Hippuran concentration will be higher in patients with high ERPF values. I- 131 -iodide in the infusion solution causes a fall in the ERPF as measured by the continuous infusion technique: 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % of free I- 131 -iodide in the infusion solution result in a reduction in ERPF of about 1. 5 %, 3. 5 % and 7 % respectively after 1. 5 h and of 3. 5 %, 6. 5 % and 13 % respectively after 5. 5 h if ERPF is high. It is concluded that a maximum of 0. 5 % of free I- 131 -iodide in I- 131 -Hippuran preparations is permissible if ERPF is to be measured with an error of less than 5 %...|$|R
