30|$|In {{order to}} {{suppress}} <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> and mitigate their impacts, a robust method for locating {{the sources of}} <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> is needed. Fundamentally, <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{can be caused by}} an external perturbation in generator sites.|$|R
30|$|<b>Forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} and reported in power grids. One of the earliest studies on <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> dates back to 1966 when Ness studied the responses of power systems to cyclic load variations [6]. To study the situation where frequency of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> is close to natural frequency of generator rotor oscillations, Vournas et al. introduced cyclic load, low-speed diesel generators and wind turbines, which is driving the synchronous generator, as possible sources of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> [8]. The Pinneilo et al. cited the nuclear accelerator as source of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> [10]. Power systems behaviors for steady state analysis, dynamic simulation and controller design have been considered in [11], where steel plants, nuclear accelerators, cement mills and aluminum processing plants are cited as sources of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Putting limit on generator field voltage in a single-machine infinite-bus system can induce stable limit cycle that consequently is a cause of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> via Hopf bifurcation [12]. To analyze the characteristics of regulating systems, the electro-hydraulic regulating system of a steam turbine is mentioned as a source of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> in [13]. Poorly designed PSS can induce amplification of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> [14]. Authors of [14] noted that traditional PSS control loops introduce additional poles and zeros which can resonate with cyclic inputs. To avoid possible resonance, authors in [14] provided adjusted PSS design. Rostamkolai et al. proposed {{that the impact of}} cyclic load, which is caused by a synchrotron in the power systems, is significant, especially in resonance situations with electromechanical oscillations [15]. In [16], incomplete islanding has been cited as a possible source of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the power system. To simulate the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations,</b> mechanical power of a generator is modulated with a sinusoidal signal in [17]. These studies showed that <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> may come from different sources.|$|R
50|$|The {{signals from}} two {{separated}} transmitters T1 and T2, T2 transmitting CW or quasi-CW signals, interact nonlinearly in the ionosphere or magnetosphere. If the wave vector {{and frequency of}} the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> at the difference frequency of the two signals satisfies the dispersion relation for electrostatic waves, such waves would exist and begin to propagate. This wave could grow in amplitude due to wave-particle interaction. At a later time it could interact with the CW signal and propagate to T1.|$|E
50|$|With normal rifles, {{the barrel}} rests {{in contact with}} the stock. If the stock is {{manufactured}} of wood, environmental conditions or operational use may shift alignment of the stock, which may cause the barrel to shift its alignment slightly over time as well, altering the projectile flightpath and impact point. Contact between the barrel and the stock also interferes with the natural frequency of the barrel, which can have a detrimental effect on accuracy in some cases. The interference of the stock with the barrel's <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> as the bullet passes down the bore can cause the barrel to vibrate inconsistently from shot to shot, depending on the external forces acting upon the stock {{at the time of the}} shot. Micro-vibrations acting during the bullet's passage result in differences in trajectory as the bullet exits the bore, which changes the point of impact downrange.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Detection {{of smoking}} effects {{is of utmost}} {{importance}} {{in the prevention of}} cigarette-induced chronic airway obstruction. The <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique offers a simple and detailed approach to investigate the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. However, there have been no data concerning the use of the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique to evaluate respiratory mechanics in groups with different degrees of tobacco consumption. OBJECTIVES: (1) to evaluate the ability of the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique to detect smoking-induced respiratory alterations, with special emphasis on early alterations; and (2) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique and spirometric parameters. METHODS: One hundred and seventy subjects were divided into five groups according to the number of pack-years smoked: four groups of smokers classified as 60 pack-years and a control group. The four groups of smokers were compared with the control group using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The early adverse effects of smoking in the group with 60 pack-years, the diagnostic performance of the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique was similar to that observed with spirometry. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique parameters were able to detect early smoking-induced respiratory involvement when pathologic changes are still potentially reversible. These findings support the use of the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique as a versatile clinical diagnostic tool in helping with chronic obstructive lung disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment...|$|E
3000|$|This paper {{presented}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> in power systems. Basically five major areas are discussed: ➀ the source of forced oscillations; ➁ detecting methods for forced oscillations; ➂ distinguishing methods of forced oscillations; ➃ locating methods for forced oscillations; ⑤ the impact of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> on power systems. In addition, future opportunities to study [...] <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> are discussed. It can be concluded that in a large power system, GCEs (such as PSS and AVR) are often reported as the sources of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> in recent years. As it has been reported, the resonance between <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> and electromechanical modes can cause catastrophic events. In addition, <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> in a power system have negative impacts on mode estimation algorithms. Thus, they should be detected and located in their early stage.|$|R

30|$|It can be {{observed}} that both cyclic load and generator control equipment (GCE) were reported as the sources of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations.</b> In addition, in the recent years, GCEs such as PSS and automatic voltage regulators (AVR) are reported more often as the sources of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations.</b> In other words, {{the sources of the}} <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> mainly are located on the generator sides.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary {{involvement}} in rheumatoid arthritis is {{directly responsible for}} 10 % to 20 % of all mortality. The best way to improve the prognosis is early detection and treatment. The <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique is easy to perform and offers a detailed exam, which may be helpful in the early detection of respiratory changes. This study was undertaken to (1) evaluate the clinical potential of the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique in the detection of early respiratory alterations in rheumatoid arthritis patients with respiratory complaints and (2) to compare the sensitivity of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique and spirometric parameters. METHODS: A total of 40 individuals were analyzed: 20 healthy and 20 with rheumatoid arthritis (90 % with respiratory complaints). The clinical usefulness of the parameters was evaluated by investigating the sensibility, the specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 01641705. RESULTS: The early adverse respiratory effects of rheumatoid arthritis were adequately detected by the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique parameters, and a high accuracy for clinical use was obtained (AUC. 0. 9, Se = 80 %, Sp = 95 %). The use of spirometric parameters did not obtain an appropriate accuracy for clinical use. The diagnostic performance of the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique parameters {{was significantly higher than}} that of spirometry. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of the present study}} provide substantial evidence that the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique can contribute to the easy identification of initial respiratory abnormalities in rheumatoid arthritis patients that are not detectable by spirometric exams. Therefore, we believe that the <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> technique can be used as a complementary exam that may help to improve the treatment of breathing disorders in rheumatoid arthritis patients...|$|E

30|$|Oscillations {{classification}} is {{very important}} to the reliable operation of power systems because control strategy for suppressing different types of oscillations can be significantly different. Using support vector machine (SVM), [33] proposed a method that can classify two different types of oscillations based on feature extraction. Basically, increasing amplitude of free oscillations is used to distinguish it from <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations.</b> In this case, algorithm accuracy has direct relationship with envelope size. Thus, there is a question of whether this algorithm can work in real-time scenarios. Reference [34] proposed unique mathematical models for <b>forced</b> and free <b>oscillations.</b> In addition, they showed that the responses of the system to <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> differs from those of free oscillations. Based on noise response and harmonic nature of oscillations, the authors proposed a method to distinguish <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> from free oscillations. However, there is question of how to separate the pure sinusoid from noise in both cases (free and <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations)</b> and the effects of this separation on algorithm accuracy should be considered. In addition, it is important to evaluate the performance of proposed method when <b>forced</b> <b>oscillations</b> exist at a system’s mode frequency.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In an {{increasingly}} old society, {{the study of}} the respiratory system changes and new techniques dedicated to older patients are of interest in physiologic studies {{as well as in the}} diagnosis of respiratory diseases. OBJECTIVES: (1) To investigate the impact of ageing on the resistive and reactive properties of the respiratory system, and (2) to compare the easiness of accomplishment of spirometry and <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> for assessing lung function. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in which <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> was used to investigate respiratory system resistive and reactive properties, while spirometry was used as a reference test to evaluate 80 normal subjects aged between 20 and 86 years. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the easiness of accomplishment of spirometry and <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation.</b> RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the respiratory system resonance frequency (p< 0. 003) and a reduction in the mean reactance (p< 0. 004) with increasing age. Respiratory system resistance and dynamic compliance were not related to the ageing process. The easiness of accomplishment of <b>forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> measurements was greater than that of spirometry. This result was particularly relevant in subjects over 70 years old (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory system resistance and dynamic compliance are not modified with ageing. On the other hand, respiratory system homogeneity decreases during the ageing process. <b>Forced</b> <b>oscillation</b> is easy to perform and provides information complementary to spirometry. This technique may be a promising alternative and/or complement to other conventional exams used to evaluate older people who are unable to adequately perform spirometric tests...|$|E
