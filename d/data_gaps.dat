500|$|In 2012, several peer-reviewed {{independent}} {{studies were}} published showing that neonicotinoids had previously undetected routes of exposure affecting bees including through dust, pollen, and nectar and that subnanogram toxicity resulted in failure {{to return to}} the hive without immediate lethality, one primary symptom of CCD. Research also showed environmental persistence in agricultural irrigation channels and soil. These reports prompted a formal peer review by the European Food Safety Authority, which stated in January 2013 that some neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and identified several <b>data</b> <b>gaps</b> not previously considered. Their review concluded, [...] "A high acute risk to honey bees was identified from exposure via dust drift for the seed treatment uses in maize, oilseed rape and cereals. A high acute risk was also identified from exposure via residues in nectar and/or pollen." [...] Dave Goulson, an author of one of the studies that prompted the EFSA review, has suggested that industry science pertaining to neonicotinoids may have been deliberately deceptive, and the UK Parliament has asked manufacturer Bayer Cropscience to explain discrepancies in evidence they have submitted to an investigation.|$|E

40|$|Governments {{worldwide}} are recognising {{ecosystem services}} as {{an approach to}} address sustainability challenges. Decision-makers need credible and legitimate measurements of ecosystem services to evaluate decisions for trade-offs to make wise choices. Managers lack these measurements because of a <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> linking ecosystem characteristics to final ecosystem services. The dominant method to address the <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> is benefit transfer using ecological data from one location to estimate ecosystem services at other locations with similar land cover. However, benefit transfer is only valid once the <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> is adequately resolved. Disciplinary frames separating ecology from economics and policy have resulted in confusion on concepts and methods preventing progress on the <b>data</b> <b>gap.</b> In this study, we present a 10 -step approach to unify concepts, methods and data from the disparate disciplines to offer guidance on overcoming the <b>data</b> <b>gap.</b> We suggest: (1) estimate ecosystem characteristics using biophysical models, (2) identify final ecosystem services using endpoints and (3) connect them using ecological production functions to quantify biophysical trade-offs. The guidance is strategic for public policy because analysts need to be: (1) realistic when setting priorities, (2) attentive to timelines to acquire relevant data, given resources and (3) responsive {{to the needs of}} decision-makers...|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{information}} {{has become a}} centralr ationalef or environmental regulation, and scientific uncertainty {{is viewed as a}} major obstacle in developing, justifying, and enforcing environmental laws and policies. In the context of environmental regulation, scientific information may be analyzed as subject to both supply and demand. A regulatory system that supplies more scientific information than it demands can operate effectively to impose protective regulation. By contrast, a system that demands more information than it supplies will face a 2 ̆ 2 <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> 2 ̆ 2 and will fail to accomplish its protective goals. The <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> can be addressed by applying regulatory techniques that increase the supply of data by providing more information (2 ̆ 7 filling 2 ̆ 2 the gap) or that reduce the demand by permitting regulation to proceed despite uncertainty and incomplete information (2 ̆ 2 bridging 2 ̆ 2 the gap). Environmental law is also structured by the divide between pollution control and chemical regulation on the one hand, and resource management on the other. In addressing the <b>data</b> <b>gap,</b> therefore, it is necessary to distinguish not only between supply and demand, but also between chemical and conservation issues. The existence of a <b>data</b> <b>gap</b> between the scientific information necessary for effective environmental regulation and the information available to regulators and the public presents an opportunity to study the causes and extent of the differences in the chemical and conservation regulatory systems.

40|$|Throughout the {{developing}} world, women, working together with men, play the dual roles of agricultural producers and household caregivers {{and are the}} key to securing household food security and nutrition. At the same time, the division of rights, resources, and responsibilities between men and women often results in higher vulnerability of women and girls to undernutrition, micronutrient malnutrition, poor health, and a general lack of time to accomplish their daily tasks. As the global community mobilizes in support of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 on gender equality and women’s rights, at least 11 of the 17 SDGs include indicators related to gender dynamics-the social relations between men and women.
