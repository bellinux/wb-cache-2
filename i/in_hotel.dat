A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and <b>in</b> <b>hotel</b> areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge for alcoholic beverages.

40|$|Convention travel {{has been}} growing rapidly {{throughout}} the world {{in recent years and}} becoming a critical component of the hospitality and travel industry. Hosting of conventions, especially international conventions, can be used by host countries as part of a strategic marketing plan to publicize modern development, traditional culture, and tourism resources. It also stimulates economic growth in the hosting country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the differences between the expenditures of delegates staying <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> and delegates not staying <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> <b>in</b> each category. It was expected that most of delegates staying <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> were foreigners and most of delegates not staying <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> were local people. A questionnaire was developed by using the categories of the 1993 IACVB Convention Income Survey as a base and executed in Taiwan. The subsequent data allowed the comparison between expenditures of the delegates staying <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> and the delegates not staying <b>in</b> <b>hotels.</b> Overall, the average spending per delegate was US$ 621. 62 in this sample study. The delegate staying <b>in</b> a <b>hotel</b> spent an average of 6. 79 times the amount the delegate not staying <b>in</b> a <b>hotel</b> <b>in</b> this 4 day meeting. Recommendations for further studies were suggested. Additional research would help Taiwan determine the economic impact of the convention industry on the local economy in the future. Such research would also serve as a base for the convention industry positioning itself to receive future government support...|$|R

5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices <b>in</b> <b>hotel</b> rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|E

Kinne encountered Francisco Parades Ordoñez, a Mexican-born American citizen, at a bar that night and accompanied {{him back to his}} room <b>in</b> <b>Hotel</b> La Vada. According to Kinne's account, she went with Ordoñez to see photographs he offered to show her, but he soon began to make sexual advances toward her and she was forced to fire her gun at him in an attempt to protect herself. Kinne maintained later that she had had no intention of killing or harming Ordoñez, and had intended only to frighten him, but her bullets struck him in the chest and killed him. Responding to the sound of gunfire, hotel employee Enrique Martinez Rueda entered the room. Kinne fired again and hit Rueda in the shoulder. Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and called the police.|$|E
