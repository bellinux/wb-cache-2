60|$|Then, harking back, Jamie's {{thoughts}} {{returned to}} the dinner of the previous evening at the Clibborns. He was the only guest, and when he arrived, found Mary and the Colonel by themselves in the drawing-room. It was an old habit of Mrs. Clibborn's not to appear till after her visitors, thinking that so she created a greater effect. The Colonel wore a very high collar, which made his head look like some queer flower on a long white stalk; hair and eyebrows were freshly dyed, and glistened like the oiled locks of a young Jewess. He was the perfect dandy, even to his bejewelled fingers and his scented handkerchief. His manner was a happy mixture of cordiality and condescension, {{by the side of}} which Mary's unaffected simplicity contrasted oddly. She seemed less at home in an evening dress than in the walking costume she vastly preferred; her free, rather masculine movements were ungainly in the silk frock, badly made and countrified, while lace and ribbons suited her most awkwardly. She was out of place, too, in that room, decorated with all the abominations of pseudo-fashion, with draperies and tissue-paper, uncomfortable little chairs and rickety tables. In every available place stood photographs of Mrs. Clibborn--Mrs. Clibborn sitting, standing, lying; Mrs. Clibborn full face, three-quarter <b>face,</b> <b>side</b> face; Mrs. Clibborn in this costume or in that costume--grave, gay, thoughtful, or smiling; Mrs. Clibborn showing her beautiful teeth, her rounded arms, her vast shoulders; Mrs. Clibborn dressed to the nines, and Mrs. Clibborn as undressed as she dared.|$|E
6000|$|About noon {{appeared}} Chico Furano, son of {{the late}} Chico de Ouro, in his quality of [...] "English linguister;" [...] a low position to which want of [...] "savvy" [...] has reduced him. His studies of our tongue are represented by an eternal [...] "Yes!" [...] his wits by the negative; he boasts of knowing how to [...] "tratar com o branco" [...] and, declining to bargain, he robs double. He is a short, small, dark man with mountaineer legs, a frightful psora, and an inveterate habit of drink. He saluted his superior, Nelongo, with immense ceremony, dating probably from the palmy times of the Mwani-Congo. Equals squat before one another, and shaking hands crosswise clap palms. Chico Furano kneels, places both [...] "ferients" [...] upon the earth and touches his nose-tip; he then traces three ground-crosses with the Jovian finger; again touches his nose; beats his [...] "volæ" [...] on the dust, and draws them along the cheeks; then he bends down, applying firstly the right, secondly the left <b>face</b> <b>side,</b> and lastly the palms and dorsa of the hands to mother earth. Both superior and inferior end with the Sakila or batta-palmas,[FN#26] three bouts of three claps {{in the best of}} time separated by the shortest of pauses, and lastly a [...] "tiger" [...] of four claps. The ceremony is more elaborate than the [...] "wallowings" [...] and dust- shovellings described by Ibn Batuta at the Asiatic courts, by Jobson at Tenda,by Chapperton at Oyo,by Denham amongst the Mesgows, and by travellers to Dahome and to the Cazembe. Yet the system is virtually the same in these distant kingdoms, which do not know one another's names.|$|E

50|$|Since {{this article}} was first written in 2008, there have been {{attempts}} {{to get around the}} rule by the production of a stick which 'in a natural resting position' has a <b>face</b> <b>side</b> that is not parallel to the flat surface measured from but rests with the face at a sharp angle. The result of the sloping of the <b>face</b> <b>side</b> is to put one edge of it closer than 25 mm to the flat surface and permit a much deeper bow than would otherwise be possible.
