The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the presence of vascular smooth muscle vasoconstrictor <b>endothelin</b> subtype <b>B</b> <b>receptors</b> in mesenteric resistance arteries and to assess whether <b>endothelin</b> subtype <b>B</b> receptor–mediated responses differ between spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Contractile responses to the <b>endothelin</b> subtype <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist sarafotoxin S 6 c and endothelin- 1 were measured simultaneously with [Ca 2 +]i in endothelium-denuded mesenteric resistance arteries from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. To simulate in vivo conditions matched as closely as possible to in vitro conditions, vessels were mounted in a vessel flow chamber in which intraluminal pressure was maintained at 60 mm Hg. Contraction was determined by video imaging to record lumen diameter, and [Ca 2 +]i was measured by the fura 2 method. Basal [Ca 2 +]i was significantly higher (P&# 60;. 01) in hypertensive (170 ± 4 nmol/L) compared with normotensive rats (134 ± 3 nmol/L). The <b>endothelin</b> subtype <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist sarafotoxin S 6 c increased [Ca 2 +]i in a concentration-dependent manner. Sarafotoxin S 6 c–induced [Ca 2 +]i and contractile responses were significantly lower in hypertensive compared with normotensive rats. These data demonstrate that <b>endothelin</b> subtype <b>B</b> <b>receptors</b> are present in vascular smooth muscle of small arteries and that <b>endothelin</b> subtype <b>B</b> receptor–mediated vasoconstriction occurs through intracellular calcium signaling pathways.

40|$|Abstract Background Up-regulation of {{vascular}} <b>endothelin</b> type <b>B</b> (ET <b>B)</b> <b>receptors</b> is {{implicated in}} the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Culture of intact arteries {{has been shown to}} induce similar receptor alterations and has therefore been suggested as a suitable method for, ex vivo, in detail delineation of the regulation of endothelin receptors. We hypothesize that mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) are involved in the regulation of <b>endothelin</b> ET <b>B</b> <b>receptors</b> in human internal mammary arteries. Methods Human internal mammary arteries were obtained during coronary artery bypass graft surgery and were studied before and after 24 hours of organ culture, using in vitro pharmacology, real time PCR and Western blot techniques. Sarafotoxin 6 c and endothelin- 1 were used to examine the endothelin ET A and ET <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> effects, respectively. The involvement of PKC and MAPK in the endothelin receptor regulation was examined by culture in the presence of antagonists. Results The endohtelin- 1 -induced contraction (after <b>endothelin</b> ET <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> desensitization) and the endothelin ET A receptor mRNA expression levels were not altered by culture. The sarafotoxin 6 c contraction, <b>endothelin</b> ET <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> protein and mRNA expression levels were increased after organ culture. This increase was antagonized by; (1) PKC inhibitors (10 μM bisindolylmaleimide I and 10 μM Ro- 32 - 0432), and (2) inhibitors of the p 38, extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2) and C-jun terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK pathways (10 μM SB 203580, 10 μM PD 98059 and 10 μM SP 600125, respectively). Conclusion In conclusion, PKC and MAPK seem {{to be involved in the}} up-regulation of <b>endothelin</b> ET <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> expression in human internal mammary arteries. Inhibiting these intracellular signal transduction pathways may provide a future therapeutic target for hindering the development of vascular <b>endothelin</b> ET <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> changes in cardiovascular disease. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{ovarian cancer}} {{elevated}} VEGF levels and {{expression of the}} immune regulatory ligand B7H3 (CD276), or the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> (ETBR) on tumor vessels correlate with decreased T cell infiltration and worse clinical outcome. Pharmacological inhibition of ETBR increased T cell adhesion to endothelial cells in an intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)-dependent manner, increasing TIL numbers in mice and a corresponding tumor response. Anti-angiogenic inhibitors targeting VEGF and its receptor VEGFR2 (approved for treatment of multiple cancers) induce vascular normalization. This, in turn, increases TILs and improves ACT and vaccine efficacy in preclinical models. VEGF impairs DC maturation, offering another means to enhance intratumoral immune responses. Deleting the regulator of G-protein signaling, Rgs5 reduced vessel leakiness and hypoxia, enhanced T cell infiltration into mouse pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and prolonged animal survival. Vascular normalization is thus likely more effective than vessel destruction. Targeted delivery of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was reported to normalize tumor blood vessels, increase CD8+ T cell infiltration and enhance vaccine and ACT therapies, unlike inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ).|$|E

Endothelin receptor antagonism has emerged as an important therapeutic strategy in pulmonary arterial hypertension.

In this study we identified the action of Bosentan on <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> using docking studies with homology modeled <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor.</b> Through the modeled protein, the flexible Docking study was performed with Bosentan and its derivatives with theoretically predicted active sites. The results indicated that amino acid ARG 82, ARG 84 and HIS 197 present in <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> are core important for binding activities and these residues are having strong hydrogen bond interactions with Bosentan. We have investigated the Bosentan and its derivatives interactions and scoring parameters using gold docking package.

We have previously shown that after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, there is an upregulation of endothelin receptors in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the PKC inhibitor Ro- 32 - 0432 on endothelin receptor upregulation, infarct volume and neurology outcome after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat. Results At 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the contractile <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> mediated response and the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> protein expression were upregulated in the ipsilateral but not the contralateral middle cerebral artery. In Ro- 32 - 0432 treated rats, the upregulated endothelin receptor response was attenuated. Furthermore, Ro- 32 - 0432 treatment decreased the ischemic brain damage significantly and improved neurological scores. Immunohistochemistry showed fainter staining of <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> protein in the smooth muscle cells of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery of Ro- 32 - 0432 treated rats compared to control. Conclusion The results suggest that treatment with Ro- 32 - 0432 in ischemic stroke decreases the ischemic infarction area, neurological symptoms and associated <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> upregulation. This provides a new perspective on possible mechanisms of actions of PKC inhibition in cerebral ischemia. </p...|$|E

Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify endothelin receptor expression in rat airway smooth muscle cells following Sephadex-induced inflammation. Compared with controls, Sephadex-induced airway inflammation caused a significant increase (3. 9 times P< 0. 05) of <b>endothelin</b> <b>receptor</b> type <b>B</b> mRNA expression in bronchial smooth muscle cells, but not in tracheal smooth muscle cells. Functional myograph studies of bronchial and tracheal ring segments without epithelium (mechanically denuded) revealed an increase of the maximum contractile effects of endothelin- 1 (a dual agonist for both endothelin type A and <b>B</b> <b>receptors)</b> and sarafotoxin 6 c (a selective agonist for <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptors)</b> in bronchial smooth muscle cells in Sephadex-induced inflammation, but not in tracheal smooth muscle cells. The enhanced maximal responses of bronchial smooth muscle cells to endothelin- 1 and sarafotoxin 6 c in Sephadex-induced inflammation support our molecular findings and hence imply a role for <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptors</b> in airway hyperreactivity during airway inflammation...|$|R

40|$|When {{mutations}} {{in two different}} genes produce the same mutant phenotype, it suggests that the encoded proteins either interact with each other, or act in parallel to fulfill a similar purpose. Haploinsufficiency of Neurofibromin and over-expression of Endothelin 3 both cause increased numbers of melanocytes to populate the dermis during mouse development, and thus {{we are interested in}} how these two signaling pathways might intersect. Neurofibromin is mutated in the human genetic disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by the development of Schwann cell based tumors and skin hyper-pigmentation. Neurofibromin is a GTPase activating protein, while the Endothelin 3 ligand activates <b>Endothelin</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>B,</b> a G protein coupled receptor. In order to study the genetic interactions between endothelin and neurofibromin, we defined the deletion breakpoints of the classical Ednrb piebald lethal allele (Ednrb(s-l)) and crossed these mice to mice with a loss-of-function mutation in neurofibromin, Dark skin 9 (Dsk 9). We found that Neurofibromin haploinsufficiency requires <b>Endothelin</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>B</b> to darken the tail dermis. In contrast, Neurofibromin haploinsufficiency increases the area of the coat that is pigmented in <b>Endothelin</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>B</b> null mice.

40|$|In both {{mice and}} humans, {{mutations}} {{in the genes}} encoding the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> and its ligand endothelin 3 lead to deficiencies in neural crest- derived melanocytes and enteric neurons. The discrete steps at which endothelins exert their functions in melanocyte development were examined in mouse neural crest cell cultures. Such cultures, kept {{in the presence of}} fetal calf serum, gave rise to cells expressing the early melanoblast marker Dct+ {{even in the absence of}} the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) or endothelins. However, these early Dct+ cells did not proliferate and pigmented cells never formed unless TPA or endothelins were added. In fact, endothelin 2 was as potent as TPA in promoting the generation of both Dct+ melanoblasts and pigmented cells, and endothelin 1 or endothelin 3 stimulated the generation of melanoblasts and of pigmented cells to an even greater extent. The inhibition of this stimulation by the selective <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist BQ- 788 (N-cis- 2, 6 - dimethylpiperidinocarbonyl-L-α-methylleucyl-D- 1 -methoxycarbonyltryptophanyl- D-norleucine) suggested that the three endothelins all signal through the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor.</b> This receptor was indeed expressed in Dct+ melanoblasts, in addition to cells lacking Dct expression.

We have previously reported that keratinocyte-derived endothelins are intrinsic paracrine mitogens and melanogens for human melanocytes and that they play an essential role in stimulating ultraviolet-B-induced melanogenesis. In this study, we have used immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis to clarify the role of the endothelin cascade, including endothelin production, processing by endothelin-converting enzyme, and expression of the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor,</b> in the hyperpigmentary mechanism(s) involved in lentigo senilis. The number of tyrosinase immunopositive melanocytes in lentigo senilis lesional skin was increased 2 -fold over the perilesional epidermis. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to endothelin- 1 demonstrated relatively stronger staining in the lesional epidermis than in the perilesional epidermis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis concomitantly demonstrated accentuated expression of transcripts for endothelin- 1 and for the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> in lentigo senilis lesional skin, which was accompanied by a similar accentuated expression of tyrosinase mRNA compared with the perilesional control. The endothelin- 1 -inducible cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α, was consistently upregulated in the lentigo senilis lesional epidermis as determined at the transcriptional level and by immunostaining, whereas interleukin- 1 α was downregulated. In contrast, endothelin-converting enzyme 1 α mRNA was not substantially increased in the lesional epidermis. These findings suggest that an accentuation of the epidermal endothelin cascade, especially with respect to expression of endothelin and the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor,</b> {{plays an important role in}} the mechanism involved in the hyperpigmentation of lentigo senilis...|$|E

In primary cultures of murine neural crest cells, L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine-positive cells were increased after 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 treatment. These findings indicate that 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 stimulates the differentiation of immature melanocyte precursors. Moreover, immunostaining and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> expression was induced in NCC-/melb 4 cells following treatment with 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3. The induction of <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> by 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 was also demonstrated in neural crest cell primary cultures, but not in mature melanocytes.

Unfortunately, there is no available pharmacologic approach to prevent or limit renal IR injury in common clinical practice.

In a rat model of renal IR, we investigated whether the administration of the novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist BR- 4628 can prevent or treat the renal dysfunction and tubular injury induced by IR. Renal injury induced by ischemia was associated with increased oxidant damage, which led to a cysteine sulfenic acid modification in <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> and consequently decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation.

40|$|Summary: The paracrine renal endothelin {{system has}} been implicated in acute and chronic kidney diseases. How-ever, there are only few data about the {{expression}} of endothelin receptor subtypes {{and their impact on}} renal function in the normal rat kidney. Therefore, we analyzed the age-dependent expression of endothelin receptors (<b>endothelin</b> <b>receptor</b> A and <b>B)</b> using Scatchard analysis, in vitro and in vivo receptor autoradiography. Furthermore, we investi-gated the effects of the mixed (A/B) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan on haemodynamic and renal function in conscious chronically instrumented rats.

Nitric oxide contributes to the regulation of multiple pathways {{that are relevant to}} myogenic autoregulation. We examined the signal transduction mechanism of nitric oxide on myogenic autoregulation in the present thesis. Because some paracrine factors contribute to the renal autoregulation, we first isolate the effects of nitric oxide from other paracrine factors. The pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to nitric oxide synthase inhibition are independent of angiotensin II. There is an interaction between nitric oxide and endothelin, mediated by <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptors,</b> that affects renal blood flow and renal autoregulation.

However, the similarity between the distal colonic aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease and that due to EDN 3 or EDNRB mutations led to the hypothesis that levels of expression of these genes might be affected in the absence of mutation, thus causing the Hirschsprung disease phenotype. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine EDN 3 and EDNRB messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in tissue samples from patients with sporadic Hirschsprung disease. Methods: RNA and DNA were isolated from the ganglionic and aganglionic colonic segments of ten children with sporadic Hirschsprung disease, and from the colon of ten age-matched controls. The DNA was analysed for mutations in the genes coding for endothelin- 3 (ET- 3) and <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> (ET-B) proteins. Relative levels of EDN 3 and EDNRB mRNA were determined by semiquantitative transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Three children had sequence variants in EDN 3 and EDNRB.

As {{is the case for}} ETBR-LP, the new receptor is strongly expressed in the human central nervous system (e. g. in cerebellar Bergmann glia, cerebral cortex, internal capsule fibers). Membranes of HEK- 293 cells stably expressing ETBR-LP- 2 did not bind endothelin- 1, endothelin- 2, endothelin- 3, bombesin, cholecystokinin- 8 or gastrin-releasing peptide...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} for sustained Ca 2 + influx activated by G protein-coupled receptors was examined. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant human <b>endothelin</b> type <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> (ETBR) and endogenous P 2 Y receptor (P 2 Y-R), endothelin- 1 elicited a sustained Ca 2 + influx depending on Gq/ 11 protein, phospholipase C (PLC), Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p 38 MAPK), whereas P 2 Y-R-induced sustained Ca 2 + influx was negligible. Functional {{study showed that}} NHE activation by ETBR was mediated via p 38 MAPK but not Gq/ 11 /PLC, while that by P 2 Y-R involves only Gq/ 11 /PLC/p 38 MAPK. These results suggest that Gq/ 11 /PLC-independent NHE activation via p 38 MAPK {{plays an important role}} in ETBR-mediated sustained Ca 2 + influx...|$|R
40|$|ABCD {{syndrome}} is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut (Hirschsprung disease [HSCR]), and deafness. This phenotype clearly overlaps with {{the features of}} the Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, comprising sensorineural deafness; hypopigmentation of skin, hair, and irides; and HSCR. Therefore, we screened DNA of the index patient of the ABCD syndrome family for mutations in the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> (EDNRB) gene, a gene known to be involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome. A homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 3 (R 201 X) of the EDNRB gene was found. We therefore suggest that ABCD {{syndrome is}} not a separate entity, but an expression of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.

40|$|Background: Alterations in the {{methylation}} {{patterns of}} promoter CpG islands {{have been associated}} with the transcriptional inhibition of genes in many human cancers. These epigenetic alterations could be used as molecular markers for the early detection of cancer—that is, while potentially curable according to current therapeutic strategies. In prostate cancer, GSTP 1 hypermethylation is the most common epigenetic alteration, and can be detected in up to 90 % of cases. Thus, screening for methylation of other loci would probably increase the number of primary tumours amenable to screening. Moreover, previous {{studies have shown that the}} <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> (EDNRB) gene is abnormally methylated in a high proportion of prostate tumours (∼ 70 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a {{frequent}} congenital malformation regarded as a multigenic neurocristopathy. Two susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene and the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptor</b> (EDNRB) gene. Hitherto however, homozygosity for EDNRB mutations accounted for the HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. Here, we report heterozygous EDNRB missense mutations (G 57 S, R 319 W and P 383 L) in isolated HSCR. These data might suggest that EDNRB mutations could be dosage sensitive: heterozygosity would predispose to isolated HSCR with incomplete penetrance, while homozygosity would result in more complex neurocristopathies associating HSCR and WS features. In addition, the present data give further support {{to the role of}} the endothelin-signalling pathway in the development of neural crest-derived enteric neurons. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Endothelin- 1 {{has been}} shown to be a {{mediator}} of pulmonary hypertension after cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. It is not known whether the mechanism is increased production of endothelin- 1 or alterations in expression of endothelin- 1 receptors in the lung. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that circulatory arrest increases endothelin- 1 mRNA levels and endothelin- 1 receptor expression in the lung. Methods and results: Twenty-four piglets (7 to 30 days old) were studied randomly either at baseline (controls, n = 12) or after cardiopulmonary bypass with 30 minutes of circulatory arrest (deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, n = 12). Lungs and pulmonary arteries were harvested immediately after hemodynamic data collection. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest significantly increased pulmonary vascular resistance (p < 0. 01). Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest also produced a significant increase in endothelin- 1 mRNA levels in the pulmonary arteries (149 ± 55 pg vs 547 ± 111 pg, p = 0. 007). There was no significant change in the pulmonary parenchymal endothelin- 1 mRNA levels (4102 ± 379 pg vs 4623 ± 308 pg, p = 0. 32). Ligand binding studies of the lung parenchyma revealed a single specific endothelin- 1 binding site with an EC 50 value (effective concentration causing 50 % of the maximum response) of about 1 × 10 − 8 mol/L, consistent with the <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> subtype. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest resulted in a significant increase in the number of endothelin- 1 receptors in the lung (109 ± 6 fmol/mg total protein to 135 ± 9 fmol/mg total protein, p = 0. 02). Conclusions: Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest increases production of endothelin- 1 by the pulmonary vascular endothelium. Endothelin- 1 production in the pulmonary parenchyma does not change. Expression of <b>endothelin</b> <b>B</b> <b>receptors</b> in the pulmonary parenchyma also increases after cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. This study supports the hypothesis that deep hypothermic circulatory arrest results in pulmonary vascular endothelial activation with increased endothelin- 1 mRNA production.

40|$|Melanocytes in {{the skin}} are derived from the {{embryonic}} neural crest, Recently, mutations in endothelin 3 and the <b>endothelin</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>B</b> genes {{have been shown to}} result in gross pigment defects, indicating that this signalling pathway is required for melanocyte development. We have examined the effects of endothelins on melanocyte progenitors in cultures of mouse neural crest. Firstly, they stimulate an increase in progenitor number and act synergistically with another factor, Steel factor, in the survival and proliferation of the progenitors. These findings are consistent with findings from mice with natural mutations in the <b>endothelin</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>B</b> gene, which show an early loss of melanocyte progenitors. Secondly, endothelins induce differentiation of the progenitors into fully mature pigmented melanocytes. This finding is consistent with the expression of endothelins {{in the skin}} of mice at the initiation of pigmentation. The melanocytes generated in endothelin-treated cultures also become responsive to alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which then acts to regulate the activity of the pigmentation pathway. These findings indicate two key roles for endothelin in melanocyte development: regulation of expansion of the progenitor pool and differentiation of progenitors into mature melanocytes...|$|R
