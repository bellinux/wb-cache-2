5|$|Negotiations with Pelagius {{about the}} status of the Church in the Kingdom of Cyprus {{concluded}} with an agreement in October 1220. One of Alice's demands was for Greek Orthodox priests to be <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> She also persuaded the pope, who had ordered the abolition of the Orthodox hierarchy on the island, to permit the appointment of Orthodox suffragan bishops in the four Roman Catholic dioceses. In time, the agreement was revised, as the Cypriot noblemen opposed the payment of a tithe (as prescribed by the agreement). The Holy See had also demanded that the estates the nobles had seized from the Orthodox Church be restored to the Catholic clerics. However, this new agreement, reached in 1222, neither freed the noblemen from the tithe nor prescribed the restoration of Church property.|$|E

He restored to Canterbury all the churches that had been seized by William or during Anselm's exile, promising that nothing more would be taken from them and even providing Anselm with a security payment. Henry had initially taxed married clergy and, when their situation had been outlawed, had made up the lost revenue by controversially extending the tax over all churchmen. He now agreed that any prelate who had paid this would be <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> for three years.

Current law allows an appraiser to harass a property owner by taxing motor vehicles that are <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> rendition. It is clear that the legislature <b>exempted</b> these vehicles <b>from</b> rendition with the intent to <b>exempt</b> them <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> By limiting this exemption to one motor vehicle per individual owner, the proposed amendment allays concerns that a fleet of motor vehicles could be <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> by a person who uses each vehicle for personal use for a short time each year.|$|R

[...] The family had been paying all of the regular taxes and fees, but Chen believed that, under the law, the family should have received government assistance and exemption from taxation. When the case went to court, blind citizens from surrounding counties were in attendance as a show of solidarity. [...] The case was successful, and the outcome became well-known.|$|E

In 1898, Melvin and his law partner, Riley, argued on behalf of the West Virginia Board of Public Works before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case, Pittsburgh [...] Ry. v. Board of Public Works of West Virginia 172 U.S. 32 (1898), in which the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad sought to avoid paying taxes on its usage of the West Virginia section of a railroad bridge crossing the Ohio River between Steubenville and Wheeling Junction. The court's decision upheld the law in the Code of West Virginia of 1891, c.29, §67, that taxed railroad bridges. The court's decision stated: [...] "A railroad bridge across a navigable river forming the boundary line between two states is not, by reason of being an instrument of interstate commerce, <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation</b> by either state upon the part within it." ...|$|E

[...] The tribe paid to fly him to Washington, D.C. to prepare the brief with Dan Israel of NARF and Bernie Becker, the tribe's attorney who would argue the case before the Supreme Court. At oral arguments on April 20, 1976, Becker pointed out that Public Law 280 gave the state jurisdiction over criminal matters and civil [...] "causes of actions" [...] – a legal term for lawsuits. Since Congress had also passed other Indian laws at the same time, such as the various Indian Termination Acts, which specifically authorized states to collect taxes from Indians, its silence in this area meant Congress {{did not intend to}} do so with Public Law 280. Becker brought up the leading article on Public Law 280, by UCLA law professor Carole Goldberg, that argued that the law was established {{to address the problem of}} crime on reservations. He also noted that tribes which had adequate law-and-order processes, such as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, were excluded from state jurisdiction in Minnesota. Arguing for the State of Minnesota was C. H. Luther of the State Attorney General's office. Luther argued four points for the tax being valid: a) the language of the statute; b) the legislative history of Public Law 280; c) prior judicial opinions; and d) public policy. Luther conceded that if the trailer was a fixed house or real property, it would be <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation.</b> Luther also stated that other taxes [...] such as gasoline, sales, income and other taxes of general applicability [...] would apply to Indians.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{between the}} city of Washington, Pennsylvania and Washington & Jefferson College span over two centuries, dating to the {{founding}} of both {{the city and the}} college in the 1780s. [...] The relationship between the town and college was strong enough that the citizens of Washington offered a $50,000 donation in 1869 to the college in a successful attempt to lure the trustees to select Washington over nearby Canonsburg as the consolidated location of the college. [...] However, the relationship was strained through most of the 20th century, as the college pursued an expansion policy that clashed with the residential neighborhood. [...] The college's frustrations grew after preservationists unsuccessfully attempted to pass laws prohibiting the college from demolishing certain buildings that were listed on the East Washington Historic District. [...] Relations were so bad that residents and college officials engaged in a shouting match at a meeting. [...] Local preservationists also unsuccessfully tried to block the demolition of Hays Hall, which had been condemned. [...] In the 1990s, the city of Washington made several unsuccessful attempts to challenge the college's tax-exempt status. [...] In 1993, Washington appealed the Washington County Board of Assessment's determination that the college was exempt from the city's property tax. [...] That case went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the college. [...] In response, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a new law clarifying that colleges were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxation,</b> including from local property taxes. [...] Separately, the city of Washington passed an ordinance that levied a municipal [...] "service fee" [...] against the College students, which was ruled to be illegal and was struck down. [...] In the late 1990s, the college and town tried to mend fences through the Blueprint for Collaboration, a plan with detailed goals and benchmarks for the future to help the college and the city work together on economic development, environmental protection, and historic preservation.|$|E
