5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} ray is not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during <b>human</b> <b>embryonic</b> development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|In early <b>human</b> <b>embryonic</b> life, {{a series}} of five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and {{surrounding}} structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E

40|$|Transient {{neonatal}} {{diabetes mellitus}} (TNDM) {{is a rare}} inherited diabetic syndrome apparent in the first weeks of life and again during early adulthood. The relative contributions of reduced islet β cell number and impaired β cell function to the observed hypoinsulinemia are unclear. The inheritance pattern of this imprinted disorder implicates overexpression of one or both genes within the TNDM locus: ZAC, which encodes a proapoptotic zinc finger protein, and HYMAI, which encodes an untranslated mRNA. To investigate the consequences for pancreatic function, we have developed a high-copy transgenic mouse line, TNDM 29, carrying the human TNDM locus. TNDM 29 neonates display hyperglycemia, and older adults, impaired glucose tolerance. Neonatal hyperglycemia occurs only on paternal transmission, analogous to paternal dependence of TNDM in <b>humans.</b> <b>Embryonic</b> pancreata of TNDM 29 mice showed reductions in expression of endocrine differentiation factors and numbers of insulin-staining structures. By contrast, β cell mass was normal or elevated at all postnatal stages, whereas pancreatic insulin content in neonates and peak serum insulin levels after glucose infusion in adults were reduced. Expression of human ZAC and HYMAI in these transgenic mice thus recapitulates key features of TNDM and implicates impaired development of the endocrine pancreas and β cell function in disease pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Distinct hemoglobins are {{synthesized}} in goats {{at different}} stages of development, similar to <b>humans.</b> <b>Embryonic</b> hemoglobins (zeta 2 epsilon 2 and alpha 2 epsilon 2) are synthesized initially and are followed sequentially by fetal (alpha 2 beta F 2), preadult (alpha 2 beta C 2), and adult (alpha 2 beta A 2) hemoglobins. To help understand the basis of these switches, the genes of the beta-globin locus have been cloned and their linkage arrangement has been determined by the isolation of lambda phage carrying overlapping inserts of genomic goat DNA. The locus extends over 120 kilobase pairs and consists of 12 genes arranged in the following order: epsilon I-epsilon II-psi beta X-beta C-epsilon III-epsilon IV-psi beta Z-beta A-epsilon V-epsilon VI-psi beta Y-beta F. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the 12 genes shows that the locus is organized into three homologous four-gene sets that presumably evolved by the triplication of an ancestral set of four genes (epsilon-epsilon-psi beta-beta). Interestingly, the three genes (beta C, beta A, and beta F) located at the ends of the four-gene sets are expressed {{at different stages}} of development. Therefore, the goat beta F-, beta C-, and beta A-globin genes appear to have evolved by a mechanism that includes the triplication of 40 - 50 kilobase pairs of DNA and the recruitment of newly formed genes for expression in fetal, preadult, and adult life...|$|R

40|$|Animal life is {{controlled}} by neurons and in this setting cholinergic neurons play an important role. Cholinergic neurons release ACh, which via nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (n- and mAChRs) mediate chemical neurotransmission, a highly integrative process. Thus, the organism responds to external and internal stimuli to maintain and optimize survival and mood. Blockade of cholinergic neurotransmission is followed by immediate death. However, cholinergic communication has been established {{from the beginning of}} life in primitive organisms such as bacteria, algae, protozoa, sponge and primitive plants and fungi, irrespective of neurons. Tubocurarine- and atropine-sensitive effects are observed in plants indicating functional significance. All components of the cholinergic system (ChAT, ACh, n- and mAChRs, high-affinity choline uptake, esterase) have been demonstrated in mammalian non-neuronal cells, including those of <b>humans.</b> <b>Embryonic</b> stem cells (mice), epithelial, endothelial and immune cells synthesize ACh, which via differently expressed patterns of n- and mAChRs modulates cell activities to respond to internal or external stimuli. This helps to maintain and optimize cell function, such as proliferation, differentiation, formation of a physical barrier, migration, and ion and water movements. Blockade of n- and mACHRs on non-innervated cells causes cellular dysfunction and/or cell death. Thus, cholinergic signalling in non-neuronal cells is comparable to cholinergic neurotransmission. Dysfunction of the non-neuronal cholinergic system is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. Alterations have been detected in inflammatory processes and a pathobiologic role of non-neuronal ACh in different diseases is discussed. The present article reviews recent findings about the non-neuronal cholinergic system in humans...|$|R
