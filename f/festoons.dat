5|$|The Delhi Durbar Tiara {{was made}} by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary, the wife of George V, to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. As British law {{prohibited}} {{the removal of the}} Crown Jewels from the country, George V wore a specially made crown (the Imperial Crown of India) to the Durbar, and his consort Queen Mary wore the tiara. It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary to use at the event which included a necklace, stomacher, brooch and earrings. Made of gold and platinum, the tiara is 8cm (3in) tall and has the form of a tall circlet of lyres and S-scrolls linked by <b>festoons</b> of diamonds. It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds, acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1912, the tiara was altered to take {{one or both of the}} Cullinan III and IV diamonds; the pear-shaped diamond was held at the top, and the cushion-shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath. Mary lent the tiara to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, and it remained with her until she died in 2002, when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005, the Queen lent the tiara to her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the Buddhist {{doctrine}} of rebirth, the previous existences of Koṇḍañña are described in Buddhist texts. They repeatedly show a theme of Koṇḍañña having displayed religious inclinations in previous rebirths, many of which involve experiences with previous rebirths of the Buddha and his other leading disciplines. This is a common theme among the leading disciples, {{all of whom had}} many encounters with the future Gautama Buddha in previous lives, and is consistent with the Buddhist concepts of cause and effect and karma. In Pali language Theravada literature, Koṇḍañña is said to have begun striving for enlightenment in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, the 13th Buddha. The son of a wealthy householder at Hamsavati, Koṇḍañña saw the monk who was the first disciple of Padmuttara Buddha. Koṇḍañña's previous rebirth bestowed on the Buddha and the sangha and wished that he was to be the first disciple of a future Buddha. Padumuttara is said to have prophesied the fulfilment of this in the era of Gautama Buddha, 1000 aeons into the future. After the passing of Padmuttara Buddha, Koṇḍañña constructed a jewelled chamber inside the cetiya in which the relics were stored and also made an offering of jewel <b>festoons.</b> The Apadana offers a variant on this reincarnation. It states that Koṇḍañña {{was the first person to}} offer a meal to Padumuttara and became a deva in the Tusita world. It further says and that during the time of Vipassī Buddha, Koṇḍañña was a householder named Mahakala who offered the Buddha the first fruits of his field in their nine stages of production. The Mahavastu gives another account explaining the origin of Koṇḍañña's vow to attain arahanthood in his final rebirth. This account asserts that he was a potter at Rajagaha in a previous existence. A Paccekabuddha who was suffering from biliousness sought shelter in the potter's hut and was cured. In time, several more Paccekabuddhas came to visit the hut to inquire about their colleagues health status. The potter asked which of them had realised the dharma first, to which the patient answered in the affirmative. Thereupon the potter made his vow.|$|E

25|$|The chapel is {{important}} in the history of architecture for it introduced the new rocaille or rococo style into Portugal. The decorative elements of rocaille inspiration – <b>festoons,</b> garlands, angels – combined with the classical austerity of the structural composition are the basis of an evolving taste that would decide the future trends of Portuguese gilt woodwork. The use of columns with straight channelled shafts with gilt fillets on a lapis lazuli background, the austerity of geometric lines reinforced by the employment of precious marbles and mosaics, as well as the rocaille decoration illustrate the combination of innovations introduced by this chapel into the Portuguese decorative tradition.|$|E

25|$|The rich, gilded {{ornaments}} of the iconostasis are Jankovits' real style-marks. He {{worked with}} lime wood, and carved his decorative elements in two artistic styles: Zopf style appears in vivid plant motifs; and Classicism {{is represented by}} geometrical patterns, like the ribbons on pilasters or the carved tassels on the doors. The foliage usually has additional significance in ecclesiastical art. Acanthus leaves, the most common motifs on the iconostasis, symbolize heaven and the eternal life. Olive {{plays an important role}} in Biblical stories and it has many religious aspects too. There are two large olive branches under the Calvary scene, on the top of the icon screen. It represents peace in the first place, but in the Old Testament it stands for blessing, wisdom, trust, faith in God, and grace of God too, in the story of Noah. The olive is the tree of life in Paradise, and it also refers to the healing power of the Blessed Virgin Mary, especially in Eastern rites where Mary's veneration plays an important role. Grape motifs decorate the icon frames and the holy doors. The Bible contains many examples of the symbolical meaning of vines and grapes. They can symbolize peace and well-being, and might refer to Israel, but in most cases the vine is a symbol of Jesus, its fruits representing the Apostles. Following the same symbolism, the vine can also refer to Mary, whose fruit is Jesus. The most common flower of the carved <b>festoons</b> is the rose, which is the symbol of Mary in Christian art. Tulips, the flower of the virginity and purity, appear in the <b>festoons</b> as well beside the rose heads.|$|E
25|$|A special form of Attic vases of {{this period}} was the Tyrrhenian amphora (550-530 BC). These were egg-shaped neck amphora with decorations {{atypical}} of the usual Attic design canon of the period. Almost all of the c. 200 surviving vases were found in Etruria. The body of the amphora is usually subdivided into several parallel friezes. The upper or shoulder frieze usually shows a popular scene from mythology. There are sometimes less common subjects, such as a unique scene of the sacrificing of Polyxena. The first known erotic images on Attic vases are also found at this vase location. The painters frequently put annotations on Tyrrhenian amphora which identify the persons shown. The other two or three friezes were decorated with animals; sometimes {{one of them was}} replaced with a plant frieze. The neck is customarily painted with a lotus palmette cross or <b>festoons.</b> The amphoras are quite colorful and recall Corinthian products. In this case a Corinthian form was obviously deliberately copied to produce a particular vase type for the Etruscan market, where the style was popular. It is possible that this form was not manufactured in Athens but somewhere else in Attica, or even outside Attica. Important painters were the Castellani Painter and the Goltyr Painter.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{already in}} the 7th century BC painted pottery was being {{produced}} in Sparta for local consumption {{as well as for}} export. The first quality pieces were produced around 580 BC. The zenith in black-figure pottery was reached between about 575 and 525 BC. Besides Sparta, the main discovery sites are the islands of Rhodes and Samos, as well as Taranto, Etruscan necropolises, and Cyrene, which was at first considered to be the original source of the pottery. The quality of the vessels is very high. The clay was well slurried and was given a cream-colored coating. Amphoras, hydriai, column kraters (called krater lakonikos in antiquity), volute kraters, Chalcidic kraters, lebes, aryballoi and the Spartan drinking cup, the lakaina, were painted. But the index form and most frequent find is the cup. In Lakonia the deep bowl was usually put on a high foot; cups on low feet are rare. The exterior is typically decorated with ornaments, usually <b>festoons</b> of pomegranates, and the interior scene is quite large and contains figures. In Laconia earlier than in the rest of Greece the tondo became the main framework for cup scenes. The main image was likewise divided into two segments at an early date, a main scene and a smaller, lower one. Frequently the vessel was only coated with a glossy slip or decorated with just a few ornaments. Inscriptions are uncommon but can appear as name annotations. Signatures are unknown for potters as well as painters. It is probable that the Laconian craftsmen were perioeci pottery painters. Characteristic features of the pottery often match the fashion of known painters. It is also possible that they were migrant potters from eastern Greece, which would explain the strong eastern Greek influence especially on the Boreads Painter.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{distribution}} of the meso-thermophilous butterfly Southern <b>Festoon</b> (Zerynthia polyxena) in Slovenia, its endangerment and mitigation measures. The key factor, which determines the spatial distribution of adult butterflies, is the presence of the host plant of the genus Aristolochia spp. Due to loss of its natural habitat the Southern <b>Festoon</b> is now considered an endangered species in the Central Europe. In Slovenia, it is on the Red List of Threatened Species categorised as vulnerable species (V). The Southern <b>Festoon</b> is threatened by reforestation, regular use of pesticides in the vineyards, spontaneous afforestation of marginal grasslands, disposal of marginal vegetation and collecting. The study on distribution of the Southern <b>Festoon</b> in Slovenia was conducted with data collected from sources which included butterfly sighting in different areas and time frames (2005). The methods of actual distribution and complete range were used. The results showed increase in the distribution of the Southern <b>Festoon</b> in the last decades which is in contrast to literature, which suggest local extinctions of the species. The main cause of endangerment is agriculture because encroachment upon nature causes the loss of habitat, which affects species distribution. The endangerment could be reduced by lowering herbicide and pesticide use, especially in wine-growing areas where the use of pesticides is most harmful...|$|R
