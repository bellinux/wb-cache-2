5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} royal castles, from the 12th century onwards, formed an {{essential}} network of royal storehouses in the 13th century {{for a wide}} range of goods including food, drink, weapons, armour and raw materials. Castles such as Southampton, Winchester, Bristol and the Tower of London were used to import, store and distribute royal wines. The English royal castles also became used as gaols – the Assize of Clarendon in 1166 insisted that royal sheriffs establish their own gaols and, in the coming years, county gaols were placed in all the shrieval royal castles. Conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common; Northampton Castle appears to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> of the worst abuses.|$|E

25|$|Nations such as France, Russia and the United Kingdom are {{generally}} considered to be great powers due to their military and strategic importance, their status as recognised nuclear powers and also their permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Some academics also believe that Germany and Japan are great powers, but due to their large advanced economies and global influence as opposed to military and strategic capabilities. Italy also has seen much discussion among academics and commentators regarding its status as a great power, particularly for its position in the G7 and the nation's influence in regional and international organisations. Although broad academic support for India as a great power is uncommon, recent years <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> in the field of political science, such as Malik Mohan (2011) and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski (2012) put forward the assertion that India holds the status of a great power.|$|E
25|$|The History {{of early}} Islamic Tunisia opens {{with the arrival}} of the Arabs who brought their {{language}} and the religion of Islam, and its calendar. The Arab conquest followed strategy designed by the Umayyad Caliphate regarding its long-term conflict with the Byzantine Empire. The native Berbers eventually converted to Islam. They might <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> similarities between themselves and the Arabs, in similar cognate culture, such as familiarity with a pastoral way of life. The first local Islamic ruling house, the Aghlabids, consisted primarily of rule by leading members of this Arab tribe. Fundamental elements of Islamic civilization were established. Although accepting Islam, many Berbers nonetheless resisted rule by the Arabs, establishing the Rustamid kingdom followiing the Kharijite revolt. Next in Ifriqiya (Tunisia) arose the Shia Fatimids, inspired by a few immigrants from the east yet consisting for the most part of Ifriqiya Berbers. The Fatimids later expanded their rule east, through conquest by Berber armies of Egypt, and established their caliphate there which came to include Syria and the Hejaz.|$|E

25|$|On {{the provincial}} level of government, the Progressive Conservatives, Liberals, and the New Democrats all hold electoral {{districts in the}} GTA. While the GTA {{provided}} a strong base {{of support for the}} Progressive Conservative government between 1995 and 2003, Dalton McGuinty and the Ontario Liberal Party roared to victory in the region during the 2003 election and has enjoyed strong support from the region ever since. In the 2011 election, the Liberals won 33 of the 44 available seats in the GTA. The 2014 election was an even bigger electoral landslide for the Liberals, as they now hold 38 seats in the region, including ridings like Durham, Burlington, Newmarket-Aurora and Halton, which had voted PC for decades. The PCs hold no seats in the Peel Region, and only one seat in each of the Halton, York, and Durham regions. While the NDP has been weak in the GTA since the 1995 election, they <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> successes in Brampton and the Durham Region, where they hold one seat each.|$|E
500|$|Altgens {{described}} {{what he saw}} following the fatal shot to JFK. [...] "There was no blood {{on the right-hand side}} of his face; there was no blood on the front of his face.

[...] This suggested to Altgens that the gunshots came from the rear, because he should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> evidence otherwise. He also remembered seeing Jackie Kennedy on the trunk of the limousine, and thinking that she was frightened by the events and was trying to get away.|$|E

In 1865 he was initiated into Freemasonry and was Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1887 during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Sullivan's talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley, and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis although, according to George Grossmith, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> bad lawn-tennis players in my time, but I never saw anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan".|$|E

500|$|He grew up {{near the}} new Melrose Abbey, an {{offshoot}} from Lindisfarne which is today in Scotland, but was then in Northumbria. [...] He had {{decided to become a}} monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that St Aidan, the founder of Lindisfarne, died, but seems to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> military service first. [...] He was quickly made guest-master at the new monastery at Ripon, soon after 655, but had to return with Eata to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead. [...] About 662 he was made prior at Melrose, and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne. [...] In 684 he was made Bishop of Lindisfarne, but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die, although he was probably still only in his early 50s. [...] After a few weeks of illness he died on the island on 20 March 687, and his body was carried back to Lindisfarne and buried there the same day.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{supporters}} {{soon began}} to have doubts about Dianetics.

Moreover, an individual supposed to have been 'clear' has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis." [...] He also deplored the Foundation's omission of any serious scientific research. Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles failed disastrously. He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience {{that as a result of}} undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall. However, Gardner writes, [...] "in the demonstration that followed, she failed to remember a single formula in physics (the subject in which she was majoring) or the color of Hubbard's tie when his back was turned. At this point, a large part of the audience got up and left." ...|$|E

[...] A number of reviewers made some comparisons to the members previous bands with PopMatters reviewer David Powell stating that [...] "Contraband is a pretty good record of unpretentious rock and roll that suffers from inevitable comparison with the best efforts of its parent bands." [...] He went on to state that while Velvet Revolver's [...] "heritage is evident on most of the songs", Contraband [...] "improves with repeat listening, which is encouraging." [...] Velvet Revolver's second album Libertad saw the band's style change with the presence of producer Brendan O'Brien, noted by Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Erlewine also stated that [...] "too often, there are concessions between Weiland and the others {{during the course of a}} song." [...] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that Libertad [...] "feels both comfortingly familiar and vaguely exotic."
