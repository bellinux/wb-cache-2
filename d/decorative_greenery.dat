40|$|Natural {{vegetation}} and green environments have disappeared rapidly from cities since World War â…¡, replaced by concrete deserts with only sparse, unnatural vegetation. Japanese cities traditionally did not destroy the surrounding vegetation except as needed for city growth, but now even in Japan {{there is a}} great need for both the ecological and socializing functions of productive, traditional green environments in the otherwise largely abiotic urban areas. True green environments are more than <b>decorative</b> <b>greenery,</b> protecting the soil, providing habitats for animals, buffering disturbances, and lending harmony to the landscape. Since the early 1970 's, small, green "environmental protection forests", composed of native potential dominant species, have been retrofitted into urban and industrial areas throughout the evergreen broad-leaved forest regions of Japan, where most of the population lives. These greenbelts and other green patches combine techniques of modern vegetation science with the traditional Japanese methods of creating 'chinju-no-mori' (shrine and temple forests) and other forest areas in the built landscape. Comfortable urban environments, however, also require conservation of large green areas (e. g. patches of rural landscape) and the linking of greenbelts and other green nuclei to form inter-connected green networks within the urban environment. Traditional native landscapes are the best basis for planning successful urban landscapes. "Environmental forests", based on aspects of traditional landscapes, are probably the fastest and cheapest way to create stable green environments in densely built-up cities.
