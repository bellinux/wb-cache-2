25|$|Between 1975 and 1990, a {{shift in}} the {{paradigm}} of computer technology had taken place, making electronic music systems affordable and widely accessible. The personal computer had become an essential component of the electronic musician’s equipment, superseding analog synthesizers and fulfilling the traditional functions of composition and scoring, synthesis and sound processing, sampling of audio input, and control over <b>external</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The KYZ relay creates pulses. The term KYZ {{refers to}} the contact designations: K for common, Y for Normally Open, and Z for Normally Closed. When {{incorporated}} into an electrical meter, the relay changes state with each rotation (or half rotation) of the meter disc. Each state change is called a [...] "pulse."

60|$|And these spurs {{and their}} {{retention}} {{are only the}} outward and visible symbol of the obstinate resistance of the Anglican intelligence to the clear logic of the present situation. It {{is not only the}} <b>external</b> <b>equipment</b> of our leaders that falls behind the times; our political and administrative services {{are in the hands of}} the same desolatingly inadaptable class. The British are still wearing spurs in Ireland; they are wearing them in India; and the age of the spur has passed. At the outset of this war there was an absolute cessation of criticism of the military and administrative castes; it is becoming a question whether we may not pay too heavily in blundering and waste, in military and economic lassitude, in international irritation and the accumulation of future dangers in Ireland, Egypt, India, and elsewhere, for an apparent absence of internal friction. These people have no gratitude for tacit help, no spirit of intelligent service, and no sense of fair play to the outsider. The latter deficiency indeed they call esprit de corps and prize it as if it were a noble quality.|$|E
