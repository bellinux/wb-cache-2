5|$|Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, {{and other}} North American {{professional}} minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty. What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not eject players simply {{for participating in}} a fight. However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues, and in Olympic competition.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these adverse effects, {{a different type of}} MAOI has been developed: the reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{fluorescent}} tubes are the common light bars {{you find in}} commercial ceilings. Fluorescent lighting has more color temperatures available which are more suited to aquariums than those of incandescent bulbs. They are also more efficient than incandescent lighting, averaging between 90 and 95 lumens per watt. The downside to regular fluorescent lights <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have the intensity to penetrate into deeper aquariums.|$|E

25|$|Many Haredim who {{subscribe}} to the anti-Zionist view still immigrate to the Land of Israel. Their rationalization <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> so only as individuals and families, but not {{as members of the}} organized mass-immigration, and that they come to the Land solely to live there, not in order to conquer it or rule over it. Such Haredim accordingly do not believe themselves to be in violation of the Three Oaths.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} various Western records {{representing}} the Armenian population, but demographic figures representing the total Armenian population within the Ottoman Empire were few. The problem with such figures <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not cover the same regions. For instance, many times “Anatolia” is equalled with the Ottoman Empire. Other times there are partial statistics representing one region, like Turkish Armenia, Ottoman Armenia, Asiatic Turkey, Anatolia, Ottoman Empire, 6 Armenian Villeyets, 9 Armenian Villeyets etc.|$|E
25|$|In response, Zemskov {{wrote that}} the charge that Zemskov {{allegedly}} did not compare new data with already known information could not be called fair. In his words, the trouble with most western writers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not benefit from such comparisons. Zemskov added that when {{he tried not to}} overuse the juxtaposition of new information with “old” one, it was only because of a sense of delicacy, not to once again psychologically traumatize the researchers whose works used incorrect figures, as it turned out after the publication of the statistics by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD.|$|E

25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} objection <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not reflect}} how real neurons function. Back propagation {{is a critical}} part of most artificial neural networks, although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks. How information is coded by real neurons is not known. Sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently. Other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron, almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks is known.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where {{they are expected to}} be grateful for inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have been times when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize flour. In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E

500|$|There {{are visible}} {{parallels}} between the trapping mechanisms of carnivorous plants and protocarnivorous plants. Plumbago and other species with glandular trichomes resemble the flypaper traps of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants, such as some Heliamphora species and Darlingtonia californica, are so {{similar to those of}} true carnivorous plants that the only reason they may be considered protocarnivorous instead of carnivorous <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not produce their own digestive enzymes. There are also protocarnivorous bromeliads that form a pitfall trap in an [...] "urn" [...] of rosetted leaves that are held together tightly. There are also other plants that produce a sticky mucilage not necessarily associated with a tentacle or glandular trichome, but instead can be described more like a slime capable of trapping and killing insects.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{factor that}} {{may have contributed to}} the {{relative}} neglect of creole languages in linguistics <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not fit the 19th-century neogrammarian [...] "tree model" [...] for the evolution of languages, and its postulated regularity of sound changes (these critics including the earliest advocates of the wave model, Johannes Schmidt and Hugo Schuchardt, the forerunners of modern sociolinguistics). This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the comparative method in historical linguistics and in creolistics.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the modern}} game, the Sri Lankan pace bowler Lasith Malinga {{has a very}} {{distinctive}} action which is authentic roundarm. This has earned him the name [...] "Slinga Malinga". There are some who question the legality of this action, but it is legal, because his arm does not straighten from a bent position as he bowls. This is the strict definition of bowling vis-à-vis throwing. In fact, many bowlers bowl with a slightly bent arm; the key <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not straighten it as they bowl.|$|E

2500|$|Shark nets do {{not offer}} {{complete}} protection but work {{on the principle of}} [...] "fewer sharks, fewer attacks". They reduce occurrence via shark mortality. Reducing the local shark populations is believed to reduce the chance of an attack. Historical shark attack figures suggest that the use of shark nets and drumlines does markedly reduce the incidence of shark attack when implemented on a regular and consistent basis. The downside with shark nets <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> result in bycatch, including threatened and endangered species.|$|E
2500|$|Constructivism views {{all of our}} {{knowledge}} as [...] "constructed," [...] {{because it does not}} reflect any external [...] "transcendent" [...] realities; it is contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender are socially constructed (Hegel, Garns, and Marx were among the [...] first to suggest such an ambitious expansion of social determinism). The common thread between all forms of constructivism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not focus on an ontological reality, but instead on the constructed reality.|$|E

The arguments in favour are that [...] "Spare Air" [...] cylinders are both less bulky and less complicated than pony bottles, as they are always on and have no hoses or pressure gauges, and that some air is better than none in an emergency.|$|E
