40|$|In {{the last}} decade, metal oxide layers {{deposited}} on polymer substrates have been utilised as <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> in food packaging {{as an alternative}} to the traditional aluminium foil. The resistance of these composite films to gas transmission is controlled predominantly by nano-scale defects created during the fabrication of the oxide layer. The size and density of these defects are believed to be strongly dependent on the intrinsic properties of the metal oxide layer. Changing the chemical composition of these coatings is one possible method to enhance the <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of the films. In this work, aluminium oxynitride films, fabricated by reactive magnetron sputtering on Poly (ethylene terephthalate) substrates, have been investigated using a range of analytical techniques including: scanning proton microprobe; atomic force microscopy; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; uni-axial tensile testing; and gas permeation measurements to characterise the <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of the film.

One of the major issues with current organic semiconductor materials is that they are susceptible to degradation when exposed to oxygen and water vapor in the ambient atmosphere. In order to take advantage of these materials, stretchable barrier films must also be developed. Solar cell devices were fabricated using an organic bulk heterojunction blend of poly(3 -heptylthiophene) and phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (P 3 HpT:PCBM). Stretchable barrier films were fabricated with graphene and polyurethane (PU) using a simple dip coating process. Devices encapsulated with an unstrained graphene/PU barrier film retained 60. 6 ± 3. 7 % efficiency after 10 days, exhibiting barrier properties similar to that of a control device encapsulated with glass (61. 1 ± 3. 2 %). Measurements over the course of 1 day showed that graphene/PU films strained up to 20 % were still able to maintain 91. 5 ± 2. 8 % efficiency.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model for {{permeation}} in oxide coated <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>films.</b> The model accounts for diffusion through the amorphous oxide lattice, nano-defects within the lattice, and macro-defects. The presence of nano-defects indicate the oxide layer is more similar to a nano-porous solid (such as zeolite) than silica glass with respect to permeation properties. This explains why the permeability of oxide coated polymers is much greater, and the activation energy of permeation much lower, than values expected for polymers coated with glass. We have used the model to interpret permeability and activation energies measured for the inert gases (He, Ne and Ar) in evaporated SiOx films of varying thickness (13 - 70 nm) coated on a polymer substrate. Atomic force and scanning electron microscopy were used to study {{the structure of the}} oxide layer. Although no defects could be detected by microscopy, the permeation data indicate that macro-defects (> 1 nm), nano-defects (0. 3 - 0. 4 nm) and the lattice interstices (< 0. 3 nm) all contribute to the total permeation.

40|$|Thin {{films with}} the ability to impart oxygen and other types of <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> are crucial to {{commercial}} packaging applications. Commodity polymers, such as polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), have insufficient barrier for goods requiring long shelf life. Current <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> technologies like plasma-enhanced vapor deposition (PECVD) often create high <b>barrier</b> metal oxide <b>films,</b> which are prone to cracking when flexed. Bulk composites composed of polymer and impermeable nanoparticles show improved barrier, but particle aggregation limits their practical utility for applications requiring high barrier and transparency. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies allow polymers and nanoparticles to be mixed with high particle loadings, creating super <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> thin <b>films</b> on substrates normally exhibiting high gas permeability. Branched polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) were deposited using LbL to create <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> with varying pH combinations. Film thickness and mass fraction of each component was controlled by their combined charge. With lower charge density (PEI at pH 10 and PAA at pH 4), PEI/PAA assemblies exhibit the best oxygen barrier relative to other pH combinations. An 8 BL PEI/PAA film, with a thickness of 451 nm, has an oxygen permeability lower than 4. 8 x 10 ^- 21 cm^ 3 * cm/cm^ 2 * s * Pa, which is comparable to a 100 nm SiOx nanocoating. Crosslinking these films with glutaraldehyde (GA), 1 -[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl]- 3 -ethylcarbodiimide methiodide (EDC) or heating forms covalent bonds between PEI and/or PAA. Oxygen transmission rates (OTR) of 8 BL films crosslinked with 0. 1 M GA or 0. 01 M EDC show the best oxygen barrier at 100 % RH. Graphene oxide (GO) sheets and PEI were deposited via LbL with varying GO concentration. The resulting thin films have an average bilayer thickness from 4. 3 to 5. 0 nm and a GO mass fraction from 88 to 91 wt%. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images reveal a highly-oriented nanobrick wall structure. A 10 BL PEI/GO film that is 91 nm thick, made with a 0. 2 wt% GO suspension, exhibits an oxygen permeability of 2. 5 x 10 ^- 20 cm^ 3 * cm/cm^ 2 * s * Pa. Finally, the influence of deposition time on thin film assembly was examined by depositing montmorillonite (MMT) or laponite (LAP) clays paired with PEI. Film growth and microstructure suggests that smaller aspect ratio LAP clay is more dip-time dependent than MMT and larger aspect ratio MMT has better oxygen barrier. A 30 BL PEI/MMT film made with 10 second dips in PEI has the same undetectable OTR as a film with 5 minute dips (with dips in MMT held at 5 minutes in both cases), indicating LbL <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> can be made more quickly than initially thought. These high barrier recipes, with simple and efficient processing conditions, are good candidates for a variety of packaging applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{permeation}} {{of water}} vapour through a coated polymer <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> {{is controlled by}} the defects in the coating. By modelling these defects as a combination of macro-defects (in which the activation energy of permeation is that of the underlying polymer substrate) and nano-defects (in which the activation energy of permeation is something greater than that of the polymer substrate), we are able to understand the mechanisms of permeation in high gas barrier layers. Permeation {{is controlled by the}} amounts of such defects, with the observed overall activation energy informing us of the relative permeation through macro- and nano-defects. Three examples of aluminium oxide (AlOx) -coated polymers are given to illustrate this: a comparison of poly(ethylene naphthalate) and polypropylene (OPP) substrates, the role of sputter power in AlOx/OPP films and the role of oxide thickness in AlOx/OPP films. When the amount of permeation through macro-defects is quite low, and hence nano-defect permeation is a significant proportion of the overall water vapour transport, control of each of the two defect types becomes important. Contrary to what has been previously assumed, the activation energy can be observed as greater in some cases in which the overall permeation is also greater, and this can be explained by an increase in the proportion of permeation taking place through nanodefects. This model is evidenced by reference to microstructural and other characterisation, and hence gives rise to understanding of the relationship between process properties, microstructure and permeation...|$|E
40|$|Thin layers {{with high}} barrier to oxygen and other gases {{are a key}} {{component}} to many packaging applications, such as flexible electronics, food, and pharmaceuticals. Vapor deposited thin <b>films</b> provide significant <b>gas</b> <b>barrier,</b> but are prone to cracking when flexed, require special, non-ambient processing environments, and can involve complex fabrication when layered with polymers. The addition of clay into polymers can enhance barrier properties relative to the neat polymer; however, these composites are subject to clay aggregation at high loadings, which leads to increased opacity and random platelet alignment that ultimately reduce barrier improvement. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is capable of producing thin films that exhibit super <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties, while remaining flexible and completely transparent. 	Montmorillonite (MMT) clay and branched polyethylenimine (PEI) were deposited via LbL assembly to create <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> that can be tailored by altering the pH of the PEI deposition solution or the concentration of the MMT suspension. Films grow linearly {{as a function of}} layers deposited, where increasing PEI pH increases spacing between clay layers and increasing MMT concentration increases thin film clay content. An oxygen transmission rate (OTR) below the detection limit of commercial instrumentation (< 0. 005 cm 3 /m 2 ?day?atm) is observed after 70 layers of 0. 2 wt % MMT or 24 layers of 2 wt % MMT are deposited with pH 10 PEI onto 179 ?m thick poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film. 	Three-component films of PEI, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and MMT grow exponentially as a function of PEI/PAA/PEI/MMT quadlayers deposited. A transparent, ultrathin film of only four quadlayers deposited onto PET exhibits the lowest oxygen permeability ever reported for any thin film material, at only 51 nm thick. 	Finally, the first example of LbL assembly using large aspect ratio vermiculite (VMT) clay was performed. PEI/VMT films grow linearly as a function of layers deposited and exhibit 95 % light transmission with 97 wt % VMT. The <b>barrier</b> of these <b>films</b> is due to the highly aligned nanobrick wall structure that creates a tortuous path for permeating molecules.

40|$|Layer-by-layer (LbL) {{assembly}} is {{a promising}} technique for depositing multi-functional thin films from dilute aqueous solutions. These films have found use as environmentally-benign flame retardants, replacing halogenated flame retardants, and as flexible <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> thin <b>films,</b> replacing vacuum-deposited inorganic oxide thin films. Unfortunately, LbL assembly has drawbacks {{that have not}} been adequately addressed, such as stiffening of coated substrates and the high number of deposition steps required. Thin films of chitosan and poly(sodium phosphate) were deposited on cotton fabric via LbL assembly to reduce flammability. The fabric was rinsed in an ultrasonication bath between deposition steps to improve the softness (i. e., hand) of the coated fabric. Ultrasonication is believed to remove weakly adhered polyelectrolyte and eliminate bridging of individual fibers, preventing the fabric from becoming stiff while improving the flame retardant behavior. Incorporating amine salts into the cationic polyelectrolyte and its associated rinse enables LbL clay-containing films to achieve large thickness (> 1 ?m) with relatively few deposition steps. This technique is potentially universal, exhibiting thick growth with multiple types of nanoclay, including montmorillonite and vermiculite, a variety of amine salts (e. g., hexylamine and tris), and a host of cationic polyelectrolytes, such as poly(allylamine) and chitosan.

40|$|Polymeric {{materials}} with <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> equivalent to metalized plastics {{have become increasingly}} important for food packaging, electronic device encapsulation, and vacuum insulation. Early attempts to develop alternative <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> materials have focused on thick (> 10 ?m) polymer/clay composites produced using physical mixing, but only limited improvement was achieved due to aggregation and random orientation of clay platelets. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a simple yet powerful bottom-up fabrication technique, which allows assembly of thin films with designed microstructure under ambient conditions. These multilayer thin films have many desirable properties: mechanical flexibility, transparency, and impermeability. This dissertation sought to further improve the processing and properties of high <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> thin <b>films</b> produced using LbL assembly. The influence of deposition time on <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> of polymer/clay multilayer thin films composed of polyethylenimine (PEI), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and clay was investigated. Multilple PEI/PAA bilayers (BL) were deposited between clay layers to construct multilayer assemblies with quadlayer (QL), hexalayer (HL), and octalayer (OL) sequences. Regardless of film structure, polymer/clay multilayer thin films prepared using shorter dipping time were thicker and exhibited better <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> than samples prepared using longer dipping time {{in the first few}} layers. This seemingly counterintuitive result was explained by considering desorption of previously deposited polymers between clay layers. Reduced deposition time helped to retain more polymer between clay sheets, leading to larger clay spacing and better <b>gas</b> <b>barrier.</b> In an effort to expand the applications and improve the throughput of layer-by-layer assembly, spray-assisted deposition of PEI/PAA bilayers was investigated. The influences of spraying time, spraying pressure, and flow rate on thickness, roughness, and <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> were evaluated. Spraying time was determined {{to be the most important}} parameter. A 7 -bilayer PEI/PAA thin film assembled using optimized spraying parameters exhibited better <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> than a dip-coated multilayer prepared using the same deposition time for each layer. These findings pave the way for using the LbL technique commercially, where fast and continuous deposition of high performance thin films on large substrates is needed. Finally, the first example of super stretchy <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> was developed by combining polyacrylic acid and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of 1. 58 mm thick natural rubber was reduced by an order of magnitude after deposition of a 20 BL PAA/PEO assembly. More importantly, no cracking was observed on the PAA/PEO coating after 100 % strain. A 5 X improvement in <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> was retained after this extreme stretching. Additionally, the effect of assembling condition on the permeability of PAA/PEO multilayer thin films was investigated. By setting the assembling pH at 2. 75, the negative impacts of PAA ionization and COOH dimer formation could be minimized, leading to a 50 % reduction in oxygen permeability. This unique combination of elasticity and <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> makes the PAA/PEO assembly an ideal candidate for improving the barrier of elastomeric materials...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films with}} the ability to control gas {{permeability}} are crucial to packaging and purification applications. The addition of impermeable nanoparticles into neat polymers improves barrier/separation properties by creating a tortuous pathway, but particle aggregation occurring at high filler loading can reduce transparency of these composites as well as barrier/separation improvement. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly allows full control of morphology at the nanoscale, so barrier/separation properties can be precisely controlled and the films remain flexible and transparent. A three component recipe, consisting of polyvinylamine, poly(acrylic acid) and montmorillonite clay was deposited as repeating PVAm/PAA/PVAm/MMT quadlayers (QL) via LbL assembly. By adjusting solution pH and varying the placement of polycation layers, polymer interdiffusion and clay concentration were controlled, as well as oxygen barrier. Another QL assembly, with a PEI/PAA/PEI/MMT repeating sequence, was deposited using LbL to create light <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>films.</b> Transmission electron microscope images revealed a highly-oriented nanobrick wall structure. A 5 QL coating on 51 ?m polystyrene (PS) is shown to lower both hydrogen and helium permeability three orders of magnitude relative to bare PS, demonstrating better performance than ethylene vinyl-alcohol (EVOH) copolymer film and even metallized plastic. Graphene oxide sheets, along with chitosan and PAA were used in a CH/PAA/CH/GO QL assembly. pH deviation between CH and PAA ionizes the counter ion, creating a more interdiffused polymer matrix and resulting in higher GO loading. Thermal reduction of GO, provides improvement in barrier performance under humid conditions and better H 2 /CO 2 separation behavior. Finally, a PEI/PAA multilayer membrane exceeding that of the current state-of-the-art gas separation membranes was performed. This ionically crosslinked assembly exhibits H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CO 2 selectivities beyond Robeson?s upper-bound limit, which are superior to the properties of most organic, inorganic or mixed-matrix membranes reported in the open literature, making it a significant advance in polymeric membranes for gas separation. In conclusion, barrier and separation behavior were improved via either a polymer-polymer or polymer-nanoplatelet assembly. Several treatments, including interdiffusion or thermal reduction proved to enhance film performance. Future works focus on applying LbL techniques in Bragg reflectors and CO 2 /N 2 separation...|$|R

In spite of these advantageous properties, the implementation of organic electronics in many applications is still challenging {{because of the potential}} for rapid degradation upon environmental exposure to oxygen, humidity, and mechanical stress. To enhance the stability of the devices, a reliable barrier layer to prevent the ingress of moisture and oxygen is required as well as more stable functional layers inside the device. Both of these goals can be partially achieved using defect-free conformal atomic layer deposition (ALD) films integrated into the devices. However, the practical electrical performance as well as the chemical stability of ultrathin ALD films has not received much attention from researchers. In some cases, characterization methods for the ultrathin ALD films have not been established. Therefore, this dissertation work proposes to investigate the functional properties of ultrathin (< 10 nm) ALD films to create an encapsulation <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> as well as to create environmentally robust coatings for electron selective contacts in organic electronics to improve their reliability. First, the chemical stability of ALD in aqueous environments was evaluated.

In addition, the <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> performance of ultrathin ALD films was investigated using an improved calcium corrosion test, which can discriminate between the intrinsic film permeation and the defect-assisted permeation.

The performance of barriers with respect to the requirements for the optoelectronics industry was studied, along with an appraisal of the metrics used to assess <b>barrier</b> levels. Polyester <b>films</b> were coated with aluminium oxide by reactive sputter deposition in an industrial-scale research web coater. The transparency and stoichiometry of coatings was achieved by control of the reactive gas supply levels, and the deposition configuration in the web coater. Target poisoning, which leads to low deposition rates, was controlled by balancing the inert and reactive gases and by changing the reactive <b>gas</b> supply locations. <b>Barrier</b> properties of the films were found to be affected strongly by the choice of power supply. By using a method of depositing many thin layers of AIOx sequentially to build up a single layer, it was possible to extend the region of high barrier performance out to thick coatings of several hundred nanometres and thus create very high barrier materials. PEN (polyethylene naphtha late) film was used as a substrate material for all samples. It is a good candidate for use as a substrate for <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> due to its excellent thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties. The use of surface treatments to minimise the effect of substrate surface features was examined. It was found that for coating thicknesses greater than 50 nm the surface smoothing layers did not improve barrier properties, and coated films with no smoothing layer performed better in water vapour transmission tests. Fragmentation tests showed that the <b>barrier</b> performance of <b>films</b> was greatly affected by the adhesion between the substrate and aluminium oxide coating. Various methods for measuring <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> properties were studied in this work. The standard steady-state test for gas transmission rates was compared with the non-standardised calcium test. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices were encapsulated with <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> to measure to what extent they act as a barrier to contaminants such as water vapour and oxygen. In a separate experiment, a component material of the OPV devices, poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT), was used successfully in encapsulation tests where its degradation was measured using UV-vis-nIR spectrometry.

40|$|Crystallinity is {{well-known}} to have major {{effects on the}} <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties. However, its effect on <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties is often dependant on the studied material and is difficult to anticipate because two aspects of crystallinity have to be considered: the crystallinity degree and the crystalline morphology. PLA is known to recrystallize when heated at a temperature higher than its Tg ("cold" recrystalllisation). Different recrystallized samples have been obtained by compression-molding the extruded films in different conditions of heating. The crystallinity degree and morphology have been investigated and related to the <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of the films. Since crystallinity also affects mechanical properties, the yield strength and the elongation at break have been measured...|$|R
40|$|Driven by {{environmental}} concerns, new polymers based on renewable resources are arriving {{on the market}} to replace conventional polymers, obtained from petroleum, for different applications like food packaging. One {{of the most prominent}} polymers among these materials is poly(lactic acid) (PLA), a biodegradable, thermoplastic, aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch (in the USA) or sugarcanes (in the rest of the world). However this polymer presents different disadvantages and especially low <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties [1]. Thermal crystallization can be used to increase its <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties but long times are necessary [2] and are not compatible with an industrial process. Another way to increase the <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties consists in stretching the film in order to increase its crystallinity and so its diffusion coefficient. We have prepared stretched PLA films with different stretch ratio and we have studied the effect of the stretching parameters on the <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of PLA films. Finally we compared this process with the isothermal crystallization process by taking into account the crystallinity degree and the crystalline morphology...|$|R

UV hand coating {{was conducted on}} the PES base film followed by SiO 2 <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> layer and aluminium gallium Zinc Oxide(AGZO) /Ag/AGZO transparent multi layer anode by roll-to-roll sputtering. The SiO 2 <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> was found to be more effective than the UV hand coating as well as enabling the AGZO/Ag/AGZO multilayer anode deposition by roll-to-roll sputter. The relatively high luminance and current efficiency of the flexible OLED with AGZO/Ag/AGZO multilayer anode could be explained by the decreased energy level close to that of NPB hall injection Layer as well as the micro cavity effect of the multilayer anode and <b>gas</b> <b>barrier</b> layerclose 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Barrier</b> <b>films</b> are {{required}} {{for a number of}} applications such as food packaging or organic electronics to prevent product degradation results from exposure to water vapour and oxygen. In order to determine the effectiveness of polymers and deposited <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> to inhibit water permeation, the water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) needs to be measured. The calcium test, MOCON instrument and tritiated water permeation can all be used to determine the WVTR, but the values produced by these techniques have not been extensively compared. The WVTR of two polymer substrates and two <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> deposited onto polymer substrates have been measured using these three techniques. For a polyethylene terephthalate substrate and a MOCON reference film, similar WVTR were observed for all three techniques. For two commercially available <b>barrier</b> <b>films,</b> variable WVTRs were observed and attributed to film defects. WVTR measurements play an essential role in the use of polymers and <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> to retard water permeation, therefore an understanding of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each technique is of great importance...|$|R

While the device without a moisture <b>barrier</b> <b>film</b> showed a large turn-on voltage shift under negative bias temperature stress, the suitably protected device with the lowest water vapor transmission rate showed a dramatically improved device performance. As the water vapor transmission rate of the <b>barrier</b> <b>films</b> decreased, the turn-on voltage instability was reduced. The charge trapping model alone could not explain this stability improvement. Instead, the improvement was attributed to effective blockage of bias-enhancedmoisture in the ambient atmosphere during gate voltage stress...|$|R
