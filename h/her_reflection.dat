5|$|Merlin {{reports to}} Camelot's {{physician}} Gaius (Richard Wilson) and saves the old man's {{life when he}} falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits {{that he has had}} magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> (like in mirrors or water).|$|E
5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at <b>her</b> <b>reflection.</b> A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E
25|$|Kushira starts {{worrying}} {{that she is}} getting old and wears a pair of pumps to work. After she trips and the heel breaks, the shoe repairer lends her bright red shoes to wear.

At home she looks at <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> and laughs.|$|E

25|$|Months pass, and Bill {{develops}} a mutual attraction {{to a student}} named Heather, who has a defect that makes it look like there is a star in her eye. Heather asks her to inspect a mysterious puddle, asking her if she can see what's wrong with <b>her</b> <b>reflection,</b> but Bill does not notice anything except that her face seems wrong somehow. Bill turns around and Heather has left. Within the puddle, a voice proclaims that {{a search for a}} pilot has begun.|$|E
25|$|When {{a visitor}} looks upon the wall, his or <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> {{can be seen}} {{simultaneously}} with the engraved names, which is meant to symbolically bring {{the past and present}} together. One wall points toward the Washington Monument, the other {{in the direction of the}} Lincoln Memorial, meeting at an angle of 125° 12′. Each wall has 72 panels, 70 listing names (numbered 1E through 70E and 70W through 1W) and two very small blank panels at the extremities. There is a pathway along the base of the Wall where visitors may walk.|$|E
25|$|In another tale, Amaterasu retreats from {{conflict}} {{with her brother}} Susa No O into a cave, depriving the Earth of sunlight and life. In order to coax Amaterasu from the cave, the deity of humour and dance, Ame No Uzume, performs a bawdy sexual dance that involved exposing her breast and vulva, and inviting Amaterasu to admire them. On Amaterasu's {{stepping out of the}} cave, the transgender kami Ishi Kori Dome held up a magical mirror, and the combination of the dance and <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> fascinate Amaterasu so much that she does not notice other spirits closing the cave entrance behind her.|$|E

500|$|... "Change Your Life" [...] is a mid-tempo pop power ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and 21 seconds. Having {{elements}} of soul and urban contemporary music, its Instrumentation includes tumbling R piano lines and a pulsating, driving backbeat. The song begins with an emotionally frayed spoken-word introduction by Leigh-Anne Pinnock, [...] "She captures <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> then she throws the mirror to the floor/ Her image is distorted, screaming 'Is it worth it anymore?" [...] 4Music said that the spoken-word introduction is reminiscent of All Saints' 1997 single, [...] "Never Ever". The chorus, [...] "Change, change your life, take it all/We gonna stick together, know we get through it all", is pledged by the group in harmony over a spiralling piano lines, cascading keyboard lines and rousing, chugging strings. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal range in the song span from the note of A3 to E5. Written in the key of A major, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills {{applying}} red lipstick, {{in a car}} mirror, while the instrumental of the song plays. She leaves the car and passes by a man, who is afterwards seen standing between two women wearing plastic masks of Kills' face. The music mutes {{and the sound of}} footsteps is heard repeatedly as Kills approaches a cracked mirror. After hearing a noise behind her, she looks over her shoulder as <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> looks to her as well. Kills is dragged into the mirror, and the title card of the first act, [...] "Vanity". During the section, a metal skull is shown while Kills lip-synchs the song in front of a mirror. The visual transitions to its second act, dubbed [...] "Control", in which she holds an axe while standing on top of a glass box. A man is seen inside the box, filming her as she moves around it. The video then shifts to act three, named [...] "Sex", in which Kill is depicted singing to a skull. Towards the end of the video, Kills is seen handcuffed and chained while sitting on the floor, and seducing a blindfolded man.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a warning saying [...] "no men were harmed {{in the making of}} this video". In the opening, it shows Aguilera playing 1980's {{computer}} games on her computer when she gets an incoming message from an occult fortune teller. Opening the message, she asks [...] "Hey Oranum, what's my week look like?" [...] to which the occult fortune teller responds [...] "You're gonna have a killer week!". Aguilera coyly smiles to the camera and images are shown of Aguilera writhing around seductively on a bed and eating cereal whilst on the couch watching cartoons. In the clip, Aguilera plays a killer who kills men after seducing them. She goes on a ride with the first man and seduces him leading to a make-out session between the two, then after he falls asleep, she blows up his car in electric-pink flames. Next, she goes to a bar and seduces the second man in a bathroom stall, where she bludgeons him to death, leaving spatters of blue paint dripping from the walls. Finally, she seduces a third unlucky suitor (who was foretold by the same occult fortune teller that it was his unlucky day) by inviting him to a motel and then uses a baseball bat to kill him, [...] "showering the room in a mist of red confetti". The video ends with Aguilera washing off the red confetti splattered all over herself while looking in the mirror at <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> and as the confetti goes down the drain, shows Aguilera in her trailer eating cereal while changing channels on her television set, settling on [...] "The Lucy Show" [...] before smiling and turning off her television. The video features several cultural influences, including the old NES Advantage, the psychic site Oranum.com, and short films of The Lucy Show featuring American actress Lucille Ball.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout Speak, Anderson {{represents}} Melinda's {{trauma and}} recovery symbolically. Barbara Tannert-Smith refers to Speak as a [...] "postmodern revisionary fairy tale" [...] {{for its use}} of fairy tale imagery. She sees Merryweather High School as the [...] "ideal fairy tale domain", featuring easily categorized characters—a witchy mother, a shape-shifting best friend, a beastly rapist. Mirrors, traditional fairy tale tools, signify Melinda's struggle with her shattered identity. After being raped, Melinda does not recognize herself in <b>her</b> <b>reflection.</b> Disgusted by what she sees, Melinda avoids mirrors. According to Don Latham, Melinda's aversion to <b>her</b> <b>reflection</b> illustrates acknowledgement of her fragmented identity. In fact, the only mirror Melinda can [...] "see herself" [...] in, is the three-way mirror in the dressing room. Rather than giving {{the illusion of a}} unified self, the three-way mirror reflects Melinda's shattered self. Likewise, Melinda is fascinated by Cubism, because it represents what is beyond the surface. Melinda uses art to express her voice. Her post-traumatic artwork illustrates her pain. The trees symbolize Melinda's growth. The walls of Melinda's closet are covered in her tree sketches, creating a metaphorical forest in which she hides from reliving her trauma. According to Don Latham, the closets in the story symbolize Melinda's queer coping strategies. Melinda uses the closet to conceal the truth.|$|E
