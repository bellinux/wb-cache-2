5|$|In newts and salamanders, {{metamorphosis}} is {{less dramatic}} than in frogs. This {{is because the}} larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are <b>encumbrances</b> on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E

40|$|How does asset <b>encumbrance</b> {{affect the}} {{fragility}} of intermediaries subject to rollover risk? We offer a model in which a bank issues covered bonds backed by a pool of assets that is bankruptcy remote and replenished following losses. Encumbering assets allows a bank to raise cheap secured debt and expand profitable investment, but it also concentrates risk on unsecured debt and thus exacerbates fragility and raises unsecured funding costs. Deposit insurance or wholesale funding guarantees induce excessive <b>encumbrance</b> and fragility. To mitigate such risk shifting, we study prudential regulatory tools, including limits on <b>encumbrance,</b> minimum capital requirements and surcharges for <b>encumbrance...</b>|$|R

25|$|For {{the purpose}} of calculating the amount of free residue in an estate, therefore, the surplus in value of {{encumbered}} assets over {{the amount of the}} <b>encumbrances</b> must be taken into consideration. “It is necessary,” the court held in Ex parte Van Heerden, “to consider whether the surplus of the proceeds of the immovable property, after satisfying the mortgage bonds which have a preferential claim thereon, can be considered as ‘free residue’ within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act.” The definition of “free residue” must be taken to refer to that portion of an estate under sequestration when liquidated, which is not subject to any right of preference. In estimating the free residue in an estate, the surplus in value of immovable property over the amount of mortgage bonds thereon may be included in such estimate.|$|E
25|$|In 1704 a {{group of}} farmers in Hurley petitioned the colonial governor, Viscount Cornbury, {{for some of the}} undeveloped land to their west along the creek to use as common pasture and firewood, since they were getting {{squeezed}} by Kingston to their east and Marbletown to the south.

The Hardenbugh Patent, as it became known, is the source of much of the land titles in the Catskills today, although its legitimacy was contested from the beginning, a dispute which continued until after the Revolution, aggravated by inadequate surveys of the region. <b>Encumbrances</b> remained on many properties into the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or <b>encumbrances</b> are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|E

500|$|During the interregnum the szlachta {{prepared}} {{a set of}} rules and limitations for the future monarch to obey as a safeguard to ensure that the new king, {{who was going to be}} a foreigner, complied with the peculiarities of the Commonwealth's political system and respected the privileges of the nobility. As Henry of Valois was the first one to sign the rules, they became known as the Henrician Articles. The articles also specified the wolna elekcja (free election) as the only way for any monarch's successor to assume the office, thus precluding any possibility of hereditary monarchy in the future. The Henrician Articles summarized the accumulated rights of Polish nobility, including religious freedom guarantees, and introduced further restrictions on the elective king; as if that were not enough, Henry also signed the so-called pacta conventa, through which he accepted additional specific obligations. Newly crowned Henry soon embarked on a course of action intended to free him from all the <b>encumbrances</b> imposed, but the outcome of this power struggle was never to be determined. One year after the election, in June 1574, upon learning of his brother's death, [...] Henry secretly left for France.|$|E

2500|$|By July, the Jacobites {{had eight}} battalions and two companies, almost all Highlanders. Dundee gained the {{confidence}} of the clans by cultivating the allegiance of each Highlander and respecting the precedence of the clans. He realised that to them, the cause of Jacobitism was secondary. At a time when infantry were trained to fight in formation, the Highlanders' method was more informal. They set aside their plaids and other <b>encumbrances</b> before the battle, and dropped to the ground to avoid enemy volleys. [...] After quickly returning fire, they pursued their foes, screaming in the Highland charge. They used heavy broadswords and targe (shield), or whatever weapons they had, including pitchforks or Lochaber axes (a combined axe and spear on a long pole). Such a charge was devastating to troops struggling to reform their lines, or fix the recently introduced 'plug' bayonets.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the industrialized}} world uses land {{registration}} systems for the transfer of land titles or interests in them. Under these systems, the government determines title ownership and <b>encumbrances</b> using its land registration; {{with only a few}} exceptions, the government's determination is conclusive. Governmental errors lead to monetary compensation to the person damaged by the error but that aggrieved party usually cannot recover the property. [...] The Torrens title system is the basis for land registration systems in several common law countries. [...] Nineteen jurisdictions in the United States, such as Minnesota and Massachusetts, adopted a form of this system between 1896 and 1917, however it fell out of favor after single judgement in Imperial County, CA, bankrupted the state's title indemnification fund, {{and the vast majority of}} U.S. states have opted for a system of document recording in which no governmental official makes any determination of who owns the title or whether the instruments transferring it are valid.|$|E

[...] However, it is possible that placing seals on the property was done solely to assess the respective fortunes of the owners.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effects of <b>encumbrance</b> (holding {{different}} types of objects while using mobile devices) to understand the interaction difficulties that it causes. An experiment was conducted where participants performed a target acquisition task on a touchscreen mobile phone while carrying different types of bags and boxes. Mobility was also evaluated since people carry items {{from one place to}} another. Motion capture hardware was used to track hand and arm postures to examine how holding the different types of objects caused excessive movement and instability therefore resulting in performance to decline. The results showed <b>encumbrance</b> and mobility caused target accuracy to decrease although input while holding the box under the nondominant arm was more accurate and exerted quicker targeting times than holding no objects. <b>Encumbrance</b> affected the dominant hand more than the nondominant hand as targeting error significantly increased and caused greater hand instability. The issues caused by <b>encumbrance</b> suggest the topic requires more attention from researchers and users would benefit greatly if better interaction techniques and applications are developed to counteract the problems...|$|R
