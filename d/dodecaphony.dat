500|$|Although in {{his youth}} Sorabji was {{attracted}} to what were then the newest developments in European art music, his musical tastes were essentially conservative. He had a particular affinity for late Romantic and Impressionist composers, such as Mahler, Debussy, Medtner and Delius, and his main [...] were Stravinsky, the late Schoenberg and Hindemith. He rejected serialism and <b>dodecaphony,</b> considering both {{to be based on}} artificial precepts, and he criticised even the later tonal works and transcriptions of Schoenberg. He loathed the rhythmic character of Stravinsky's music and what he perceived as its brutality and lack of melodic qualities. He viewed Stravinsky's neoclassicism as a sign of lack of imagination. Shostakovich and Fauré are among the composers whom Sorabji initially condemned but later admired.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his growing}} {{reputation}} as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler's Eighth Symphony in 1910. Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music. Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, {{he did not understand}} or like the latter's opera Pénélope (1913), of which he was the dedicatee. In 1917 Francis Poulenc, {{at the beginning of his}} career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius. By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common. His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy. Nor did the theories of Arnold Schönberg's <b>dodecaphony</b> commend themselves to Saint-Saëns: ...|$|E
500|$|Poulenc {{said that}} he was not inventive in his {{harmonic}} language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, [...] "All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity." [...] Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language [...] "as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing". Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for [...] "a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!" [...] He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to <b>dodecaphony,</b> led by René Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is [...] "directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up– [...] "la légende de facilité"– that his music came easily to him; he commented, [...] "The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, Stravinsky {{began using}} serial {{compositional}} {{techniques such as}} <b>dodecaphony,</b> the twelve-tone technique originally devised by Arnold Schoenberg. He first experimented with non-twelve-tone serial techniques in small-scale vocal and chamber works such as the Cantata (1952), the Septet (1953) and Three Songs from Shakespeare (1953). The first of his compositions fully based on such techniques was In Memoriam Dylan Thomas (1954). Agon (1954–57) {{was the first of}} his works to include a twelve-tone series and [...] (1955) was the first piece to contain a movement entirely based on a tone row. Stravinsky expanded his use of <b>dodecaphony</b> in works such as Threni (1958) and A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer (1961), which are based on biblical texts, and The Flood (1962), which mixes brief biblical texts from the Book of Genesis with passages from the York and Chester Mystery Plays.|$|E
2500|$|Serialism {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} post-war movements among the high modernist schools. Serialism, more specifically named [...] "integral" [...] or [...] "compound" [...] serialism, was led by composers such as Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono, and Karlheinz Stockhausen in Europe, and by Milton Babbitt, Donald Martino, Mario Davidovsky, and Charles Wuorinen in the United States. Some of their compositions use an ordered set or several such sets, which may be the basis for the whole composition, while others use [...] "unordered" [...] sets. The term is also often used for <b>dodecaphony,</b> or twelve-tone technique, which is alternatively regarded as the model for integral serialism.|$|E
2500|$|Other composers {{offered more}} melodic {{variants}} of Futurist music, notably Franco Casavola, who was active {{with the movement}} {{at the invitation of}} Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and Arthur-Vincent Lourié, the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five Synthèses offer a form of <b>dodecaphony,</b> while Formes en l'air was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, Leo Ornstein gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the Daily Sketch newspaper [...] "one listened with considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital." ...|$|E
2500|$|Copland's work in {{the late}} 1940s and 1950s {{included}} use of Schönberg's twelve-tone system, a development that he had recognized but not fully embraced. He had also believed the atonality of serialized music {{to run counter to}} his desire to reach a wide audience. Copland therefore approached <b>dodecaphony</b> with some initial skepticism. [...] While in Europe in 1949, he heard a number of serial works but did not admire much of it because [...] "so often it seemed that individuality was sacrificed to the method." [...] The music of French composer Pierre Boulez showed Copland that the technique could be separated from the [...] "old Wagnerian" [...] aesthetic with which he had associated it previously. Subsequent exposure to the late music of Austrian composer Anton Webern and twelve-tone pieces by Swiss composer Frank Martin and Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola strengthened this opinion.|$|E
2500|$|Serialism of {{the first}} type is most {{specifically}} defined as the structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements (normally a set—or row—of pitches or pitch classes) are used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity. Serialism is often broadly applied to all music written in what Arnold Schoenberg called [...] "The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ), or <b>dodecaphony,</b> and methods that evolved from his methods. It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series. In such usages post-Webernian serialism {{will be used to}} denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music. Other terms used to make the distinction are twelve-note serialism for the former, and integral serialism for the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Cage's first {{completed}} {{pieces are}} currently lost. According to the composer, the earliest works were very short pieces for piano, composed using complex mathematical procedures {{and lacking in}} [...] "sensual appeal and expressive power." [...] Cage then started producing pieces by improvising and writing down the results, until Richard Buhlig stressed to him the importance of structure. Most works from the early 1930s, such as Sonata for Clarinet (1933) and Composition for 3 Voices (1934), are highly chromatic and betray Cage's interest in counterpoint. Around the same time, the composer also developed a type of a tone row technique with 25-note rows. After studies with Schoenberg, who never taught <b>dodecaphony</b> to his students, Cage developed another tone row technique, in which the row was split into short motives, which would then be repeated and transposed according {{to a set of}} rules. This approach was first used in Two Pieces for Piano (c. 1935), and then, with modifications, in larger works such as Metamorphosis and Five Songs (both 1938).|$|E
