5|$|Sarah {{was famous}} for telling the Queen exactly what she thought, and did not offer her flattery. Anne and Sarah had invented petnames for {{themselves}} during their youths which they continued to use after Anne became queen: Mrs Freeman (Sarah) and Mrs Morley (Anne). Effectively a business manager, Sarah <b>had</b> <b>control</b> over the Queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.|$|E
5|$|The Senate still {{controlled}} North Africa, {{an important}} regional producer of grain, {{as well as}} Illyria and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions. However, the Senate <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions {{under the control of}} Augustus, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian.|$|E
5|$|The actors petitioned Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, the Lord Chamberlain, and {{requested}} that he settle the dispute, {{but he refused}} to involve himself in the matter. By early June, the actors <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of the theatre through the lease, but the management refused to leave. The actors tried to file for the management to be legally removed from the property, but the court system was slow to respond.|$|E

5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E
5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines <b>had</b> <b>control</b> {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|By May 1786, Raspe {{no longer}} <b>had</b> <b>control</b> over the book, which {{was taken over}} by a {{different}} publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen.|$|E

5|$|Ensemble Studios worked {{together}} with Big Huge Games to develop The Asian Dynasties, Age of Empires IIIs second expansion. This {{was the first}} joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects—particularly Halo Wars—while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games {{did most of the}} work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen joined in the brainstorming, and <b>had</b> <b>control</b> over the final product. Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.|$|E
5|$|Hugh married Margaret, one of {{the daughters}} and heiresses of William de Chesney, the founder of Sibton Abbey. Margaret {{was one of three}} daughters, but she {{inherited}} the bulk of her father's estates. Although Margaret was the eldest daughter, the reason she received the bulk of the estates was King Henry's desire to reward Hugh, as the king arranged the marriage as well as ensuring that most of her father's lands went to her. Through Margaret, Hugh gained the barony of Blythburgh in Suffolk, which he <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of by 1174. He also acquired lands at Rottingdean in Sussex from Margaret.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often <b>had</b> <b>control</b> over the appointment of the clergy and would be important in establishing and funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one on the word, making the Bible, {{and the ability to}} read the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E

5|$|Nolan {{returned}} to the British forces to join the Light Division at Devna as aide-de-camp to Airey. The Royal Navy <b>had</b> <b>control</b> over the Black Sea, and with a Russian treaty with Turkey and Austria, the enemy forces were withdrawing from Eastern Europe. Despite this favourable outcome, the British government wished {{to negotiate with the}} Russians from a strong position. The decision was taken to invade the Crimea itself, with the objective of destroying or capturing the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Raglan personally considered this unrealistic – British forces knew little about the region, the port's defences, or the strength of the Russian military, with estimates of troop numbers varying between 45,000 and 140,000. It was also quite a distance away, causing logistical difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the roads}} along which the A1 route travels {{are shared by}} the {{individual}} local boroughs, the Greater London Authority (GLA), and the British Government. The first organised London-wide authority dealing with roads in London was the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), set up in 1856. The MBW replaced the disparate turnpike trusts which had already been amalgamated in 1826 into the single control of Government Commissioners, and was itself replaced by the London County Council (LCC) in 1889. The LCC became the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1965, and during the 1960s when traffic management in London was being modernised, and the London Ringways was proposed, the GLC, which was not in favour of increasing traffic into central London, <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of the inner London roads, while the government, through the Ministry of Transport, which was in favour of widening roads, <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of outer London. These different approaches resulted in the Ministry of Transport widening a stretch of the A1 until it reached {{the control of the}} GLC, when the widening abruptly stopped. Due to the problems associated with two different and opposing bodies having responsibility for London's roads, the government were keen {{to take control of the}} major routes, and made plans in 1983 for the Department of Transport to take over 70 miles of road, including significant parts of the A1; when the GLC was abolished in 1986, the Department of Transport took over direct control of the 70 miles of major routes, plus had a significant influence on another 300. In 2000 control of roads in London passed to Transport for London, a department of GLA created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, and the major roads, including the A1, were declassified as trunk roads.|$|E
5|$|The District {{found an}} {{investor}} {{to finance the}} upgrade in 1901, American Charles Yerkes. On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised £1million {{to carry out the}} electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes soon <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level conductor rail similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, {{and the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} a Pinfalls Count Anywhere {{match for the}} WWE Championship, as John Cena defended against The Great Khali. Khali <b>had</b> <b>control</b> {{for most of the}} contest, {{performing}} a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena. The contest went into the crowd, as Khali hit Cena with a television monitor. Cena gained the advantage, swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali. Cena attempted to perform the FU, but Khali blocked it with his elbow. Khali regained the upper hand, scoop slamming Cena onto a crane. Cena fought back while on the crane and performed an FU to Khali off the crane onto the arena floor. Cena got the pinfall and the victory.|$|E
5|$|Urse also {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of a new castle at the town of Worcester, although nothing now remains of the castle. Worcester Castle was in place by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral. Although Urse <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of the castle after it was built, by 1088 he had lost it to the bishops of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with vacuum brakes, instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of a screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those {{that ran in}} passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E
5|$|After the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon {{and the end}} of the Angolan War of Independence, {{the parties}} of the {{conflict}} signed the Alvor Accords on 15 January 1975. In July 1975, the MPLA violently forced the FNLA out of Luanda, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. By August, the MPLA <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and Luanda. South Africa intervened on 23 October, sending between 1,500 and 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola in order to support the FNLA and UNITA. Zaire, in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government and thwart the MPLA's drive for power, deployed armored cars, paratroopers, and three infantry battalions to Angola in support of the FNLA. Within three weeks, South African and UNITA forces had captured five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela. In response to the South African intervention, Cuba sent 18,000 soldiers as part of a large-scale military intervention nicknamed Operation Carlota in support of the MPLA. Cuba had initially provided the MPLA with 230 military advisers prior to the South African intervention. The Cuban intervention proved decisive in repelling the South African-UNITA advance. The FNLA were likewise routed at the Battle of Quifangondo and forced to retreat towards Zaire. The defeat of the FNLA allowed the MPLA to consolidate power over the capital Luanda.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} end of Goswell Road, the route northwards follows a one-way section to the Angel, turning right into Islington High Street. The southwards route from Islington High Street follows City Road for a short distance before joining Goswell Road via Wakley Street. The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area. At this time, nine inns (including the Angel, which subsequently gave its name to the area), as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street. The Peacock Inn, one of the nine inns, and which operated on Islington High Street from 1564 to 1962, was where Tom of Tom Brown's Schooldays stayed prior to travelling to Rugby School. In 1716 Islington High Street came {{under the control of the}} newly formed Islington Turnpike Trust. The Trust grew rapidly and soon <b>had</b> <b>control</b> of most major roads in the area, building a number of major road arteries through the expanding residential areas, including Caledonian Road, Euston Road, City Road and New North Road.|$|E
