40|$|We {{exploit the}} {{restrictions}} of intertemporal portfolio {{choice in the}} presence of non-financial income risk to design and implement tests of hedging that use the information contained in the actual portfolio of the investor. We use a unique dataset of Swedish investors with information broken down at the investor level and into various components of wealth, investor income, tax positions and investor demographic characteristics. Portfolio holdings are identified at the stock level. We show that investors do not engage in hedging, but invest in stocks closely related to their non-financial income. We explain this with familiarity, that is the tendency to concentrate holdings in stocks with which the investor is familiar in terms of geographical of professional proximity or that he has held for a long period. We show that familiarity is not a behavioral bias, but is information-driven.

40|$|We derive {{the optimal}} hedging ratios for a {{portfolio}} of assets driven by a Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive model with general cointegration rank. Our hedge is optimal {{in the sense of}} minimum variance portfolio. We consider a model that allows for the hedges to be cointegrated with the <b>hedged</b> <b>asset</b> and among themselves. We nd that the minimum variance hedge for assets driven by the CVAR, depends strongly on the portfolio holding period. The hedge is dened as a function of correlation and cointegration parameters. For short holding periods the correlation impact is predominant. For long horizons, the hedge ratio should overweight the cointegration parameters rather then short-run correlation information. In the innite horizon, the hedge ratios shall be equal to the cointegrating vector. The hedge ratios for any intermediate portfolio holding period should be based on the weighted average of correlation and cointegration parameters. The results are general and can be applied for any portfolio of assets that can be modeled by the CVAR of any rank and order...|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} problem of writing {{guaranteed}} renewable health insurance {{in the presence of}} medical spending growth. Prior research suggests that the growth and difficulty in forecasting future medical costs is an impediment to multiperiod health insurance, where contract reserves are used to pay a portion of the benefits in later years of the contract. Medical spending growth is an input to calculating the magnitude of premiums and reserves, so setting up reserves to pay future claims involves forecasting spending growth. <b>Hedging</b> <b>assets</b> can ameliorate the investment problem by providing assets that automatically adjust to unexpected shocks in spending growth. ^ I expand an existing model of guaranteed renewability in an economy with risk to show the specific ways that medical spending growth enters the premium and reserve functions. I treat stochastic trend as a factor the insurance company can predict with error. I utilize aggregate and individual level insurance spending data and financial returns data to analyze whether medical trend can be <b>hedged</b> with existing <b>assets.</b> I separate trend into predictable and error components and analyze the correlation between the error component and return on assets. I find that medical spending growth is predictable with error over short and medium time horizons. I find that there is no significant correlation between asset returns and forecast errors across several broad asset classes. ^ The combination of partially predictable spending growth and the absence of a <b>hedging</b> <b>asset</b> imply that insurers should be using reserves to manage the macroeconomic risk of spending growth. The load for reserving for trend is an up-front cost in addition to the up-front expense of guaranteed renewability. Insurers should use a diversified investment strategy for reserves rather than one targeted at trying to match spending growth. I conclude by noting the positive and negative effects of the newly passed health reform law (PPACA) on guaranteed renewable health insurance and other health insurance arrangements that require contract reserves and policies that shift health care spending onto public plans. ...|$|R

40|$|In [1] Zawadoski {{introduces}} a banking network {{model in which}} the asset and counter-party risks are treated separately and the banks <b>hedge</b> their <b>assets</b> risks by appropriate OTC contracts. In his model, each bank has only two counter-party neighbors, a bank fails due to the counter-party risk only if {{at least one of}} its two neighbors default, and such a counter-party risk is a low probability event. Informally, the author shows that the banks will <b>hedge</b> their <b>asset</b> risks by appropriate OTC contracts, and, though it may be socially optimal to insure against counter-party risk, in equilibrium banks will not choose to insure this low probability event. In this paper, we consider the above model for more general network topologies, namely when each node has exactly 2 r counter-party neighbors for some integer r> 0. We extend the analysis of [1] to show that as the number of counter-party neighbors increase the probability of counter-party risk also increases, and in particular the socially optimal solution becomes privately sustainable when each bank hedges its risk to at least n/ 2 banks, where n is the number of banks in the network, i. e., when 2 r is at least n/ 2, banks not only <b>hedge</b> their <b>asset</b> risk but also hedge its counter-party risk.

The question has a natural formulation as a linear program. We show how to get price bounds. We also show the corresponding robust strategies which enforce those bounds. The strategies allow agents to write exotics and put a floor on their losses in all states of the world. For some common exotics such as a digital barrier option and a lookback, we provide simple characterizations for the bounds and the hedging strategies. For others, notably the forward straddle, we show numerical solutions. Rational Bounds on the Prices of Exotic Option...|$|R

Increasing volatility of financial markets and their globalization {{also lead to}} higher financial risks. These aspects are especially important for transitional and small open economies. The basic goal of the paper is to show the derivation and application possibilities of select hedging strategies. Five basic hedging strategies ? delta hedging, minimum variance, minimum value at risk, maximum expected utility value, and minimum shortfall ? are derived and described. All the strategies are derived for two asset portfolios consisting of risk assets (share, bond, commodity price, and exchange rate) and <b>hedged</b> <b>assets</b> (financial derivative). Another common assumption is that random variables are normally distributed. Examples of exchange rate, interest-rate, equity and commodity-risk hedging are described.

40|$|Real option {{valuation}} {{has traditionally}} been concerned with investment under project value uncertainty while assuming that the agent has perfect confidence in a specific model. However, agents do not generally have perfect confidence in their model and this ambiguity may affect their decisions. In addition, the value of real investments is not typically fully spanned by tradable assets because markets are incomplete as is typically the case in energy and commodities. In this paper, we account for the agent’s aversion to model ambiguity and address market incompleteness through the notion of robust indifference prices. We derive analytical results for the perpetual option to invest and the linear complementarity problem that the finite-time version of this problem satisfies. Ambiguity aversion {{has a number of}} effects on decision making some of which cannot be explained by altering the agent’s risk aversion. For example, ambiguity averse agents are found to exercise real options both earlier and later than their ambiguity neutral counterparts, depending on whether ambiguity stems from uncertainty in the dynamics of the project value or the dynamics of a <b>hedging</b> <b>asset...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytically}} tractable {{dynamic model}} of corporate investment and risk management for a financially constrained firm. Following Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993), we define a corporation’s risk management as {{the coordination of}} investment and financing decisions. In our model, corporate risk management {{is a combination of}} internal liquidity management, financial hedging, investment, and payout decisions. We determine the firm’s optimal risk management policies as functions of the following key parameters: 1) the firm’s earnings growth and cash flow risk; 2) the external cost of financing; 3) the firm’s liquidation value; 4) the opportunity cost of holding cash; 5) investment adjustment and asset sales costs; and 6) the return and covariance characteristics of <b>hedging</b> <b>assets</b> the firm can invest in. The optimal cash inventory policy involves two endogenous barriers and the continuous adjustment in investment and hedging positions in between the barriers. Cash is paid out to shareholders only when the cash-capital ratio hits the upper barrier, and external funds are raised only when the firm has depleted its cash. Several new insights emerge from our analysis. For example, w...|$|R
