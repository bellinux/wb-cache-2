When the sheet is viewed by itself in ordinary light, a pale image is seen. When viewed through a uniformly polarizing <b>filter</b> <b>sheet</b> oriented in the same plane of polarization, the image is almost completely invisible. If either sheet is then rotated 90 degrees about its axis, so that their planes of polarization are {{at right angles to}} each other, the image becomes boldly visible.|$|E
50|$|Wide angle L-lenses {{typically}} have a {{gelatin filter holder}} on the mounting point of the lens, which allows the photographer to cut a small, square piece of gelatin out of a larger <b>filter</b> <b>sheet</b> {{and place it on}} the lens. On film cameras, these are typically used to correct the color temperature, but on digital cameras this is largely unnecessary, as the color temperature can be corrected in software. The mount is still commonly used for neutral density gelatin sheets though, especially on certain wide-angle lenses where the protruding front element precludes the use of any screw-in filters. Some telephoto L-lenses, such as the EF 70-200mm zoom lenses, or the EF 300mm f/4L IS USM do not have rear gelatin filter holders. Super-telephoto lenses such as the EF 500mm f/4L IS USM, or the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM do have a rear 52mm drop-in filter holder which can be used to hold gelatin type filters.|$|E

Cell and ehemoattractant dose-response curves showed that results were comparable to or better than those obtained with blindwell chambers. The volume of chemoattractant per well is 25 pl; the number of cells can be as low as 10, 000. The time needed for setting up this multiwell unit and for staining the membrane <b>filter</b> <b>sheet</b> is negligible.

Cold stabilisation treatment involved holding of the brandy at - 1 °C during 24 hours. Five depth <b>filter</b> <b>sheets</b> with the nominal retention rate of 0. 3 μm, 0. 5 - 0. 7 μm, 0. 7 - 1. 0 μm, 1. 0 - 2. 0 μm and 2. 5 - 4. 0 μm, were tested in the study. It was shown that all assessed <b>filter</b> <b>sheets</b> were efficient in removing chill haze by significantly reducing the content of fatty acid esters (primarily ethyl palmitate and ethyl laurate). Other volatile and aromatic compounds were not significantly influenced by the applied treatments. However, the <b>filter</b> <b>sheets</b> with higher nominal retention rate (> 0. 7 μm), had a smaller impact on the sensory characteristics of the apricot brandy.

40|$|An {{investigation}} to study adsorption of gentamicin {{and other related}} aminoglycoside antibiotics to cellulose, diatomaceous earth (Celite), and Seitz <b>filter</b> <b>sheets</b> was carried out. Experiments with five aminoglycosides indicated that 30 to 100 % of these antibiotics was adsorbed to cellulose depending on the ratio of antibiotic to adsorbent, and the total quantity could not be removed by acidification. Similarly, a study with gentamicin found adsorption to diatomaceous earth {{to be in the}} range of 33 to 98 %. Neomycin and gentamicin were also readily adsorbed to Seitz <b>filter</b> <b>sheets.</b> The data indicate that large losses may occur during filtration of these antibiotics under certain conditions, and care should be taken to properly evaluate results during studies with these compounds in the presence of adsorbent materials...|$|R
40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle filter elements can be used directly as inverted candle filter elements, {{and the development of a}} new type of filter element is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle filter elements were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle filter elements, and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle filter elements are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> elements were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> element is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> element may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> elements could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> element manufacturing has not been established. The development of the <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle <b>filter</b> system. The <b>sheet</b> <b>filter</b> system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, filter element fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R

Depth measurements typically ranged from the substrate surface to the <b>filter</b> <b>sheet</b> separating substrate from the drainage layer below. Taken together, each roof therefore received a mean value for substrate depth. Interestingly, {{in spite of the}} different forces one would expect, substrate depth on pitched versus flat roofs was similar for both the mean and the measured range across each roof (data not shown); of course, the absence of original data prevents any meaningful conclusions. Overall, we would expect pitched roofs to have deeper depths {{at the base of the}} slope and shallower depths at the top, supporting an accordingly stratified vegetation (Table  1).|$|E
30|$|The surface {{hydrophobicity}} {{was investigated}} by water {{contact angle measurement}} as described in Eschlbeck and Kulozik (2017). In short, filtration of cells was applied (approx. 4  ×  109 cells per filter) on a cellulose acetate filter (pore size 0.22  µm, Sartorius Stedim, Göttingen, DE), followed by adjusting the surface water content by storing the filters with spore layers on petri dishes consisting of 2 % agar–agar for 2  h to equilibrate the moisture content throughout the spore layer. The <b>filter</b> <b>sheet</b> was cut in stripes and fixed on glass slides by means of double-sided adhesive tape and dried for further 50  min on air to remove excess water and to reach a defined state in moisture content without crack formation of the spore layer. The measurement was carried at out 20  °C with a DSA 100 (Krüss, Hamburg, DE) and the software DSA  4 (Krüss, Hamburg, DE). A drop of water was deposited on the filter surface and the cell hydrophobicity was determined by video analysis of the advancing contact angle.|$|E

Results in practical inactivation validation tests, however, vary considerably with no available explanation so far. This study reports {{on the effect of}} cultivation pH on spore surface hydrophobicity. Surface hydrophobicity is suspected {{to have an impact on}} the decontamination of technical surfaces such as packaging material when gaseous, condensing hydrogen peroxide is applied. It is the aim of this study to examine the impact of different cultivation pH levels on surface hydrophobicity and resistance of B. subtilis spores. Submersed cultivation of B. subtilis in bioreactors at controlled conditions with different static pH levels led to contact angles ranged between 50 ° and 80 °, which was analyzed with water on a homogeneous layer of spores on a <b>filter</b> <b>sheet.</b> Resistance of spores was also affected by the cultivation pH. The results show that the culturing conditions during BI production should be controlled to obtain BI with specified characteristics in inactivation validation tests.|$|E

Immunoperoxidase staining of these antigens with infected mastomys sera showed that maximum number of antigens in infective larval stage were identified by the sera collected at prepatent stage of infection whereas in adult antigen maximum bands were recognized by sera from patent infection. A large number of microfilarial antigens {{were found to be}} immunoreactive during patent stage but only a few remained functional during latency. Uterine antigens possess a number of immunoreactive components which reacted with antibodies in sera of all stages of infection with maximum recognition by patent (microfilaraemic) serum.

Ultracentrifuged, pelleted, and solubilized viral culture supernatants were transferred into either tubes (macromethod) or microtiter plates (micromethod) and incubated with tritiated enzyme substrate. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated DNA was collected on individual filter papers with a Millipore filtration manifold (macromethod) or on <b>filter</b> <b>sheets</b> using a semiautomated cell harvester (micromethod). Filters were then placed in scintillation fluid and counted on a beta scintillation counter. Results of the micromethod significantly correlated {{to those of the}} macromethod, with a linear relationship between the two. The cutoffs for positivity based on the mean + 2 standard deviations for a set of known negative specimens (n = 19) was 4, 973 cpm for the micromethod compared with 5, 336 for the macromethod. The intrarun and interrun variations were comparable for both methods. There was a 67 % increase in the maximal daily number of specimens which could be run (100 versus 60) as well as a reduction in reagent use. In summary, the micromethod utilizing a semiautomated cell harvester is comparable to the existing macromethod in accuracy and is an improvement due to savings in time and reagents...|$|R

We present here some promising results {{on the use of}} essential oil compounds to control these biofilms. Biofilms were grown on stainless-steel coupons with a microbial white water consortium sampled from an industrial paper mill. Five essential oil compounds were screened initially in the laboratory in terms of their antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells and biofilms. The three most active compounds were selected and then tested in different combinations. The combination finally selected was tested at the pilot scale to confirm its efficiency under realistic conditions. All the compounds tested were as active against biofilms as they were against planktonic cells. The most active compounds were thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol, and the most efficient combination was thymol-carvacrol. At a pilot scale, with six injections a day, 10 mM carvacrol alone prevented biocontamination for at least 10 days, and a 1 mM thymol-carvacrol combination enabled a 67 % reduction in biofilm dry matter after 11 days. The use of green antimicrobials could constitute a very promising alternative or supplement to the treatments currently applied to limit biofilm formation in the environment of paper mill machines...|$|R

The initial acceleration period becomes shorter as the oxygen concentration is increased. The spread rate is weakly dependent on the flow veloci ty for low gas velocities (mixed flow) but becomes independent of the flow velocity for forced flow conditions. The flame spread rate is practically linearly dependent on the oxygen concentration of the flow over the range of concentrations tested.

40|$|Trissolcus egg parasitoids, when perceiving the {{chemical}} footprints {{left on a}} substrate by pentatomid host bugs, adopt a motivated searching behaviour characterized by longer searching time on patches were signals are present. Once in contact with host chemical footprints, Trissolcus wasps search longer on traces left by associated hosts rather than non-associated species, and, in the former case, they search longer on traces left by females than males. Based on these evidences, we hypothesized that only associated hosts induce the ability to discriminate host sex in wasps. To test this hypothesis we investigated the ability of Trissolcus basalis, T. brochymenae, and Trissolcus sp. to distinguish female from male Nezara viridula, Murgantia histrionica, and Graphosoma semipunctatum footprints. These three pentatomid bugs were selected according to variable association levels. Bioassays were conducted on <b>filter</b> paper <b>sheets,</b> and on Brassica oleracea (broccoli) leaves.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new method for the isolation of proteins for microsequencing. It consists of electrophoretic transfer (electroblotting) of proteins or their cleavage fragments onto activated glass <b>filter</b> paper <b>sheets</b> immediately after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins are immobilized on the glass fiber sheets by ionic interactions or by covalent attachment. A wide range of proteins can be prepared in this fashion with no apparent restriction due to solubility, size, charge, or other intrinsic properties of the proteins. As little as 50 ng of the transferred proteins can be detected using Coomassie Blue or fluorescent dye staining procedures and even smaller amounts of radiolabeled proteins by autoradiography. After detection, the protein- containing bands or spots are cut out and inserted directly into a gas- phase sequenator. The piece of glass fiber sheet acts as a support for the protein during the sequencing. Amounts of protein in the 5 - to 150 - pmol range can be sequenced, and extended runs {{can be obtained from}} the blotted samples because of improved stepwise yields and lower backgrounds.

The results showed that nutrient deficiency had effect on root architecture of winter wheat. N deficiency increase in total seminal root and lateral root length and root/shoot ratio, while P deficiency resulted in increase of mean root diameter, total root area when compared to the control. N deficiency also decreased root and shoot dry weight and total leaf area. However, nutrient deficiency slightly decreased lateral density.

40|$|Drug {{availability}} from suppositories {{is currently}} evaluated in vitro {{by means of}} a model consisting of a dialysis tube (porous membrane) or isolated biological membrane (animal rectum). We propose a new alternative in vitro method to determine drug availability from suppositories consisting of an artificial membrane soaked with n-octanol, coupled with a <b>filter</b> paper <b>sheet</b> soaked with phosphate buffer. This method provides for an integrated hydro-lipophilic simulation of the biological membrane, including the mucus layer adhering to the rectal mucosa. By simply using the porous membrane, the amount of drug released varied directly according to its solubility for formulations with lipophilic excipients. For formulations with hydrophilic excipients, drugs with low/intermediate solubility in water showed increased availability in comparison to lipophilic excipients. The in vitro rat rectum model provided overall results that were similar to those obtained with the porous membrane method, although the percentage values of AUC were lower. The new model of in vitro simulated absorption produced a degree of drug availability that was lower in comparison to both previous methods. However, the simulated model appeared to give a pattern of drug availability closer to that of the model of in vitro rat rectum. The new in vitro artificial model thus appears to be useful in suppositories preformulation studies, allowing for an estimate of drug availability and the choice of the most adequate excipient...|$|R

40|$|Epidemiological and {{toxicological}} studies demonstrate that ultrafine particles (UFPs) are strongly related with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and syndromes. One common method to reduce human exposure to {{particulate air pollution}} {{is the use of}} intermediate class filters (F 5 -F 9 class filters according to EN 779 : 2002). However, the efficiency of such filters, with respect to UFPs, is not well explored. Furthermore, neither the European standard nor the US standard for classification of intermediate class filters comprises performance with respect to UFPs or particles of the most penetrating size (MPPS). This {{could turn out to be}} a major lack in classification standards since UFPs have been pointed out as a potential serious health hazard. To fill in the gap, the purpose of the thesis is to evaluate the performance of intermediate class filters available on the Swedish market, and to correlate the efficiency for UFPs (EFUFP) and MPPS-size particles (EFMPPS) with the EN 779 classification efficiency for particles of the size 0. 4 μm (EF 0. 4 μm). The thesis also contains analyses of 1) air filtration for indoor particles of outdoor and indoor origin; 2) how to efficiently apply intermediate air filters in two-step air filtration systems and 3) ionizer assisted air filtration. Size-resolved filtration efficiencies of 23 <b>filter</b> <b>sheets</b> and 8 full-scale filters were tested in laboratory experiments with four types of upstream aerosols. The relationships between EFUFPs, EFMPPS and EF 0. 4 μm were investigated under different testing conditions. The results showed that the electrostatic force from charged filter fibers has big influence on the shape of the efficiency curves. Additionally, the electrical charge state of the upstream aerosol is critical for the testing of charged synthetic filters. Linear relationships were found between EFUFPs, EFMPPS and EF 0. 4 μm within the observed efficiency range for both glass fiber and charged synthetic filters. In general, EFMPPS was 10 - 20 %-units lower than EF 0. 4 μm. The values of EFUFPs were close to EF 0. 4 μm for glass fiber filters, while EFUFPs were lower than EF 0. 4 μm for charged synthetic filters. Theoretical analysis showed that filter operating hours and classes are critical to the cost of two-step filtration, i. e. a solution where a pre-filter protects the main filter. Under suitable operation, two-step filtration is not necessarily more expensive than single-step filtration. Another analysis investigated suitable filter class, filtration locations, and the ratio of supply to outdoor air flow rate, for efficient removal of particles coming from indoor and outdoor sources. The results can be used to recommend suitable air filters and ventilation rates/modes or to predict the existing system performances. Yet a separate study, based on measurements, shows that an F 7 class filter assisted with an ionizer may reach an efficiency similar to that of a single F 9 class filter...|$|R

40|$|Innovations in {{hydraulic}} fracturing technology have created opportunities for petroleum {{and natural gas}} production. This technology injects water, sand, and additives to create fissures in rock formations and discharge oil and gas to the surface. The average amount of water used per well is approximately 4. 4 million gallons. The large water demand and the complexities involved in wastewater treatment make this process very expensive and not sustainable as far as water use is concerned. Flexible membrane technology has not been developed to process fracking water for re-use across the U. S. The objective of this project is to compare and analyze the recovery of contaminated fracking water through different types of ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes. Through ultrafiltration, the hydraulic fracture water is pretreated to remove the majority of total suspended solids (TSS) and turbidity. The water flux, chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, TSS, and salt level concentrations are then measured. Afterwards, the treated water is <b>filtered</b> using flat <b>sheet</b> nanofiltration membranes of Osmonics and SEPA Membrane Element Cell Equipment. The process is repeated with different membranes to determine optimal operating pressure, flux, and salt rejection. This study reveals that the highest performing membranes could remove 70 percent of divalent ions with an 85 percent water recovery in the permeate. Therefore, the process reduces significant amount of wastewater, which is disposed to the deep wells injection. With these promising results, our process can recycle water for reuse in {{hydraulic fracturing}} while minimizing environmental damage due to water contamination. Through this project, {{we are confident that}} hydraulic fracking can become a more sustainable process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{dealt with}} {{comparative}} activities of enzymic hydrolysis upon such cellulosic substances as the filter papar strips (Toyo Filter Paper Co., No. 50, 2 × 10 cm in size) and CMC (a soluble derivative of cellulose, DP, 155 : DS, 0. 48) with nineteen species of wood-rotting fungi (ten species {{of white and}} nine species of brown rot fungi). These fungi were inoculated to <b>filter</b> papers (one <b>sheet</b> per one test tube of 20 cm and four tubes were used per one species of test organisms) and incubated at 27 ℃. Each tube contained 25 ml of the nutrient solution. After 3 weeks of incubation, {{the rate of the}} weight loss of filter paper strips was calculated and dialyzed filtrates were used for samples of the determination of Cx activity. Percentage of the weight loss of strips with Trametes sanguinea showed the greatest value of 16. 6 %. Since mycelia developed mainly around the point of inoculum and the degradation of the strips was then confined to that point, it was converted into the proportion against 16. 6 %, decreased by Trametes sanguinea. The most prominent fact in the present experiment was that the great differences in the weight loss of strips between white and brown rot fungi were found. These caused by white rot fungi were greater than those by brown rot ones except where Tyromyces balsameus was tested, the rate of the weight loss of which being 15. 6 % (converted value is 94). These difference might not be resulted by the differences of cellulolytic activities, but mainly by those of the velocity of growth or ecological conditions between both types of wood-rotting fungi. On the contrary, Cx activities of brown rot fungi were greater than those of white rot fungi, so that it could not be recognized any correlation between the degradation of paper strips and Cx activities. 菌類によるセルローズ分解に関する研究は近年著しく進歩し，多数の報告が出されているが，セルローズが酵素によつて分解を受ける機作については，次のような過程が考えられている。すなわち〓ここにおいて，酵素C 1 ，Cxの作用は細胞外で行われるものである。しかしながら，この見地によつて木材腐朽菌を用いたセルローズ分解に関する研究は極めて少ない。それ故，筆者は 19 種類の木材腐朽菌（白色朽菌 10 種，褐色朽菌 9 種）を用いてセルローズ物質――セルローズとして東洋濾紙 50 番を，またCx activity決定のために可溶性セルローズ誘導体CMC（DP＝ 155 ，DS＝ 0. 48 ）――の分解能力の比較を行うと同時に，培養濾液のpHの変化及びCx activityをも測定した。その結果，濾液のpHの変化及びCx activityの大小とセルローズ分解能力との間には，本実験に関する限りでは，関係が見られなかつた。セルローズの分解は重量減少率を以て表わされたが，一般に白色朽菌は褐色朽菌に比して，はるかに分解力が大で，逆にCx activityは褐色朽菌の方が著しく大であつた...|$|R
