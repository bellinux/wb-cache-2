40|$|Solar cells used in {{photovoltaic}} (PV) crystalline silicon modules commonly feature <b>grid</b> <b>fingers</b> and {{bus bars}} as front contacts. The <b>grid</b> <b>fingers</b> and bus bars partially block the sunlight {{from reaching the}} semiconductor layers of a solar cell and therefore reduce the efficiency of a solar module. In this paper, we present experimental results of different technologies to reduce the shadowing effect that bus bars and <b>grid</b> <b>fingers</b> impose. We focus on two technologies {{that can be easily}} integrated into standard PV module technology and help to increase the module's efficiency. In the first technology, a laser is used to create a scattering pattern on the front glass of the module. This pattern directs light away from the bus bars and <b>grid</b> <b>fingers.</b> In the second technology, the bus wires are coated with a diffuse reflective coating. The sunlight is diffusely reflected at this coating. A part of it is reflected at such angles that internal reflection at the front surface of t he cover glass occurs. From there the light is reflected back to the solar cell and contributes to the generated photocurrent...|$|E

Efficiencies were calculated for various cell lengths and scribing areas in between cells (interconnection dead zone widths). The application of a metallic grid was studied to enhance the front contact. Both the efficiency and the cell length can be increased considerably. The exact benefit depends on the cell configuration and dimensions. This work presents quantitative analysis {{of the effects of}} a wide array of variables, such as cell length, sheet resistance of the transparent conductive oxide, interconnect dead zone, <b>grid</b> <b>finger</b> height, <b>grid</b> fingerwidth and <b>grid</b> <b>finger</b> spacing. In addition to the cell efficiency, the calculated JV-curves are also presented, which bring more detail for a correct interpretation of the trends observed. Furthermore, the efficiencieswere calculated using a set of ‘virtual’ transparent conductors with a sheet resistance between 0. 1 and 10 Ω/sq and a fixed transmittance of 89. 8 %. By comparing the efficiency of these transparent conductors with the results obtainedwhen using the fingers, the finger height can be translated to a virtual sheet resistance...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a gap in}} {{efficiency}} between record thin film cells and mass produced thin film solar panels. In this paper we quantify the effect of monolithic integration on power output for various configurations by modeling and present metallization {{as a way to}} improve efficiency of solar panels. <b>Grid</b> design and <b>finger</b> dimension optimization was performed monolithically integrated solar panels by modeling under standard conditions and with variation of boundary conditions such as transparent conductor used, conductivity of the metallic pattern and low light intensity. For each, the optimal cell and grid dimensions as well as the power output is presented. In contrast to previous studies that focus on 100. μm wide grid lines, our <b>grid</b> <b>finger</b> width was varied between over a wide range and a finger width of 20. μm was shown to give optimal results. We included mapping the power output for 20. μm, 60. μm and 100. μm wide grid lines as function of cell length, finger spacing and TCO sheet resistance and show that also for wide fingers efficiency improvement of more than 15 % is possible. This provides not only optimization of grid dimensions, but also the sensitivity of the power output with respect to the finger dimensions, TCO sheet resistance and the cell length. These results indicate that the application of a grid is a robust solution which allows for a considerable variation (> 25 %) in the parameter window around the optimum configuration with only small impact (< 2 %) on the power output. cop. 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Solar cells with n-doped BSFs were much worse compared to p+ BSFs. This might be a result of a lower crystallographic quality of the highly n-doped layers which act as seeding layers for the subsequent epi-growth.

40|$|Isothermal ageing is {{a widely}} used method in {{electronics}} to address the alleged long-term stability of soldered joints. Compared to common IEC 61215 module tests such as damp heat or thermal cycling it is relatively fast (< 90 h), {{does not require the}} lamination of a module and allows ribbon peel testing and metallographic analysis after the test. We study the mechanical and chemical solder joint properties after isothermal cell testing compared to thermal cycling and damp heat exposure of mini-modules. In this study solder joints of encapsulated Multi-Busbar (MBB) solar cells, which provide a multitude of single joints, are investigated after accelerated ageing tests. A special demountable one-cell-module setup enables chemical and mechanical characterization of solder joints after damp heat and thermal cycling tests. The observed fracture patterns are analyzed and designated to the degradation products characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Isothermal ageing and thermal cycling show non-chemical failure mechanisms caused by mechanical stress or intermetallic phase growth. The largest impact on contact adhesion and indicators for chemical degradation are found after damp heat testing.

Light transmission and surface characterisation of the cells displays an average of 22 % more light transmission than the physical non-AgNW shaded area of the cell surface. Further to this it is observed that plasmonic effects result in an increased scattering of incoming light into the cell, which also reduced the amount of light reflected from the cell’s front plane. The cells with silver nanowire electrodes did not, however, show improved current–voltage characteristics compared to cells without a front electrode. This is attributed to the overall low light transmission as a result of silver nanoparticles present in the electrodes and poor electrical connection between silicon cell and electrode.

Substrate misorientation can change the value of critical coverage but also creates more uniform quantum dots in both size and distribution. Uniform quantum dots are advantageous in concentrator photovoltaic devices due to increases in sub bandgap response. Concentration photovoltaic devices are designed to compete on a cost per watt basis with other terrestrial photovoltaic devices. This benefit can only be utilized if the fabrication process is also cost effective. Concentration devices rely on dense thick Au <b>grid</b> <b>finger</b> design to reduce series resistance, which can add to processing costs. This work explores GaAs p-i-n photovoltaic devices grown via organometallic vapor phase epitaxy with InAs quantum dots using the Stranski-Krastanov growth method on substrates misoriented 6 ° off (100) in the [110] direction and 2 °off (100) in the [110] direction. Both preliminary test and devices structures were created in order to study device performance through external quantum efficiency, and current-voltage behavior, as well as material properties through atomic force microcopy and photoluminescence.

The techniques employed included diffuse scattering and reflection to minimize shading losses, as well as using structured glass {{to increase the}} probability of incident light capture. In the first technology, a laser is used to create a scattering pattern on the front-side glass of the module. This pattern directed light away from the bus bars and <b>grid</b> <b>fingers,</b> resulting in an increase in short circuit current (ISC) of up to 3. 3 %.

The light is reflected back to the active area of the solar cell and contributes to the generated photocurrent resulting in an av erage increase of 0. 9 % in ISC. Finally, four different types of commercially available structured glass were investigated: grooves, pyramids, inverted pyramids, and a very lightly textured glass with only 5 % increased surface area.
