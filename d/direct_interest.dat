5|$|In New Hampshire {{the timber}} dispute was {{overlaid}} by ongoing disputes between local landowners and Samuel Allen, a London merchant who had acquired the territorial {{claims of the}} heirs of John Mason, the province's founder, and was pursuing them against those landowners. Allen, who had been commissioned governor of the province in 1692, only came to the colony in 1698 to take a <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in its affairs. During Bellomont's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.|$|E

The newspaper also published the complete FBI file on McGovern, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed shortly after McGovern's death.|$|E
5|$|James IV was 15 {{when he came}} to the throne, {{but soon}} proved a capable and {{independent}} minded ruler, whose reign is often considered to have seen a flowering of Scottish culture under the influence of the European Renaissance. He took a <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in the administration of justice and frequently moved his court in legal circuits of justice ayres. He defeated a major Northern rebellion, mainly of supporters of the murdered James III. It began in Dunbarton in 1489, led by the Earl of Lennox and Lord Lyle and spreading through the North. James is credited with finally bringing the Lordship of the Isles under control. He forced through the forfeiture of the lands of the last lord John MacDonald in 1493, backing Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly's power in the region and launching a series of naval campaigns and sieges that resulted in the capture or exile of his rivals by 1507.|$|E

5|$|Saavedra protested against Pedrarias' {{aggression}} but judged his own forces {{insufficient to}} attack Pedrarias' men in Olancho. Pedrarias in turn sent messengers {{to demand that}} Saavedra and the town council of Trujillo submit to his rule. The Spanish Crown was now taking a <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in the chaotic state of affairs in Central America. It was taking efforts to place Crown officials as governors, and creating colonial organisations such as the audiencias to impose absolute government over territories claimed by Spain. In so doing, it ended the era of distinguished conquistadors setting themselves up as overlords of territories they had conquered. On 30 August 1526, the Diego López de Salcedo was appointed by the Crown as governor of Honduras. He left Santo Domingo in early September, and the Audiencia ordered all rival claimants out of the colony.|$|E
5|$|Joseph married Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, {{hoping he}} could claim the Bavarian {{electorate}} for his offspring. After {{two years of}} unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died without issue. When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to Lower Bavaria through a dubious and ancient grant made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor legal grounds, Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph's death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to {{the remainder of the}} duchy. Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Anterior Austria that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore's own heir presumptive, Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the presumptive heir of Charles Theodore's domains and titles. He had a clear and <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in the disposition of the Bavarian duchy, especially in its territorial integrity.|$|E

25|$|Publicly traded grantor trusts, such as Merrill Lynch's HOLDRs securities, are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} ETFs, although they lack many {{of the characteristics of}} other ETFs.

25|$|In 1883, {{because of}} {{extensive}} poaching and political scandal, the Army was authorized to protect Yellowstone {{although it was}} not called upon by the Secretary of the Interior to do so until 1886. The Army stayed in Yellowstone in an administrative capacity until 1916. After 1890, the Army also was called on to protect Sequoia, the General Grant tree, and Yosemite. In each of the Army parks, the War Department was compelled to erect basic facilities for its own use. Fort Yellowstone, Wyoming, was {{the most important of these}} complexes. The army buildings there were constructed to standard Army specifications. The Army had no <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in the landscape, and this was echoed in their architecture.|$|E

25|$|The League of Three Emperors (Dreikaisersbund) {{was signed}} in 1872 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that republicanism and {{socialism}} were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia {{in order to keep}} France isolated. In 1877–1878, Russia fought a victorious war with the Ottoman Empire and attempted to impose the Treaty of San Stefano on it. This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the Ottoman Empire and preventing a Russian takeover of the Bosphorus Strait. Germany hosted the Congress of Berlin (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence, although King Carol of Romania was a German prince.|$|E
500|$|The ambassadors {{of the six}} Great Powers {{decided to}} {{constitute}} the Principality of Albania on July 29, 1913 during the [...] 54th meeting of the London Conference. The new country needed a sovereign, borders, government and military police force. To ensure the gendarmerie's neutrality, the Powers decided that its members should come from a different country. Their first choice was Sweden, but that country was already busy with a similar mission in Persia, they chose the Netherlands for its neutrality, lack of <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in Albania and extensive colonial experience in the Dutch East Indies. On October 15, 1913 they established the International Commission of Control to administer the country until its own political institutions were established.

Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield and ended with the club's first FA Cup title.

500|$|No Singapore {{cases have}} yet {{recognized}} the standing of applicants {{who have had}} no direct personal interest in the subject-matter being litigated. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the High Court appeared to accept in theory that every citizen prima facie {{has the right to}} apply for mandatory, prohibiting or quashing orders in order to prevent an abuse of power by a public authority, though the Court has discretion to refuse to grant them. In doing so, the applicant may claim to be regarded as a public benefactor, rather than a meddlesome busybody. This seems to support the proposition that a citizen may bring a suit even where he or she has no <b>direct</b> <b>interest</b> in the subject matter of litigation. The court has discretion to accord him or her standing if it considers it in the public interest to do so. Justice Judith Prakash cited the following comments of Lord Justice Hubert Parker in R. v.

(See [...]) Similarly, in addition to allegedly receiving a signet ring and a Royal State Sword or Sword of State, a consequence of the diplomatic mission sent to Aurangzeb in 1700 was formal subordination to Mughal authority and a requirement to pay annual taxes; there is evidence too that the administrative reforms Chikka Devaraja has instituted might have been a direct result of Mughal influence.|$|E
