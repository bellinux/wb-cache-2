5|$|These {{sections}} are subdivided {{by other}} {{features such as}} the substrate, products, and chemical mechanism. An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example, hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) is a transferase (EC 2) that adds a phosphate group (EC 2.7) to a <b>hexose</b> sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group (EC 2.7.1).|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{transfer}} from plant to fungi may occur through the arbuscules or intraradical hyphae. Secondary synthesis from the hexoses by AM {{occurs in the}} intraradical mycelium. Inside the mycelium, <b>hexose</b> is converted to trehalose and glycogen. Trehalose and glycogen are carbon storage forms that can be rapidly synthesized and degraded and may buffer the intracellular sugar concentrations. The intraradical <b>hexose</b> enters the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, which produces pentose for nucleic acids.|$|E
25|$|Among the <b>hexose</b> {{substrates}} are mannose, fructose, and glucosamine, but the affinity of glucokinase {{for these}} requires concentrations {{not found in}} cells for significant activity.|$|E
50|$|HMF is an {{intermediate}} in the titration of <b>hexoses</b> in the Molisch's test. In the related Bial's test for pentoses, the hydroxymethylfurfural from <b>hexoses</b> may give a muddy-brown or gray solution, {{but this is}} easily distinguishable from the green color of pentoses.|$|R
40|$|A Salmonella typhimurium mutant showing {{impairment}} in {{the utilization of}} <b>hexoses</b> was isolated after treatment with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. At 30 C, it grew with <b>hexoses</b> (glucose, fructose, galactose, mannitol), glycerol, succinate, or acid-hydrolyzed casein. At 37 C, it failed to grow {{with any of the}} <b>hexoses.</b> Enzymatic determinations demonstrated, however, that the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway (up to the formation of triose phosphates) were present and active at 25 and 32 C. At 42 C, the mutant did not grow with any of the carbon sources used. At both 37 and 42 C, the mutant grew perfectly well with <b>hexoses</b> if yeast extract was present. The metabolite required for growth was thiamine or, specifically, its thiazole moiety. If glucose was added to a culture growing in glycerol, at 37 C, growth was inhibited. This inhibition was relieved by the addition of thiamine or thiazole. Thus, at 37 C and only in the presence of <b>hexoses,</b> the mutant manifests a requirement for thiazole. This auxotrophy is absolute at 42 C. These data indicate that, in this mutant, some derivative of <b>hexoses</b> inhibits the synthesis of thiazole, and that this inhibition is also dependent on the temperature of incubation. The position in the bacterial chromosome of the genetic locus of this lesion (thz−) was determined by conjugation and found to coincide with the only thiamine (thi) locus so far reported...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{conditions}} for the calorimetric estimation of <b>hexoses</b> by reaction with carbazole in hot sulfuric acid solution have been determined and a convenient procedure, giving results with a precision of 2 to 5 per cent {{in the range of}} 50 to 150 γ of glucose, is described. The colors obtained with glucose, galactose, fructose, and mannose are not sufficiently distinctive to allow their ready differentiation and identification by spectral measurements. The significance of the ultraviolet spectra of heated and unheated sulfuric acid solutions of <b>hexoses</b> to the problem of estimation and identification of <b>hexoses</b> is discussed...|$|R
25|$|Phosphorylation of a <b>hexose</b> such as glucose often limits it to {{a number}} of {{intracellular}} metabolic processes, such as glycolysis or glycogen synthesis. This is because phosphorylated hexoses are charged, and thus more difficult to transport out of a cell.|$|E
25|$|A {{hexokinase}} is {{an enzyme}} that phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming <b>hexose</b> phosphate. In most organisms, glucose {{is the most}} important substrate of hexokinases, and glucose-6-phosphate {{is the most important}} product. Hexokinase possesses the ability to transfer an inorganic phosphate group from ATP to a substrate.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>hexose</b> glucose and fructose sugars, most strains of O. oeni can use the residual pentose sugars left behind from yeast fermentation including L-arabinose and ribose. Only around 45% of O. oeni strains can ferment sucrose (the form of sugar usually added for chaptalization that gets converted by yeast into glucose and fructose).|$|E

25|$|Destabilizing the {{molecule}} {{in the previous}} reaction allows the <b>hexose</b> ring to be split by aldolase into two triose sugars: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (a ketose), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (an aldose). There are two classes of aldolases: class I aldolases, present in animals and plants, and class II aldolases, present in fungi and bacteria; the two classes use different mechanisms in cleaving the ketose ring.|$|E
25|$|By catalyzing the {{phosphorylation}} of glucose {{to yield}} glucose 6-phosphate, hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of glucose into cells. This reaction also initiates all physiologically relevant pathways of glucose utilization, including glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The {{addition of a}} charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping' of glucose and 2-deoxyhexose glucose analogs (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose, and 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose) within cells, as charged <b>hexose</b> phosphates cannot easily cross the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid {{is absorbed}} in the body by both active {{transport}} and simple diffusion. Sodium-Dependent Active Transport—Sodium-Ascorbate Co-Transporters (SVCTs) and <b>Hexose</b> transporters (GLUTs)—are the two transporters required for absorption. SVCT1 and SVCT2 import the reduced form of ascorbate across plasma membrane. GLUT1 and GLUT3 are the two glucose transporters, and transfer only the dehydroascorbic acid form of Vitamin C. Although dehydroascorbic acid is absorbed in higher rate than ascorbate, the amount of dehydroascorbic acid found in plasma and tissues under normal conditions is low, as cells rapidly reduce dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate. Thus, SVCTs {{appear to be the}} predominant system for vitamin C transport in the body.|$|E

40|$|During sucrose uptake by the cotyledons of {{castor bean}} {{seedlings}} excised from their endosperms, {{small amounts of}} glucose and fructose accumulate in the medium. When these <b>hexoses</b> were supplied separately, {{it was found that}} the rate of fructose uptake exceeded that of glucose at concentrations up to 0. 5 m. Sucrose uptake exceeded that of both <b>hexoses</b> combined, particularly at concentrations greater than 0. 1 m. Only minute amounts of labeled <b>hexoses</b> were recovered from the cotyledons after exposure to glucose-U- 14 C or fructose-U- 14 C; sucrose contained virtually all of the 14 C in the sugar fraction. The fructose and glucose moieties of the extracted sucrose were equally labeled when glucose-U- 14 C was supplied, and the glucose moiety contained 41 % of the 14 C when fructose-U- 14 C was the substrate...|$|R

These results, along {{with the results of}} studies on the enzymes present in extracts of these heat-activated spores, were interpreted to mean that a functional Embden-Heyerhof (W) system was absent and that glucose was utilized by means of a modified hexosemonophosphat...|$|R
25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (<b>hexose)</b> residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E
2500|$|Hexokinases {{should not}} be {{confused}} with glucokinase, which is a specific isoform of hexokinase. [...] While other hexokinases are capable of phosphorylating several hexoses, glucokinase acts with a 50-fold lower substrate affinity and its only <b>hexose</b> substrate is glucose.|$|E
2500|$|Methylene blue restores {{the iron}} in {{hemoglobin}} to its normal (reduced) oxygen-carrying state. [...] This {{is achieved by}} providing an artificial electron acceptor (such as methylene blue or flavin) for NADPH methemoglobin reductase (RBCs usually don't have one; the presence of methylene blue allows the enzyme to function at 5× normal levels). [...] The NADPH is generated via the <b>hexose</b> monophosphate shunt.|$|E
40|$|Pentoses, <b>hexoses</b> and disaccharides were {{administered}} to the triturated florets of dyer's saffon (Carthamus tinctorius) and their effects on enzyme-catalyzed floret reddening examined spectrophotometically. Among the sugars tested, <b>hexoses</b> promoted reddening most prominently. On average, a 4. 2 -fold increase in the certhamin content was observed when <b>hexoses</b> {{were added to the}} crushed materials. Disaccharides followed these. Upon incubation of the triturated tissues with 10 mM sugars, the pigment producing activity was raised to 3. 4 -fold or more. Pentoses were also potent stimulators, although their efficiencies were somewhat lower (3. 2 -fold). On the whole, D-forms were more stimulative than L-forms (D-forms - 3. 6 -fold, L-form - 2. 8 -fold). Based on these comparisons, we concluded that sugars play a role in floret reddening through interaction with endogenous precarthamin-oxidizing enzyme(s) in the floral tissues of the garden plant...|$|R
40|$|Bioethanol {{production}} by white rot fungus (Trametes versicolor), identified from fungal mixture in naturally decomposing wood samples, from <b>hexoses</b> and xylose was characterized. Results showed that T. versicolor can grow in culture, under hypoxic conditions, with various mixtures of <b>hexoses</b> and xylose and only xylose. Xylose was efficiently fermented to ethanol in media containing mixtures of <b>hexoses</b> and xylose, such as MBMC and G 11 XY 11 media (Table 1), yielding ethanol concentrations of 20. 0 and 9. 02 g/l, respectively, after 354 h of hypoxic culture. Very strong correlations {{were found between}} ethanolic fermentation (alcohol dehydrogenase activity and ethanol production), sugar consumption and xylose catabolism (xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase activities) after 354 h in culture in MBMC medium. In a medium (G 11 XY 11) containing a 1 : 1 glucose/xylose ratio, fermentation efficiency of total sugars into ethanol was 80 % after 354 h...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid dual-wavelength spectroscopic method {{is used for}} {{simultaneous}} determination of pentoses and <b>hexoses</b> in the prehydrolyzate from lignocellulosic biomass. The method {{is based on the}} following reaction mechanism: in the solution of hydrochloric acid, phloroglucinol gives color reaction with sugars or their degradation products, showing maximum absorbance at 553 nm and 410 nm. Based on dual-wavelength spectrophotometric measurement, the pentoses and <b>hexoses</b> can separately be quantified. It was found that the derivatives from these two different sugars have an isosbestic point at 425 nm. According to the validation results, high accuracy and reasonable recovery rate is shown with the present method (pentoses recovery 97. 1 to 100. 0 %, <b>hexoses</b> recovery 97. 2 to 102. 0 %). Additionally, the interferences from substances including lignin, furfural, 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid are insignificant. All of the above results illustrate the suitability of this method for analyzing sugars in the lignocelluloses prehydrolyzate, especially hardwoods or herbaceous plants, based on forest-related biorefinery research...|$|R

50|$|The Uhp system uptakes {{phosphorylated}} <b>hexose</b> sugars into bacteria. The Uhp {{system is}} triggered by phosphorylated <b>hexose</b> sugars {{on the outside}} of the cell. UhpC binds to the phosphorylated <b>hexose</b> which allows the phosphorylation of UhpB on one of its cytoplasmic histadines. This facilitates the phosphorylation of an aspertate on UhpA, and the phosphorylated UhpA activates the transcription of UhpT. UhpT then facilitates the transport of the phosphorylated <b>hexose</b> sugars into the cell.|$|E

40|$|In peach trees (Prunus persica L. Batsch cv. Redhaven), {{sorbitol}} is {{a primary}} photosynthetic product and may {{play an important role}} in the budbreak process. Surprisingly, before budbreak (from January to early March), the concentration of sorbitol in the xylem sap decreases, while that of <b>hexoses</b> (glucose and fructose) increases. The aim of this work was to study the control of sorbitol uptake into vegetative buds by <b>hexoses.</b> Sorbitol uptake was selectively inhibited by <b>hexoses</b> at low and physiological concentrations and this effect was both reversible and concentration-dependent. In addition, the active uptake of sorbitol significantly declined in the plasma membrane vesicles-enriched fraction purified from glucose-treated vegetative buds, suggesting that the inhibitory action of glucose was at the membrane level. Finally, among several glucose analogues tested, only hexokinase substrates (2 -deoxyglucose and mannose) were able to mimic the glucose effect, which was completely blocked by the hexokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose. These results represent the first steps towards a better understanding of polyol transport control in plants...|$|R
