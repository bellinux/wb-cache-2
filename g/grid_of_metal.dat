40|$|B-modes in {{the cosmic}} {{microwave}} background (CMB) polarization is a smoking gun signature of the inflationary universe. To achieve better sensitivity to this faint signal, CMB polarization experiments aim to maximize the number of detector elements, resulting in a large focal plane receiver. Detector calibration of the polarization response becomes essential. It is extremely useful to be able to calibrate 'simultaneously' all detectors on the large focal plane. We developed a novel calibration system that rotates a large 'sparse' <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> wires, in front of and fully covering the field of view of the focal plane receiver. Polarized radiation is created via the reflection of ambient temperature from the wire surface. Since the detector has a finite beam size, the observed signal is smeared according to the beam property. The resulting smeared polarized radiation has a reasonable intensity (a few Kelvin or less) compared to the sky temperature ({approx} 10 K observing condition). The system played a successful role for receiver calibration of QUIET, a CMB polarization experiment located in the Atacama desert in Chile. The successful performance revealed that this system is applicable to other experiments based on different technologies, e. g. TES bolometers...|$|E

30|$|Polarizer is an {{indispensable}} device {{in a wide}} range of optical systems, including flat panel displays, microdisplays, and optical networking. Nanowire-grid polarizers (NWGPs) have been of great interest because of their excellent polarization performance and planar structure that allows them to be integrated to other thin-film optoelectronic devices. Moreover, they show good optical stability with respect to variation of the polar angle and azimuthal rotation, and excellent durability at high temperatures and under exposure to high UV flux [1]. The NWGP generally consists <b>of</b> fine <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> parallel <b>metal</b> nanowires with space and width less than the wavelength of light. For the light polarized parallel to the nanowire, it reflects, whereas for the light polarized perpendicular to the nanowire, it transmits.

40|$|Abstract. Stents are medical implants, {{which are}} applied to keep {{cavities}} {{in the human body}} open, e. g. blood vessels. Typically they consist <b>of</b> tube-like <b>grids</b> <b>of</b> suitable <b>metal</b> alloys. Typical dimensions depend on their applications: outer diameters in the mm-range and grid bar thickness in the 100 µm range. Before implantation, stents are compressed (crimped) to allow implantation in the human body. During implantation, stents are expanded, usually by balloon catheters. Crimping as well as expansion causes high strains and high stresses locally in the grid bars. These strains and stresses are important design criteria of stents. Usually, they are calculated numerically by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The XRD-sinψ-technique is applied for in-situ-determination of stress conditions during crimping and expansion of stents of the CoCr-alloy L- 605. This provides a realistic characterization of the near-surface stress state and an evaluation of the numerical FEA results. XRD-results show an increasing compressive load stress in circumferential direction with increasing stent expansion. These findings correlate with the numerical FEA results. Further residual stresses after removing the expansion device have been measured...|$|R

Ferro- (1 and 5) and antiferromagnetic (2 – 4) interactions between the metal ions are mediated by the carboxylate bridge in the anti–syn conformation, the bis-monodentate 4, 4 ′-bpy ligand being unable to transmit a significant magnetic coupling.

As strength characteristic the Rockwell hardness is used. Wear tests were conducted in the conditions of normal loading with (10 %) and without sliding on the test equipment SMTs- 2. Parameters of the fine crystalline structure (tetragonality degree <b>of</b> the crystalline <b>grid,</b> dislocation density, scale of coherent scattering regions, and disturbance value <b>of</b> the crystalline <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> second kind) {{are determined by the}} methods of X-ray structural analysis. Findings. During operation of the railway wheels with different strength level, origin of defects on the wheel thread is caused by simultaneous action of both the friction forces and the cyclically changing loadings. Considering that formation of damage centers is largely determined by the state <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> volumes near the wheel thread, one should expect the differences in friction processes development at high contact stress for the wheels with different strength level and structural state. Originality. During the wear tests softening effect of carbon steel with martensite quenching structure is obtained. Softening effect equaled 3. 5 – 7 % from the level <b>of</b> quenched <b>metal</b> hardness. The softening effect is accompanied by the reduction of tetragonality degree of the crystalline structure of martensite, reduction of coherent scattering regions, dislocation density increase and crystalline <b>grid</b> disturbance <b>of</b> the second kind. Practical value. The results point out the necessity for further studies to clarify the resulted softening effect mechanism...|$|R
