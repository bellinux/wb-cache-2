5|$|Abbas Kiarostami's film Ten (2002) was an {{experiment}} that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement of the car which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{retained the}} aluminium body panels of the XJ220 concept, {{but for the}} production vehicles, Abbey Panels of Coventry were contracted to provide the exterior panels. The scissor doors were dropped for the production model, and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> insisted the design had {{to be seen to}} be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company. Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated by the change in the wheelbase, which was reduced by 200mm.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E

5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E

5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|E

25|$|The Home Depot {{has been}} a major sponsor for Joe Gibbs Racing in NASCAR since 1999.
