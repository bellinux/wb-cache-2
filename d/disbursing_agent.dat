25|$|McCall was a {{constant}} critic {{of the lack of}} a central disbursing authority in the federal government. He believed that having a <b>disbursing</b> <b>agent</b> in each agency or department was a recipe for financial misappropriation. He applauded President Roosevelt's decision on June 10, 1933, to issue Executive Order 6166, which created a Division of Disbursement within the Treasury Department and eliminated this office within each agency.|$|E

50|$|An {{accounting}} of {{the exact number of}} fatalities during the Removal is also related to discrepancies in expense accounts submitted by Chief John Ross after the Removal that the Army considered inflated and possibly fraudulent. Ross claimed rations for 1600 more Cherokee than were counted by an Army officer, Captain Page, at Ross' Landing as Cherokee groups left their homeland and another Army officer, Captain Stephenson, at Fort Gibson counted them as they arrived in Indian Territory. Ross' accounts are consistently higher numbers than that of the Army <b>disbursing</b> <b>agents.</b> The Van Buren administration refused to pay Ross, but the later Tyler administration eventually approved disbursing more than $500,000 to the Principal Chief in 1842.|$|R
6000|$|During {{the last}} fiscal year 23,196 names {{were added to}} the pension rolls and 4,876 dropped therefrom, leaving at its close 187,963. The amount paid to pensioners, {{including}} the compensation of <b>disbursing</b> <b>agents,</b> was $28,422,884, an increase of $4,411,902 on that of the previous year. The munificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested in its legislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the recent struggle to maintain [...] "that unity of government which makes us one people." [...] The additions to the pension rolls of each successive year since the conclusion of hostilities result in a great degree from the repeated amendments of the act of the 14th of July, 1862, which extended its provisions to cases not falling within its original scope. The large outlay which is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowance bestowed since that date upon those who {{in the line of duty}} were wholly or permanently disabled. Public opinion has given an emphatic sanction to these measures of Congress, and it will be conceded that no part of our public burden is more cheerfully borne than that which is imposed by this branch of the service. It necessitates for the next fiscal year, in addition to the amount justly chargeable to the naval pension fund, an appropriation of $30,000,000.|$|R
50|$|In other cases, {{a process}} called {{settlement}} takes place on a specified date and time during which all parties (usually including the agents involved) meet at a settlement company, and which is presided over or supervised by a lawyer or settlement agent. At that time, the settlement <b>agent</b> <b>disburses</b> all funds listed on the settlement statement (in form of certified or wired funds) and the property conveyance takes place, and the deed is then recorded by the settlement company.|$|R

50|$|CERP Officers had {{authority}} to sign agreements with contractors up to $200,000. The Pay <b>Agent</b> <b>disbursed</b> cash or paid by electronic transfer (EFT) in Afghanistan. The PRT Commander (LTC or CDR) could approve projects up to $25,000. CERP guidelines required that development projects be coordinated through and sustained by local governments and prohibit the use of funding for the salaries of government officials. The monies {{could not be used}} by police or security forces. CERP projects from up to $200,000 had to be approved by the Task Force Commander. The contracts were written in US Engineering standards. The Army usually paid by electronic funds transfer as pay agents are discouraged from paying cash to contractors in Afghanistan. The projects were paid in phases. Engineers worked through project details with contractors. If the contractors failed the performance work standard, the engineer could recommend that the PRT withhold funds until project deficiencies were corrected. The project could also be cancelled.|$|R

50|$|The plan {{proposed}} by the Monetary Commission provided {{for the establishment of}} local associations of banks and the grouping of these into regional associations. These were further grouped into a national reserve association with a head office at Washington. Under certain conditions, all banks in the country were to be eligible for membership in this central institution. Its functions were to be essentially the same as those performed by the great central banks or Europe, namely, the holding and administration of the bank reserves of the country, the issue of an elastic currency based upon commercial assets, the rediscount or commercial paper for banking institutions, and the serving as depositary and <b>disbursing</b> <b>agent</b> for the Government. The commission believed that it had worked out a system of control which would prevent the domination of the association by any group of interests, political or financial.|$|E
50|$|In addition, some Cherokee {{traveled}} {{from east to}} west more than once. Many deserters from the Army's boat detachments in June 1838 later emigrated in the twelve Ross wagon trains. There were transfers between groups, and later join ups and desertions were not always recorded. Jesse Mayfield was a white man with a Cherokee family went twice (first voluntarily in B.B. Cannon's detachment in 1837 to Indian Territory; unhappy there, he returned to the Cherokee Nation; and in Oct. 1838 was Wagon Master for the Bushyhead Detachment). An Army <b>disbursing</b> <b>agent</b> discovered that a Cherokee named Justis Fields travelled with government funds three times under different aliases. A mixed-blood named James Bigby, Jr. travelled to Indian Territory five times (three as government interpreter for different detachments, as Commissary for the Colston detachment, and as an individual in 1840). In addition, a small but significant number of mixed-bloods and whites with Cherokee families petitioned to become citizens of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, or Tennessee and thus ceased to be considered Cherokee.|$|E

40|$|Financial Aid {{is awarded}} to {{students}} based on federal formulas {{for determining the}} need for taxpayerfunded student aid programs. Federal and state regulations require that all financial aid awards have taken into account any and all resources that students have available to meet {{the cost of their}} education. All colleges and universities are required to have a mandatory Coordination of Resources policy in place to ensure compliance with these regulations. PROCEDURES: STUDENTS are required to report all resources they receive during the school year (other than employment). Similarly, ALL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS DEPARTMENTS, OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES AND ANY UNIVERSITY AUXILIARIES must notify the Financial Aid Office of any payments or benefits that they award to students (other than employment or short-term loans). Failure to do so, or late notification, puts the student at serious risk for overpayment of financial aid funds resulting in a reduction and or cancellation of Financial Aid already awarded and a billing by the University. Eligibility for all future financial aid may be affected. The entities making award decisions (rather than the <b>disbursing</b> <b>agent)</b> are required to report student resources to the Financial Aid Office. Such entities include but are not limited to...|$|E
