40|$|A popular refrain in the {{politics}} of American education, often buttressed by a steady stream of studies, contends that ‘we are falling behind’ students from other countries. Sometimes this decline is specified in terms of discipline, but the general premise is that American students lag behind their foreign counterparts, with special dread attached to the notion <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> behind adversaries such as China. The failure to rectify our educational inadequacies apparently portends a genuine crisis, the loss of global dominance. The articulation <b>of</b> such <b>fears</b> is particularly instructive in discerning the political role of education in late capitalism, its conceptualization and uses within the context of politics. How do the <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> behind speak to the political role of education in late capitalism? I draw upon the ideas of the Herbert Marcuse and his Marxist intervention into Freudian psychoanalysis. Using Marcuse’s framework, I argue that in late capitalism the political role of education, formerly understood to serve life affirming value, has been reoriented to further the aims of the death drive. The <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> behind, and the policies that have followed, are symptomatic of a disposition toward education that has reconfigured the school as a means of conquest, subjugation, and war...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} clinical {{factors associated}} with gait alterations in patients with Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A sample of 76 diabetic patients underwent clinical examination and an outdoor gait assessment on tarred and cobblestoned terrains. We calculated respective differences in gait speed (performance measure) and gait variability (fall risk index) on changing terrains. Associations with clinical factors were investigated using correlation coefficients and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean walking speed on the tarred pathway was 4. 5 +/- 0. 6 km/h and 3. 9 +/- 0. 8 km/h on the cobblestone pathway (P < 0. 001). The CVGCT increased from 2. 6 +/- 0. 9 % on the tarred pathway to 5. 1 +/- 2. 8 % on the cobblestone pathway (P < 0. 001). Regression analysis showed that 36 % of the decrease in gait speed was explained proportionally by the mean of maximal isometric lower limb strength (22. 2 %; P ≤ 0. 01), <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> (7. 4 %; P ≤ 0. 01) and participants' perceived vibration threshold (6. 4 %; P ≤ 0. 01). Moreover, mean maximal isometric strength explained 11. 8 % (P ≤ 0. 01) of the increase of the coefficient of variation of the gait cycle time when participants changed from tarred terrain to cobblestones. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that both physiological (strength and proprioception) and cognitive-behavioural factors (<b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls)</b> should be considered when treating diabetic patients with gait alterations. Therapists should apply these findings when developing specific fall prevention and treatment programmes...|$|R
