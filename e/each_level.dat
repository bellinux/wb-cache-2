Upon the station's opening, it operated as a typical one-track, one-side platform station on <b>each</b> <b>level,</b> with only the IND side in use, while the BMT side of <b>each</b> <b>level</b> was hidden beyond an orange tiled false wall.

Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged.

5|$|Alyssa {{is given}} no {{weaponry}} during {{the majority of}} the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within <b>each</b> <b>level,</b> the Subordinate can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill the Subordinate, but instead renders them unconscious for a set time. The primary means of eluding one, however, is by hiding. There are multiple hiding points throughout <b>each</b> <b>level,</b> and each one can be used multiple times. However, hiding places are ineffective if the Subordinate sees Alyssa enter them.|$|E
