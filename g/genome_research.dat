5|$|Guinea pigs {{were popular}} {{laboratory}} animals until the later 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used {{annually in the}} U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. As of 2007, they constitute about 2% of the current total of laboratory animals. In the past, they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation. Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats. This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W. E. Castle and Sewall Wright {{made a number of}} contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color. In 2004, the U.S.'s National Human <b>Genome</b> <b>Research</b> Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig.|$|E

From discussions in that workshop it was obvious that our community needed to organize to fully exploit genomics resources. A provisional Aspergillus <b>Genomes</b> <b>Research</b> Policy Committee (AGRPC) was conscripted and charged with creating a structure for community-wide coordination and organizing an annual meeting. The First Aspergillus Meeting was held in Copenhagen, April 21, 2004, as a satellite meeting of the European Congress on Fungal Genetics- 7. In addition to scientific presentations, bylaws were approved, community research directions were discussed and the 2004 AGPRC was elected. The name Aspergillus <b>Genomes</b> <b>Research</b> Policy Group was adopted for the community. The objectives of the AGRPG are: (1) Provision of an educational and discussion forum for issues pertaining to Aspergillus genomics, in its widest sense, and for the various Aspergillus research communities; (2) Influencing grant making bodies and other institutions on behalf of the various Aspergillus research communities; (3) Coordinating research activities internationally, as and when required, to further the science base of the Aspergillus genus.

40|$|Emergence {{of novel}} genome {{engineering}} {{technologies such as}} clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) has refocused attention on unresolved ethical complications of synthetic biology.

While a precautionary principle should be applied at all stages of <b>genome</b> engineering <b>research,</b> the stigma of germline editing, synthesis of new life forms and unrealistic presentation of current technologies should not arrest the transition of new therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive tools from research to clinic.

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TE) are {{stretches of}} DNA {{that represent the}} greatest fraction of genomes, especially in plants.

The fraction of genome that they represent and the influence they have is variable among species; however they were detected in practically every plant <b>genome</b> <b>researched</b> up to date. Deleterious mutations may be caused by their activity which is also another reason why their expression is tightly regulated by the host organism.

40|$|A {{class of}} bent DNA {{is present in}} the genomic DNA of higher eukaryotes as a repeating unit (Kiyama, R., Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1, 641 - 647, 1998). This bent DNA appears once every 680 bp on average, and often shows periodicity, {{suggesting}} biological significance. By having a higher affinity for histone core particles, it has a role in designating a key nucleosome, which initiates nucleosome alignment. This modulates the enhancer activity of-LCR and the silencer activity of the human-globin locus and other loci. This suggests that this type of bent DNA plays important roles in various biological functions by affecting chromatin structure. I. Periodic bent DNA Recent advances in <b>genome</b> <b>researches</b> have made an extensive progress in the technology for identifying genes. A high attention, although less than that for identifying genes, has also been paid for the regulatory elements in the promoter regions of these genes.

25|$|The {{extent to}} which masculinity is inborn or {{conditioned}} is debated. <b>Genome</b> <b>research</b> has yielded information {{about the development of}} masculine characteristics and the process of sexual differentiation specific to the human reproductive system. The testis determining factor (also known as SRY protein) on the Y chromosome, critical for male sexual development, activates the SOX9 protein. SOX9 works with the SF1 protein to increase the level of anti-Müllerian hormone, repressing female development while activating and forming a feedforward loop with the FGF9 protein; this creates the testis cords and is responsible for sertoli cells, which aid in sperm production. The activation of SRY halts the process of creating a female, beginning a chain of events leading to testicle formation, androgen production and a number of pre- and post-natal hormonal effects.|$|E
