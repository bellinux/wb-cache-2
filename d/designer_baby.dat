40|$|Abstract: The study {{discusses}} {{the topic of}} preimplantation genetic diagnostic (PGD) {{as an object of}} regulation in Austrian reproductive medicine policy. It has two main focuses: On the one hand it shows the political processes and public discussionsconcerning PGD in Austria; on the other hand it explicates the meanings which PGD acquired in Austria in this connection. After an introduction about the relevance of PGD as an object of political regulation, about the medical-technical procedures and forms of clinical applications of PGD, the legal framework for applying PGD in Austria is presented. Then the process of policy formulation, basically covering the period between 1999 / 2000 and 2008, is described in detail. Finally, the meanings ofPGD are discussed. It is argued that the central meanings of PGD condense around the notion of the <b>designer</b> <b>baby,</b> which can be connected both to positive and negative appraisals of PGD. ...|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} the ethical {{arguments}} for and against several issues raised by assisted reproductive technologies, including sex selection, <b>designer</b> <b>babies</b> and multifoetal pregnancy reduction. The unprecedented advances made in obstetrics {{with the aid of}} these technologies are considered wonderful by many medical professionals and infertile couples alike. The wide-ranging and ever expanding applications of these new technologies are not unanimously supported however, with many groups expressing concerns about their misuse. Using the main ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice and autonomy each topic is examined in detail to provide a reasoned argument as to their merits and downfalls. The common theme is that the responsible use of these technologies for treating or avoiding severe medical conditions can be ethically justified. In contrast, the more controversial social reasons for their use provoke a “slippery slope” argument, which is generally reprehensible. For these reasons, sex selection and <b>designer</b> <b>babies</b> can be supported with ethical arguments, within the limits of disease prevention.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a lot of}} {{different}} areas in genetic research have been debated in the mass media. On the one hand ethical problems with amniocenteses, potential risks with genetically modified crops, problems with biologist arguments in gender-debates have been discussed for years. Other subjects, like chimera mice, <b>designer</b> <b>babies</b> and risks with stem cell therapy are on the other hand hidden in mass medial silence. How does that come? In this paper I would like to discuss some explanations of why some scientific and technological issues become "hot stuff" in media, described as conflicts, while other subjects aren’t discussed at all, they become non-conflicts. Since they have not been discussed, they haven’t either been exposed for the public "trial". This is the case in, for example, issues concerning stem cell therapy, transgenic animals and <b>designer</b> <b>babies.</b> These are examples of non-existing, or chill, debates in Swedish mass media. The explanations of how different debates emerge I will suggest are a) the starting point of a debate (cf. Ideland 2002 a), b) what kinds of metaphors are used (cf. Haraway 2004, Martin 1994) and c) how expectations for medical cures are described (cf. Brown 2003). The paper is based on results from projects concerning media debates on embryonic stem cell research (Ideland 2002 a), gene technology (Ideland 2002 b) and ethical evaluation of experimentation on transgenic animals (Ideland 2007) ...|$|R
50|$|For example, PGD has {{the ability}} to select an embryo based on gender {{preferences}} (Stankovic). Since changing a gender is not needed, but desired this could cause much controversy. Additionally, the procedure is able to create a donor offspring or a “savior sibling”, which can assist a pre-existing offspring for medical purposes. The “savior sibling” is a brother or sister that is created to donate life-saving tissue to an existing child. There has been arguments against the procedures of “savior siblings” because many believe that this will lead humans closer to the creation of <b>designer</b> <b>babies.</b> For example, one critique said, “the new technique is a dangerous first step towards allowing parents to use embryo testing to choose other characteristics of the baby, such as eye colour and sex”.|$|R

40|$|Study question: Is {{the fear}} for <b>designer</b> <b>babies</b> a convincing {{argument}} against the development of stem cell derived (SCD-) gametes? Summary answer: Although SCD-gametes can facilitate the creation of <b>designer</b> <b>babies,</b> this need not undermine the entire enterprise of in vitro gamete derivation. What is known already: The dawn of new reproductive techniques is often accompanied by fears for eugenic practices, the creation of so-called <b>designer</b> <b>babies</b> in particular. The reproductive use of SCD-gametes feeds similar worries, {{in view of the}} possibility to select and design embryos with desired nondisease related traits. While such practices have a negative moral connotation, it should be investigated whether or not this moral worry is justified, both in terms of the scientific possibilities (state of the art), and the moral wrongness of selecting and or editing embryos in function of non-disease related traits. Study design, size, duration: A literature study was performed to delineate how the terms ‘eugenics’ and ‘designer baby’ are used and how they relate to each other. Next, claims in the scientific and ethical literature about how SCD-gametes may be used for eugenic purposes were inventoried. These claims were critically evaluated for scientific accurateness. Finally, we question whether the claimed possibility of selecting or genetically designing future offspring based on non-disease related traits is necessarily a morally bad thing. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Literature study, conceptual analysis, normative analysis. Main results and the role of chance: A first possibility is to produce large numbers of gametes (especially oocytes) and embryos to select genetic traits. Second, stem cells could be edited via CRISPR/Cas 9 and differentiated into gametes. Third, SCD-gamete technology could be used to recombine SCDgametes with other gametes and derive gametes from the resulting embryos (and so on) to shape the genome through selective breeding, by combining desirable traits that arise in different embryos. Fourth, at present somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is hindered by the short supply of human oocytes. This could be overcome by means of SCD-gametes. By facilitating SCNT, SCD-gamete technology could ease the creation of embryos with the same genome as someone with a desirable genotype. A last possibility would be to create gametes from persons with desired traits (e. g. via induced pluripotent stem cells) and make these available via gamete banks. Each of these scenarios is premised upon further scientific developments. Given the rapid advance in CRISPR/Cas 9, it might become possible to edit embryos so that SCD-gamete technology will be neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition to genetically design offspring. If SCD-gamete technology would become safe, it might nevertheless facilitate eugenic purposes, of which the moral wrongness remains contested. Limitations, reasons for caution: Gamete derivation from human stem cells is still in the research phase. The question of the moral wrongness of enhancement and eugenics is explored but not ‘answered’, as it is a fundamentally normative question. Similarly, ‘designer baby’ is a stipulative concept, as it is contested which interventions amount to ‘designing’. Wider implications of the findings: The causal link between SCD-gamete technology and eugenics/designer babies is weak and speculative. Moreover, the wrongness of such an evolution is contested.

Areas of agreement: Mitochondrial donation offers women with mitochondrial disease an opportunity to have healthy, genetically related children. Areas of controversy: Key areas of disagreement include safety, the creation of three-parent babies, impact on identity, implications for society, definitions of genetic modification and reproductive choice. Growing points: The UK government legalized the techniques in March 2015. Scientific and medical communities across the world followed the developments with interest.

30|$|A further reason {{given as}} a {{justification}} for moratorium on gene editing research {{is that it will}} send us on a slippery slope to non-therapeutic modifications and <b>designer</b> <b>babies.</b> But the mere fact that a technology could be used non-therapeutically doesn’t warrant a moratorium on its use. For example, lasik eye surgery can be used non-therapeutically, but this doesn’t justify restrictions on its therapeutic uses. There would need to be clear evidence that the acceptance of therapeutic lasik will ultimately lead to objectionable non-therapeutic applications. Similarly, IVF and PGD can be used to select for traits like height and intelligence. This doesn’t constitute a good reason not to use these technologies to avoid genetic disease. Rather than a blanket ban on research into gene editing technology, it would be more appropriate to ban the deployment of this technology to enhance normal traits, if that is the concern. Technology can and must be controlled by laws. And if it cannot, {{there is no point in}} making laws, including bans. Rather, energy would be better spent preparing to combat the unethical deployment of technology.|$|R
