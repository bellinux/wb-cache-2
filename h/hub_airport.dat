5|$|International {{airports}} have {{commercial relationships}} with and {{provide services to}} airlines and passengers from around the world. Many also serve as hubs, or places where non-direct flights may land and passengers may switch planes, while others serve primarily direct point-to-point flights. This affects airport design factors, including the number and placement of terminals {{as well as the}} flow of passengers and baggage between different areas of the airport. An airport specializing in point-to-point transit can have international and domestic terminals, each in their separate building equipped with separate baggage handling facilities. In a <b>hub</b> <b>airport,</b> however, spaces and services are shared.|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of global civil aviation industry, {{the significance of}} non-aeronautical revenue has become increasingly evident from the 1990 s. Nowadays, many airports are focusing on being more creative with non-aeronautical revenue. According to the latest statistics, the world’s non-aeronautical revenue occupies about 45. 8 % of the total revenue with 7. 2 % of the annual rate of growth, (ACI, 2015). Therefore, to examine the significant role of the non-aeronautical activities for international <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> in a multi-view, thus to make practical recommendations accordingly will be worthy for the future development of these airports. This study consists of methods of literature review, case study, survey, and professional interview. Through carrying out a desktop research by literature review to gain an insight into current world’s non-aeronautical activities. And through a case study to reveal the current situation of worldwide international <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> in a large extent, {{which is based on}} the historical statistics of six target at-grade international <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> worldwide. Moreover, by conducting a passenger survey in HKIA to gain an insight into the current situation of passenger satisfaction in international <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> And by conducting two professional interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of the current situation of non-aeronautical activities in international <b>hub</b> <b>airports,</b> and the views also is a guidance for making relevant recommendations. Based on the multi-angle the combined results of this study, this dissertation concludes the increasingly significant role of non-aeronautical activities in the development of international <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> to a large extent.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} links between {{domestic}} market regulation, dominant airline performance, and international market liberalization in Northeast Asia (NEA). The study focuses on China, where substantial regulations are still present in the aviation market, particularly {{in areas such as}} route entry, airport slot allocation, input supply, and aviation support services. These regulations limit the ability of entrant airlines to compete in <b>hub</b> <b>airports,</b> and allow dominant airlines to strengthen their market power and achieve substantial growth at the expense of their competitors. Current Chinese regulations assist major state-owned carriers by suppressing domestic competition, particularly in markets linked to <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> If national policy in China continues to be guided by requirements created to support the dominant airlines, in the short term there will be limited liberalization on routes linked with <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> Promoting LCC services in the region is one practical alternative for the short term which could prevent major disruption to network carriers. This investigation suggests that Chinese airlines would be less resistant to bilateral liberalization with ASEAN, Oceanian or European nations than they would with other regions, as they are well positioned in these markets, and may be able to develop their <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> into Asia's gateways to Europe. In the long term, however, {{there is no substitute for}} full liberalization if NEA governments want their nations to fully benefit from enabling their carriers and <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> to achieve global competitiveness...|$|R

25|$|Grand Central Terminal was an {{innovation}} in transit-hub design {{and continues to}} influence designers. One new concept {{was the use of}} ramps, rather than staircases, to conduct passengers and luggage through the facility. Another was wrapping Park Avenue around the Terminal above the street, creating a second level for picking up and dropping off of passengers. As airline travel replaced railroads {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century, Grand Central design innovations were later incorporated into the <b>hub</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|E
25|$|Until 2015, CVG {{consistently}} {{ranked among}} the most expensive major airports in the United States. Delta operated over 75% of flights at CVG, a fact often cited {{as a reason for}} relatively high domestic ticket prices. Airline officials have suggested that Delta practices predatory pricing to drive away discount airlines. From 1990 to 2003, ten discount airlines began service at CVG, but later pulled out, including Vanguard Airlines, which pulled out of CVG twice. Delta maintains that its pricing is reasonable, considering the increased connectivity and non-stop flights that a <b>hub</b> <b>airport</b> offers a market the size of Cincinnati.|$|E
50|$|A {{mainline}} {{flight is}} a flight operated by an airline's main operating unit, {{rather than by}} regional alliances, regional code-shares, regional subsidiaries, or wholly owned subsidiaries offering low-cost operations. Mainline carriers typically operate between <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> within their network and on international or long-haul services, using narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. This {{is in contrast to}} regional airlines, providing feeder services to <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> operating smaller turboprop or regional jet aircraft, or low-cost carrier subsidiaries serving leisure markets.|$|R

25|$|By the 1980s the {{original}} design, which had mobile lounges meet each plane, {{was no longer}} well-suited to Dulles' role as a <b>hub</b> <b>airport.</b> Instead, midfield concourses were added to allow passengers to walk between connecting flights without visiting the main terminal. Mobile lounges were still used for international flights and to transport passengers between the midfield concourses and the main terminal. An underground tunnel (consisting of a passenger walkway and moving sidewalks) which links the main terminal and Concourse B was opened in 2004. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) began a renovation program for the airport including a new security mezzanine with more room for lines.|$|E

It was announced in June 2015 that the airport would have an expansion taking 10 years to complete. Terminal 2 will be the most developed, adding new piers to the terminal and also create a larger security hall as well as more outlets. There will also be a connecting hallway to Terminal 3.|$|E

25|$|The ACT Government and Canberra Airport {{had been}} {{attempting}} {{for years to}} attract international airlines such as Air Asia X, Air New Zealand, and Emirates or persuade Qantas or Virgin Australia to commence international flights from Canberra. The airport argues {{there is a strong}} business case for flights to New Zealand. Canberra Airport managing director Stephen Byron said he believed there was a case to support about three flights a week to the capital of Wellington and another three to Auckland. In addition, the airport believes in the viability of a direct daily flight to an Asian <b>Hub</b> <b>airport</b> (such as Singapore or Hong Kong) to accommodate one-stop flights to onward destinations in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Canberra has a population of 900,000 in its catchment area (approximately 75% of that of Adelaide which has 42 weekly international services from its airport). Its status as Australia's capital city and the above average income of residents in the surrounding area provide more arguments in favour of international services at the airport.|$|E

25|$|Speaking at {{the first}} Gatwick Airport Consultative Committee (Gatcom) meeting since GIP's {{takeover}} of the airport (held on 28 January 2010 at Crawley's Arora Hotel), Gatwick's chairman Sir David Rowlands ruled out building a second runway for the foreseeable future, citing {{the high cost of}} the associated planning application – estimated to be between £100million and £200million – as the main reason for the new owners' lack of interest. At that meeting, Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate stressed GIP's preference for increasing the existing runway's capacity and confirmed GIP's plans to request an increase in the current limit on the permitted number of take-offs and landings. However, in 2012, Gatwick's new owners reversed their initial lack of interest in building a second runway at the airport for the foreseeable future. On 3 December 2012, chief executive Stewart Wingate argued in front of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee that allowing Gatwick to add a second runway to relieve the growing airport capacity shortage in the South East of England once the agreement with West Sussex County Council preventing it from doing so had expired in 2019 served the interests of the 12million people living in its catchment area better than building a third runway at Heathrow or a new four-runway <b>hub</b> <b>airport</b> in the Thames Estuary. In support of his argument, Wingate stated that expanding Heathrow or building a new hub in the Thames Estuary was more environmentally damaging, more expensive, less practical and risked negating the benefits of ending common ownership of Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted by the erstwhile BAA. Wingate contrasted this with the greater range of flights and improved connectivity including to hitherto un-/underserved emerging markets that would result from a second runway at Gatwick by the mid-2020s as this would enable it to compete with Heathrow on an equal footing to increase consumer choice and reduce fares. In this context, Wingate also accused his counterpart at Heathrow, Colin Matthews, of overstating the importance of transfer traffic by pointing to research by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This counts the number of air travel bookings made by passengers passing through the IATA-designated London area airports and shows that only 7% of these passengers actually change flights there. Wingate believes this to be a more accurate measure of the share of passengers accounted for by transfer traffic at these airports than the more widely used alternative based on survey data collated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA survey data relies on the number of passengers changing flights at these airports as reported by the airlines to the airport authorities and shows that fewer than 20% of all passengers actually change flights there.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the economic regulation of a <b>hub</b> European <b>airport</b> and the relationship system between actors involved in, or subjected to, this regulation. Studying the case of Aéroports de Paris, {{it is argued that}} airport economic regulation is produced by the strong conjunction of interests between the <b>hub</b> <b>airport’s</b> operator, the dominant airline, and public authorities. These three categories of actors form an “iron triangle ” framing and shaping the terms of economic regulation to satisfy their interests, and the shift from a cost-plus to a price-cap regulation does not dramatically threaten the maintenance of the triangle. All other actors (nondominant, domestic airlines, and international air carriers) are excluded from the iron triangle even if they remain deeply affected by its decisions. Finally, this article calls for an analytical generalization of this theorization for semiprivatized European <b>hub</b> <b>airports...</b>|$|R

40|$|We examine {{two factors}} that explain air traffic congestion: network {{benefits}} due to hubbing and congestion externalities. While both factors impact congestion, {{we find that}} the hubbing effect dominates empirically. Hub carriers incur most of the additional travel time from hubbing, primarily because they cluster their flights in short time spans to provide passengers as many potential connections as possible with a minimum of waiting time. Non-hub flights at the same <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> operate with minimal additional travel time. These results suggest that an optimal congestion tax might have a relatively small impact on flight patterns at <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> (JEL L 2, L 5, L 9, D 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{flight data}} for the period 2000 - 2004 we find that four {{significant}} variables in explaining delays at European airports are market concentration, slot coordination, <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> and <b>hub</b> airlines.

While delays are higher at <b>hub</b> <b>airports,</b> <b>hub</b> airlines experience lower delays than non-hub airlines. This may be at least partly explained by the special characteristics of the hub-and-spoke system in Europe, which is less extensive and more constrained, relative to the US.
