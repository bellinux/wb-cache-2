The President of the British Association of Dermatologists said this was [...] "just one example of the many fires we are fighting across the UK to try to keep <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> open in the face of poorly thought-out commissioning decisions and the Government’s lack of understanding of the implications of pushing NHS services into unsustainable models provided by commercially driven private providers or enterprises,” [...] The exodus of doctors left a department with too few staff to function, and put Circle under [...] "financial pressure" [...] because they had to pay nearly £300,000 per year each for six locum doctors, some insufficiently qualified to be on the specialist register. A report, by Dr Chris Clough of Kings College Hospital, London, called for the trust, Circle and Rushcliffe Clinical Commissioning Group to work together to solve the problem. The handling of these changes by both commissioners and providers was described as an ‘unmitigated disaster'. The consultants had concerns about transferring “to an uncertain model at Circle”. The consultants said the company had no experience of the highly specialist work they provided and that this would “inevitably lead to a downscaling of their ability to deliver effective training and research”.|$|E

40|$|Background: How well Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> provide {{clinical}} care, medical education, {{and innovative}} research is a largely unexplored {{topic in the}} literature. Objective: We sought to benchmark VA <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> by surveying VA dermatologists about their environment, resources, and {{the pros and cons}} of working in the VA. Methods: Printed surveys were mailed to VA dermatologists and responses were compiled and analyzed. Results: Of 105 <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> surveyed, 48 % returned surveys completed by board-certified dermatologists (n = 50); 20 surveys completed by nondermatologists were excluded from the analysis. Most services trained dermatology residents (72 %) and medical students (80 %). One third of services reported significant research involvement. Qualitative analysis revealed the academic environment, patient population, and decreased business management responsibilities as the 3 most commonly cited advantages to VA employment. The most commonly listed disadvantages included low salaries, bureaucracy, and lack of resources. Limitations: The survey data were self-reported and not independently verified. Not all services returned the survey. Conclusions: Outpatient VA <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> accomplish significant primary care and preventive services (eg, sun safety counseling, skin cancer screening, and treatment). However, the small number of dedicated <b>dermatology</b> <b>services,</b> their irregular geographic distribution, and the lack of staffing and resources may adversely affect optimal patient care. Dermatologist responses regarding the positive and negative aspects of working in the VA system may lead to improved management strategies to better retain and recruit dermatologists to provide patient care, medical education, and medical research despite dramatically lower dermatologist salaries within the VA system compared with private practic...|$|E

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{product claim}} and help-seeking {{advertisements}} have prompted the types and purposes of medical <b>dermatology</b> <b>service(s)</b> that patients have {{used in the}} United States. Indeed, researchers have demonstrated that 94 % of working nurse practitioners affirmed receiving from their patients {{a request for a}} cancer drug advertised. However, adult dermatology patients members of Saint Nicholas Catholic Church or/and patients at MedStar Clinic in Houston, Texas, have not been of interest for any study so far. The purpose of this quantitative study was to assess the relationship between product claim, help-seeking, types, and purposes of medical <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> used amongst males and females aged at least 18 years. Prospect theory (PT) was the theoretical framework used to analyze the purpose of this study. A cross-sectional survey approach permitted to collect primary data from 120 participants who were members of Saint Nicholas Catholic Church or/and patients at MedStar Clinic. The results, based on a forced entry multiple regression analysis at 95 % confidence interval, indicated that product claim and help-seeking significantly explained (p â?¤. 05) the variances of certain types and purposes of medical <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> used. Thus, product claim and help-seeking predicted the types and purposes of medical services used by the study population. Pharmaceutical announcers may benefit from {{the results of this study}} by using the study results to create new direct-to-consumers advertisements for the dermatology health promotion. The study population may benefit healthy skin, hairs, and nails by using medical <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> after exposure to the new pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertisements...|$|E

40|$|Background  Skin {{disease can}} have {{a huge impact on}} quality of life for {{patients}} and their families. Nurses have {{an important role in the}} delivery of specialist <b>dermatology</b> <b>services,</b> and prescribing enhances the care they provide. The views of dermatology patients about nurse prescribing are unknown. Objectives  To explore the views of dermatology patients about nurse prescribing, and its impact on medicines management and concordance. Methods  Semistructured interviews were undertaken with a consecutive sample of 42 patients with acne, psoriasis or eczema who attended the clinics of seven dermatology specialist nurse prescribers. Primary and secondary care clinics were included to reflect settings in which nurses typically prescribe for patients within specialist <b>dermatology</b> <b>services</b> in England. Interviews addressed the effects of nurse prescribing on care, the patient’s medicine regimen, involvement in treatment decisions and concordance, and influences on medicine taking. Results  Patients believed that nurse prescribing improved access to, and efficiency of, <b>dermatology</b> <b>services.</b> Great value was placed on telephone contact with nurses, and local access. Information exchange and involvement in treatment decisions ensured that treatment plans were appropriate and motivated adherence. Nurses’ specialist knowledge, interactive and caring consultation style, and continuity of care improved confidence in the nurse and treatment concordance. Conclusions  Nurse prescribing can increase the efficiency of <b>dermatology</b> <b>services.</b> Patients experienced active involvement in decisions about their treatment which in turn contributed to concordance and adherence to treatment regimens. This study has important implications for maximizing resource use and improving access to and quality of care in dermatology specialist services...|$|E

Method.  A collective case study of 10 practice settings across England where nurses prescribed medicines for dermatology patients.

Findings.  Nurse prescribing was reported to support and facilitate the modernisation of <b>dermatology</b> <b>services.</b> It enabled nurses to make effective use of their knowledge and skills, overcome delays in treatment and provide faster access to medicines. However several organisational issues restricted the success of the initiative. Conclusion. Nurse prescribing is successfully being used to support and deliver a range of services to dermatology patients. Stakeholders reported that both patients and staff had benefited by the adoption of this role by nurses. However issues over support and access to CPD and capacity of the workforce were identified as potential barriers which could affect the contribution of nurse prescribing to dermatology patients...|$|E
