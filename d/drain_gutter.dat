50|$|The {{effect of}} the neglect of {{repairing}} liabilities {{during and after the}} Second World War faced many tenants on short leases with huge bills for dilapidations to make good dwellings which had been originally let in a poor state of repair. Such tenants did not at that time have sufficient security of tenure to enable them to reap the benefit from carrying out major repairs.Under the Housing Act 1961 (see particularly sections 32 and 33) where a tenancy of a dwelling house for less than seven years was granted after 24 October 1961, the landlord was required by an implied covenant to keep in repair the structure and interior (including <b>drains,</b> <b>gutters</b> and external pipes) and to keep in repair and proper working order the installations in the house for the supply of water, gas and electricity, for sanitation, and for space heating and heating water. This applied whatever the rent or the rateable value. The Act included a provision to prohibit the backdating of a lease. The term of years counted from the date of lease signing.|$|R
5000|$|Minuscule is a French {{series of}} short video {{animations}} giving [...] "a bird's eye view of insects' {{day to day}} existence, distorted through a burlesque, yet poetic lens". [...] The characters are computer-modelled in 3D and set against natural scenery. Each animation has a self-contained and usually humorous storyline. The audio {{is a combination of}} genuine insect and ambient recordings with artificial sound effects. The various protagonist insects often perform anthropomorphic activities, displaying ironically portrayed intelligence, enjoyment and, sometimes, pathos. The background settings are generally of rural France, and include farm houses, fences, cars, road surfaces, <b>drains,</b> <b>gutters</b> and garbage bins. In Season 1 episodes, humans appeared only peripherally (e.g., as mute drivers of intrusive vehicles) and large farm animals were the main reluctant witnesses to the variety of insect, spider and mollusc activities. Some Season 2 episodes depict more explicit interaction with humans. Production of a feature film that shares the same creative universe was commenced in March 2012. The feature film titled Minuscule: Valley of the Lost Ants, was released on January 29, 2014.|$|R

500|$|The imbrices {{completed}} the waterproofing {{of the roof}} by arching over the joints between the vertical edges of the tegulae, dividing the roof into channels. Rain water flowed off the curved imbrices into the channels and down over the surfaces of the tegulae, and descended into the gutter (canalis). [...] In formal architecture the canalis had a plain or ornamented frontal piece set atop the entablature, immediately above the cornice. The semicircular opening {{at the front of}} the lowermost imbrex was often capped with an ornamental fronton, and the spouts which <b>drained</b> the <b>gutters</b> were frequently decorated with lions' heads (capita leonina) or other fantastic or grotesque faces.|$|R

50|$|The Rivers of America and the {{waterways}} of Disneyland {{remain at}} level {{even during the}} hot summer when the water evaporates, because most remaining original park <b>gutters</b> <b>drain</b> into the waterways. On rainy days, the gutters of the parks that are still connected to the Rivers of America allow for the river to rise to its normal level. Over-topping of concrete embankments happens frequently but has never posed a major issue.|$|R
50|$|In dry regions, cultivated, and {{urbanized}} areas, {{overland flow}} or surface runoff {{is usually a}} major source of streamflow. Overland flow is a stormwater runoff that begins as thin layer of water that moves very slowly (typically less than 0.25 feet per second) over the ground. Under intensive rainfall {{and in the absence of}} barriers such as rough ground, vegetation, and absorbing soil, it can mount up, rapidly reaching stream channels in minutes and causing sudden rises in discharge. The quickest response times between rainfall and streamflow occur in urbanized areas where yard <b>drains,</b> street <b>gutters,</b> and storm sewers collect overland flow and route it to streams straightaway. Runoff velocities in storm sewer piper can reach 10 to 15 feet per second.|$|R

2500|$|In medieval European cities, small natural {{waterways}} {{used for}} carrying off wastewater were eventually covered over and functioned as sewers. London's River Fleet {{is such a}} system. Open <b>drains,</b> or <b>gutters,</b> for waste water run-off ran along the center of some streets. These were known as [...] "kennels" [...] (i.e., canals, channels), and in Paris were sometimes known as “split streets,” as the waste water running along the middle physically split the streets into two halves. The first closed sewer constructed in Paris was designed by Hugues Aubird in 1370 on Monmartre Street, and was 300 meters long. The original purpose of designing and constructing a closed sewer in Paris was less-so for waste management {{as much as it}} was to hold back the stench coming from the odorous waste water.|$|R
50|$|The railway {{platform}} has tall sash windows, {{some of which}} have been painted out, and timber panelled doors with fanlights open from the adjoining offices and service rooms. Rainwater heads, <b>draining</b> the box <b>gutter</b> between the station building and the carriage shade, protrude into the platform area, with the downpipe inset into the station building wall. The signal box protrudes from the station building on a raised concrete base, and has sliding multi-paned windows to three sides.|$|R
50|$|Another common {{reason for}} failure of flat roofs {{is lack of}} drain {{maintenance}} where gravel, leaves and debris block water outlets (be they spigots, <b>drains,</b> downpipes or <b>gutters).</b> This causes a pressure head of water (the deeper the water, the greater the pressure) which can force more water into the smallest hole or crack. In colder climates, puddling water can freeze, breaking up the roof surface as the ice expands. It is therefore important to maintain your flat roof to avoid excessive repair.|$|R

50|$|Flooding {{can also}} occur if storm <b>drains</b> and street <b>gutters</b> are not kept clear of road debris and litter. Large {{quantities}} of water are sometimes thrown {{up from the}} road (road spray) by large vehicles, creating visibility problems for the drivers of oncoming, nearby, or following vehicles. Following vehicles may reduce the problem by slowing and increasing the following/separation distance. Headlights (or fog lights) improve vehicle visibility for all drivers, including those dealing with the spray. Driving manuals advise against following vehicles too closely (tailgating) in these hazardous conditions. Road spray can cause reduced visibility and dramatically reduce the safety of motorists.

40|$|Stormwater runoff is now {{the leading}} cause of {{impairment}} to Ohio’s streams and waterways. Agricultural drainage—sediments and chemicals—is a major source of this impairment. However, nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from urban impervious surfaces (i. e., parking lots, roadways, sidewalks, rooftops, etc.) is also a major contributor. Parking lots collect grease, oil, anti-freeze, and other vehicle leakage, heavy metals from brake dust, as well as litter, other debris, and pathogens. All of these pollutants are flushed into waterways by rain and melting snow. In addition, impervious areas hasten the movement of stormwater runoff across the surface, into a series of curbs, <b>gutters,</b> <b>drains,</b> and pipes, increasing flood occurrence and stream bank erosion.

Once at a lagoon, {{the purpose is to}} treat the waste and make it suitable for spreading on agricultural fields. There are three main types of lagoon: anaerobic, which is inhibited by oxygen; aerobic, which requires oxygen; and facultative, which is maintained with or without oxygen. Aerobic lagoons provide a higher degree of treatment with less odor production, though they require a significant amount of space and maintenance. Because of this demand, almost all livestock lagoons are anaerobic lagoons.|$|R

40|$|All homes contain {{products}} that are hazardous to people or the environment when disposed of improperly-oven cleaner, drain cleaner, mothballs, metal and wood polishes, motor oil, turpentine, insect sprays, and weed killers, {{to name just a}} few. These products contain the same chemicals that industry is required to dispose of in an approved hazardous waste disposal site. However, as yet there is little regulation of the) disposal of hazardous household products. It is up to each of us to minimize hazardous wastes and dispose of them responsibly. Why the disposal concern? When a consumer disposes of a hazardous household product, it is likely to end up either in a landfill or incinerator as garbage, or at a waste water treatment facility if it is dumped down the drain or flushed. Unfortunately, sewage treatment plants, septic systems, and most land fillsarenot designed to handle hazardous chemicals, and they soon end up in the environment. Sometimes these products enter the environment directly through storm <b>drains</b> and <b>gutters</b> where people pour them without thinking of the consequences. A combination of public awareness and proper management will help remove these materials from the waste stream before they reach the landfill, incinerator, treatment plant or the environment.

Almost a dozen historic properties on Fort DuPont are available for residency as part of this curatorship program. There are also several buildings/structures that are available under a similar program zoned for regular businesses and non-profit organizations. In 2006, the Fort Delaware Society became the first successful curator following the adaptive reuse of the quartermaster office (Building 113) on Staff Lane. Since then, the Delaware Military Heritage & Education Foundation has signed on with the program, pledging to restore the Post Exchange & gymnasium (Building 36) and a non-commissioned officer duplex (Building 91), both for use as part of the Delaware Military Museum.

5000|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Cape Cod by Bartholomew Gosnold in 1602, {{the eastern side of}} the peninsula has been treacherous to shipping. Since sea levels rose to their present levels, and up until recent times, water has flowed over land in Orleans during times of high tide, allowing for boats to pass between them. [...] On 26 April 1717, the 1.5 mi passage between Boat Meadow Creek on the side of Cape Cod Bay and Town Cove, to the east, was deepened by a massive Nor'easter that lasted for several days and wrecked the Whydah Gally and the Mary Anne (fleet ships of the pirate Samuel Bellamy); the canal became known as Jeremy's <b>Drain</b> and Jeremiah's <b>Gutter,</b> named after Jeremiah Smith. The canal was very shallow and allowed for a maximum of twenty ton boats when the tides were just right. The canal could cut up to a day off of the trip for ships, who instead of traveling around the arm of the Cape could pass right through it. In 1804, the canal was widened and improved, which allowed for use during the War of 1812. Eventually, proposals for a new canal began to take priority in the late 1800s (although the construction of the railroad around that time might have permanently blocked passage), and the canal began to fall into disrepair. In 1916, the opening of the Cape Cod Canal (between Bourne and Sandwich) created a permanent canal for the Cape.|$|R
5000|$|A roof must be {{designed}} with a suitable fall {{to allow the}} rainwater to discharge. The water <b>drains</b> into a <b>gutter</b> that is fed into a downpipe. A flat roof will have a watertight surface with a fall of 1 in 60, or 1 {{in the case of}} lead. They can drain internally or to an eaves gutter, which has a minimum 1 in 360 fall towards the downpipe. [...] The pitch of a pitched roof is determined by the construction material of the covering. For slate this will be at 25%, for machine made tiles it will be 35%. Water falls towards a parapet gutter, a valley gutter or an eaves gutter. [...] When two pitched roofs meet at an angle, they also form a pitched valley gutter: the join is sealed with valley flashing. Parapet gutters and valley gutters discharge into internal rainwater pipes or directly into external down pipes {{at the end of the}} run. The capacity of the gutter is a significant design consideration. The area of the roof is calculated (metres) and this is multiplied by rainfall (litres/sec/metres²) which is assumed to be 0.0208. This gives a required discharge outfall capacity. (litres/sec) [...] Rainfall intensity, the amount of water likely to generated in a two-minute rainstorm is more important that average rainfall, the British Standards Institute notes that an indicative storm in Essex, (annual rainfall 500mm per annum) delivers 0.022 l/s/m²- while one in Cumbria (annual rainfall 1800mm per annum) delivers 0.014 l/s/m².|$|R
2500|$|Paxton's roofing system {{incorporated}} his elegant {{solution to}} the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydnenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional - during construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering - a patented design now widely known as a [...] "Paxton gutter". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main <b>gutters</b> <b>drained</b> at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function - each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.|$|R
