5|$|According {{to former}} English paceman Bill Bowes, England had {{approached}} the First Test {{with the intention}} of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior, reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics. Bowes himself believed the tactics to be correct and almost successful. However, <b>he</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Walter Robins, one of the selectors, considered the English strategy to be misguided and that they should attack the Australians. This was reflected in the English selections. The home team made three changes; the leg spinner Doug Wright, who was forced to withdraw from the First Test at late notice due to lumbago, had regained his fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox spin of Young, who had taken match figures of 1/107 in the First TestAustralian wicket-keeper Don Tallon was his only wicket. However, he had managed to keep the batsmen quiet with his defensive leg theory, bowling 60 overs for 79 runs; Wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler. Jim Laker, who had been called into the First Test team due to Wright's lumbago, was initially the third spinner in the pecking order, but he took 4/138, including three specialist batsmen, and was retained.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. <b>He</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E

25|$|Caroline and George {{were married}} on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace, in London. At the ceremony, George was drunk.

25|$|Around February 1945, {{he began}} to fear the {{possibility}} that Emil Bodnăraș was planning his assassination and {{that he intended to}} blame it on political opponents of the Communist Party (as a means to direct sympathy towards the latter group). <b>He</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Bodnăraș had chosen to back Gheorghiu-Dej (allegedly fearing that Pătrășcanu was betraying the fragile alliance established before the fall of Ștefan Foriș). Consequently, he attempted to block Bodnăraș's rise to power, and denounced his reputedly corrupt activities as Secretary in the Interior Ministry to {{the other members of the}} leadership.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} aided Ribbentrop's rise was Hitler's {{distrust}} of, and disdain for, Germany's professional diplomats. <b>He</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> {{they did not}} entirely support his revolution. But the Foreign Office diplomats loyally served the government and rarely gave Hitler grounds for criticism. The Foreign Office diplomats were ultra-nationalist, authoritarian, and anti-Semitic. As a result, there was enough overlap in values {{between the two groups}} to allow most of them to work comfortably for the Nazis. Nonetheless, Hitler never quite trusted the Foreign Office and was on the lookout for someone to carry out his foreign-policy goals.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after Devlin arrived in Nyasaland, Armitage {{received}} advice from the Colonial Office on the action to be followed when a governor dissented from {{the findings of a}} Commission of Inquiry, and was told that he could dissent if he felt it was justified. At the end of May, Armitage thought the commission were satisfied that the State of Emergency was necessary, but that it did not accept that there was a massacre plan, and had concentrated on the use of firearms and the burning of houses by government forces, ignoring events leading up to such incidents. <b>He</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the Commission's report would be highly critical.|$|E

After viewing the television show, America's Most Wanted that aired in December 1998, which documented the case, Creek's father had notified police that <b>he</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the body belonged to his daughter. When Creek had first vanished, she was not reported missing for five weeks, as her history of running away had prevented investigation. After the identification, laws in the state were changed to prevent an issue like this from happening again.|$|E
25|$|Nkrumah never {{returned}} to Ghana, but he continued to push for his vision of African unity. He lived in exile in Conakry, Guinea, as the guest of President Ahmed Sékou Touré, who made him honorary co-president of the country. Nkrumah read, wrote, corresponded, gardened, and entertained guests. Despite retirement from public office, {{he felt that he}} was still threatened by Western intelligence agencies. When his cook died mysteriously, he feared that someone would poison him, and began hoarding food in his room. <b>He</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> foreign agents were going through his mail, and lived in constant fear of abduction and assassination. In failing health, he flew to Bucharest, Romania, for medical treatment in August 1971. He died of prostate cancer in April 1972 at the age of 62.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks before}} he was killed, Bermúdez Zacarías {{reached out to the}} Metepec {{municipal}} police for help and told them that <b>he</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> someone was following him. He also told this to Manuel Delgadillo Aguiñaga, one of his coworkers. After the murder, his coworker told investigators that Bermúdez Zacarías saw two suspicious men on a motorcycle one day in his neighborhood when he was coming back home from work. Bermúdez Zacarías decided to turn around in his car and drive away. Minutes later, he arrived home escorted by a Metepec police car. Despite fearing for his life, Bermúdez Zacarías did not officially ask for any sort of security measures or protection, and continued his daily activities as usual. According to his family, Bermúdez Zacarías never told them about this incident or that he faced any work-related death threats.|$|E

25|$|Lü Boshe was an {{acquaintance}} of Cao Cao, a prominent warlord who rose to power {{towards the end of}} the Eastern Han dynasty and established the foundation of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. According to historical sources, Cao Cao killed Lü Boshe's family in 189 or 190 when he passed by Lü's house on his way home to Chenliu (陳留; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan) after escaping from the imperial capital, Luoyang. Cao Cao's motive behind the murders remains ambiguous. One source claimed that he killed Lü Boshe's family in self-defence while two other texts stated that <b>he</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Lü's family were plotting to harm him so he killed them preemptively. This event was dramatised in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which Lü Boshe himself also died at the hands of Cao Cao.|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that <b>he</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E
25|$|In his Fredericksburg headquarters, Lee was {{initially}} {{in the dark}} about the Union intentions and <b>he</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the main column under Slocum was heading towards Gordonsville. Jeb Stuart's cavalry was cut off at first by Stoneman's departure on April 30, but they were soon able to move freely around the army's flanks on their reconnaissance missions after almost all their Union counterparts had left the area. As Stuart's intelligence information about the Union river crossings began to arrive, Lee did not react as Hooker had anticipated. He decided to violate one of the generally accepted principles of war and divide his force {{in the face of a}} superior enemy, hoping that aggressive action would allow him to attack and defeat a portion of Hooker's army before it could be fully concentrated against him. He became convinced that Sedgwick's force would demonstrate against him, but not become a serious threat, so he ordered about 4/5 of his army to meet the challenge from Chancellorsville. He left behind a brigade under Brig. Gen. William Barksdale on heavily fortified Marye's Heights behind Fredericksburg and one division under Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, on Prospect Hill south of the town. These roughly 11,000 men and 56 guns would attempt to resist any advance by Sedgwick's 40,000. He ordered Stonewall Jackson to march west and link up with Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division, which had pulled back from the river crossings they were guarding and began digging earthworks on a north-south line between the Zoan and Tabernacle churches. McLaws's division was ordered from Fredericksburg to join Anderson. This would amass 40,000 men to confront Hooker's movement east from Chancellorsville. Fortunately for the Confederates, heavy fog along the Rappahannock masked some of these westward movements and Sedgwick chose to wait until he could determine the enemy's intentions.|$|E
