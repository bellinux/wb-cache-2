5000|$|Despite {{on-going}} {{industrial action}} by carpenters and bricklayers, the Ross River Meatworks began operation on 28 June 1892. The plant was coal powered, with six Babcock and Wilcox 96-horsepower safety tubular boilers supplying steam {{for the various}} engines. Cattle and sheep were processed separately. An overhead tramway transported the carcases to a cooling room, then into the freezing, canning or preserving rooms. In the <b>freezing</b> <b>room,</b> the two compound engines could produce 400 horsepower each and each machine could circulate 170,000 cubic feet of air per hour. The freezing and cold storage building was about 100 feet square and two storeys high. The refrigeration machinery {{was a combination of}} Bell-Coleman and Haslam machines, which circulated cold air and removed moisture and impure air at the same time. Electric lighting powered by a Crompton dynamo was installed by Barton and White electrical engineers - 31 years prior to the provision of public electric lighting in Townsville. In August 1892 the Ross River meatworks was inspected by New Zealand industry experts, who described the works as [...] "superior to any in the colony - actively engaged in the meat export trade".|$|E

When Harrison refused, Malcolm became insanely determined to halt his brother's activities. Donning the alias of Midas the Golden Man and working out of Harrison's discothèque the Hot Spot, Malcolm started to get some inner circle kids to be addicted to his drugs in a plot to wipe out all blacks in America. This did attract the attention of Sam Wilson and Glory Grant. Glory Grant's cousin and his friends were drugged by Midas' henchmen and they ended up assaulting Glory. Her cries attracted the attention of Spider-Man who subdued them. When the drugs wore off, they remembered a golden man and his plot. When Glory Grant alerted Sam Wilson, he entered the Hot Spot as Falcon at the same time when Spider-Man arrived and they confront Midas and his thugs. They defeated the thugs, but Midas escaped. Heading over to Malcolm's estate, Spider-Man and Falcon are ambushed by Midas' thugs who knocked them out and bounded them in metal straps. Midas traps them in a rapidly <b>freezing</b> <b>room,</b> but Spider-Man uses his webbing to free himself and Falcon. After being freed by Midas' employees and encountering the brothers, Spider-Man and Falcon identify Malcolm as Midas. Spider-Man and Falcon easily subdue Malcolm by pulling the rug out from underneath him and sending Malcolm out the window.|$|E

The {{feasibility}} {{of the application}} of cool storage technology in cold storage was discussed and the ice cool storage used in high temperature cold storage, condenser water, cooling room, frozen food store and <b>freezing</b> <b>room</b> was analyzed. Carried on the efficient analysis through a cold storage of Hunan Shaoyang as an example, the result shows that the equipment cost of ice cool storage equipment is 831310. 2 Yuan higher than the traditional cold storage and annual operating costs than traditional ice storage refrigeration technology can save 375694. 5 Yuan. So it is feasible {{for the application of}} cool storage technology in cold storage.

The {{purpose of the}} study was to propose measures to decrease the facility’s energy demand and to calculate the payback time for these suggestions. By means of using simulation software along with data from practical measurements different configurations in the facility were tested. The study resulted in suggestions consisting of an increase of the temperature in the <b>freezing</b> <b>room</b> and the temperature in LTB 1. Those suggestions increases the facilities COP and decreases the energy consumption. Proposals to curb the ice growth are the insulation of components such as pipes and valves. Insulation results in a small decrease in energy demand but greatly increases the accessibility and also decreases the risk of corrosion. Through load tests conducted on the compressors it showed that the compressors were not driven in the optimal load range, suggestions were made for operation in a more favourable load range. Thus increasing the efficiency and cutting the maintenance costs. From the results it is shown that the facility is well built and dimensioned against thermal transmission. Though it turned out that the floor heating accounts for a disproportionate amount of the thermal transmission. ...|$|E

40|$|Cultural objects {{may become}} wet by {{deliberate}} water cleaning, water disaster or water soaked for other reasons. Air drying textile objects and even other organic materials from a water wet state, involves many problems {{depending on the}} strong capillarity action of water. Damages and changes such as bleeding of dyes, stains or lines of impurities from water movement, shrinking or stiffness can occur. Freeze-drying as an alternative drying method has often been used for wet archaeological and marine objects, but more seldom for historical materials. This bachelor thesis addresses {{the issue of whether}} freeze-drying can be an alternative controlled drying method for historic costumes. Costumes and related objects are often composite objects, consisting of multiple materials, as well as being three dimensional, all of which will complicate drying. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether it is possible to handle costume objects after wet cleaning for drying by freeze-drying, and if damages due to surface tension of water, can be avoided in this way. A literature survey was carried out into the characteristics of water, the processes of wetting and drying, the properties of textile and skin, alternative drying methods and the theory of freeze-drying. Another aim of this thesis was to develop a practical procedure based upon experience. Seven case studies are reported. All objects are Sámi costumes: four “gákti”/clothing and three “gahpir”/caps made of textile, with some skin details. The freeze-drying process was carried out without vacuum in an ordinary <b>freezing</b> <b>room.</b> Different procedures and handling of the objects were tested from wet state through freezing, freeze-drying, and to the final air drying. Changes in dimension, colour and staining from water movement was evaluated afterwards. Observations were carried out during the whole drying process on the drying behavior. Appropriate drying equipment and how to decide the drying rate are discussed. The results suggest that freeze-drying can be an alternative drying method and a way to control the drying of historic costumes after wet cleaning. Damages due to air drying should in most cases be avoided by freeze-drying. A method to handle objects before freezing was investigated, in which the goal was to keep the object as wet as possible prior to placing in the freezer. This reduced the risk of damage from water movement and also the pressure of time. Some guidelines are given for practical use...|$|E

Chan suffered minor injuries attempting stunts in the film, having been kicked in the chest by a stuntman wearing the wrong boots and fallen off a quad bike, while attempting to perform a wheelie.

After slaughter and dressing carcasses were showered with cold water, and removing the kidney and peripheral fats, the carcasses were used in precooling and freezing experiments. Precooling, freezing and all the other treatments were done in the practical handling conditions of EBK, that is none of those conditions were rearranged or altered, and what had been happening in those conditions were aimed to be determined.

The stretching and bending modes in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is observed which indicates {{the formation of the}} perovskite structure of LSMO. The nature of DC magnetization versus field M(H) plot for sample resembles qualitatively with ferromagnetic (FM) systems. The AC-susceptibility data obtained at different frequencies confirmed the presence of a frequency–dependent <b>freezing</b> temperature around <b>room</b> temperature. Based on the interparticle interaction strength and phenomenological models (Neel-Brown, Vogel-Fulcher and Critical slowing down) the magnetic dynamic behavior of nanoparticles was characterized. By fitting the experimental data with mentioned models the possibility existence of superparamagnetic/spin glass states were considered. The obtained values from fitting performance showed that there is a strong interaction between magnetic nanoparticles of LSMO...|$|R
