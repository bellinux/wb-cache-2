I do not <b>even</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> where I might have been if I would not have met him; I owe him everything for overseeing {{my research}} and advising me throughout my last two years of graduate school. Special thanks go to the three most important professors in my graduate career, Dr. Sherali Zeadally, Dr. Loren Schwiebert, and Dr. Monica Brockmeyer for everything they have taught me about computer networks and the academic world in general. It was their patience, expertise, and teaching ability that shaped me into what I am today and made my thesis possible. I especially <b>want</b> <b>to</b> thank my fiancée, Daniela Stan, for creating all the ideal conditions for my academic career to succeed. It is obvious that without my parents, Margareta and Ion Raicu, and my brother, Mihai, none of my current achievements would have been possible. Family is truly {{the most important thing in}} my life. Although many would like to believe that careers and family are independent of each other, they are very intertwined to the point where neither one can prevail unless they both happily coexist. ii ii Last but not least, I thank my many colleagues, Dr. Klaus-Pete...|$|R

40|$|To {{my parents}} ii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I {{would like to}} give my deep {{gratitude}} to my committee chair, Prof. Jeffrey L. Stein, for his profound mentorship, intellectual guidance, endless patience, and support. I am also indebted to the rest of my committee for their insightful feedback. Specifically, I would like to thank Prof. Hulbert for his feedback on the coordinate frame reorientation part of this work; and Prof. Kabamba for his feedback on the model reduction part. I especially would like to thank Prof. Epureanu for graciously taking time to get me started on the Karhunen-Loève expansion and to discuss with me numerous times the subtleties of that part of this work that is based on the Karhunen-Loève expansion. I am also forever thankful to Dr. Hosam K. Fathy for first being my friend, and then my mentor. His attention to details, constructive criticism, and amazing ability to put things into perspective greatly improved the quality of this work. I cannot thank him enough for our immensely enjoyable and endless discussions, for being there whenever I needed him, and for believing in me even when I did not. I {{would also like to thank}} Burit Kittirungsi for spending an enormous amount of time with me to develop the HMMWV model. Without his insight, resourcefulness, and willingness to help, I do not <b>even</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how long it would take me to finish the model. I am also thankful to Steve Riley for his interest in this work and his feedback, and for sharing his literature on multibody dynamics with me...|$|R
