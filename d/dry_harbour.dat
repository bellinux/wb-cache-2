50|$|Discovery Bay {{is a town}} in Saint Ann Parish on the {{northern}} coast of Jamaica. The city is also known locally as <b>Dry</b> <b>Harbour</b> Bay, because it sits {{in the shadow of}} the <b>Dry</b> <b>Harbour</b> Mountains in St. Ann. There is a dispute as to whether Christopher Columbus first landed in Discovery Bay or Sevilla la Nueva (east of Discovery Bay) in 1494. Near to the city are Puerto Seco Beach and several historic sites, such as the Green Grotto Caves and Columbus Park. Visitors to the Green Grotto Caves can see relics of the native Taíno Arawak lifestyle there. It is said that many Spaniards escaped the English invasion of 1655 through secret passages in the caves with the help of Arawaks and African slaves, in exchange for their freedom.|$|E

50|$|Fishing {{has always}} been a {{principal}} occupation for the people of Polperro. For centuries the village was a pilchard fishing and processing port. The fish were drawn to the south Cornwall coast to feed in late summer and brought rich pickings for local fishermen. Once ashore, the fish were salted and pressed and the oil was collected as a by-product and used for heating and lighting. Polperro pilchards were exported to many parts of Europe. Shoals of the fish diminished in the 20th century and pilchard fishing died out in Polperro in the 1960s, but today the port still has around 12 commercial vessels fishing for flat fish, scallops, crabs, monkfish, ray, pollock, bass and cod. The little fishing port of Polperro, 5 miles west of Looe, had a fleet of small sailing fishing boats known as Polperro Gaffers. Their principal catch was the pilchard but this was a late summer catch {{and the rest of the}} year they set long lines, and seine nets. Most were built in Looe, around 26' with a deep 6' draft, a gaff rig on a pole mast stepped on the keel and they dried out on legs in Polperro's <b>drying</b> <b>harbour.</b> Within the village is the Polperro Heritage Museum of Fishing and Smuggling, situated on the harbourside in an old fish processing warehouse, which amongst other things, houses interesting photographs of the village's history. Jonathan Couch, the village doctor for many years, was also a notable ichthyologist and trained in succession a large number of fishermen to aid him in his pursuits. His observations made at and near Polperro during his lifetime and since his death have not been equalled in value at any British station. He was in correspondence with many of the foremost naturalists, and especially rendered aid to Thomas Bewick and to William Yarrell.|$|R

The Blue Mountains rise to these elevations from the coastal plain in the space of about 16 km, thus producing one of the steepest general gradients in the world. In this part of the country, the old metamorphic rock reveals itself through the surrounding limestone.

40|$|The fern flora of the Seychelles {{archipelago}} remains relatively poorly known. Current projects {{involving the}} development of the Seychelles National Herbarium and study of key biodiversity areas have resulted in extensive new explorations on the granitic islands. Historical literature, newly collected specimens and older collections have been revised for the fern family Marattiaceae as a prelude for a fern checklist, resulting in the rediscovery of Ptisana a century after it was last reported (as Marattia). Two species of Angiopteris are recognised in the Seychelles, one of them new to science. In total, three species are recorded from the granitic Seychelles islands, Mahé and Silhouette, and none from the coral islands, which are too <b>dry</b> to <b>harbour</b> Marattiaceae. These three species are described in detail. The newly described Angiopteris chongsengiana is characterized by the elongated terminal pinnules and progressively reduced distal pairs of pinnules. Based on phylogenetic molecular analyses the Ptisana fraxinea complex is discussed and several new combinations are proposed. The Seychellois Ptisana is most closely related to Ascension Island endemic P. purpurascens and is described as a new species, Ptisana laboudalloniana. It differs from P. fraxinea in its winged secondary rachises and from P. salicifolia in its smaller habit, with the laminae shorter than broad and shorter than the petioles.

40|$|The {{roles of}} {{subcellular}} distribution on silver (Ag) accumulation and elimination {{in the green}} mussel Perna viridis collected from 2 hydrographical zones (harbour vs. estuarine) in Hong Kong during 3 different seasons were investigated. Ag concentration and biokinetics varied widely between the 2 zones, but were less variable among the different seasons (pre-wet, wet and <b>dry).</b> The <b>harbour</b> population had a 2 - to 6 -fold higher Ag tissue concentration than the estuarine population. The insoluble fraction was the predominant pool for Ag subcellular distribution in the green mussels. In both the pre-wet and wet seasons, a lower Ag tissue concentration {{was associated with the}} insoluble fraction in the estuarine population as compared to the harbour population. Ag uptake from the aqueous phase was faster in the estuarine population during all seasons, but no significant relationship between Ag uptake and salinity was found in this study. Dietary uptake of Ag was similar in both populations, although there was a slight difference in assimilation from diatoms and natural seston. Efflux of Ag was 2 times faster in the estuarine population during the wet and dry seasons, which may partially explain the lower Ag tissue burden in the mussels. These results demonstrated a close correlation between Ag kinetics and its subcellular distribution. The percentage of Ag in the heat-sensitive proteins correlated positively to the influx of dissolved Ag and Ag efflux, but negatively to the dietary assimilation. On the other hand, a higher percentage of Ag in the insoluble fraction was related to a higher dissolved uptake rate constant and a lower assimilation. Thus, the role of the individual subcellular fraction in the uptake was exposure pathway-specific. This study highlights the importance of subcellular Ag partitioning in controlling its accumulation and detoxification in bivalves...|$|R
40|$|Aim Although {{hundreds}} of tree species have broad geographic ranges in the Neotropics, {{little is known}} about how such widespread species attained disjunct distributions around mountain, ocean and xeric barriers. Here, we examine the phylogeographic structure of a widespread and economically important tree, Cordia alliodora, to: (1) test the roles of vicariance and dispersal in establishing major range disjunctions, (2) determine which geographic regions and/or habitats contain the highest levels of genetic diversity, and (3) infer the geographic origin of the species. Location Twenty-five countries in Central and South America, and the West Indies. Methods Chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSR; eight loci) were assayed in 67 populations (240 individuals) sampled from the full geographic range of C. alliodora. Chloroplast (trnH–psbA) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) DNA sequences were sampled from a geographically representative subset. Genetic structure was determined with samova, structure and haplotype networks. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and rarefaction analyses were used to compare regional haplotype diversity and differentiation. ResultsAlthough the ITS region was polymorphic it revealed limited phylogeographic structure, and trnH–psbA was monomorphic. However, structure analysis of cpSSR variation recovered three broad demes spanning Central America (Deme 1), the Greater Antilles and the Choco ́ (Deme 2), and the Lesser Antilles and cis-Andean South America (Deme 3). samova showed two predominant demes (Deme 1 + 2 and Deme 3). The greatest haplotype diversity was detected east of the Andes, while significantly more genetic variation was partitioned among trans-Andean populations. Populations experiencing high precipitation seasonality (dry ecotype) had greater levels of genetic variation. Main conclusions Cordia alliodora displayed weak cis- and trans-Andean phylogeographic structure based on DNA sequence data, indicative of historical dispersal around this barrier and genetic exchange across its broad range. The cpSSR data revealed phylogeographic structure corresponding to three biogeographic zones. Patterns of genetic diversity are indicative of an origin in the seasonally dry habitats of South America. Therefore, C. alliodora fits the disperser hypothesis for widespread Neotropical species.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe extreme {{conditions}} of Antarctic desert soils render this environment selective towards a {{diverse range of}} psychrotrophic microbial communities. Cracks and fissures in translucent quartz rocks permit an adequate amount of penetrating light, sufficient water and nutrients to support cryptic microbial development. Hypolithons colonizing the ventral surface of these quartz rocks have been classified into three types: cyanobacterial dominated (Type I),moss dominated (Type II) and lichenized (Type III) communities. Eukaryotic microbial communities were reported to represent only a minor fraction of Antarctic communities. In this study, culture independent techniques (DGGE, T-RFLP and clone library construction) were employed to determine {{the profile of the}} dominant eukaryotes, fungi and microalgae present in the three different hypolithic communities. The 18 S rRNA gene (Euk for eukaryotes), internal transcribed spacer (ITS for fungi) and microalgal specific regions of the 18 S rRNA gene, were the phylogenetic markers targeted for PCR amplification from hypolith metagenomic DNA. Results suggest that the three hypolith types are characterized by different eukaryotic, fungal and microalgal communities, as implied by nMDS analysis of the DGGE and T-RFLP profiles. Sequence analysis indicates close affiliation to members of Amoebozoa, Alveolata, Rhizaria (general eukaryote), Ascomycota (fungal) and Streptophyta (microalgal). Many of these clones may represent novel species. This study demonstrates that <b>Dry</b> Valley hypolithons <b>harbour</b> higher eukaryote diversity than previously recognised.
