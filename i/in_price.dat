40|$|This {{study is}} {{examines}} the dynamics <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> paid <b>in</b> “pay-what-you-want” situations over multiple customer–seller transactions {{on an individual}} customer level. The analysis of potential dynamism <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> paid allows for {{an assessment of the}} profitability of pay-what-you-want pricing for sellers of frequently bought products and services. To empirically validate the framework, the authors conduct a field study that focuses on the aggregate and individual dynamics <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> paid over customers’ multiple purchases. Using latent growth modeling, the authors find significant but declining decreases <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> paid. Further, they identify stable individual and relational difference factors which predict steeper or more gradual declines <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> paid. Customers’ individual preferences for fairness and price consciousness as well as their overall satisfaction with the seller alleviate price declines. The authors discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{high-frequency}} propagation of shocks across international equity markets. We identify shocks to stock prices, liquidity (quoted and effective spreads), and trading activity (turnover and order imbalance) for 12 equity markets {{around the world}} based on non-parametric jump statistics at the 5 -minute frequency from 1996 to 2011. Jumps <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> quoted spreads, and order imbalance are prevalent and large, while jumps in effective spreads and turnover are rare. Within a market, jumps <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> are regularly accompanied by jumps in order imbalance, but are independent of jumps in liquidity. Jumps <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> and co-jumps <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> and order imbalance are primarily driven by information rather than liquidity, {{since there is no}} subsequent price reversal and since they often occur around U. S. macroeconomic news announcements. We also present evidence that jumps <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> and order imbalance (but not liquidity) spillover across markets within the same 5 -minute interval. Overall, we find that order imbalances help explain why shocks to stock prices occur and spread across markets, while shocks to liquidity tend to be isolated events...|$|R

5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular <b>in</b> <b>price</b> levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E
