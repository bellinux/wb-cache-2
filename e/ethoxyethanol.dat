40|$|The solvent, 2 -ethoxyethanol, induced {{complete}} embryomortality in pregnant rats {{exposed to}} three times the current Federal permissible exposure limit (PEL). Following exposure to <b>ethoxyethanol</b> at a concentration only one-half the current PEL, the offspring evidenced behavioral and neurochemical deviations from controls. Subsequent studies found that ingestion of ethanol with concomitant inhalation of <b>ethoxyethanol</b> vapors early in pregnancy appeared {{to reduce the number}} of both behavioral and neurochemical deviations found for <b>ethoxyethanol.</b> In contrast, the concomitant exposure to ethanol and <b>ethoxyethanol</b> later in gestation potentiated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of <b>ethoxyethanol.</b> This research indicates that the industrial solvent 2 -ethoxyethanol presents an occupational reproductive hazard and raises the issue of the importance of an interaction of social habits with occupational exposure to such hazards. The results would suggest that occupational physicians should advise pregnant workers in the chemical industry of the adverse effects of ethanol during pregnancy and of the possible interactions with other chemicals and should encourage them to be especially cautious with ethanol consumption since they may be at greater risk.

40|$|Investigations of {{the male}} {{reproductive}} toxicity of <b>ethoxyethanol</b> (ethylene glycol monoethyl ether) have been restricted exclusively to histopathological assessments of the testes. The present study consisted of two experiments designed to document the spermatotoxicity of <b>ethoxyethanol</b> (EE) as reflected in evaluations of ejaculated rat semen. The basic strategy involved the evaluation of individual ejaculates recovered from the genital tract of a female rat prior to exposure {{of the male}}s to EE. Repeated assessments of the ejaculate were made during the experimental phase according to specified protocols. Adult Long-Evans hooded male rats received 0, 936, 1872 or 2808 mg/kg (PO) of EE for five consecutive days. Semen evaluations were then conducted at weeks 0, 1, 4, 7, 10 and 14 after exposure. Males in the highest two dose groups showed declines in sperm counts by week 4 and were essentially azoospermic by week 7. At this time, males receiving the lowest dose of EE also exhibited decreases in ejaculated sperm counts. An increase in abnormal sperm shapes was also observed. Over the ensuing weeks all males exhibited varying degrees of recovery as reflected by increasing ejaculated sperm counts. In a second experiment, males were treated with 0 or 936 mg/kg of EE daily (5 days/week) for 6 weeks with semen evaluations conducted weekly. By week 5, sperm counts were significantly depressed {{and there was an}} increase in the number of abnormal shapes. Sperm motility was depressed by week 6. The temporal trend...|$|E

DOI: 10. 1016 /j. taap. 2006. 09. 019 Glycol ethers are {{solvents}} widely used alone and as mixtures in industrial and household products. Some glycol ethers {{have been shown to}} have a range of toxic effects in humans following absorption and metabolism to their aldehyde and acid metabolites. This study assessed the influence of water mixtures on the dermal absorption of butoxyethanol and <b>ethoxyethanol</b> in vitro through human skin. Butoxyethanol penetrated human skin up to sixfold more rapidly from aqueous solution (50 %, 450 mg/ml) than from the neat solvent. Similarly penetration of <b>ethoxyethanol</b> was increased threefold in the presence of water (50 %, 697 mg/ml). There was a corresponding increase in apparent permeability coefficient as the glycol ether concentration in water decreased. The maximum penetration rate of water also increased in the presence of both glycol ethers. Absorption through a synthetic membrane obeyed Fick's Law and absorption through rat skin showed a similar profile to human skin but with a lesser effect. The mechanisms for this phenomenon involves disruption of the stratum corneum lipid bilayer by desiccation by neat glycol ether micelles, hydration with water mixtures and the physicochemical properties of the glycol ether???water mixtures. Full elucidation of the profile of absorption of glycol ethers from mixtures is required for risk assessment of dermal exposure. This work supports the view that risk assessments for dermal contact scenarios should ideally be based on absorption data obtained for the relevant formulation or mixture and exposure scenario and that absorption derived from permeability coefficients may be inappropriate for water-miscible solvents...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the age of}} an ink entry from a questioned document is often an essential problem and a controversial issue in forensic sciences. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} the aging process of the different components found in ink. The aim of this work was to the study the drying process of ballpoint ink, characterised by the disappearance of volatile solvents from the ink entry. Phenoxyethanol is of particularly high interest as it is found in more than 80 % of the blue ballpoint pens at different concentrations. Liquid extraction followed by splitless gas chromatography / mass spectrometry in the selected ion mode was used to measure the quantitative decrease of solvents from ink entries made with a blue Parker® ballpoint pen. Quantities of ethoxyethoxyethanol, dipropylene glycol, phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethoxyethanol were studied in ink entries up to one and a half years old, thus allowing to calculate aging curves for this particular pen. The low quantities of solvents (in the microgram range for a 1 cm ballpoint entry) were found to decrease quickly after deposition of the ink on paper through the competitive processes of evaporation and diffusion. Losses of up to 75 % of solvents were observed after a few seconds. The amount of <b>ethoxyethanol</b> stopped decreasing after about 10 days (quantities reached the nanogram range for a 1 cm ballpoint entry), while the aging curves of dipropylene glycol, phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethoxyethanol level off considerably after 2 weeks. It was observed that <b>ethoxyethanol,</b> dipropylene glycol and phenoxyethanol can also migrate from one sheet of paper to another if placed close enough (e. g. in a book or a stack of papers), therefore contamination from fresh ink stroke from other paper sheets has to be taken into account for those solvents. In this paper we demonstrate that differentiation between fresh ink (< 2 weeks) and older inks is possible under laboratory storage conditions. For real cases samples, more parameters have to be studied and other possibilities have to be considered...|$|E

40|$|The anodic {{oxidation}} of 2 -alkoxyethanol on a platinum electrode in 0. 5 M sulfuric acid {{has been studied}} {{on the basis of}} product-analysis and polarization behavior. The results obtained are as follows. 　(1) The significant oxidation of 2 -alkoxyethanol used takes place at potential below 0. 8 V(vs. SCE) from the polarization curve. The electrolysis of methoxye-thanol(or <b>ethoxyethanol)</b> at this potential region yields methanol(or ethanol) and formaldehyde at the ratio of 1 / 2. It is considered from the above results and the coulonmetry of products that the initial oxidation proceeds by the discharge through alcoholic oxygen and two-electrons transfer is involved in the overall reaction. 　(2) In the case of propoxy and isopropoxyethanol, the reaction by the discharge through ethereal oxygen is observed to occur, except for the similar reaction to that of methoxyethanol. 　(3) The reaults obtained from polarization characteristics, Tafel slope, reaction order, and the reaction of adsorbed oxygen species on the electrode could be explained {{on the basis of the}} following mechanisms. H_ 2 O -> + H^+ + e, RH -> + H^+ + e, R^ + OH^ ->__ R 2 ̆ 7 + H_ 2 O (RH:alkoxyethanol, R 2 ̆ 7 :products). Two Temkin-type adsorption equilibriums occur prior to the rate determining step, which is the chemical reaction on electrode surface between the two adsobates to yield products. 　On the other hand, the experimentally observed resu]ts support that the electrode reaction of propoxy and isopropoxyethanol proceeds according to the followving mechanisms.
