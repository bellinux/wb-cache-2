50|$|The {{common bream}} spawns from April to June, when water {{temperatures}} are around 17 C. At this time, the males form territories {{within which the}} females lay 100,000 to 300,000 eggs on water plants. The <b>fry</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>after</b> three to 12 days and attach themselves to water plants with special adhesive glands, until their yolk is used up.|$|R
50|$|This {{species of}} {{pipefish}} has a sex-role reversed mating {{system in which}} females compete for access to males. This fish breeds in the summer. The male has a brood pouch into which several females deposit clutches of about twenty eggs and where the eggs are fertilised. The <b>fry</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>after</b> about four weeks and are expelled into the open water. Even after this the male continues to provide some parental care as the fry can retreat into the brood pouch in case of danger.|$|R
40|$|The {{main subject}} of this {{experiment}} was to explain the behaving of the minnow during its reproduction, the preferation of the spawning substratum, {{the length of the}} incubation of eggs, the evolution and the growth of the juvenile and the fry. Brood fish were taken by elektrical unit in the Blanice river, in the area between the railway bridge and the weir in the village of Blanice. These were put into the experimental pond of 75 square metres. There were two spawning processes. The first took place on 10 June, the <b>fry</b> <b>hatched</b> <b>after</b> ten days and in the next ten days it could be found all over the pond looking for food. In the selection of the substratum the gravel (of the size of 2 - 5 cm) was prefered at all. The standard length of the fry {{at the end of the}} process of breeding (after a hundred days) was 39 { [...] } 48 mm (the amount of 800 individuals). The second spawn took place on 11 August. The <b>fry</b> <b>hatched</b> <b>after</b> eight days and the next week it was hidding in the substratum and consuming yolk sack. The standard length at the end of the breeding was 18 { [...] } 26 mm. The ammount of the breeded fry was 350 individuals...|$|R

Body length was measured in the lots which could be raised to fingerling stage. No hybrid superiority in growth was evidenced, {{with the exception of}} brown trout ♀ × brook trout ♂ which performed better than the brown trout control lot. The use of such hybrids for practical aquaculture would require evidence of superiority at the adult stage and the possibility of improved larval survival...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} very easy to breed in aquarium. The fish spawn in open water and 1-2 large (ca. 2 mm in diameter), sticky eggs are {{attached}} to a plant or stone. Adults do not guard the eggs. The number of eggs is relatively small (several tens per spawn from one female). The optimal water chemistry for the development of eggs varies from author to author and it may thus depend on the origin of the fish population. At 26 °C the <b>fry</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>after</b> ca. four days and start to eat after another four days. Raising the fry may not be fully trouble-free, however.|$|R
5000|$|The pygmy corydoras is a silver-colored fish, with an {{unbroken}} black line that runs horizontally along {{the center of}} the sides of the fish from the tip of its snout to its caudal peduncle.

50|$|Most, if not all, {{species of}} bubble nesting fish {{continue}} parental care after {{construction of the}} floating bubble nest and spawning. After spawning the eggs either float up into the bubble nest, or (in the case of sinking eggs) are carried there, and subsequently lodged into the nest by one or both parents. Following this, the male protects the brood by chasing away the female (if not a species in which the female also guards the nest) and any other intruders, concentrating on the eggs in the nest, retrieving any eggs or fry that fall from the nest and keeping the nest in repair; {{only a handful of}} bubble nest makers (notably some snakeheads) have females participate in bubble nest maintenance. One or both parents will guard the eggs constantly until the <b>fry</b> <b>hatch</b> <b>after</b> 24-48 hours and be suspended from the nest. The newly hatched fry will then be tended by the parent fish until they are independent, which can take from a day to several weeks depending on the species.|$|R
40|$|The chronological {{appearance}} of endocrine {{cells in the}} pituitary of sea-bream (Sparus auratus) larvae was studied using antisera against salmon prolactin, trout growth hormone, salmon gonadotropin and Nterminal human adrenocorticotropin. The larval pituitary (1 - 12 days <b>after</b> <b>hatching)</b> was oval in shape and was composed of a dense mass of cells with few neurohypophysial fibres. By 60 days <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> it began to resemble the adult and was divisible into a distinct rostral pars distalis containing prolactin and adrenocorticotropin cells; a proximal pars distalis containing somatotrophs and gonadotrophs and a pars intermedia.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of time of initiation of feeding <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> and influence of dietary ascorbic supplementation during realimentation on productivity, carcass characteristics and mortality of Ross 308 broiler chickens. The study was a factorial arrangement in a complete randomized design. Six hundred and seventy five unsexed Ross 308 broiler chickens with an initial weight of 32 ± 2 g per bird were assigned to 15 treatments in a 3 (times of initiation of feeding) x 5 (ascorbic acid supplemental levels) factorial arrangement with three replications, each having 15 birds each. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but with different ascorbic acid supplementation levels. Ascorbic acid supplementation started three days <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> More than 50 % of the birds died between one and three days of age when initiation of feeding <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> was above 36 hours. Time of initiation of feeding above 36 hours of hatching resulted in lower (p 0. 05) on feed intake of the bird's irrespective of time of initiation of feeding <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> It is concluded that time of initiation of feeding above 36 hours <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> is not desirable, mainly because of its effect on mortality. However, the beneficial effect of ascorbic acid supplementation could be exploited in reducing mortality rate and improving growth rates in broiler chickens subjected to delayed initiation of feeding <b>after</b> <b>hatching...</b>|$|R

30|$|Females brooded more intensively in nests where males {{provided}} sufficient {{food for}} the family. These females continually stayed with the young until the late brooding stage (18 days <b>after</b> <b>hatching).</b> <b>After</b> completing the brooding period (21 days <b>after</b> <b>hatching),</b> they either no longer visited their nests or began to provide food to their young together with males. Females exposed to a low or zero male feeding rate left their young for long periods without brooding during the early brooding stage (8 days <b>after</b> <b>hatching)</b> and provisioned nestlings at a mean rate of 0.6 ± 0.8 prey items/night. As a consequence, all of these nesting attempts failed. One female that was widowed 21 days <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> stopped brooding and began food provisioning alone, but only one of six young successfully left the nest. Body masses of females in successful and unsuccessful nests were similar, indicating that females in nests with insufficient provisioning did not markedly suffer {{from a lack of}} food.|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the expression of five yolk protein genes in the avian liver in response to exogenous estradiol is shown to be developmentally regulated. Though each of these yolk protein genes gains the capacity to respond to estradiol during embryonic development, we demonstrate that maximal responses for the different genes are achieved at distinct ages between 1 and 6 weeks <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> This observation prompted us to look for possible correlations between yolk protein gene expression {{and changes in the}} expression of estrogen receptors that might also occur <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> We discovered that indeed the maximal level of nuclear estrogen receptors (assayed following the administration of estradiol) increases progressively over this same period of development from approximately 1000 receptors per cell at 1 week <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> to approximately 3500 receptors per cell at 6 weeks <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> The latter number represents the fully mature state, as comparable levels of receptors are present in the livers of egg-laying hens. Thus, though increases in the expression of estrogen receptors during embryonic liver development have previously been reported, our results indicate that the changes that occur <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> are quantitatively far more significant to the developmental program for this transcription factor...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the digestive system in the larvae of the marble goby Oxyeleotris marmoratus was examined histologically from the 2 nd to the 35 th day <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> The larvae absorbed their yolk sacs 4 - 5 day <b>after</b> <b>hatching,</b> however they commenced exogenous feeding 2 days <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> <b>After</b> the onset of exogenous feeding 5 regions could be easily distinguished in the gut: the buccal capvity, the oesophagus, a future stomach, the intestine and the rectum. At this time, the intestinal tract was functional however the stomach was not developed completely. The first signs of intestinal absorption appeared in day 3 <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> and could be identified as lipid vacuoles in the rectum. The larvae started to absorb protein in day 5.

40|$|Abstract: The avian eggshell is {{composite}} structure of calcium carbonate {{in association with}} organic components. Calcium, magnesium, and sodium are major inorganic constituents of the avian eggshell. However, Ca distribution is not homogenous throughout the shell thickness, its relative concentration increases from inside to outside. This phenomenon is more pronounced <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> indicating the consumption of the inner layer contents by the embryo during its development. On the other hand Mg and Na concentrations in the internal layers of the eggshell before hatching are higher than <b>after</b> <b>hatching</b> for the same reasoning. It {{has been suggested that}} an increase in magnesium content of the shell is directly related to an increase in shell hardness. In the present work Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technique has been used to study the avian eggshell elemental composition before and <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> Depth profiling of the shell is also carried out to follow-up different elements throughout the shell thickness using the same laser spectroscopic technique. The evaluation of the LIBS spectra of the examined samples provided us with quantitative information about the consumption of different elements during incubation. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to assess the relationship between layers of the eggshell before and <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> The thicknesses of the mammillary, palisade, vertical crystal, and cuticle layers relative to the total eggshell thickness were measured before and <b>after</b> <b>hatching.</b> The percent contribution of the layers was different in the thinnest and thickest eggshell <b>after</b> and before <b>hatching</b> respectively...|$|R
