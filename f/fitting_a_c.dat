40|$|Three-mode factor {{analysis}} models {{are often used}} in exploratory analysis of three-way data. However, in some situations it is a priori known that a particular constrained three-mode {{factor analysis}} (C 3 MFA) model describes an underlying process exactly. In such situations, <b>fitting</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 3 MFA model to a data set {{can be used for}} both quantitative analysis (e. g. estimating concentrations of a chemical substance in a mixture) and qualitative analysis (e. g. on the basis of certain subsets of parameters one can identify the substances present in a mixture). In this paper a general algorithm for fitting a range of such C 3 MFA models is proposed. Whether C 3 MFA is used for qualitative or quantitative analysis, in both cases it is crucial that the relevant parameter estimates are uniquely determinable. In the present paper it is discussed how and to what extent uniqueness of certain model parameters can be assessed. (C) 1998 John Whey & Sons, Lt...|$|E
40|$|A small bundle-sheath {{conductance}} (g bs) {{is essential}} for the C 4 CO 2 -concentrating mechanism to suppress photorespiration effectively. To predict the productivity of C 4 crops accurately under global warming, it is necessary to examine whether and how g bs responds to temperature. We investigated the temperature response of g bs in maize by <b>fitting</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 4 photosynthesis model to combined gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of irradiance and CO 2 response curves at 21 % and 2 % O 2 within the range of 13. 5 - 39 °C. The analysis was based on reported kinetic constants of C 4 Rubisco and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and temperature responses of C 3 mesophyll conductance (g m). The estimates of g bs varied greatly with leaf temperature. The temperature response of g bs was well described by the peaked Arrhenius equation, with the optimum temperature being ~ 34 °C. The assumed temperature responses of g m had only a slight impact on the temperature response of g bs. In contrast, using extreme values of some enzyme kinetic constants changed the shape of the response, from the peaked optimum response to the non-peaked Arrhenius pattern. Further studies are needed to confirm such an Arrhenius response pattern from independent measurement techniques and to assess whether it is common across C 4 species. </p...|$|E

The experiments {{have been performed}} for 120 K < T < 200 K with a gold working electrode in two different electrolyte solution mixtures containing equal amounts of decamethylferrocene and decamethylferricinium, tetrafluoroborate: 7 : 1 : 16 (v:v:v) tetrahydrofuran/ 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran/ethylchloride with lithium tetrafluoroborate, and 1 : 2 (v:v) butyronitrile/ethylchloride with tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. Values of standard rate constants for each temperature have been evaluated by <b>fitting</b> the experimental <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> impedance spectra with a simple RC parallel circuit in the middle frequency part of complex-plane plots. The analysis of Arrhenius plots, corrected from solvent dynamics (In k(0) T(1 / 2) vs T- 1), for the range of temperatures studied yields the free activation energy Delta G* and the pre-exponential factor A' for the two solvents mixtures (respectively 18. 22 kJ mol(- 1) and 1140 cm s(- 1) in the tetrahydrofuran-based solvent system, 22. 53 U mol(- 1) and 2618 cm s(- 1) in the butyronitrile-based solvent system). The very slight discrepancies between the experimental results and theoretical values calculated from the solvent dielectric continuum model are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
