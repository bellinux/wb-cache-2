50|$|Some machines, such as Ms. Pac-Man and Joust, are {{occasionally}} in smaller boxes with a <b>flat,</b> <b>clear</b> glass or acrylic glass top; the player {{sits at the}} machine playing it, looking down. This style of arcade game {{is known as a}} cocktail-style arcade game table or tabletop arcade machine, since they were first popularized in bars and pubs. For two player games on this type of machine, the players sit on opposite sides with the screen flipped upside down for each player. A few cocktail-style games had players sitting next to rather than across from one another. Both Joust and Gun Fight had these type of tables.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1760s, Euro-American {{settlers}} began {{arriving in the}} Holston, Watauga, and Nolichucky river valleys in Southwest Virginia and what is now Northeast Tennessee. Along the Watauga, settlers were drawn to a place known as the Watauga Old Fields, an ancient Native American gathering place that pre-dated the Cherokee. The Old Fields consisted of <b>flat,</b> <b>cleared</b> land located along the Watauga's Sycamore Shoals, a relatively low stretch of the river where pioneers and travelers could cross with ease. [...] These early settlers inevitably came into conflict with the Cherokee and other Native American tribes in the region who claimed these lands as hunting grounds.|$|R

50|$|Spa Green {{adapted for}} working {{families}} many features from Lubetkin’s luxury Highpoint flats, including lifts, central heating, balconies, daylight and ventilation from multiple directions, large entry spaces, and a roof terrace. Well designed fitted kitchens, including slide-away breakfast counters and ironing boards, electrical and gas appliances, and a central waste-disposal system in stainless steel, exceeded the amenities enjoyed {{by most of}} the population in the austere late 1940s. Ove Arup’s innovative concrete box-frame or 'egg-crate' construction gave each <b>flat</b> <b>clear</b> views and interiors uncluttered by beams, columns, or pipes, while his aerodynamic 'wind-roofs' and open terraces provided a communal area for drying clothes, social gathering and enjoying views of St Paul's Cathedral, the Old Bailey and the Houses of Parliament.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of aview of the parapet of Adolph Sutro's grounds, San Francisco, ca. 1890. The {{picture is}} {{dominated}} by a steep cliff, into which {{a flight of stairs}} has been cut. Standing on these steps are several women in black dresses. On top of the cliff is a low stone wall that resembles battlements on a castle, and more people can be seen standing behind it. Further behind the wall is a building with a flat roof, and {{on the left side of}} this building is a tower, complete with several flights of stairs reaching the top platform. On the left side of the cliff, a wrought-iron fence runs from the top of the cliff steps to the edge of another building at the extreme left of the picture. Below, statues are arranged sporadically on pedestals made from the cliff rock, as well as on the <b>flat</b> <b>clearing</b> farther down...|$|R
50|$|The south {{entrance}} {{has a low}} pavilion structure {{over the}} opening and a dirt parking area nearby. The opening is artificial and has a permanently placed ladder descending to a debris pile. The debris pile can be descended on foot, landing on a <b>flat</b> and <b>clear</b> cinder floor. The main length of the cave is mostly clear with occasional piles of fallen rock.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, Paramus, lacking any {{master plan}} until 1969, was redeveloped into two {{shopping}} corridors when its farmers and outside developers saw that shopping malls were more lucrative than produce farming. [...] "It was a developer's dream: <b>flat</b> <b>cleared</b> land adjacent to major arterials and accessible {{to a growing}} suburban population and the country's largest city – with no planning restrictions". New York had a state sales tax, but New Jersey had none, so {{with the opening of}} Manhattan department stores in the Bergen Mall (1957), the Garden State Plaza (1957) and Alexander's (1961), Paramus became the [...] "first stop outside New York City for shopping". From 1948–58, the population of Paramus increased from 6,000 to 23,000, the number of retail establishments tripled from 111 to 319, and annual retail sales increased from $5.5 million to $112 million. By the 1980s, when the population had increased slightly over 1960s levels, retail sales had climbed to $1 billion.|$|R
50|$|Many of Voysey's pattern designs rely {{for their}} effect on rhythmically contrasted shapes {{consisting}} of areas of <b>flat,</b> <b>clear</b> colour, usually bounded by dark or pale outlines. This is {{in the tradition of}} oriental design praised by Victorian reformers of design, such as Owen Jones and Matthew Digby Wyatt. In Voysey's work stylised natural forms, especially plants and birds, often represent the positive shapes, and areas of background form the contrasting negative shapes. This skilful juxtaposition can also be seen in his handling of the solids and voids in his designs for two-dimensional metalwork, such as ventilator grilles and hinges. Some of Voysey's pattern designs after c. 1900 consist of motifs placed in comparative isolation against a light ground. The use of scale is arbitrary, giving an effect of naive charm reminiscent of medieval illuminations and tapestries. The later designs are generally smaller and more delicately coloured than the designs of the 1880s and 1890s.|$|R

40|$|The broad {{weight of}} current {{scientific}} opinion supports {{the view that}} anthropogenically caused climate change is a reality. To minimise gaseous emissions linked with climate change, the energy production industry is moving increasingly toward renewable sources. Wind energy is set to make a substantial contribution to the generation capacity of many European countries. The UK Government has set a target to generate 10 % of the UK’s electricity from {{renewable sources of energy}} by 2010 and 5 % by 2003. Wind energy is now recognised as the fastest growing energy technology in the world, with the yearly growth rate estimated at 30 %. In the UK alone there are currently 1060 turbines in 83 wind energy installations, and many more with planning consent (BWEA 2004). A typical wind farm of 20 turbines might extend over an area of 1 square kilometre. It is generally agreed that the ideal position for a wind turbine generator is a smooth hill top, with a <b>flat</b> <b>clear</b> fetch, at least in the prevailing wind direction. Wind farms are sited in exposed areas to ensure high averag...|$|R
50|$|The LEMV {{required}} at least 1,000 ft of runway (violating the runway-independent requirement), and a tether point with a 300 ft <b>clear</b> <b>flat</b> area around {{on which to}} park, which prevented them from operating at most large bases and all small bases.|$|R
50|$|The single men's {{quarters}} {{are located}} on generally <b>flat</b> and <b>cleared</b> land to the south-east of the single women's quarters and the supply centre complex. A track leads to the single men's quarters from the north-west and the nearby supply centre. The area is bordered by a steep rocky slope to the north-east and a sandy beach to the south- west. The site consists of concrete pads of the single men's quarters, communal kitchens, dispensary, toilet and shower blocks, laundry and Anglican Church.|$|R
50|$|The {{locality}} {{is roughly}} equivalent to the cadastral parishes of Womboyne, Jimberoo, and Currawong in the county of Dowling. The area is bordered by the towns of Lake Cargelligo {{to the north and}} Rankins Springs to the south. Although predominantly <b>flat</b> and <b>cleared</b> for agriculture, significant geographic features include a number of mesa in the southern portion as well as the Jimberoo and Conapaira State forests. There are also significant mineral deposits in the north of Naradhan, including gold, lead, and tin.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Classic" [...] Cassegrain has a {{parabolic}} primary mirror, and a hyperbolic {{secondary mirror}} {{that reflects the}} light back down {{through a hole in}} the primary. Folding the optics makes this a compact design. On smaller telescopes, and camera lenses, the secondary is often mounted on an optically <b>flat,</b> optically <b>clear</b> glass plate that closes the telescope tube. This support eliminates the [...] "star-shaped" [...] diffraction effects caused by a straight-vaned support spider. The closed tube stays clean, and the primary is protected, at the cost of some loss of light-gathering power.|$|R
50|$|As glaciers receded {{towards the}} end of the Ice Age and turned ice into liquid, the Mississippi River grew longer and wider. Over time, the silt {{deposits}} of the Mississippi created some of the most fertile soil in the world, ideal for agriculture. The areas around the Mississippi are composed of thick regolith that is around 100 m thick. The Bootheel lies in the flood plain between the Mississippi and St. Francis rivers; so the land is very <b>flat.</b> Since <b>clearing</b> and drainage of wetlands in the early 20th century, it has been predominantly developed for agricultural purposes. Prior to the 20th century, it was mostly unsettled swampy forestland.|$|R
50|$|Wood {{engravers}} use a {{range of}} specialized tools. The lozenge graver {{is similar to the}} burin used by copper engravers of Bewick's day, and comes in different sizes. Various sizes of V-shaped graver are used for hatching. Other, more flexible, tools include the spitsticker, for fine undulating lines; the round scorper for curved textures; and the <b>flat</b> scorper for <b>clearing</b> larger areas.|$|R
50|$|Heading {{north from}} Melbourne, the road {{passes through the}} hills of the Great Dividing Range, some of which is covered with box {{eucalypt}} forest but of which much is cleared for farmland, before levelling out near Seymour to cross <b>flat,</b> mostly <b>cleared</b> farming country to Wodonga and the Victoria-New South Wales border. Victoria's landscape differs {{to that of the}} typical 'true Australian Outback', but a dry summer can leave the ground parched. Mount Buffalo {{can be seen in the}} distance to the east as the highway comes down off the Warby Range near Glenrowan, and a museum commemorating Ned Kelly is located nearby. At Wangaratta the highway passes close to the Rutherglen and Milawa wine-producing areas.|$|R
