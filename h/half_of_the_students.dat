5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} also welcomes {{foreign students}} {{who wants to}} obtain a French degree. In 2010, they are about 2,400, which is 13,3% of the students. They are much more in proportion in the PhD courses, where they are almost <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> (45%).|$|E
25|$|Although women {{comprise}} approximately <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> {{enrolled in}} American law schools, they represent only 17% of partners at major law firms {{and less than}} a quarter of tenured law professors. Similarly, in the United States, there has been only one female attorney general, three female secretaries of state, two women Supreme Court justices, and one acting solicitor general.|$|E
25|$|Trinity High School {{receives}} {{students from}} three feeder schools: all students from Euless Junior High school and most students zoned to Harwood Junior High school attend Trinity along with roughly <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> from Central Junior High school. Students in the attendance zones for Bell Manor, Lakewood, Meadow Creek, Midway Park, North Euless, Oakwood Terrace, Shady Brook, South Euless, Spring Garden, Viridian, and Wilshire elementary schools attend Trinity High School.|$|E

25|$|In {{another study}} {{examining}} the Forer effect, students took the MMPI personality assessment and researchers evaluated their responses. The researchers wrote accurate {{evaluations of the}} students' personalities but gave the students an accurate assessment and a fake assessment using vague generalities. Students {{were then asked to}} choose which personality assessment they believe was their own, actual assessment. More than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> (59%) chose the fake assessment as opposed to the real one.|$|E
25|$|The State of Texas {{chartered}} {{the school}} on February 20, 1946, and classes were first held on April 1. At that point, enrollment at LeTourneau was exclusively male and predominantly veterans. For {{the first two}} years, LeTourneau provided an academy section to allow {{the completion of the}} junior and senior years of high school as well as a college section that offered two-year tradeskill programs and a four-year technology program. Students attended classes on alternating days; while one <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were in class, the other half worked at R.G. LeTourneau's nearby LeTourneau Incorporated manufacturing plant, thus satisfying the laboratory requirements of all of the industrial courses.|$|E
25|$|Since German {{universities}} do {{not offer}} accommodation or meals, {{students are expected to}} organize and pay for board and lodging themselves. Inexpensive places in dormitories are available from Studentenwerk, a statutory non-profit organization for student affairs. However, there are only enough places for a fraction of students. Studentenwerk also runs canteens and cafés on campus, which are similarly affordable. Other common housing options include renting a private room or apartment as well as living together with one or more roommates to form a Wohngemeinschaft (often abbreviated WG). Furthermore, many university students continue to live with their parents. One third to one <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> works to make a little extra money, often resulting in a longer stay at university.|$|E
50|$|UT has {{approximately}} 8,310 {{students from}} 50 U.S. states and 140 countries. A {{significant number of}} students come from northern and northeastern states.

500|$|As the North Side {{neighborhood}} has changed, so has Minneapolis North. During the 1920s and 1930s the North Side {{was the center}} of Minneapolis' Jewish population. In 1936 almost <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were Jewish. [...] The North Side has since transitioned into a [...] diverse working-class neighborhood with the highest rate of housing foreclosures in Minneapolis. North used to be a very large school and was overcrowded with over 2800 students attending the school in 1931. Now, residents are able to choose which schools they attend, and as a result only about half of the North Side's students attend local schools such as North. The Minneapolis Public Schools Board of Education's decision to close several North Side middle and elementary schools led to North's enrollment plummeting from 1,143 students in 2004-05 to 265 students in 2010. On October 11, 2010 Minneapolis Public Schools Superintendent Bernadeia Johnson recommend to the Board of Education the phasing out of North High Community High School beginning the 2011-12 school year. However, this decision resulted in backlash from the North Minneapolis community. It was decided that North Community High School would remain open, but change its curriculum standards to focus more on arts and communications. It is now called North Academy of Arts and Communications (NAAC).|$|E
500|$|A Royal Commission was {{appointed}} in 1852 {{to investigate the}} university. The college wished to retain its links with Wales, and initial reforms were limited despite {{the wishes of the}} commissioners: those scholarships that were limited to particular parts of Wales were opened to the whole of Wales, and half of the fellowships awarded were to remain open only to Welshmen if and so long as the Principal and Fellows shall deem it expedient for the interests of education in connection with the Principality of Wales. All the scholarships at the college, except for two, and all the exhibitions were still restricted to students from Wales. The numbers of students at the college still fell, despite prizes being awarded for success in university examinations. Daniel Harper, principal from 1877 to 1895, noted the continuing academic decline. [...] Speaking in 1879, he noted that fewer students from the college were reaching high standards in examinations, and that more Welsh students were choosing to study at other Oxford colleges in preference to Jesus. A further Royal Commission {{was appointed}}. This led to further changes at the college: in 1882, the fellowships reserved to Welshmen were made open to all, and only half (instead of all) of the 24 scholarships were to be reserved for Welsh candidates. Thereafter, numbers gradually rose and the non-Welsh element at the college increased, so that by 1914 only about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were Welsh.|$|E
2500|$|The {{school is}} roughly half boys and half girls, and nearly one <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> have non-white backgrounds.

50|$|Drury's {{study abroad}} program is an {{integral}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> college experience. Almost <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> body studies overseas at some point in short-term, semester, or year-long programs. Foreign learning is a requirement for most students with majors in <b>the</b> schools <b>of</b> Business and Architecture.|$|R
50|$|More than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> body {{participated in}} one or more inter-scholastic sports. The academy fielded teams in {{basketball}} and boys' and girls' volleyball, and was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PAC-5 consortium <b>of</b> schools that fields joint teams in <b>the</b> Interscholastic League <b>of</b> Honolulu (ILH) sports.|$|R
50|$|The school's admissions {{policy is}} broadly non-selective. Priority for admissions {{is given to}} <b>students</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{founding}} trustee nations - British, Australian, New Zealand, and Irish students. These nationalities make up slightly under <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> population. <b>The</b> school has around one-third Malaysians and 49 other nationalities represented.|$|R
2500|$|Over <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> at {{the college}} were the sons of farmers, though most did not study {{agriculture}} as Tillman wished.

2500|$|Anglican clergymen {{were usually}} quick to publish {{pamphlets}} on any theological controversy, but tended to excuse themselves from responding to Vestiges as they lacked expertise: men of science {{were expected to}} lead the counterattack. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge {{were part of the}} Anglican establishment, intended to educate Christian gentlemen with <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> becoming clergymen. Science subjects were optional lectures. The professors were scientific clergymen with strong reputations, and at Cambridge science had developed as natural theology, but there was no unified scientific establishment. The quarterly review magazines turned to them for commentary on the book, but demonstrating that it was superficial was difficult when its range of topics meant experts being drawn into superficial responses outside their own area of intensive expertise. William Whewell refused all requests for a review to avoid dignifying the [...] "bold, speculative and false" [...] work, but was the first to give a response, publishing Indications of a Creator in mid February 1845 as a slim and elegant volume of [...] "theological extracts" [...] from his writings. His aim was to inform superficial London society used to skimming books as conversation pieces and lacking properly prepared minds to deal with real philosophy and real science, and he avoided mentioning Vestiges by name. During the crucial early months of the debate this and Hume's lecture distributed as a pamphlet were the only responses to Vestiges published by the established clergy, and there were just two other short works opposing it: a published lecture by the Anabaptist preacher John Sheppard, and an unorthodox anti-science piece by Samuel Richard Bosanquet.|$|E
60|$|Only about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> had as yet arrived, {{the others}} being {{expected}} that day, Friday, and Saturday. The college coach {{was to bring}} {{in some of the}} boys about eleven o'clock, and the Rovers wondered if Songbird Powell would be among them.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the removal announcement a campaign was launched to stop <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. Notably, a student petition got 1,200 signatures (about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> population), and community involvement came from <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Santa Monica and from <b>the</b> neighborhood councils <b>of</b> Brentwood and West Los Angeles.|$|R

50|$|ACP’s {{student body}} changed with time, {{in part due}} to <b>the</b> {{decrease}} <b>of</b> US military presence in Europe.
