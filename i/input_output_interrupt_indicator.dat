40|$|Some PDP 6 LISP {{users have}} felt {{a need for}} a way to {{incorporate}} MIDAS subroutines into LISP. LISP has been changed to let you do this, using files found on the LISP SYSTEM microtape. You write a routine for LISP {{in much the same way}} that you write any other MIDAS relocatable subroutine. You must, however, observe the constraints imposed by LISP's allocation and use of accumulators, and its methods of handling <b>input,</b> <b>output,</b> and <b>interrupts.</b> In addition, you require linkage to LISP before your routine can operate properly: The entry point(s) of the subroutine must be put on the property list(s) of the appropriate atom(s), and the address fields of the instructions pointing to other routines, to list structure, or the other LISP data structures must be set properly. This is done when LISP begins operation??er allocation, but before going into its listen loop. We provide eight macros to ease the job of creating such linkages: SUBR, FSUBR, MACRO, QUOTE, E, SPECIAL, and SYM. If you write "SUBR name" at a location a in your routine, LISP will subsequently ascribe the property SUBR to the atom name, with entry location a. Similar remarks apply to the use of FSBUR, LSBUR, and MACRO. The significance and use of other four macros is perhaps best communicated through examples: 1. An instruction like "MOVEI A,QUOTE(X Y Z) " will be assembled as "MOVEI A,O". At link time, however, LISP will insert the location of list (X Y Z) into the address field of the instruction. 2. 2. Suppose that the atom FOO has the properties shown in Figure 1. Then the instructions "MOVEI A QUOTE FOO", "MOVEM B, SPECIAL FOO", "PUSHJ P, SYM FOO", and "CALL E FOO" will each be assembled with a zero address field, which will be modified at link time to be b, c, 106, and 101, respectively.

40|$|The PCF 8574 / 74 A {{provides}} general-purpose remote I/O expansion via the two-wire bidirectional I 2 C-bus (serial clock (SCL), {{serial data}} (SDA)). The devices consist of eight quasi-bidirectional ports, 100 kHz I 2 C-bus interface, three hardware address <b>inputs</b> and <b>interrupt</b> <b>output</b> operating between 2. 5 V and 6 V. The quasi-bidirectional port can be independently assigned as an input to monitor interrupt status or keypads, {{or as an}} output to activate indicator devices such as LEDs. System master can read from the input port or write to the output port through a single register. The low current consumption of 2. 5 �A (typical, static) is great for mobile applications and the latched output ports directly drive LEDs. The PCF 8574 and PCF 8574 A are identical, except for the different fixed portion of the slave address. The three hardware address pins allow eight of each device {{to be on the}} same I 2 C-bus, so there can be up to 16 of these I/O expanders PCF 8574 / 74 A together on the same I 2 C-bus, supporting up to 128 I/Os (for example, 128 LEDs).

The PCA 9535 EC is identical to the PCA 9535 E but with high−impedance open−drain outputs at all the I/O pins.
