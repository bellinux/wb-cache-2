A plot of bladder (intravesical) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a cystometrogram), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is {{a manifestation of the}} law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle.|$|E

However, soft robots suffer from {{not being able to}} carry their own weight which mainly depends on the modulus of elasticity of the material used to fabricate them. In this paper, we report on a practical and easy-to-implement stiffness augmentation method to enhance stiffness of soft robotic components. We fabricated a soft robotic finger which is fully compliant with flexure hinges using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technique and a stiffness augmenting unit made of thin poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) sheets. The stiffness of the entire robotic finger was increased mechanically by linearly driving the stiffness augmenting unit. The experimental data presented show that stiffness of the finger was increased by 40 %.

In this condition extra work is required to get air out of the lungs. In addition, patients often have difficulties inhaling air as well.

The motion of these robots is difficult to model, as continuum mechanics apply to them, and they are sometimes referred to as continuum robots. Soft Robotics is the specific sub-field of robotics dealing with constructing robots from <b>highly</b> <b>compliant</b> materials, similar to those found in living organisms. Similarly, soft robotics also draws heavily from the way in which these living organisms move and adapt to their surroundings. In contrast to robots built from rigid materials, soft robots allow for increased flexibility and adaptability for accomplishing tasks, as well as improved safety when working around humans. These characteristics allow for its potential use in the fields of medicine and manufacturing. However, there exist rigid robots that are also capable of continuum deformations, most notably the snake-arm robot.|$|E

The magnet is close to a set of fixed pick-up coils, or the moving coils are held within a magnetic field generated by fixed permanent magnets. In either case, the movement of the stylus as it tracks the grooves of a record causes a fluctuating magnetic field which causes a small electric current to be induced in the coils. This current closely follows the sound waveform cut into the record, and may be transmitted by wires to an electronic amplifier where it is processed and amplified in order to drive a loudspeaker. Depending upon the amplifier design, a phono-preamplifier may be necessary.|$|E

40|$|The {{vision of}} {{morphological}} computation proposes that {{the complexity of}} compliant bodies of biological systems is not accidentally, but rather that it {{can contribute to the}} computations, which are needed for a successful interaction with the environment. We demonstrate in a simulation that a <b>compliant,</b> <b>highly</b> nonlinear body (simulated as a random network of masses and springs) can serve as a computational resource, which allows the end-effector of a two-link robot arm to move autonomously on a complex trajectory. Remarkably, simple linear and static feedback loops from the state of the compliant structure back to the robot arm torques suffice. This suggests that by outsourcing parts of the nonlinear and dynamic computation to the compliant morphology the remaining computational task is much simpler and can be even represented by some static, linear weights...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{elastomer}} (DE) actuators {{could have}} {{great potential for}} innovative solutions in different applications due to their large deformation capabilities, low cost and lightweight nature. One of the main technical challenges {{in the development of}} DE actuators is to realize <b>highly</b> conductive, <b>compliant</b> electrodes that do not constrain the large strain of the elastomer material. Metal electrodes are normally not feasible due to their high stiffness, though their electrical properties are excellent. Therefore mostly powder or grease electrodes have been realized so far, yielding good results in the laboratory. However, for many applications in industrial use, stack actuators with compliant electrodes have some disadvantages regarding processing and durability. Additionally the inhomogeneous strain distribution along the stack due to boundary constraints leads to performance losses, especially for thin actuators. Therefore a new design approach with rigid, perforated me tal electrodes is chosen. This stack actuator only contracts in one direction whereas all the other directions remain undeformed. To find an optimal electrode design, a numerical model is set up for a small cut-out element of the actuator and different physical effects are subsequently taken into account to match reality as closely as possible. Finally, a functional demonstrator is built and characterized experimentally. The studies show the great potential for elastomer actuators with perforated, rigid electrodes and also demonstrate the need for a careful design and the advantage of numerical optimization methods...|$|R
50|$|Pulmonary {{vascular}} resistance (PVR) {{also depends}} on the lung volume, and PVR is lowest at the functional residual capacity (FRC). The <b>highly</b> <b>compliant</b> nature of the pulmonary circulation means {{that the degree of}} lung distention has a large effect on PVR. This results primarily due to effects on the alveolar and extra-alveolar vessels. During inspiration, increased lung volumes cause alveolar expansion and lengthwise stretching of the interstitial alveolar vessels. This increases their length and reduces their diameter, thus increase alveolar vessel resistance. On the other hand, decreased lung volumes during expiration cause the extra-alveolar arteries and veins to become narrower due to decreased radial traction from adjacent tissues. This leads to an increase in extra-alveolar vessel resistance. PVR is calculated as a sum of the alveolar and extra-alveolar resistances as these vessels lie in series with each other. Because the alveolar and extra-alveolar resistances are increased at high and low lung volumes respectively, the total PVR takes the shape of a U curve. The point at which PVR is the lowest is near the FRC.|$|E
50|$|The complex {{loading of}} the bass drive unit demands {{specific}} Thiele-Small driver parameters to realise the full {{benefits of a}} TL design. Most drive units in the marketplace are developed for the more common reflex and infinite baffle designs and are usually not suitable for TL loading. High efficiency bass drivers with extended low frequency ability, are usually designed to be extremely light and flexible, having very compliant suspensions. Whilst performing well in a reflex design, these characteristics do not match {{the demands of a}} TL design. The drive unit is effectively coupled to a long column of air which has mass. This lowers the resonant frequency of the drive unit, negating the need for a <b>highly</b> <b>compliant</b> device. Furthermore, the column of air provides greater force on the driver itself than a driver opening onto a large volume of air (in simple terms it provides more resistance to the driver's attempt to move it), so to control the movement of air requires an extremely rigid cone, to avoid deformation and consequent distortion.|$|E

Once buckled, the tube becomes <b>highly</b> <b>compliant</b> so that small additional increases in pe lead to a substantial reduction in cross-sectional area ®. Further compression leads to contact of the opposite tube walls, first at a point, and then along a line (Figure 2, left); once in opposite-wall contact, the tube’s compliance falls because strong bending forces in the tube wall at the bulbous end of each lobe provide an increasing resistance to area reductions.

The adhesion surface combines electrostatic attraction and van der Waals forces; it is <b>highly</b> flexible and <b>compliant</b> to local irregularities of the target surface. The proposed capture concept increases the operative flexibility, tolerating critical scenario uncertainties (i. e. target shape, motion, mass).

40|$|Mooring systems {{employed}} for floating structures commonly result in non-linear load-excursion characteristics. The non-linear stiffness {{and the subsequent}} amplitude-dependent natural frequency influence the vortex-induced motion of the structure. The application of linear stiffness vortex-induced motion modelling and experimental data {{has been shown to}} produce significant uncertainties regarding the onset and vortex-induced response prediction of catenary moored cylindrical structures (Bjarke et al. 2003; Dijk et al. 2003). In the present study, the two-degree of freedom vortex-induced motion of non-linearly compliant elastically mounted rigid cylinders was experimentally investigated. Specifically, third-order polynomial hard-spring stiffness, typical of catenary moorings was considered. The linear and cubic compliance components were independently varied over the non-linear compliance ratio range of 0 to 0. 29. The study revealed that the analysis of non-linear compliant structures assuming the corresponding linear system response is conservative with respect to mean inline structure displacement and the maximum inline and transverse oscillatory response. Relative to the non-linear compliant system, the transverse and inline motions were over-predicted by adopting a linear restoring force model. The vortex-induced vibration initial lock-in conditions were also unaltered with increasing non-linear stiffness. Conversely, the analysis of non-linear compliant structures, assuming the corresponding linear system response, is not conservative with respect to the lock-out point and the maximum structure excursion (and consequently the maximum mooring line tension experienced) over the lock-in range. This has potential bearing on the way in which <b>highly</b> non-linear <b>compliant</b> systems are modelled with regard to their vortex induced motion response...|$|R

50|$|Because a stiff wheel {{rolling on}} a rigid rail {{requires}} far less energy per ton-mile moved than road transport (with a <b>highly</b> <b>compliant</b> wheel on an uneven surface), railroads are highly {{suitable for the}} movement of dense, bulk goods such as coal and other minerals. This was an incentive to experiment with many configurations and shapes of wheels and rails. In the late 1760s, the Coalbrookdale Company began to fix plates of cast iron to the upper surface of the wooden rails. These (and earlier railways) had flanged wheels as on modern railways, but another system was introduced, in which unflanged wheels ran on L-shaped metal plates - these became known as plateways. John Curr, a Sheffield colliery manager, invented this flanged rail, though the exact date of this is disputed. The plate rail was taken up by Benjamin Outram for wagonways serving his canals, manufacturing them at his Butterley ironworks. Meanwhile, William Jessop, a civil engineer, had used a form of edge rail successfully for an extension to the Charnwood Forest Canal at Nanpantan, Loughborough, Leicestershire in 1789. Jessop became {{a partner in the}} Butterley Company in 1790. The flanged wheel eventually proved its superiority due to its performance on curves, and the composite iron/wood rail was replaced by an all-metal rail, with its vastly superior stiffness, durability, and safety.|$|E
5000|$|The unique {{plantigrade}} {{alignment of}} the human foot results in a distal-limb structure that can adapt {{to a variety of}} conditions. The less mobile and more robust tarsal bones are shaped and aligned to accept and transmit large loads during the early phases of stance (initial contact and loading response phases of walking, and inadvertent heel strikes during running). The tarsals of the midfoot, which are smaller and shorter than the hindfoot tarsals, appear well oriented to transmit loads between the hindfoot and forefoot; this is necessary for load transfer and locking of the foot complex into a rigid lever for late stance phase. Conversely, the midfoot bones and joints also allow for the transmission of loads and inter-joint movement that unlocks the foot to create a loosely packed structure which renders the foot <b>highly</b> <b>compliant</b> over a variety of surfaces. In this configuration, the foot is able to absorb and damp the large loads encountered during heel strike and early weight acceptance. [...] The forefoot, with its long metatarsal and relatively long phalanges, transmits loads during the end-of-stance phase that facilitate the push-off and transfer of forward momentum. The forefoot also serves as a lever to allow balance during standing and jumping. In addition, the arches of the foot that span the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot {{play a critical role in}} the nature of transformation of the foot from a rigid lever to a flexible weight-accepting structure.|$|E
30|$|The main patient-related {{factor that}} places a patient at an {{increased}} risk for lithium intoxication, thus, might be summarized {{as a lack of}} lithium-related knowledge, which is known to be negatively correlated with age, whereas duration of treatment, sex, education and diagnosis {{does not seem to be}} related to lithium-specific knowledge (Schaub et al. 2001). Surprisingly, lithium-related knowledge has been shown to be insufficient even in a <b>highly</b> selected and <b>compliant</b> outpatient clinic cohort (Schaub et al. 2001). Consequently, intensifying patient education, especially in older patients taking lithium, on a regular basis seems to be most promising in potentially preventing lithium intoxications regarding patient-related factors. Despite the patients’ education, other strategies of preventing lithium intoxication like dosing considerations should be included (Malhi and Tanious 2011). In addition, a positive influence on the poor compliance in long-term lithium use might be a positive side effect in a less frequent administration (Malhi and Tanious 2011).|$|R

From April 1990 to August 1991, 57 femoropopliteal bypass grafts were implanted in 47 patients by surgeons at five university centres. In all instances, the saphenous vein was unavailable, unusable or reserved for use elsewhere. An empirical perioperative risk score for acute occlusion (0 - 20) was developed, based on such factors as severity of clinical ischaemia, quality of inflow and outflow, site of distal anastomosis and associated drug therapy. Primary cumulative patency was calculated according to standard life-table analysis. Poor inflow and a distal anastomosis below the knee were significant factors affecting graft patency (P = 0. 001 and P= 0. 001 respectively). Six-month cumulative patency for the 25 grafts with good inflow and above or mid-knee anastomoses (79 %) was superior to the cumulative patency for all 57 grafts (59 %). There was a significant improvement in patency rates between 'low' (22 grafts) and 'medium risk' (27 grafts) patients and 'high risk' (eight grafts) ones (risk scores 0 - 10 and 11 - 20 respectively) at a level of P = 0. 001. There were two operative deaths (4 %). Of the 19 postoperative occlusions, six occurred within 30 days and 18 within 6 months. These data indicate that the patency rates achieved with this new graft compare favourably with other available prosthetic grafts. In addition, the graft demonstrates superior handling characteristics and eliminates bleeding through suture holes. There is also the possibility that rapid tissue ingrowth, neointima formation and compliance will reduce intimal hyperplasia and increase long-term patency. © 1993.

40|$|Social {{scientists}} have long concerned {{themselves with the}} question of how employers manage their employees (Burawoy, 1979). The literature shows that employers control their workforces in different ways, including: physical control (Marx 1844), emotional control (Hochschild 2003), and control using gender stereotypes (Leidner 1991). However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the management of women working in the low-wage labor market and in non-traditional workspaces and their response to those control mechanisms. This thesis examines how employer control functions in a largely low-income female labor force. The study site was Love Dreams, a direct selling organization specializing in sexual enhancement products. The research question informed by Burawoy’s (1979) work on labor control is: how does Love Dreams manufacture labor control consent in a decentralized work environment? And in addition: how do workers make meaning of their work identity under these labor control mechanisms? This ethnographic case study uses the theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism based on a constructionism epistemology. Interviews and field notes were taped, transcribed, and entered into a qualitative program, MAXqda, for purposes of analysis. 	Findings show that Love Dreams exerted labor control over its workforce through the practice of cultural shilling, a social process that used familiar social identities to entice compliance. Cultural shilling consisted of two components. First, the company created a culture of motherhood that was comfortable and attractive to women because it gave them a feeling of belonging, thus ensuring loyalty. Second, the company offered continuous education, in conjunction with the Kinsey Institute, on sexual behaviors and products thereby medicalizing sexuality and empowering women by making them experts in their field. Together the cultural shilling practices resulted in a loyal, <b>highly</b> educated and <b>compliant</b> labor force. 	This thesis contributes to the labor control literature by considering the cultural practices used to manage a marginalized workforce in a decentralized business. With the emergence of new and increasingly diverse work environments come challenges to existing knowledge on labor control. Future research should focus on other non-traditional work environments as well as other marginalized work forces to better understand evolving management practices...|$|R
40|$|Governance is {{the process}} by which power and {{authority}} are exercised in a society by which government, the private sector, and citizens' groups articulate their interests, mediate their differences, and exercise their legal rights and obligations. Governance in public organisations is different from that in private organisations as they both possess different types of institutional stakeholders. Governments are directly answerable to the public. Therefore, it is essential for governments to be transparent in order to avoid any triggers in the accountability process that might adversely affect people's trust. The proper creation, capture, distribution and preservation of judicial evidence in the form of records can help avoid these problems. A trusted government is one that can demonstrate its accountability and transparency and is continually striving to improve value delivery and increase cost-effectiveness. The freedom of information demands governments to be more transparent and accountable for their actions and decisions. Whilst governments promote corporate governance to provide transparency and objectivity it can only give stakeholders better tools to do their job, it does not and cannot do it for them. The need for managing risk and audit culture is imperative to balance and satisfy the expectation of citizen and stakeholders. The accountability of a government can arguably only be achieved when it demonstrates considerable transparency, which in turn can only happen when trust is supported by authentic and reliable records. The records management community claims that records have to be preserved for accountability, but they rarely explore what 'accountability' is and what role records play in the accountability processes. In addition, the contribution of records management to good governance and accountability are often not recognised by other professions and management. In an age where corporate governance and transparency is a global agenda, it is imperative for the records management community to scrutinise their present role and approach in order to change the perception by other professions about their contribution towards achieving organisational goals in a <b>highly</b> regulated and <b>compliant</b> bound environment in the public and private sectors. The contention of this thesis is that record keeping is just a tool that ensures the availability of evidence for the accountability of governance, which in turn relies on the ethical standard of those involved.
