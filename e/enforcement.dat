5|$|By 2009, the P90 was {{in service}} with {{military}} and police forces in over 40 countries. In the United States, Houston Police Department was the first local law <b>enforcement</b> agency to adopt the P90, acquiring it for their SWAT team in 1999. In 2003, the Houston SWAT team {{became one of the}} first agencies in the country to use the weapon in a shootout. By 2009, the P90 was in use with over 200 law <b>enforcement</b> agencies in the United States, including the Secret Service and Federal Protective Service. In response, the National Rifle Association added the P90 and PS90 to its NRA Tactical Police Competition standards, allowing law <b>enforcement</b> agencies to compete in the event using either weapon.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law <b>enforcement</b> in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law <b>enforcement</b> was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
40|$|This article reexamines the {{pollution}} heaven hypothesis, using measureable environmental indicators {{to quantify the}} laxity of pollution control <b>enforcements.</b> The article examines the impact of pollution control <b>enforcements</b> on FDI inflow in industries across the spectrum {{as well as individual}} industries. The study was done on a global platform with separate groups of ASEAN countries and domestically within Thailand. Data from the World Bank, UNCTAD and Thailand’s Board of Investment between years 2008 to 2013 were used with panel data regression. Mixed results were obtained; low levels of pollution control <b>enforcements</b> significantly attract FDI inflow to ASEAN countries and East Asia Pacific Region, while in the cases of Europe, Central Asia and Latin America no significant result was found. For Thailand, as a host country, firm-level evaluation procedures using pollution intensity value together with laxity of pollution control <b>enforcements</b> were evaluated. Foreign investors from various countries consider that low levels of pollution control <b>enforcements</b> in Thailand reflected significantly and attracted their investment decisions...|$|R

5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis.

5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law <b>enforcement</b> team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law <b>enforcement</b> when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law <b>enforcement</b> integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law <b>enforcement</b> integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law <b>enforcement</b> agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug <b>Enforcement</b> Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law <b>enforcement</b> agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the <b>Enforcement</b> Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The <b>Enforcement</b> Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the <b>enforcement</b> of the <b>Enforcement</b> Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E
