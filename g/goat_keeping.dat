However, the message was a trap set by Aspen, who reveals {{himself to be a}} follower of the defeated wizard Cob. Tenar and Ged are led to the lord's mansion controlled by Aspen's magic. Therru runs to the cliff behind Ogion's cottage, where she calls to the dragon Kalessin for help, and reveals her true nature: she is in fact [...] "a double being, half human, half-dragon". Aspen and his followers bring both Tenar and Ged up to the clifftop. Under the influence of Aspen's spell, they are both just about to jump to their deaths when the dragon Kalessin arrives, subsequently burning Aspen and his men. Kalessin addresses Therru by her true name Tehanu, calling her his daughter, and asks her if she would like to leave with him, but she decides for now that she will stay with Tenar and Ged. The novel ends with all three of them settling down to a simple life of farming and <b>goat</b> <b>keeping</b> at Ogion's old cottage.|$|E

Household dietary diversity score (HDDS) was used as a proxy indicator of food security. GM was significantly affected by an off-take rate and flock size interaction (P 0. 05). Nevertheless, a significant positive correlation (P< 0. 05) was observed between GM from goats and HDDS in AAP system, indicating the indirect role of goat production for food security.

According to farmers interviewed, key challenges restricting dairy <b>goat</b> <b>keeping</b> in Zanzibar are; disease (57 %), drought (49 %), lack of funds (21 %), low access to health care (18 %), and lack of education (14 %). Key benefits are income and poverty reduction (35 %), manure (33 %), milk (18 %) and improved household nutrition (15 %). A small group (12 %) of farmers reported no benefit from keeping dairy goats. Average milk production for a dairy goat in Zanzibar is 0. 92 L per day for three months, well below genetic potential. Low milk production was mainly due to poor management, inadequate records and feeding in particular. To help improve management practices, farmers need access to appropriate animal healthcare, milk markets and education on dairy goat husbandry.

So far, there is little knowledge {{on the structure of}} these goat farms and their husbandry and breed-ing management. Aim {{of this study was to}} get an overview on dairy goat husbandry and breeding in Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. For this, a structured questionnaire was developed to investigate operational characteristics and basic data on dairy goat husbandry and breeding. The addresses of commercial dairy goat farms where ob-tained from goat breeders associations. The feedback from goat farmers was very high (94 %). Most dairy goat farms are organic farms and belong to specific certifying organisations. Most farms (87 %) farm less than 50 ha of agricultural land and keep between 60 and 100 goats. The German Fawn is the predominant breed (80 %) in female goats. There is a large variation in numbers of male goats per farm and also in their breed. The marketing of surplus kids is mainly directly to the consumer and below 12 weeks of age. Finally, commercial dairy goat farming in south Germany secures an income to small family farms.

Although the main subject is dwarf goats, management aspects, innovations or recommendations made are also valid for dwarf sheep and are indicated where relevant. The role goats may in farming households is described. Goat management systems are covered, both extensive or semi-intensive with descriptions and diagrams of housing and enclosures. The step-by-step advice {{on health care and}} nutrition is supplemented by detailed drawings and diagrams. There is a chapter on extension giving advice on how to involve the farmer in building up husbandry information with the use of simple mapping and seasonal diagramming. For example, a squared chart drawn on the ground with symptom indications written down the side months of the year at the bottom and the rows filled with numbers of beans (2 beans indicated low and 8 high) shows when the seasonally` highest or lowest incidence of health problems occurred.

Eric Tielkes, who works with PDRT and is an enthusiastic tinkerer, applied a novel way of supporting GIS systems (see Links on page 10). He hung a camera under a kite. Using a set of these photographs, PDRT can monitor whether, for instance, erosion control measures like small dams or hedges actually work or not. Patches of deposited sediment are visible on the photographs, just as gullies reveal instances where erosion control measures have been wrongly sited or built. The technique, kite aerial photography (KAP), is not new but until now {{it has not been}} used for professional purposes. The kite is 6 m 3 in size and the camera hangs 8 m under the kite. On the ground the photographer can determine when to take the picture once the kite is in the air, by using a drainpipe 40 cm long and 10 cm in diameter with a small mirror underneath. As soon as the kite {{can be seen in the}} mirror, the photographer knows that the camera is right above the spot to be photographed. The camera is radio-controlled and has an automatic film transporter. To get maximum amounts of data and good interpretable photographs, it is essential that the pictures are taken perpendicular to the face of the earth. The technique is relatively simple and cheap.

30|$|Goat {{husbandry}} {{is part of}} {{the portfolio}} of smallholders’ activities. Diversification has also been described in small-scale goat husbandry in northern parts of the country (Mora-Ledesma [2011]). The increasing number of households involved in <b>goat</b> <b>keeping</b> in various villages indicates that there is a growing interest among smallholders. Goat milk has become an important commercial commodity, while crops are mainly used for home consumption and as feed for the goats. Commercial cropping has become a risky activity for smallholders, whereas goat husbandry is relatively more feasible, especially for those having little or no land. As sale of milk gives a regular income, farmers try to optimize their income sources and manage risks through goat husbandry. This shows also farmers’ agency; even among the poor, taking an active role to make their living a sustainable livelihood as they pursue autonomy and self-sufficiency. Goat husbandry seems to support those who argue that smallholders should not disappear, the so-called campesinistas (peasantists) (Kay [2008]).|$|E

Thus, participatory approaches are being promoted for designing community based improvement programs. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the indigenous goat production systems and assess in a participatory manner farmer preferred traits for establishing breeding objectives for indigenous goat breeds in Uganda. 217 farm households representing three goat production systems (combinations of breed and region) were individually interviewed to assess the socio-economic characteristics of the regions and the preferences of the farmers for indigenous goat breeds. The three breed/region combinations were 78 households with the Small East African breed in Arua, 81 with the Mubende breed in Mubende and 58 with the Kigezi breed in Kabale. An index based approach was used to rank farmers' choices of traits considered important for their production systems. Descriptive statistics show that overall the production systems were not significantly different in terms of the nature of the farms and the trait preferences of the farmers. The sale of live animals was considered a primary objective for <b>keeping</b> <b>goats</b> by farmers across all the production systems studied. Adaptation traits (disease resistance, heat tolerance and survival) were considered critical in the farmers' preferred breed.

40|$|Goats {{account for}} about 30 % of Africa's {{ruminant}} livestock and produce about 17 and 12 % of its meat and milk, respectively. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounts for over 60 % of the total goat population in Africa, with an estimated 147 million goats representing about 80 indigenous breeds or strains distributed across all agro-ecological zones and ruminant livestock production systems. Goats are particularly important in marginal agricultural land areas, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, which together hold 64 % of the goat population. At the rural community level, goats {{play a significant role}} in the food chain and overall livelihoods of the poor rural households where they are also largely the property of resource poor women and their children. Indigenous goat breeds/strains are adapted to the diverse local production circumstances and are able to thrive with minimum inputs.

This paper attempts to look at the challenges and opportunities of <b>goat</b> <b>keeping</b> at the household level for the improved welfare of the keepers, using SSA as a representative of other developing sub-regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in bale zone to assess farmer’s selective breeding objectives, trait preferences, selection criteria and breeding system October 2012 to November 2013. A purposive and multistage sampling technique {{was applied for}} selection of 3 district and 9 kebeles. Then 360 households were selected by using simple random sampling techniques after the list of pastoralist having goats was identified. Statistical analysis system version 9. 1 was used for analysis of data. Indices, effective population size and rate of inbreeding were calculated on average each respondent holds about 14 goats. Milk production {{is the main reason}} of <b>goat</b> <b>keeping</b> in the study area. Appearance is the first rank as selection criteria for male and female in all studies area. About 47. 8 % of the respondents have their own buck. The main use of breeding buck in the study area was for mating purpose (76. 2 %). Mean estimate of effective population size and mean rate of inbreeding was 2. 43 and 0. 21, respectively when a household flock is herded alone and under random mating. Therefore, any breed improvement strategies that are intended to be implemented in the study area and else- where should consider the traditional breeding practices and breeding objectives of the community...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{information}} manuals AGRODOKS are {{a series}} of low-priced, simple manuals on agricultural practices in the tropics which are produced by AGROMISA in conjunction with CTA, who finance the translation of the booklets. Agrodok 7, on <b>Goat</b> <b>keeping</b> in the tropics, is designed as a first-aid kit for those who live in isolated places and cannot easily diagnose a disease or have an analysis made of feed quality. The book covers goat breeding; raising and selection; nutrition; housing; health, diseases and parasites; goat products; and administration. A list of helpful literature is included together with useful appendices that deal with units of feed values, an example of how to calculate rations, hoof care, castration of young billy-goats, age estimation, and examples of how to keep a record card on individual goats (male as well as female) and a servicing record. Agrodok 18 deals with Protection of stored grains and pulses; it is a revised edition of the earlier Protection of stored products against insects and fungi. This booklet deals with the problems concerning losses of stored products by storage pests (moulds, insects and rodents), and is meant as a manual for those who are involved with providing information on storage to farmers and cooperatives. Descriptions of the main storage pests are given, together with preventative practices. Special attention is given to the use of natural materials in protecting storage products but there is also information on chemical treatment of stored products against pests. All sections of the books are well illustrated with simple explanatory line drawings. Beekeeping in the tropics (Agrodoc 32), first published in June 1977, was revised for the third time last year. Similarly, The preparation of dairy products, first published in 1985, was also revised last year. <b>Goat</b> <b>keeping</b> in the tropics by Carl Jansen and Kees van den Burg ISBN 9072746 39 2 Protection of stored grains and pulses by Inge de Groot ISBN 9072746 120 4 Beekeeping in the tropics compiled by P Segeren and revised by V Mulder, J Beetsma and R Sommeijer ISBN 90 72746 13 9 The preparation of dairy products by Pauline Ebing and Karin Rutgers revised by Rogier Muller and Matty Weijenberg All four books are also available in French.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze present {{situation}} and establish characteristics of goat farming at Mediterranean part of Turkey. For this aim, 100 goat farmers were surveyed in three geographical areas (North, Middle and West) of Adana district, located Mountainous area of East Mediterranean region of Turkey. In this study, some traits of goat farmers such as education, occupation was determined. Goat production was unique source of family livelihood in this area. Hair goat (Kil) was the most common breed and small population of Kilis and crossbred of Hair x Kilis goats were also raised at the area. It was reported that, whole family took part in goat production; particularly women and daughters were responsible to flock. Goats moved from one area to another from spring to winter. For the greater part of enterprises involved housing in winter (73 %). Daily milk yields of goats were too low. Some herds had higher yield than the others because of <b>keeping</b> <b>goats</b> under semi-intensive systems. These were big scale farms and goats were fed by concentrate together with grazing in winter and summer. Main dairy product was goat cheese. Brucella (34 %), echtyma (54 %), infertility (9 %), foot and mouth disease (23 %) were common diseases in the area. Almost all goats were vaccine (74 %). Average daily milk yield, lactation length and housing period were detected as 0. 591 kg, 4. 43 and 4. 58 months, respectively. Additionally goats were kept in breeding until 6 years old...|$|R
40|$|The {{livestock}} sector plays {{a dynamic}} {{role in the}} economic development of rural areas in Algeria. Due to its adaptation to harsh environments, goat breeding is practiced {{in many areas of}} the country. To the north, it is confined to mountainous areas, but the bulk of the workforce is left in the steppe and semi-desert areas. The goat population in Algeria reached 3. 8 million heads, ranking second after sheep. The present work contributes to a better characterisation of local goat in Kabylie for production and reproduction traits. The study was conducted in the regions of Chemini (Bejaia province) and Bouzeguene (Tizi-Ouzou province). A survey was conducted in 29 herds. The results revealed that the overall mean of goats per households was 6. 69 ± 2. 97. The purposes of <b>keeping</b> <b>goat</b> in Chemini and Bouzguene was private consumption of milk (82. 76 %) and meat (68. 97 %) as well as for commercial exchange (62. 07 %). The Kabyle goat is small (male: 62. 23 cm and female: 58. 41 cm) with long hair. Its ears are drooping, its convex profile has a slightly pronounced nasal split and its coat colour ranges from dark brown to black. However, the crossbreeding with exotic breeds (mainly with Saanen goat), controlled or uncontrolled, increased the frequency of white coat. The average age at puberty in males was 6. 93 ± 1. 04 and 7. 38 ± 0. 94 months in females. The reported age at first kidding and kidding interval were 13. 03 ± 0. 87 months and 7. 83 ± 1. 29 months, respectively. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} farmers’ {{preferences}} for sheep or goats based on feeding practices, animal and flock performances and {{economic benefits of}} sheep and goats in different agro-ecological zones in Central Java, Indonesia. In total, 150 smallholder farmers were selected from three agro-ecological zones: the lowlands, the middle zone, and the uplands. Feeding and performance parameters were estimated through weekly farm visits and farm records, from September 2001 to August 2003. In the lowlands, small ruminants were fed mainly with field grass and crop residues, whereas in the middle zone and uplands feeds fed were mainly field grass and leaves. Sheep were given more opportunities to graze than goats, however, grazing was not a major component in the diets. In the lowlands and the middle zone the differences in feed intakes, ADG and reproductive performances between sheep and goats were small. In all zones, does had significantly larger litters than ewes. In the uplands, goats had a significantly higher DMI, grew slightly faster, and had a higher weaning rate than sheep. Consequently, in the uplands, the total economic benefits from goat flocks were 25 % higher than from sheep flocks. The major differences in agro-ecological conditions that affect the choice for sheep or goats were the availability of cassava peels in the lowlands, favouring a choice for sheep, and the abundance of leaves in the middle zone and uplands, which favours <b>keeping</b> <b>goats.</b> The promotion of goats by the government, the family tradition of <b>keeping</b> sheep or <b>goats,</b> the preference for sacrificing sheep for religious festivities, and the high initial investment needed to buy goat breeding stock could be other important motives to keep sheep or goats. Sheep fattening based on rice bran supplementation could be a feasible innovation in the lowlands. In the middle zone and uplands goat breeding could make a positive contribution to rural livelihood...|$|R
