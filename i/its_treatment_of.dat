5|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections to the content of the novel, particularly <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> military conflict.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> freaks.|$|E

5|$|In July 1999, a {{discrimination}} {{lawsuit was}} filed against Cracker Barrel {{by a group}} of former employees, who claimed that the company had discriminated against them on the grounds of race.

5|$|The 1895 {{dispute between}} the United States and Britain over Venezuela was peacefully {{resolved}} through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. President William McKinley supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. The main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> Ireland.|$|E

5|$|In September 1973, he {{returned}} to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore should not be at the conference. At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's {{close relationship with the}} U.S. and <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> Palestinians during the Israel–Palestine conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally. As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian territory from Israeli incursions. Leaving Algiers, Castro visited Iraq and North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere {{from the}} idea of a teenager's coming out after hearing that his friend's son had come out to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to teenagers in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{artists in}} the later eighteenth century were {{strongly}} influenced by the Enlightenment, which stressed rationalism and human inquiry, of which Scotland was a major centre of influence. Artists like Alan Ramsey formed The Select Society, with philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and produced his Dialogue on Taste, which made a major contribution {{to the study of}} aesthetics. Scotland also played a major part in the origins of the Romantic movement through the publication of James Macpherson's Ossian cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing Herder and Goethe.|$|E
5|$|Although Scotland {{increasingly}} {{adopted the}} English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct {{national identity and}} began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the ancient legend did more than any single work {{to bring about the}} Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing Herder and Goethe. Eventually {{it became clear that the}} poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.|$|E
5|$|Both Idea and Adonis {{were created}} using Master Cages as weapons during the conflict, {{though they were}} only awakened in the present. Only Adonis fully awoke while Idea {{suffered}} an incomplete awakening when found by Pharzuph Division 7 and regressed to a childlike amnesiac state. In addition, Master Laban has been using Pharzuph Division 7 {{to gain access to}} the Master Cages so he could stop Adonis and continue the use of Soma energy by destroying the Arethia consciousness. Welt, a new member of Pharzuph Division 7, is contacted by Orpheus, the avatar of the Arethia's true will. Orpheus asks Pharzuph Division 7 through Welt to stop both Laban and Adonis, the latter wishing to bring destruction upon mankind for <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the Arethia. Upon confronting Adonis after traveling to the Soma Ring via the Ring Tower, Pharzuph Division 7 defeat the incarnation of the deranged Arethia energies: with Welt's help, Adonis, Idea, and Orpheus stabilize the Soma flow and pacify the Visitors. Welt is returned to his comrades, but Orpheus, Adonis, and Idea must leave to merge with the Arethia along with the Visitor energies.|$|E

5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was unusual in the depth and breadth of <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E
5|$|The main {{documentary}} {{source for}} the kings of the Crovan dynasty is the Chronicle of Mann, the only contemporary indigenous narrative-source concerning these men. The source itself survives {{in the form of}} a fourteenth-century Latin manuscript, which is in turn a copy of a chronicle probably first commissioned and composed during the reign of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1265). About fifteen percent of the chronicle is devoted to the strife between the half-brothers, and much of the rest of this source deals with the after-effects of the conflict. Although the chronicle's account of the half-brothers' struggle appears to be somewhat neutral, <b>its</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> their descendants is clearly slanted in favour of Óláfr's sons. In fact, it was only during the reign of Óláfr's son Magnús, that the former's sons finally overcame Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's descendants once and for all. The chronicle, therefore, may have been composed to further legitimise king's descended from Óláfr. In consequence, even the chronicle's claim that Óláfr's father had chosen him as his successor may be suspect. Whatever the case, the chronicle is the main historical {{source for the}} life of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson.|$|E
