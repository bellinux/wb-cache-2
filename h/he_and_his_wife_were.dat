5|$|Despite their {{relationship}} having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pitești's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen {{as sources of}} inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche (completed in 1928). Some have noted that Bogdan-Pitești has {{a lot in common}} with {{at least one of the}} three protagonists. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> both characters in Ion Vinea's novels Venin de mai ("May Venom") and Lunatecii ("The Lunatics")—Alexandru as Adam Gună, Domnica as wife Iada Gună. Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and show them promoting vice as virtue. This lifestyle has taken its toll on Adam Gună, who is a physical ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality. Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pitești was abusing drugs, and that Domnica was originally a prostitute.|$|E

5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, he said that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was {{to put an end}} to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1959 Dominique Mbonyumutwa, {{one of the}} few Hutu sub-chiefs and a PARMEHUTU activist, was {{attacked}} after attending mass with his wife at a church close to his home in Byimana, Gitarama Province. The attackers were nine members of UNAR's youth wing, exacting retribution for Mbonyumutwa's refusal to sign a UNAR protest letter, condemning the Belgian removal of the three Tutsi chiefs. The attackers initially engaged Mbonyumutwa in conversation regarding his increasing influence as a sub-chief, before punching him. Mbonyumutwa fought off the attackers and both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> able to return safely home, but rumours began to spread that he had been killed; according to American theology professor James Jay Carney, Mbonyumutwa may have started the rumours himself.|$|E

5|$|Playing with Fire {{became the}} top seller on Amazon.ca {{within a week}} of its release, and Fleury stated that he had been {{contacted}} by several sexual abuse victims who were motivated by his book to seek help. He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James, and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims. Fleury was surprised that his story became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> unable {{to keep up with the}} mail they were receiving. It is the second book about Fleury's life, following Fury, released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver {{as a threat to the}} conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E
5|$|Henry Peake (1821–1886) was occupying Westholme by 1885. Peake was a {{solicitor}} {{who served}} as clerk to the county magistrates, and was {{a partner in the}} local law firm Peake, Snow and Peake, along with his son Henry Arthur Peake. The partnership had connections with Kirk and Parry, and Peake married Eliza, a daughter of Charles Kirk the elder. After his death, Peake's sons, George Herbert and Henry Arthur, successively occupied the house in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the First World War, Henry Arthur and his wife, Alice Ann, lost three of their sons in battle. In 1923, Henry Arthur died while staying at Hastings. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> planning to sell Westholme and move to Guildford before his death; she did so and died there in 1933. The businessman and Liberal politician Samuel Pattinson (1870–1942) lived at the house from at least 1924. His wife, Betsy Sharpley Pattinson, also died in 1942 and their trustees auctioned off the furniture at Westholme two years later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Kim's work {{began to be}} rediscovered by South Korean cult film fans who {{discussed}} his films through the Internet and exchanged hard-to-find copies by videotape. Noticing this growing domestic Kim Ki-young cult, the Dongsung Cinematheque, an art-house theater in Seoul, programmed a retrospective showing of Kim's films. With his profile again high in Korean film society, Kim's work began to attract international attention. Five of his films were screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1996. When Kim Ki-young's career was highlighted at the second Pusan International Film Festival in 1997, his work found enthusiastic new audiences in the international film community. The strongly positive reception of Kim's work by international audiences surprised the festival organizers, who immediately began receiving requests for overseas retrospectives of Kim's career. With this renewed interest, Kim began work on a comeback film to be titled Diabolical Woman. The Berlin International Film Festival invited him to attend a showing of his films in 1998. Before Kim started work on the film or attended the festival, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> killed in a house fire caused by an electrical short circuit on February 5, 1998.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland's season started against Tottenham Hotspur on 11 August 2007. Sunderland won {{the game}} through a last minute goal from Michael Chopra {{in front of an}} {{attendance}} of 43,967. Their second game of the season was an away fixture to Birmingham City, a Paul McShane own goal had put Sunderland behind in the 28th minute, but Michael Chopra scored his second goal of the season to equalise. Birmingham took the lead again through Garry O'Connor but Sunderland scored another last minute goal, this time from Stern John to save a point. On 24 August ex Manchester United and Newcastle United striker Andy Cole joined the club on a free transfer from Portsmouth. Sunderland travelled to the JJB Stadium unbeaten on 18 August but lost 3–0 to Wigan Athletic. On 25 September Liverpool beat Sunderland 2–0 to give them their second consecutive defeat. On the same day, Tobias Hysén returned to his native Sweden with IFK Göteborg after <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>were</b> suffering from home sickness. Luton Town produced a league cup shock as they beat Sunderland 3–0 at Kenilworth Road. Sunderland signed three more players before the transfer deadline; Ian Harte from Levante on a free transfer, Danny Higginbotham from Stoke City for £3 million, and Kenwyne Jones from Southampton for £6 million with Stern John going in the opposite direction.|$|E
