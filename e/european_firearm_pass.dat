"The <b>European</b> <b>firearms</b> <b>pass</b> {{functions}} in a satisfactory {{way on the}} whole and {{should be regarded as}} the main document needed by hunters and marksmen for the possession of a firearm during a journey to another Member State.

5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Firearms</b> <b>Pass</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the <b>European</b> <b>Firearms</b> Directive of 1991. The amending directive 2008/51/EC was approved in May 2008 and member states' laws had to comply with it by 28 July 2010.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Directive No. 91/477/EC {{was adopted}} in 1991 on {{the background of}} abolition of intra-Community frontiers. It aimed at partial approximation of national legislation that would prevent <b>passing</b> possession of <b>firearms</b> from one Member State to another, unless it is done according to rules established by the Directive. At the same time, the Directive introduced <b>European</b> <b>Firearms</b> <b>Pass</b> that would allow hunters and target shooter to move between the Member States without unnecessary impediments. Generally, a person with valid <b>European</b> <b>Firearms</b> <b>Pass</b> traveling to or through other Member States may be in possession {{of one or more}} firearms during that journey, provided that they are in possession of a <b>European</b> <b>firearms</b> <b>pass</b> listing such <b>firearm</b> or firearms and provided that they are able to substantiate the reasons for their journey, in particular by producing an invitation. That, however, does not apply to a journey through Member States that have more stringent laws and generally prohibit such firearms within their territory.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Firearms</b> <b>Pass</b> (EFP) is a locally-issued {{firearms}} licence in {{a common}} format that allows citizens of the European Union (EU) to travel {{with one or more}} firearm(s) mentioned on the licence from one member state to another. For certain purposes other documentation may be required, depending on the current states' laws and the reason for the movement; a transfer may be temporary (for a competition) or permanent (on a sale). An applicant for an EFP must already hold a licence from the member state in which he/she holds the firearm.|$|R
40|$|To {{comply with}} Belgian and EU {{firearms}} legislation, RA obtained a Belgian weapon license Model 4 (Nr. 4 / 200014 / 15 / 15013010) {{to operate a}} firearm for scientific purposes and a <b>European</b> <b>Firearms</b> <b>Pass</b> (Nr. 20 / 21 / 15 / 14045), both from the Office of the Governor of the Province of Flemish Brabant. Alien invasive species can affect large areas, often with wide-ranging impacts on ecosystem structure, function and services. Prunus serotina is a widespread invader of European temperate forests, where it tends to form homogeneous stands and limits recruitment of indigenous trees. We hypotesized that invasion by P. serotina would {{be reflected in the}} nutrient contents of the native species’ leaves and in the respiration of invaded plots as efficient resource uptake and changes in nutrient cycling by P. serotina probably underly its aggressive invasiveness. We combined data from 48 field plots in the forest of Compiègne, France, and data from an experiment using 96 microcosms derived from those field plots. We used general linear models to separate effects of invasion by P. serotina on heterotrophic soil and litter respiration rates and on canopy foliar nutrient content from effects of soil chemical properties, litter quantity, litter species composition and tree species composition. In invaded stands, average respiration rates were 5. 6 % higher for soil (without litter) and 32 % higher for soil and litter combined. Compared to indigenous tree species, P. serotina exhibited higher foliar N (+ 24. 0 %), foliar P (+ 50. 7 %) and lower foliar C:N (− 22. 4 %) and N:P (− 10. 1 %) ratios. Prunus serotina affected foliar nutrient contents of co-occuring indigenous tree species leading to decreased foliar N (− 8. 7 %) and increased C:N ratio (+ 9. 5 %) in Fagus sylvatica, decreased foliar N:P ratio in Carpinus betulus (− 13. 5 %) and F. sylvatica (− 11. 8 %), and increased foliar P in Pinus sylvestris (+ 12. 3 %) in invaded vs. uninvaded stands. Our results suggest that P. serotina is changing nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon cycles to its own advantage, hereby increasing carbon turnover via labile litter, affecting the relative nutrient contents in the overstory leaves, and potentially altering the photosynthetic capacity of the long-lived indigenous broadleaved species. Uncontrolled invasion of European temperate forests by P. serotina may affect the climate change mitigation potential of these forests in the long term, through additive effects on local nutrient cycles. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Accession to EU {{required}} {{a new law}} compliant with the <b>European</b> <b>Firearms</b> Directive, which was passed in 2002. The law significantly liberalized gun ownership, for example by allowing any legal weapon to be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which look like automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.|$|R
50|$|The new {{enactment}} of 1995, after the Velvet Revolution, meant {{a return to}} the more liberal times of the First Czechoslovak Republic.

The law remained liberal despite introducing more EU required regulation.|$|R
50|$|Tanegashima {{is known}} in Japanese history for the {{introduction}} of <b>European</b> <b>firearms</b> to Japan. Around 1543, a Chinese junk with Portuguese merchants on board was driven to Tanegashima. Tanegashima Tokitaka succeeded in reproducing matchlock rifles obtained from the Portuguese. Within a few decades, firearms, then known as tanegashima, were spread across Sengoku Japan.|$|R

50|$|A {{range of}} weapons {{were used in}} Oceania. These {{included}} the woomera and boomerang in Australia, and the bow {{in some parts of}} Melanesia and Polynesia. Nearly all Oceanic peoples had spears and clubs, although the Māori of New Zealand were unusual in having no distance weapons. Weapons could be very simple or elaborately crafted, with distance weapons in particular requiring a great deal of craftsmanship to be accurate. It has been estimated that Aboriginal spears were more accurate than nineteenth-century <b>European</b> <b>firearms.</b>|$|R

Nevertheless, no types of firearms are outright banned, and in principle a person can apply for a licence for any type of gun.|$|R
50|$|During the Japanese invasions in the 1590s, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, {{plotting}} {{the conquest}} of Ming China with Portuguese guns, invaded Korea with his daimyōs and their troops, intending to use Korea as a stepping stone. Factional division in the Joseon court, inability to assess Japanese military capability, and failed attempts at diplomacy led to poor preparation on Joseon's part. The use of <b>European</b> <b>firearms</b> by the Japanese left most of {{the southern part of}} the Korean Peninsula occupied within months, with both Hanseong (present-day Seoul) and Pyongyang captured.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} Ottoman {{firearms}} were considered by 17th-century Chinese writers {{to be superior}} to <b>European</b> <b>firearms</b> demonstrates that the Ottoman Empire {{was at least a}} second tier producer of muskets during this period. However, some claim that the 'European' firearms the Chinese researcher tested were actually Japanese arquebuses based on fifty-year-old Portuguese models. The design of the Ottoman matchlock is substantially {{different from that of the}} European variety and it in turn influenced the matchlocks produced in both Safavid Persia and Mughal India.|$|R
25|$|The army's war {{strategy}} and fighting tactics generally remained fairly constant throughout the imperial era. The infantry battalions, {{supported by the}} cavalry and elephantry, engaged the enemy in the open battlefield. The arrival of <b>European</b> <b>firearms</b> {{did not lead to}} any major changes in battle techniques or transform traditional ideas of combat. Rather, the new weapons were used to reinforce traditional ways of fighting with the dominant weaponry still the war elephants, pikes, swords and spears. In contrast to European-style drill and tactical co-ordination, Burmese field forces generally fought in small groups under individual leaders.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} view among 20th century {{anthropologists and}} historians of the fur trade posits that the Western Woods Cree and the Plains Cree (and therefore their dialects) did not diverge from other Cree peoples before 1670, when the Cree expanded {{out of their}} homeland near James Bay because of access to <b>European</b> <b>firearms.</b> By contrast, James Smith of the Museum of the American Indian stated, in 1987, that the weight of archeological and linguistic evidence puts the Cree as far west as the Peace River Region of Alberta before European contact.|$|R
50|$|Firearms were {{introduced}} to Japan in the 13th century by the Chinese, but saw little use. <b>European</b> <b>firearms</b> {{were introduced}} in 1543, and intense development followed, with strong local manufacture {{during the period of}} conflicts of the late 16th century. Japan then almost completely abandoned the further development and military use of firearms during a period of seclusion known as sakoku. The usage of firearms in Japan would start again after 1854 with the resumption of contacts with the West and the accumulation of conflicts from that period.|$|R
