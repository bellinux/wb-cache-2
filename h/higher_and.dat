5|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept is}} that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was <b>higher,</b> <b>and</b> then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E

At its northernmost extent, the unconformity in fact removed all of the Pahrump, and the Noonday rests directly on the Proterozoic Complex. An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being <b>higher</b> (<b>and</b> thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.|$|E

5|$|Dale Russell {{hypothesized}} that the more lightly built and more common Gorgosaurus may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the time, while the more robust and less common Daspletosaurus may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, {{which may have been}} more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The <b>higher</b> <b>and</b> broader muzzles of tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus are mechanically stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like Gorgosaurus, although tooth strengths are similar between the two groups. This may indicate a difference in feeding mechanics or diet.|$|E

They may also contain levels of vitamins many times <b>higher,</b> <b>and</b> in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} an empirical model for daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily lows of US stock indexes {{based on the}} intuition that <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows do not drift apart over time. Our empirical results show that daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows of three main US stock price indexes are cointegrated. Data on openings, closings, and trading volume are found to offer incremental explanatory power for variations in <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows within the VECM framework. With all these variables, the augmented VECM models explain 40 – 50 % of variations in daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows. The generalized impulse response analysis shows that the responses of daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily lows to the shocks depend on whether data on openings, closings, and trading volume {{are included in the}} analysis.

5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the breed to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the declining population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the breed. By the 1990s, population numbers were <b>higher,</b> <b>and</b> genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations still consider the breed to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} of munitions {{was a central}} feature of the war, and with {{a third of the}} men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily. Trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, cutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. Membership increased by 692% from 4.1 million in 1914, to 28.3 million by 1920. 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) In 1914, rising to 77% in 1920.
