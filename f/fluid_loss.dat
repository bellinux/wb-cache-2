40|$|Each year exercise-induced {{heat stroke}} {{is a leading}} cause of death among high school and college athletes. Numerous studies state that each year {{decreased}} athletic performance, severe health problems and even death {{can be traced back to}} dehydration. Previous hydration research and recommendations have been based on exercise in hot, humid, outdoor environments. Studies suggest great caution is merited under hot, humid conditions in response to the resulting increase in water losses, but little is known about the contrasting dry, indoor environment, therefore few recommendations exist. This study proposes assessing <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> of Division III track athletes during indoor and outdoor seasons to quantify relative water losses in each environment. This 111 study hypothesizes humid weather and dry weather will manifest similar <b>fluid</b> <b>losses,</b> due to the nature of their water draining properties. Monitoring body weight before and after exercise allows athletes to easily monitor individual sweat rates and fluid needs. This study aims to quantify <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> of athletes during both seasons and compare them. The purpose is to learn more about <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> in a controlled, dry environment. Hydration is essential in all sports, and failure to maintain hydration can be fatal for athletes of all shapes and sizes. v...|$|R

40|$|Intake of {{food and}} drink during {{exercise}} can be effective in enhancing performance, {{in so far as}} it prevents or ameliorates exercise-induced changes to body homeostasis. <b>Loss</b> of body <b>fluids</b> containing water and electrolytes during exercise is mostly by sweating. Sweat rates during a sporting event or activity will vary according to a number of factors, including the size of the athlete and his or her degree of acclimatization, the intensity of exercise, environmental conditions and the clothing worn. The mismatch of fluid intake and <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> may lead to a body water deficit. It has generally been considered that decreases in performance become apparent when hypo-hydration exceeds 2 % of body weight; that performance decrements become substantial when <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> exceed 5 % of body weight; and that when <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> approach 6 - 10 % of body weight, heat stroke and heat exhaustion become life-threatening. Hypohydration also affects mental functioning. Therefore, the effect of hypohydration on real-life sport may be greater than that shown in laboratory studies of physiological performance...|$|R

25|$|Openhole {{completions}} (in {{comparison with}} cemented pipe) require {{better understanding of}} formation damage, wellbore clean-up and <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> control.

40|$|Plasma {{volume is}} {{frequently}} well maintained by oncotic forces {{even in the}} presence of significant extracellular and intracel-lular <b>fluid</b> <b>losses.</b> Intracellular <b>fluid</b> depletion develops rela-tively slowly and can lead to significant total body fluid deple-tion.

There are a number of situations in which such intracellular volume depletion can arise, including dehydration, <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> from vomiting and diarrhoea, excessive sweating (particularly with pyrexia) etc. Drug therapy, notably with diuretics or ACE in-hibitors can also create this situation.

25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal system.

The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (hematuria).|$|E
25|$|Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the {{condition}} of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day.

25|$|This is characterised by a {{physical}} obstruction of the intestine, {{which can be}} due to impacted food material, stricture formation, or foreign bodies.

The first problem with this degree of <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> from circulation is one of decreased plasma volume, leading to a reduced cardiac output, and acid-base disturbances.|$|E

25|$|The {{human body}} {{contains}} from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size. To function properly, the body requires {{between one and}} seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends {{on the level of}} activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though most specialists agree that approximately 2 liters (6 to 7 glasses) of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> from exercise or warm weather.|$|E
25|$|Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD), {{also known as}} Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other {{primates}} caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. The disease has {{a high risk of}} death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected, with an average of about 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from <b>fluid</b> <b>loss,</b> and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{diabetes}} is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs {{are twice as}} likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are also more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles. The symptoms may relate to <b>fluid</b> <b>loss</b> and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{practice}} guidelines of the American Burn Association on burn shock resuscitation, intravenous (IV) fluid therapy is the standard of care for the replacement of <b>fluid</b> and electrolyte <b>losses</b> in burn injury of ≥ 20 % of the total body surface area. However, in mass burn casualties, IV fluid resuscitation may be delayed or unavailable. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which {{has been shown to}} be highly effective in the treatment of dehydration in epidemics of cholera, could be an alternate way to replace <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> in burns. A prospective case series of three patients was carried out as an initial step to establish whether oral Ceralyte® 90 could replace <b>fluid</b> <b>losses</b> requiring IV <b>fluid</b> therapy in thermal injury. The requirement of the continuing IV fluid therapy was reduced by an average of 58 % in the first 24 hours after the injury (range 37 - 78 %). ORT may be a feasible alternative to IV fluid therapy in the resuscitation of burns. It could also potentially save many lives in mass casualty situations or in resource-poor settings where IV fluid therapy is not immediately available. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of this treatment and to determine whether the present formulations of ORT for cholera need modification...|$|R
