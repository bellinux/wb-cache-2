5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations {{between him and his}} aides. The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes <b>for</b> <b>impeachment.</b> On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E

In 1974 {{she was a member of}} the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal. Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum, Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards <b>for</b> <b>impeachment.</b> The committee's work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.|$|E
5|$|Following these decisions, the General Assembly {{attempted}} {{to remove all}} three justices from their positions, but lacked the two-thirds majority required <b>for</b> <b>impeachment.</b> The Assembly then {{attempted to}} abolish the Court of Appeals and create a new one, beginning the Old Court-New Court controversy. The members of the existing court – Owsley, John Boyle, and Benjamin Mills – continued functioning in that role, while a new court of four pro-relief justices was organized by the legislature. For a time, both courts {{claimed to be the}} court of last resort in Kentucky, but by 1826, supporters of the Old Court won control of the legislature and abolished the New Court.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried <b>for</b> <b>Impeachment</b> for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Montana held a {{constitutional}} convention to update and revise its state constitution. Under the new constitution, District Courts now had jurisdiction only over criminal felonies, while criminal misdemeanors were handled by City Courts, Justice of the Peace Courts, and Municipal Courts. No longer was the legislature required to establish inferior courts only in incorporated cities or towns, and the District Courts {{were required to}} hear appeals de novo. The new constitution also authorized the legislature {{to establish a right}} to appeal the decisions of state agencies directly to district courts. Impeachment powers were changed as well. Now the Montana Senate and the Montana House of Representatives jointly vested with impeachment powers. The entire legislature could now specify the criteria <b>for</b> <b>impeachment,</b> establish whatever tribunal it wished, and provide for the procedures <b>for</b> <b>impeachment.</b>|$|E

25|$|The author {{provides}} an overview of actions taken by Trump before his presidency that could also lead to his downfall, including possible violations of the Fair Housing Act, the operations of Trump University, and donations or lack thereof related to the Donald J.

With regard to the Foreign Emoluments Clause, the author outlines for the reader the basis <b>for</b> <b>impeachment</b> with discussion of Trump and Trump family debt, trademark negotiations with China, and financial transactions in the Philippines, arguing these obligations could allow foreign powers control over the Trump Administration. In a proposal that the author acknowledges is unlikely, he submits the International Criminal Court could potentially prosecute the president for crimes against humanity related to reneging on agreements to combat climate change. Legally this would not have significant standing on its own <b>for</b> <b>impeachment</b> in the U.S. however, the author suggests that it could provide the moral impetus for legislators to take further actions instead.|$|E
