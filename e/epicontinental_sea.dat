25|$|The Cesar-Ranchería Basin is {{underlain}} by Neoproterozoic basement. The Sierra Nevada Metamorphic Belt {{was formed}} during the Grenville orogeny, when the supercontinent Rodinia was formed {{due to the}} collision of Amazonia, Baltica and Laurentia. The granulites and gneisses of the complex have been dated to 1.5 to 1.0 Ga. The phyllites and quartzites of the Perijá Formation were formed during the Early Paleozoic and {{are related to the}} Caledonian orogeny. The shales of the Río Cachirí Group were deposited in the Devonian and contain abundant fossils of brachiopods, bryozoa, corals and crinoids. The formation is time-equivalent with the fossiliferous Floresta and Cuche Formations of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. The sediments were deposited in an <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea</b> {{at the edge of the}} Paleo-Tethys Ocean, the last remnant of the Rheic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Thus, direct {{competition}} for food between bony-toothed birds and cetaceans or pinnipeds cannot have been very severe. As both the birds and pinnipeds would need level ground near the sea to raise their young, {{competition for}} breeding grounds may have affected the birds' population. In that respect, the specializations for dynamic soaring restricted the number of possible nesting sites for the birds, {{but on the other}} hand upland on islands or in coastal ranges could have provided breeding grounds for Pelagornithidae that was inaccessible for pinnipeds; just as many albatrosses today nest in the uplands of islands (e.g. the Galápagos or Torishima). The bony-toothed birds probably required strong updrafts for takeoff and would have preferred higher sites anyway for this reason, rendering competition with pinniped rookeries quite minimal. As regards breeding grounds, giant eggshell fragments from the Famara mountains on Lanzarote, Canary Islands, were tentatively attributed to Late Miocene pseudotooth birds. As regards the Ypresian London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey, wherein pelagornithid fossils are not infrequently found, it was deposited in a shallow <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea</b> during a very hot time with high sea levels. The presumed breeding sites cannot have been as far offshore as many seabird rookeries are today, as the region was hemmed in between the Alps and the Grampian and Scandinavian Mountains, in a sea less wide than the Caribbean is today. Neogene pseudotooth birds are common along the America coasts near the Appalachian and Cordilleran mountains, and these species thus presumably also bred not far offshore or even in the mountains themselves. In that respect the presence of medullary bone in the specimens from Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina, United States, is notable, as among birds this is generally only found in laying females, indicating that the breeding grounds were probably not far away. At least Pacific islands of volcanic origin would be eroded away in the last millions of years however, obliterating any remains of pelagornithid breeding colonies that might have once existed in the open ocean. Necker Island for example was of significant size 10 million years ago, when Osteodontornis roamed the Pacific.|$|E

50|$|Starting in the Paleozoic Era the supercontinent Pannotia {{began to}} break up, forming smaller continents {{including}} Laurentia (North America and Greenland), Gondwana, Baltica, and Siberia. At the same time sea levels were rising, {{which resulted in the}} flooding of most of the continents with shallow <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas.</b> This was followed by three periods of extensive orogeny.|$|R
50|$|Chirotherium trackways {{have been}} found in German {{sandstones}} that were likely deposited on flood plains. During the Middle Triassic, much of Central Europe was covered by a shallow <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea</b> (the so-called Muschelkalk Sea). In one location, Chirotherium trackways were found alongside those of early horseshoe crabs. The horseshoe crabs were likely breeding along the intertidal zone while the Chirotherium trackmaker preyed on them during low tide. Smaller reptiles like Macrocnemus, represented by the ichnogenus Rhynchosauroides, likely fed on the horseshoe crabs’ eggs.|$|E
50|$|An inland sea (also {{known as}} an epeiric sea or an <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea)</b> is a shallow sea that covers central areas of continents during periods of high sea level that result in marine transgressions. In modern times, continents stand high, {{eustatic}} sea levels are low, and there are few inland seas, none larger than the Caspian Sea. Modern examples might also include the recently (less than 10,000 years ago) reflooded Persian Gulf, and the South China Sea that presently covers the Sunda Shelf.|$|E
50|$|A shallow <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea,</b> {{normally}} {{less than}} 100m deep, {{spread over the}} British area during this period. Britain at this time lay between 30° and 40° north of the equator. However, the Pennines, along with parts of Wales and Scotland were probably above sea level {{for most of the}} time. During the early and middle Jurassic an area of uplift around Market Weighton affected the way that sediments were deposited causing thinner bands of Jurassic rocks to be formed immediately north and south of the uplifted block.|$|E
50|$|Endocerids {{may have}} been the superpredators of the Ordovician, {{probably}} living close to the sea floor, and preying on trilobites, molluscs, brachiopods and other bottom-dwelling organisms. They were probably not active nektonic swimmers, but rather crawled over the floor of <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> or lay there in ambush. They probably filled a different ecological niche than that filled by such as sharks and squid today.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{a global}} {{greenhouse}} interval {{is a distinct}} or distant future, {{it is important to}} understand the dynamics of a greenhouse system.

The stratification and circulation of these <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> are open to debate, because there are no Recent analogs. The carbon and oxygen stable isotope record of fossil molluscan shell from <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> has the potential to reveal their stratification and seasonal cycles. As a study sample, mollusks from the Baculites compressus and Baculites cuneatus biozones of the Western Interior Seaway of North America were collected from three locations: Kremmling, Colorado; Trask Ranch, South Dakota; Game Ranch, South Dakota. These fossils date to the Campanian (Late Cretaceous). Taxa include ammonites, bivalves, gastropods, and nautiloids. The first part of this investigation, described in Chapter 2, investigates the degree of alteration in these specimens. Elevated concentrations of minor elements such as magnesium and strontium reveal alteration from the original aragonite and/or calcite skeletons. Concentrations of these elements obtained by ICP-OES analysis are compared within several suites of specimens: mode of preservation, shell testing location, shell color, cementation, appearance under light microscope, and appearance under scanning electron microscope. Each of these suites tests a hypothesis about optimal shell preservation. Shell was found to be preserved best in shale rather than concretions, ammonite phragmacone rather than septa, opalescent specimens rather that nonopalescent ones, and uncemented shells rather than cemented shells, especially those with second-order versus first-order cement. Salinity and temperature values were derived for the organisms in the Western Interior Seaway: while bivalves produced unusually low temperatures, the others were reasonable for an inland sea. The second part of this study, described in Chapter 3, examines the isotopic record within exemplary mollusk shells, taken perpendicular to growth lines. The data for this investigation in sclerochronology documents the dominant isotopically enigmatic bottom-water habitat of the Inoceramus, the geochemical signature of the overlying water mass inhabited by Baculites, and short-term migrations between the two water masses in the nautiloid Eutrephoceras...|$|R
50|$|Ecologically, goniatites {{were limited}} to environments of normal-marine salinity—as {{appears to be the}} case for all {{cephalopods}} throughout their history. Goniatites are much more abundant and speciose in sediments that represent called <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> than they are in those that represent the open ocean. Within these inland seas, goniatites' greatest abundance and diversity appears to have been achieved in deeper offshore and basinal environments rather than in nearshore environments. Known nearshore (e.g., lagoonal) occurrences have generally been ascribed to wash-in of shells from offshore waters.|$|R
50|$|As glaciers grew, the {{sea level}} dropped, {{and the vast}} shallow intra-continental Ordovician seas withdrew, which {{eliminated}} many ecological niches. When they returned, they carried diminished founder populations that lacked many whole families of organisms. They then withdrew again with the next pulse of glaciation, eliminating biological diversity with each change. Species limited to a single <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea</b> on a given landmass were severely affected. Tropical lifeforms were hit particularly hard in {{the first wave of}} extinction, while cool-water species were hit worst in the second pulse.|$|E

50|$|The Hangenberg {{event is}} a bioevent that {{occurred}} {{at the end of}} the Famennian epoch (late Devonian) associated with the Late Devonian extinction (roughly 358.9 ± 0.4 million years ago); it was an anoxic event marked by a black shale. It has been proposed that this was related to a rapid sea-level fall due to the last phase of the Devonian Southern Hemisphere glaciation. It has also been suggested that it was linked to an increase in terrestrial plant cover, leading to increased nutrient supply in rivers. This may have led to eutrophication of semi-restricted <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> and could have stimulated algal blooms.|$|R
5000|$|Pelagosaurus (meaning [...] "lizard of {{the open}} sea") is an extinct genus of thalattosuchian crocodyliform that lived during the Toarcian stage of the Lower Jurassic, around 183 Ma to 175 Ma (million years ago), in shallow <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> that covered {{much of what is}} now Western Europe. The {{systematic}} taxonomy of Pelagosaurus has been fiercely disputed over the years, and was assigned to Thalattosuchia after its systematics within Teleosauridae were disputed.

50|$|The {{basement}} {{rocks are}} mainly gneisses, mica schists and granitoids with occasional outcrops of amphibolites and serpentinites. The sedimentary succession of the Aquitanian Basin {{starts with a}} transgression in the Lower Jurassic (Lias) over the basement rocks (usually a conglomerate at the base, followed by arkoses, dolostones and shales). During the Dogger a calcareous reef built from ooids developed. During the Malm dense, micritic limestones were deposited. Afterwards the sea retreated to come back again {{at the onset of}} the Cenomanian (Upper Cretaceous). A very warm <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea</b> chalky sediments were laid down right up to the Maastrichtian. At the end of the Cretaceous the sea finally retreated and the sediments of the Aquitanian Basin started to become continental within the area of the park.|$|E
50|$|The late Middle Jurassic lagerstätte at La Voulte-sur-Rhône, in the Ardèche {{region of}} southwestern France, offers paleontologists an {{outstanding}} {{view of an}} undisturbed paleoecosystem that was preserved in fine detail as organisms died at the site and settled {{to the bottom of}} a shallow <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea,</b> with a folded floor that in places exceeded 200 m at this site. The site preserves a marine system of the Lower Callovian stage, a little over 160 mya. The sequence is exposed in a series of quarries at La Boissine, west of the village of La Voulte-sur-Rhône. Iron pyrites in the silty shale are symptoms of an anoxic environment. The site was recognized among French paleontologists from the mid-nineteenth century for its finely detailed fossils.|$|E
5000|$|Ausia may {{represent}} ascidians (sea squirts), an invertebrate group {{related to the}} chordates. Results of a new study of a Burykhia from Russia have shown a possible affinity of these organisms to the ascidians, which are urochordates. The Russian species is more than 90 mm across, and the rows of oval depressions are separated by structures which were probably grooves in the internal wall surface of the living organism. The study's authors interpret these fossils as the internal sand casts of a vast bag-like cavity, possibly a pharynx or branchial basket. The animals represented by these two genera were thought {{to live in the}} shallow waters of an <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea,</b> slightly more than 555-548 million years ago, and the authors feel this is probably the oldest evidence of the chordate lineage of metazoans.|$|E
40|$|A {{gastropod}} fauna {{has been}} studied from upper Pliensbachian – upper Toarcian deposits of two sections of the Causses Basin (southern France) in order to investigate the mode of recovery after the early Toarcian anoxic event. The fauna consists of 15 species, {{one of which is}} new (Bathrotomaria kronzwilmesorum sp. nov.). Their stratigraphical distribution shows two peaks of diversity – in the Bifrons Zone (Bifrons Subzone) and in the Aalensis Zone (Mactra Subzone) – which reflect brief times during which the oxygen content and bottom consistency favoured the settlement of a relatively diversified fauna. In the Variabilis–Pseudoradiosa zones, gastropods are only represented by two species. This probably indicates more severe and unstable environmental conditions, only allowing the survival of gastropod taxa with wide adaptive capacities. The very low species diversity and the discontinuous and slow faunal recovery were probably determined by physiographic factors. The Causses area was a small basin confined by exposed lands and open towards the central part of western Tethys. Gastropods described here occur exclusively in the Toarcian – early Aalenian communities of the European <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas,</b> whereas species from the central region of western Tethys are absent. Geographic isolation and marginal location of the Causses Basin restricted faunal exchange with the western European <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas,</b> preventing fast recovery after the anoxic event. Gastropods of the central region of the western Tethys were probably unable to settle and colonize that area due to the strongly different environment...|$|R
50|$|During interglacials, such as {{the present}} one, the climate warms and the tundra recedes polewards {{following}} the ice sheets. Forests return to areas that once supported tundra vegetation. Interglacials are identified on land or in shallow <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> by their paleontology. Floral and faunal remains of species pointing to temperate climate and indicating a specific age are used to identify particular interglacials. Commonly used are mammalian and molluscan species, pollen and plant macro-remains (seeds and fruits). However, many other fossil remains may be helpful: insects, ostracods, foraminifera, diatoms, etc. Recently, ice cores and ocean sediment cores provide more quantitative and accurately dated evidence for temperatures and total ice volumes.|$|R
25|$|A global drop in {{sea level}} {{at the end}} of the Devonian {{reversed}} early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period.|$|R
50|$|Through the Triassic period, the Colorado Plateau {{in which}} the Moenkopi resides was covered {{sometimes}} by the <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea</b> that both eroded and deposited rock fragments, including those of other major geologic formations. Named by Gilluly and Reeside in 1928, the Sinbad unit stands out in a siliceous clastic sequence as a lone carbonate unit, a conspicuous feature shared by the Thaynes group to the west that has caused its membership to the San Rafael Swell to be questioned. However, its noticeably different composition allows for easy identification of formations {{in an area that}} is otherwise difficult to subdivide. Sinbad’s southeastern boundaries are difficult to locate, where the carbonate that characterizes the formation becomes sandy and hard to trace. In many places, the Sinbad member overlaps with the Black Dragon and Torrey members, and their limestone, siltstone and sandstone beds interweave.|$|E
5000|$|The second tectophase, {{during the}} Middle Devonian, {{represents}} the collision with the New York promontory. The southward migration of deformation reflected the third tectophase, which marks {{the collision of}} Avalon terranes with the Virginia promontory in the Middle to Late Devonian time. The effects of the New York and Virginia promontories together produced the Catskill Delta complex. [...] As the migration of deformation continued southward along the fault zone, during the Early Mississippian time, the final collision occurred with the Alabama promontory [...] [...] Ettensohn later refers to the fourth tectophase as the Mississippian tectophase of the Acadian Orogeny, since it demonstrated an unusually long duration (Mississippian-Early Pennsylvanian). [...] Subsequently, the Pocono & equivalent clastic wedges essentially filled the <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea.</b> The deposition of Middle Mississippian carbonates {{marks the end of}} the Acadian Orogeny and Catskill Delta complex.|$|E
50|$|The rock {{making up}} Vedauwoo's {{characteristic}} hoodoos and outcrops is the 1.4 billion year old Sherman Granite. These rocks represent {{some of the}} oldest rock in Wyoming (but are still {{more than a billion}} years younger than the Tetons). It is exposed at the surface around Vedauwoo due to the uplift of the Laramie Mountains that began around 70 million years ago. Younger layers of rock and sediment have progressively eroded, and this continues today. The hard granite of vedauwoo is made of large crystals of quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase, and some mica and is more erosion-resistant, resulting in wind and water-sculpted forms. Just east of Vedauwoo, along I-80, sandstone cliffs are formed of the Permian-age Fountain Formation, which is about 300 million years old. Ancient sand dunes of a broad desert met with the salty waters of a shallow, <b>epicontinental</b> <b>sea,</b> producing examples of cross-stratification. Fossils of sea urchins, snails, and sea lilies can be found in some of these rocks.|$|E
25|$|Shallow <b>epi{{continental}}</b> <b>seas</b> {{like the}} current North Sea have since long existed on the European continental shelf. The rifting {{that formed the}} northern part of the Atlantic Ocean during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, from about , caused tectonic uplift in the British Isles. Since then, a shallow sea has almost continuously existed between the uplands of the Fennoscandian Shield and the British Isles. This precursor of the current North Sea has grown and shrunk with the rise and fall of the eustatic sea level during geologic time. Sometimes it was connected with other shallow seas, such as the sea above the Paris Basin to the south-west, the Paratethys Sea to the south-east, or the Tethys Ocean to the south.|$|R

50|$|The {{effects of}} wind and water were able to {{chemically}} and mechanically erode and destroy the Hercynic mountain ranges. In the Permian, the main deposits in Europe were sandstone and conglomerate, products of erosion in the Hercynic mountain range. At the same time, crustal extension took place because the mountain range was isostatically unstable (this is called orogenic collapse). Due to extension, basins formed along the axis of the mountain range and felsic volcanism occurred. This was {{the first phase of}} rifting between Europe and Africa. Due to the rising sealevel in the Triassic period, the eastern margin of Pangaea was flooded. Shallow shelf <b>seas</b> and <b>epicontinental</b> <b>seas</b> existed in which evaporites and limestones were deposited.|$|R
