5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{hypothesis}} {{put forth}} by Richard Lindzen is the iris hypothesis <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> increase in tropical sea surface temperatures results in less cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted to space.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} to invent and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E

50|$|Residential time is {{considered}} to be time <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> product, its constituent materials and parts, exists in society. Residential time includes the time <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> product may be broken and/ or discarded.|$|R
5|$|Another pursuit-deterrent {{signal is}} {{thanatosis}} or playing dead. Thanatosis {{is a form}} of bluff <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> animal mimics its own dead body, feigning death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E
5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} matter <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially generated from neutral gases.|$|E

5|$|The {{policy is}} not Wednesbury-unreasonable. In {{assessing}} whether policies fall foul of this rule, a court cannot reject the way <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> administrative body formulated a policy in favour of its own view of how the discretion should have been exercised. Furthermore, a {{policy is not}} Wednesbury-unreasonable if the court simply feels {{that it may not}} work effectively.|$|E
5|$|After it {{had been}} {{previously}} forecast to turn northwestward and track along the northeastern Florida coast, the forecast shifted 24hours prior to moving ashore to a landfall point in the east-central portion of the state; the change {{was due to the}} persistence of the ridge to its north. The hurricane moved over Grand Bahama Island, and in the Bahamas it produced wind gusts of up to 130mph (210km/h). As it approached the Florida coastline it did not strengthen much further, due to an eyewall replacement cycle; this is the process <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> outer eyewall forms, causing the original eye to shrink and dissipate due to lack of moisture. At 0400UTC on September 26, Jeanne made landfall with peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) on the southern end of Hutchinson Island near Stuart, Florida, with an eye 50mi (85km) in diameter. The hurricane moved ashore in almost the same location as Hurricane Frances, which made landfall 21days prior.|$|E
5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> actor is recorded waving {{his head around}} at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{there were}} three brutal murders along the road, one was <b>a</b> robbery <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> man was hit {{over the head with}} a tire jack over some gold coins, <b>a</b> second <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> woman {{beheaded}} her husband and buried the head and the body on different sides of the street, and lastly one <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> local resident, Bill Cummins, was shot and buried in a mudpile. It was never solved.|$|R
50|$|The first attack {{occurred}} <b>in</b> Joué-lès-Tours, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> knife-wielding man {{attacked a}} police station, injuring three officers before being killed. The second attack occurred <b>in</b> Dijon, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> man used {{a vehicle to}} run over eleven pedestrians in several {{areas of the city}} before being arrested. The third attack occurred <b>in</b> Nantes, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> vehicular attack at a Christmas market resulted in ten people being injured and one fatality. The driver was arrested after attempting suicide.|$|R
5|$|As he {{had done}} with the prior two Adventures, Wallez {{organised}} a publicity stunt to mark the culmination of Tintin in America, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> actor portraying Tintin arrived in Brussels. It proved the most popular yet. In 1932, the series was collected and published in a single volume by Les Éditions de Petit Vingtième, coinciding with their publication of the first collected volume of Quick and Flupke. A second edition was produced in France by Éditions Ogéo-Cœurs-Vaillants in 1934, while that same year Casterman published an edition, the first of The Adventures of Tintin that they released. In 1936, Casterman asked Hergé to add several new colour plates to a reprint of Tintin in America, which he agreed to. They also asked him to replace the cover with one depicting a car chase, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either a buildup of methane gas or coal dust. As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more difficult to control the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
5|$|B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad {{to direct}} a bilingual film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The film's script, by Chakrapani, was based on Rabindranath Maitra's Manmoyee Girls School and Sharadindu Bandhopadhyay's Detective. Chakrapani thought the plot of Manmoyee Girls School, about two {{unemployed}} young people who pretend {{to be married to}} gain employment and fall in love, was too limited for a full-length film. He added the basic storyline of Detective, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> enthusiastic detective finds a missing woman and marries her. Prasad's relationship with Khan, a Muslim tailor near Kohinoor Studios in Bombay (now Mumbai), was the basis of the film's friendship between two men of different religions. The film was titled Missamma in Telugu and Missiamma in Tamil.|$|E

5|$|Brood parasitism, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> egg-layer {{leaves her}} eggs with another individual's brood, {{is more common}} among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
5|$|Burrowing behaviour, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) {{into the}} substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium {{consists of a}} series of movements characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1913, Born had {{published}} 27 papers, including important work on relativity and the dynamics of crystal lattices (3 with Theodore von Karman), which became a book. In 1914 {{received a letter from}} Max Planck explaining that a new professor extraordinarius chair of theoretical physics had been created at the University of Berlin. The chair had been offered to Max von Laue, but he had turned it down. Born accepted. The First World War was now raging. Soon after arriving in Berlin in 1915 he enlisted in an Army signals unit. In October he joined the Artillerie-Prüfungs-Kommission, the Army's Berlin-based artillery research and development organisation, under Rudolf Ladenburg, who had established a special unit dedicated to the new technology of sound ranging. In Berlin, Born formed a lifelong friendship with Einstein, who became a frequent visitor to Born's home. Within days of the armistice in November 1918, Planck had the Army release Born. A chance meeting with Fritz Haber that month led to discussion of the manner <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen, which is today known as the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E

5|$|During the year, a {{total of}} 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, six {{hurricane}}s and two major hurricanes formed. The most intense hurricane, Dean, tied for the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded {{as well as the}} third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall. The season was one of only four on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category5 storm. It was the second on record <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. Aside from Dean and Felix, none of the storms exceeded Category1 intensity.|$|E
5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked through the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E
5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
