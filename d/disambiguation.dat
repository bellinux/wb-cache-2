5|$|The region, {{as defined}} above, has a total {{population}} of about 5 million. The main <b>disambiguation</b> issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as Macedonian on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both Macedonian on a regional, and Greek on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, {{the use of the}} term on a national level lays claims to their history. This <b>disambiguation</b> problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} area in {{semantic}} analysis is {{the identification of}} the intended meaning at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense <b>disambiguation</b> (a concept that is evolving away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by {{the ways in which they}} are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word <b>disambiguation,</b> multi- and cross-lingual <b>disambiguation,</b> and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.|$|E

Beginning with the fourth workshop, SemEval-2007 (SemEval-1), the nature of the tasks evolved to include semantic analysis tasks outside of word sense <b>disambiguation.</b>|$|E
