500|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{state that}} human beings have a [...] "rational soul", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's status and humanity's relationship with its creator.

Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and <b>Hell</b> <b>are</b> taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.|$|E
