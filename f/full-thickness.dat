5|$|Continuous passive motion (CPM) {{has been}} used to improve healing of the {{articular}} surface during the postoperative period for people with <b>full-thickness</b> lesions. It has been shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small (< 3 mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits. Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. <b>Full-thickness</b> burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a <b>full-thickness</b> or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable lesions (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, <b>full-thickness</b> lesions (stageIII and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{study on}} human cadaveric {{shoulders}} suggests tendon tears {{may affect the}} pennation angle of the rotator cuff muscles. Researchers compared pennation angle between a control group and tear groups comprising either partial or complete-thickness tendon tears. Via dissection of ten injured and ten non-injured cadeveric shoulders, the study discovered a correlation between tendon tear size {{and an increase in}} pennation angle among two of the rotator cuff muscles. Pennation angle remained unaffected across all rotator cuff muscles in the partial tendon tear group, suggesting a threshold tear size must be exceeded to produce any changes in pennation angle. <b>Full-thickness</b> tendon tears did not affect the pennation angle of the subscapularis or teres minor muscles. However, a correlation between <b>full-thickness</b> rotator cuff tear size and the pennation angle of the supraspnatus and infraspinatus muscles was evident. The length of the <b>full-thickness</b> tendon tear strongly correlated with an increase in the pennation angle of the supraspinatus muscle. In addition, a moderately strong association between the area of the <b>full-thickness</b> tear and the resulting increase in pennation angle of the infraspinatus was visible.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} rhinoplastic {{techniques are}} applied to the surgical management of: (i) partial-thickness defects; (ii) <b>full-thickness</b> defects; (iii) heminasal reconstruction; and (iv) total nasal reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Full-thickness</b> tears {{may also}} involve {{complete}} detachment of the tendon(s) from the humeral head and {{may result in}} significantly impaired shoulder motion and function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Full-thickness</b> nasal defects are {{in three}} types: (i) wounds {{to the skin}} and to the soft tissues, {{featuring}} either exposed bone or exposed cartilage, or both; (ii) wounds extending through the nasal skeleton; and (iii) wounds traversing all three nasal layers: skin, muscle, and the osseo-cartilaginous framework. Based upon the dimensions (length, width, depth) and topographic locale of the wound {{and the number of}} missing nasal-tissue layers, the surgeon determines the rhinoplastic technique for correcting a <b>full-thickness</b> defect; each of the aesthetic nasal subunits is considered separately and in combination.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that no single physical examination test distinguishes reliably between bursitis, partial-thickness, and <b>full-thickness</b> tears. On the contrary, a combination of tests seems to provide the most accurate diagnosis. For impingement, these tests include the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign in which the examiner medially rotates the patient's flexed arm, forcing the supraspinatus tendon against the coracoacromial ligament and so producing pain if the test is positive a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of defecography, In 1968 Broden and Snellman used cinedefecography to show that rectal prolapse begins as a circumferential intussusception of the rectum, which slowly increases over time. The {{leading edge of the}} intussusceptum may be located at 6–8cm or at 15–18cm from the anal verge. This proved an older theory from the 18th century by John Hunter and Albrecht von Haller that this condition is essentially a <b>full-thickness</b> rectal intussusception, beginning about 3 inches above the dentate line and protruding externally.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in pennation angle following <b>full-thickness</b> tendon tears {{will result in}} a change to the PCSA of the supraspinatus and infraspinutus muscles. This would reduce the force producing capacity of these muscles. However, partial tendon tears, which did not result in a change to pennation in any of the rotator cuff muscles, may not impair the force producing properties of the muscles. Azizi’s observations on variable gearing in pennate muscles further suggests tendon tears will affect the AGR of the supraspinatus and infraspinutus. The greater pennation angle could result in an increased AGR.|$|E
25|$|<b>Full-thickness</b> {{skin grafts}} are the {{effective}} wound-management technique for defects with a well-vascularized, soft-tissue bed covering the nasal skeleton. The patient’s ear {{is the preferred}} skin-graft donor site from which to harvests grafts of pre-auricular skin and grafts of post-auricular skin, usually with an additional, small amount of adipose tissue to fill the wound cavity. Yet, nasal correction with a skin graft harvested from the patient's neck is not recommended, because that skin is low-density pilosebaceous tissue with very few follicles and sebaceous glands, thus is unlike the oily skin of the nose.|$|E
25|$|Musculoskeletal {{ultrasound}} {{has been}} advocated by experienced practitioners, avoiding the radiation of X-ray and {{the expense of}} MRI while demonstrating comparable accuracy to MRI for identifying and measuring the size of <b>full-thickness</b> and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. This modality can also reveal {{the presence of other}} conditions that may mimic rotator cuff tear at clinical examination, including tendinosis, calcific tendinitis, subacromial subdeltoid bursitis, greater tuberosity fracture, and adhesive capsulitis. However, MRI provides more information about adjacent structures in the shoulder such as the capsule, glenoid labrum muscles and bone and these factors should be considered in each case when selecting the appropriate study.|$|E
25|$|A partial-thickness defect is a wound with {{adequate}} soft-tissue {{coverage of the}} underlying nasal skeleton, yet is too large for primary intention closure, with sutures. Based upon the locale of the wound, the surgeon has two (2) options for correcting such a wound: (i) healing the wound by secondary intention (re-epithelialisation); and (ii) healing the wound with a <b>full-thickness</b> skin graft. Moreover, because it avoids the patched appearance of a skin-graft surgical correction, healing by secondary intention can successfully repair nasal wounds up to 10mm in diameter; and, if the resultant scar proves aesthetically unacceptable, it can be revised later, after the wound has healed.|$|E
25|$|A wound {{measuring}} 10–15mm {{in diameter}} can be reconstructed with a single-stage modified bilobed flap, because it best matches the skin {{color and the}} skin texture of the wounded aesthetic subunit. Although not every scar can be hidden {{at the margins of}} the aesthetic nasal subunits concerned, the superior scarring ability of those nasal skin areas minimizes such an histologic disadvantage. In a patient whose basal-cell carcinoma was excised with Mohs surgery, the scar of the nasal reconstruction (an 11mm <b>full-thickness,</b> laterally based, bilobed-flap applied down to the bone and the cartilage), was hidden by aligning the axis of the second lobe to and emplacing the skin graft at the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose.|$|E
25|$|Nd:YAG laser {{peripheral}} iridotomy (LPI) {{may be used}} {{in patients}} susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, <b>full-thickness</b> opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Full-thickness</b> {{tears are}} [...] "through-and-through". These tears can be small pinpoint, larger buttonhole, or involve the {{majority}} of the tendon where it still remains substantially attached to the humeral head and thus maintains function.|$|E
2500|$|No {{evidence}} of benefit is seen from early rather than delayed surgery, and many [...] with partial tears and some with complete tears {{will respond to}} nonoperative management. Consequently, many recommend initial, nonsurgical management. However, early surgical treatment may be considered in significant (>1cm-1.5cm) acute tears or in young patients with <b>full-thickness</b> tears who have a significant risk {{for the development of}} irreparable rotator cuff changes.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{diagnosis}} of <b>full-thickness</b> rotator cuff tear, the best combination appears to include once more the painful arc and weakness in external rotation, and in addition, the drop arm sign. This test {{is also known as}} Codman's test. The arm is raised to the side [...] to 90° by the examiner. [...] The patient then attempts to look to lower the arm back to neutral, palm down. If the arm drops suddenly or pain is experienced, the test is considered positive.|$|E
2500|$|Special bipolar {{aluminum}} {{electrolytic capacitors}} designed for bipolar operation are available, and usually {{referred to as}} [...] "non-polarized" [...] or [...] "bipolar" [...] types. In these, the capacitors have two anode foils with <b>full-thickness</b> oxide layers connected in reverse polarity. On the alternate halves of the AC cycles, one of the oxides on the foil acts as a blocking dielectric, preventing reverse current from damaging the electrolyte of the other one. But these bipolar electrolytic capacitors are not adaptable for main AC applications instead of power capacitors with metallized polymer film or paper dielectric.|$|E
2500|$|Even for <b>full-thickness</b> {{rotator cuff}} tears, {{conservative}} care (i.e., nonsurgical treatment) outcomes are usually reasonably good. However, many patients still suffer disability and pain despite nonsurgical therapies. [...] For massive tears of the rotator cuff, surgery has shown durable outcomes on 10-year follow-up. However, {{the same study}} demonstrated ongoing and progressive fatty atrophy and repeat tears of the rotator cuff. [...] MRI evidence of fatty atrophy in the rotator cuff prior to surgery is predicative of a poor surgical outcome. If the rotator cuff is completely torn, surgery is usually required to reattach the tendon to the bone.|$|E
2500|$|Repair of a complete, <b>full-thickness</b> tear {{involves}} tissue suture. The method {{currently in}} favor {{is to place}} an anchor in the bone at the natural attachment site, with resuture of torn tendon to the anchor. If tissue quality is poor, mesh (collagen, Artelon, or other degradable material) {{may be used to}} reinforce the repair. Repair can be performed through an open incision, again requiring detachment of a portion of the deltoid, while a mini-open technique approaches the tear through a deltoid-splitting approach. The latter may cause less injury to muscle and produce better results. [...] Contemporary techniques now use an all arthroscopic approach.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{significant}} bone spur is present, {{any of the}} approaches may include an acromioplasty, a subacromial decompression, {{as part of the}} procedure. [...] Subacromial decompression, removal of {{a small portion of the}} acromion that overlies the rotator cuff, aims to relieve pressure on the rotator cuff in certain conditions and promote healing and recovery. [...] Although subacromial decompression may be beneficial in the management of partial and <b>full-thickness</b> tear repair, it does not repair the tear itself and arthroscopic decompression has more recently been combined with [...] "mini-open" [...] repair of the rotator cuff, allowing for the repair of the cuff without disruption of the deltoid origin. [...] The results of decompression alone tend to degrade with time, but the combination of repair and decompression appears to be more enduring.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are comparable in efficacy and helpful in diagnosis although {{both have a}} false positive rate of 15 - 20%. [...] MRI can reliably detect most <b>full-thickness</b> tears although very small pinpoint tears may be missed. In such situations, an MRI combined with an injection of contrast material, an MR-arthrogram, may help to confirm the diagnosis. [...] It should be realized that a normal MRI cannot fully rule out a small tear (a false negative) while partial-thickness tears are not as reliably detected. While MRI is sensitive in identifying tendon degeneration (tendinopathy), it may not reliably distinguish between a degenerative tendon and a partially torn tendon. Again, magnetic resonance arthrography can improve the differentiation. An overall sensitivity of 91% (9% false negative rate) has been reported indicating that magnetic resonance arthrography is reliable in the detection of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, its routine use is not advised, since it involves entering the joint with a needle with potential risk of infection. Consequently, the test is reserved for {{cases in which the}} diagnosis remains unclear.|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{modification}} of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection. The prolapse is exposed {{if it is not}} already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor. The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. [...] "Mucosal proctectomy" [...] was first discussed by Delorme in 1900, now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse. The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with <b>full-thickness</b> prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation). Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%–75% of patients). Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased. Constipation is improved in 50% of cases, but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, anastomotic dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases. Mortality occurs in 0-2.5% cases. There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).|$|E
2500|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of a central wedge-resection involves cutting and removing a partial-thickness wedge of tissue from the thickest portion of the labium minus. Unlike the edge-resection technique, the resection pattern of the central wedge technique preserves the natural rugosity ("wrinkled" [...] edge) of the labia minora. If performed as a <b>full-thickness</b> resection, there exists the potential risk of damaging the pertinent labial nerves, which can result in painful neuromas, and numbness. A partial thickness removal of mucosa and skin, leaving the submucosa intact, decreases the risk of this complication. F. Giraldo et al. procedurally refined the central wedge resection technique with an additional 90-degree Z-plasty technique, which produces a refined surgical scar that is less tethered, and diminishes the physical tensions exerted upon the surgical-incision wound, and, therefore, reduces the likelihood of a notched (scalloped-edge) scar. The central wedge-resection technique is a demanding surgical procedure, and difficulty can arise with judging the correct amount of labial skin to resect, which might result in either undercorrection (persistent tissue-redundancy), or the overcorrection (excessive tension to the surgical wound), and an increased probability of surgical-wound separation. The benefit of this technique is that an extended wedge can be brought upwards towards the prepuce to treat a prominent clitoral hood without a separate incision. This leads to a natural contour for the finished result, and avoids direct incisions near the highly-sensitive clitoris.|$|E
50|$|With the {{advancement}} of tissue engineering an alternative approach was developed: the <b>full-thickness</b> engineered oral mucosa. <b>Full-thickness</b> engineered oral mucosa is a better simulation of the in vivo situation because they take the anatomical structure of native oral mucosa into account. Problems, such as tissue shortage and donor site morbidity, do not occur when using <b>full-thickness</b> engineered oral mucosa.|$|E
50|$|An escharotomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{used to treat}} <b>full-thickness</b> (third-degree) circumferential burns. In <b>full-thickness</b> burns, both the epidermis and the dermis are destroyed along with sensory nerves in the dermis. The tough leathery tissue remaining after a <b>full-thickness</b> burn has been termed eschar. Following a <b>full-thickness</b> burn, as the underlying tissues are rehydrated, they become constricted due to the eschar's loss of elasticity, leading to impaired circulation distal to the wound. An escharotomy can be performed as a prophylactic measure {{as well as to}} release pressure, facilitate circulation and combat burn-induced compartment syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Purpura fulminans lesions, once established, often {{progress}} within 24 to 48 {{hours to}} <b>full-thickness</b> skin necrosis or soft-tissue necrosis. Once purpura fulminans lesions progress to <b>full-thickness</b> skin necrosis, healing takes between 4-8 weeks and leaves large scars.|$|E
