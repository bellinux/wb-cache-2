5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E
5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation {{and is one of}} just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The program used import {{subsidies}} to pump US {{dollars into the}} South Vietnamese treasury. The regimes sold these dollars to business people who held licenses to import American goods. The businessmen bought the US dollars from the Saigon treasury with their South Vietnamese piasters at half the official exchange rate; they then used this cheaply acquired American currency to import US goods. This meant that American manufacturers would still <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of US currency they would have received for selling their goods on the free market, while South Vietnamese importers could get twice as much goods for the same money. The piasters that the Saigon government collected from selling the US aid dollars were {{to be placed in}} a fund held by the National Bank of Vietnam, which was to be used to fund the expansion and training of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, national police and civil service.|$|E

Alcoholism affects physical and mental health, and can cause problems with family, friends, and work.|$|E
25|$|Dead {{space in}} a {{breathing}} apparatus is space in the apparatus in which the breathing gas must flow in both directions as the user breathes in and out, increasing the necessary respiratory effort to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of usable air or breathing gas, and risking accumulation of carbon dioxide from shallow breaths. It is in effect an external extension of the physiological dead space.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2003 reforms {{subsidies}} {{have been}} linked to the size of farms, so farmers <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for a hectare of land regardless of how much land they own. So while subsidies allow small farms to exist, large farms tend to get the larger share of the subsidies. With the 2008 Health Check of the CAP, a first step was taken towards limiting CAP payments to very large landowners.|$|E

The North, however, was not able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> connections. In 1972, the two states fought a war. The war was resolved with a ceasefire and negotiations brokered by the Arab League, where it was declared that unification would eventually occur. In 1978, Ali Abdallah Saleh was named as president of the Yemen Arab Republic.|$|E
25|$|At {{the feminist}} {{congress}} that began on 5 September 1900, chaired by Marguerite Durand, {{most of the}} delegates were from the elite rather than working women. Saumoneau and Renaud were admitted somewhat reluctantly. While the attendees had no difficulty supporting a resolution that called for an eight-hour day for industrial workers, with a full day off, they had considerable difficulty supporting a proposal that their own maids should <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> conditions. Saumoneau and Renaud pushed the point.|$|E

25|$|To {{generate}} the same output stream, {{the order of}} the taps is the counterpart (see above) of the order for the conventional LFSR, otherwise the stream will be in reverse. Note that the internal state of the LFSR is not necessarily the same. The Galois register shown has the same output stream as the Fibonacci register in the first section. A time offset exists between the streams, so a different startpoint will be needed to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> output each cycle.|$|E
25|$|For example, to get 1kW of real power, if {{the power}} factor is unity, 1kVA of {{apparent}} power {{needs to be}} transferred (1kW รท 1 = 1kVA). At low values of power factor, more apparent power needs {{to be transferred to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> real power. To get 1kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1kW รท 0.2 = 5kVA). This apparent power must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.|$|E
25|$|Price and Pavelich have {{an entirely}} {{different}} view of the Internet than other free daily publishers. While most free daily publishers post their stories and/or PDF pages online, the creators of the Palo Alto Daily News model have refused to put their content online. They argue that posting their stories online will reduce demand for their printed newspapers, which will also reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} print ads. They note that readers have dropped their subscriptions to paid newspapers because they can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> stories online, yet those newspapers make far less money on their websites than they do on their print editions.|$|E

25|$|The scheme {{relies on}} two {{properties}} of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated {{in the sense}} that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.|$|E
25|$|General {{bystander}} effect {{research was}} mainly {{conducted in the}} context of non-dangerous, non-violent emergencies. A study (2006) tested bystander effect in emergency situations to see if they would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> results from other studies testing non-emergencies. In situations with low potential danger, significantly more help was given when the person was alone than when they were around another person. However, in situations with high potential danger, participants confronted with an emergency alone or in the presence of another person were similarly likely to help the victim. This suggests that in situations of greater seriousness {{it is more likely that}} people will interpret the situation as one in which help is needed and will be more likely to intervene.|$|E
25|$|Experience in India gave Stephen {{opportunity}} {{for his next}} activity. The government of India had been driven by {{the conditions of the}} Indian judicial system to recast a considerable part of the English law which had been informally imported. Criminal law procedure, and a good deal of commercial law, had been or were being put into easily understood language, intelligible to civilian magistrates. The rational substance of the law was preserved, while disorder and excessive technicalities were removed. Using Jeremy Bentham's ideal of codification, he attempted to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> principles put into practice in the United Kingdom. In spite of six years of effort on this task, Stephen was largely unsuccessful in making any reforms. Stephen also privately published digests in code form of the law of evidence and criminal law.|$|E
