The Mangalorean Catholics came to Bombay out of <b>economic</b> <b>necessity.</b> The first permanent settlement of Mangalorean Catholics in Bombay {{was recorded in}} the 1890s. The first Mangalorean Catholic settlement in Madras was recorded in the 1940s. Joachim Alva, a Mangalorean Catholic politician, actively participated in uniting the Mangalorean Catholic community against the British during the Indian Independence Movement.|$|E
5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed <b>economic</b> <b>necessity,</b> they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|By 1846 Honoré de Balzac had {{achieved}} tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing {{a series of}} potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, Les Chouans ("The Chouans"), in 1829. He followed this with dozens of well-received novels and stories, including La Peau de chagrin ("The Magic Skin"), in 1831, Le Père Goriot ("Father Goriot") in 1835, and the two-volume Illusions perdues ("Lost Illusions"), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, however, {{he spent most of}} his life trying to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by <b>economic</b> <b>necessity</b> as by the muse and black coffee. This regimen of constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.|$|E

5|$|With López gone, {{control of}} the CNOC was now fought over by anarchists and Communists. By 1930-1, CNOC had {{been taken over by}} the Communists, with anarchists being turned over to the police, still under the control of Machado. Many of the Spanish anarchists {{involved}} {{decided to go back to}} Spain. Following the new government's passage of a law dictating that at least half of an employer's employees be Cuban-born, a large number of Cuba's Spanish-born anarchists were forced by <b>economic</b> <b>necessity</b> to return to Spain, which greatly diminished the clout of the anarchist movement in Cuba. However, soon the Juventud Libertaria (Libertarian Youth) was founded by a younger generation of anarchists, and by 1936, after the start of the Spanish Civil War, Cuban anarchists had founded the Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA), to help send money and arms to the CNT and FAI. Many Cuban-born anarchists went to Spain to join the fight, alongside many Spanish-born anarchists exiled from Cuba.|$|E

25|$|While neolithic {{writing is}} a current {{research}} topic, conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from <b>economic</b> <b>necessity</b> in the ancient Near East.

Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.|$|E

25|$|Before World War II, Japan {{built an}} {{extensive}} empire that included Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, {{and parts of}} northern China. The Japanese regarded this sphere of influence as a political and <b>economic</b> <b>necessity,</b> preventing foreign states from strangling Japan by blocking its access to raw materials and crucial sea-lanes, as Japan possessed very few natural and mining resources of its own, although it imported large amounts of coal from Korea, Manchukuo, and some regions of occupied China. Japan's large military force was regarded as essential to the empire's defense.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{direction}} of the Iliffes (later the 2nd Baron and Lady Iliffe), Basildon was completely restored and refurnished. This was achieved over a period of 25 years. Many fixtures and fittings were purchased from similar houses in a greater state of dereliction prior to their demolition. While often the Iliffes found great bargains, obtaining 18th-century mahogany doors and marble fireplaces, at other times their luck was less favourable; Lady Iliffe recalled attending the Mentmore Towers auction of 1975 with the intention of buying marble topped console tables for Basildon, but through <b>economic</b> <b>necessity</b> returned with only a coal-scuttle.|$|E
25|$|The Sasanian navy was an {{important}} constituent of the Sasanian military {{from the time that}} Ardashir I conquered the Arab side of the Persian gulf. Because controlling the Persian gulf was an <b>economic</b> <b>necessity,</b> the Sasanian navy worked to keep it safe from piracy, prevent Roman encroachment, and keep the Arab tribes from getting hostile. However, it is believed by many historians that the naval force could not have been a strong one, as the men serving in the navy were those who were confined in prisons. The leader of the navy bore the title of nāvbed.|$|E

Martí learned English at an early age, and had begun to translate at thirteen.

25|$|Unger's work on law {{has sought}} to denaturalize the concept of law {{and how it is}} {{represented}} through particular institutions. He begins by inquiring into why modern societies have legal systems with distinctions between institutions, such as legislature and court, as well as a special caste of lawyers possessing a method of reasoning about social problems. Whereas thinkers such as Marx and Weber had argued that such legal arrangements were a product of <b>economic</b> <b>necessity</b> to secure property rights and the autonomy of the individual, Unger shows that this liberal legal order emerged in Europe {{as a result of the}} indeterminate relations between monarchy, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie. It took the particular form that it did by emerging out of the long tradition of natural law and universality, rather than of necessity.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{production}} and trade was, {{partly due to}} geopolitical reality and <b>economic</b> <b>necessity,</b> redirected toward Germany. An overriding concern was a German fear of creating a burden if the Danish economy collapsed as it did after World War I. This sensitivity to Denmark's heavy reliance on foreign trade informed the German decision before the occupation to allow the Danes passage through their blockade. Denmark had traditionally been a major trading partner of both Britain and Germany. Many government officials saw expanded trade with Germany as vital to maintaining social order in Denmark. Increased unemployment and poverty was feared to lead to more of open revolt within the country, since Danes tended to blame all negative developments on the Germans. It was feared that any revolt {{would result in a}} crackdown by the German authorities.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the rise}} of tourism made {{knowledge}} of German an <b>economic</b> <b>necessity</b> in many areas, while the agricultural sector, which had been a traditional domain of Romansh, became less important. All this meant that knowledge of German {{became more and more}} of a necessity for Romansh speakers and that German became more and more a part of daily life. For the most part, German was seen not as a threat but rather as an important asset for communicating outside one's home region. The common people frequently demanded better access to learning German. When public schools began to appear, many municipalities decided to adopt German as the medium of instruction, {{as in the case of}} Ilanz, where German became the language of schooling in 1833, when the town was still largely Romansh-speaking.|$|E
25|$|Besides football, Wembley can be {{configured}} to hold {{many other}} events, particularly major concerts but also private events like weddings and conferences. This is an <b>economic</b> <b>necessity</b> {{given that the}} stadium ended up costing the FA much more than was originally projected. The regular covering of the pitch for concerts {{has led to the}} pitch being relaid often (see elsewhere in this article). Regular changes to the pitch mean that it never matches the quality of its surroundings, or of the pitch of the old Wembley in its later years. The first concert at the new stadium was given by George Michael on 9 June 2007. Bon Jovi were scheduled to be the first artists to perform at the new Wembley but the late completion of the stadium saw the concerts relocated to the National Bowl and the KC Stadium.|$|E
25|$|While {{the growth}} of tourism has benefited the city of Havana economically, {{there have been several}} {{negative}} side effects. One such side effect is the revival of sex tourism in the city. Sex tourism was a central part of the tourism industry before the Revolution. However, after 1960, prostitution was essentially eradicated on the island due to government initiatives and a significant drop in demand as tourism was minimized. With tourism becoming more prevalent in the 1990s, however, so did the practice of prostitution. The demographic profile of tourists (the overwhelming majority being men between ages 25–60) is a key indicator of the existence of prostitution. Additionally, websites and magazines, such as Playboy, have outlined the opportunities for both heterosexual and homosexual sex tourism. According to Trumbull, many prostitutes engage in the practice out of <b>economic</b> <b>necessity,</b> but they do not work in oppressive conditions and a large number of prostitutes in contemporary Havana see the work as a way to earn a better living than if they were to work in open jobs throughout the city. Therefore, contemporary prostitution is different than the sex tourism of the 1950s in this regard.|$|E
