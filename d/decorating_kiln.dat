50|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} pin-holes is Spit-out. These are pin-holes or craters sometimes occurring in glazed non-vitreous ceramics {{while they are}} in the <b>decorating</b> <b>kiln.</b> The cause of this defect is the evolution of water vapour, adsorbed by the porous body, during the period between the glost firing and the decorating firing, via minute cracks in the glaze.|$|E
50|$|Bright Gold or Liquid Gold is a {{solution}} of gold sulphoresinate together with other metal resinates and a bismuth-based flux. It is particularly bright when drawn from the <b>decorating</b> <b>kiln</b> and so needs little further processing. This form of gilding was invented or at least improved by Heinrich Roessler. Rhodium compounds are used to improve the binding to the substrate.|$|E
