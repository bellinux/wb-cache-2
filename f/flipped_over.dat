5|$|On 11 July 1965. Avro 748 G-ARMV of Skyways Coach-Air {{arriving}} from Beauvais was written off at Lympne when its nose-wheels dug into soft {{ground on the}} grass runway. The aircraft <b>flipped</b> <b>over,</b> losing its port wing in the process.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Team Penske for the 2005 season. At Phoenix in the season's second race, Hornish started {{in second place}} and won after leading for 25 laps. During practice for the Indianapolis 500, he drove over a piece of debris after Paul Dana's second-turn crash and <b>flipped</b> <b>over.</b> Two days later Hornish qualified in second place, crashing out after leading for a race-high 77 laps and finishing 23rd. At the Milwaukee Mile he qualified for the pole position and led for 123 of 225 laps, passing Dario Franchitti with nine laps left for his second win of the season. Hornish {{finished third in the}} championship standings, with 512 points.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{was killed}} on 9 May 2013, during {{training}} for the 34th America's Cup, when the Swedish Artemis Racing team yacht he was aboard capsized near Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. The yacht, a 72-foot catamaran with a rigid, wing-like sail, was turning downwind and bearing away when it <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> and broke into pieces. Simpson was trapped underneath its hulls for approximately ten minutes, and attempts to revive him by doctors afloat and subsequently ashore were unsuccessful. The cause of the accident is unknown. An investigation was initiated by the United States Coast Guard which involved San Francisco police and the America's Cup management.|$|E

5|$|In Florida, Allison's {{dangerous}} winds {{knocked down}} power lines, leaving 48,000 residents without power and/or telephone services. Along the 150-mile (240km) stretch of Florida's Big Bend, 65 seaside homes were flooded {{and there was}} extensive beach erosion {{as a result of}} the storm surge. Three hotels and a restaurant were damaged. In Apalachicola, three fishing boats were swamped; the storm closed a bridge linking Apalachicola with St. George Island. The highest storm surge in Florida was about 6 to 8feet (1.8 to 2.5m) in Wakulla and Dixie Counties, and 2 to 6feet (0.6 to 1.8m) to the east. A tornado spawned by Allison touched down at Jacksonville Beach, causing minor damage when it downed power lines and <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> vehicles. Minor crop damage was also reported. There were no deaths reported as a result of Allison in Florida. Damage was estimated at $860,000 (1995 USD) in Florida, primarily {{as a result of the}} storm surge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Randy Orton faced Kurt Angle. In {{the early stages}} both superstars took the advantage over one another. Angle controlled most of the match, as Orton tried to avoid Angle's assaults. Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron, but did not perform the move. This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to drive it over his shoulders, but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle. Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle, leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold. Orton, however, <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> and sent Angle face-first into the exposed turnbuckle. As he turned around, Orton performed the RKO, and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1966, XB-70A No. 2 was {{in close}} {{formation}} {{with four other}} aircraft (an F-4 Phantom, an F-5, a T-38 Talon, and an F-104 Starfighter) for a photoshoot {{at the behest of}} General Electric, manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft. After the completion of the photoshoot, the F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wing, <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> and rolled inverted {{over the top of the}} Valkyrie, striking the vertical stabilizers and left wing of the bomber. The F-104 exploded, destroying the Valkyrie's rudders and damaging its left wing. With the loss of both rudders and damage to the wings, the Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California. NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker (F-104 pilot) and Carl Cross (XB-70 co-pilot) were killed. Al White (XB-70 pilot) ejected, sustaining serious injuries, including one arm crushed by the closing clamshell-like escape crew capsule moments prior to ejection.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{a similar}} path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta {{threatened}} {{to reproduce the}} devastating effects of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roatán along the offshore Bay Islands, {{and there was one}} death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125houses and the primary hospital. In Belize City, a tornado <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> a truck and damaged four houses. Damage in Belize was estimated at $25million (1978USD), and there were four deaths.|$|E
5|$|The five UH-1 gunships {{immediately}} strafed Viet Cong {{positions with}} 2.75-inch rockets, {{but failed to}} suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged {{to get off the}} ground. A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized as soon as it touched the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. As it prepared to land, the main rotor was struck by enemy gunfire. The aircraft <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who had ridden in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rain and flooding, winds damaged more homes and businesses, and a tornado was spawned {{a few miles}} southwest of Port Arthur. More than 19,000power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered tree limbs, and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a radio tower at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake Sam Rayburn were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated away, while portions of were submerged. Four indirect fatalities were confirmed in Texas, two from traffic accidents, one from a house fire ignited by a candle, and another from drowning. Several injuries were also reported, including four after a truck <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> due to strong winds.|$|E

5|$|The eight Locusts {{were loaded}} into {{separate}} Hamilcar gliders between 17–20 March, {{and on the}} morning of 24 March were towed from the airfield by Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers to join the rest of the gliders and transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions. Weather conditions for the operation were excellent, with clear visibility, and all eight gliders arrived {{in the vicinity of the}} landing zone without incident. During their attempts to land, however, the small force was severely depleted; one glider broke away from the Halifax towing it and disintegrated, apparently as a result of structural failure, with the Locust inside it falling to the ground. Three more gliders came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> onto its turret, rendering it useless.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E
5|$|All of the gliders {{successfully}} {{took off}} at 07:20 on 24 March, but seven were lost {{en route to}} the landing zones, the majority being forced to cast off and land in Allied territory due to their tugs suffering engine failures; however, one Hamilcar which carried an M22 Locust broke up in mid-air as it approached the Rhine, possibly due to structural failure, and all aboard were killed. Three more of the gliders were destroyed by German anti-aircraft fire as they approached the landing zones, as their slow speed made them easy targets. The thirty-eight that remained landed successfully between 10:46 and 11:00, although a number of them suffered damage from anti-aircraft fire. Particularly hard hit were the Hamilcars that carried the RASC personnel and supplies; eight landed successfully, but only three were sufficiently undamaged to allow the stores they carried to be recovered. Of the eight Hamilcars that transported the M22 Locusts of 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, seven reached the landing zones intact but had problems when they landed due to anti-aircraft fire and smoke obscuring the area. Four landed safely, but the other three came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> onto its turret, which rendered it useless. After the operation had come to an end, a few of the undamaged Hamilcars were dismantled and their parts shipped to England to aid in the construction of further gliders.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of his 37th lap Bernhard {{reported}} a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris. He had difficulty turning into the track's right-hand turns and fell to fourth place behind di Grassi and Tréluyer. The tyre degraded further which damaged his car's bodywork, but he cautiously returned to the pit lane for a replacement front nose, and Webber took over his position. Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's tyre carcass which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into his garage for ten-minute bodywork repairs. Then his front-axle energy retrieval system was changed, forcing Webber to remain in his garage for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, kept the lead after the pit stops. The first full course caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match was the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal, {{the winner of}} which would become the number one {{contender}} to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. It involved Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Gail Kim, Jackie Moore, ODB, Salinas, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. This contest involved two stages; {{the first was a}} standard battle royal. After all but two wrestlers were eliminated, stage two, a ladder match, began. The winner of the ladder match would become the number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship; the loser would have her head shaved. The final four were Kim, Laveaux, Love, and ODB. The next eliminated was ODB, followed by Love; both were eliminated by Laveaux. Only Kim and Laveaux remained for the ladder match portion. Kim had won immunity on the May8 episode of Impact!, so if Laveaux won the match, then Love's head would be shaven. Love and Sky interfered in the contest several times. During the bout, as Kim and Laveaux stood on the ladder, Kim <b>flipped</b> <b>over</b> Laveaux, grabbed her around the legs, and slammed her into the mat back-first with a powerbomb. Laveaux's head was legitimately cut open during this stage. Later, while Laxeaux climbed the ladder in an attempt to retrieve the contract, Love interfered by pushing the ladder over. Kim followed by climbing the ladder and grabbing the contract to win the encounter at ten minutes. Afterwards, Laveaux was forced to have her head shaven.|$|E
