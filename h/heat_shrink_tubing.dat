50|$|Low smoke zero halogen cable {{considerably}} {{reduces the}} amount of toxic and corrosive gas emitted during combustion. When burned, a low-smoke zero halogen cable emits a less optically dense smoke that releases at a lower rate. During a fire, a low-smoke cable is desirable because it reduces the amount and density of the smoke, which makes exiting a space easier for occupants as well as increases the safety of firefighting operations. This type of material is typically used in poorly ventilated areas such as aircraft, rail cars, tanks, subsea and offshore installations, submarines or ships. It is also used extensively in the rail industry, wherever high voltage or track signal wires must be run into and through underground tunnel systems. The nuclear industry is another area where LSZH cables have been and {{will be used in}} the future. Major cable manufacturers have been producing LSZH cables for nuclear facilities since the early 1990s. Construction of new nuclear plants will almost certainly involve extensive use of LSZH cable. This will reduce the chance of toxic gasses accumulating in those areas where personnel are working and the lack of corrosive gasses where there are computer controlled systems will reduce the possibility of wires being damaged by fire resulting in a short circuit fault.. Since the 1970s, the wire and cable industry has been using low-smoke, low-halogen materials in a number of applications. The introduction of a thermoplastic LSZH extended its use to accessories such as <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing,</b> labelling and fixtures. The objective was to create a wire and cable jacketing system that was not only flame retardant but also did not generate dense, obscuring smoke and less toxic or corrosive gases. In the military field its introduction was accelerated after 1982 following the dense black smoke emitted from HMS Sheffield after being hit by an exocet missile in Falkland’s war. Several fires, such as the King’s Cross fire in London that killed 31 people in London’s underground in 1987, increased the awareness of the contribution that wire and cable jacketing makes in a fire. As a result there has been an increased use of LSZH cables. With an increase in {{the amount of}} cable found in residential, commercial and industrial applications in recent years, there is a greater fuel load {{in the event of a}} fire and LSZH systems have a major role to play in protecting the public.|$|E

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a low-cost, PDMS-membrane {{micropump}} with two one-way ball check-valves for lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic applications. The micropump consists of two functional PDMS layers, one holding the ball check-valves and an actuating chamber, and the other covering the chamber and holding a miniature permanent magnet on top for actuation. An additional PDMS layer is used to cover the top magnet, and thereby encapsulate the entire device. A simple approach was used to assemble a high-performance ball check-valve using a micropipette and <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b> The micropump can be driven by an external magnetic force provided by another permanent magnet or an integrated coil. In the first driving scheme, a small do motor (6 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length) with a neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnet embedded in its shaft was used to actuate the membrane-mounted magnet. This driving method yielded a large pumping rate with very low power consumption. A maximum pumping rate of 774 μ L min(- 1) for deionized water was achieved at the input power of 13 mW, the highest pumping rate {{reported in the literature}} for micropumps at such power consumptions. Alternatively, we actuated the micropump with a 10 -turn planar coil fabricated on a PC board. This method resulted in a higher pumping rate of 1 mL min(- 1) for deionized water.

In this paper we describe the fabrication of a DCC device; the optimization of pneumatic actuators, their integration into a matrix with a modulus in the range of cardiac tissue and methods to affix this device to the heart wall. Pneumatic air muscles (PAMs) were fabricated using a modified McKibben technique and four types of internal bladders; low durometer silicone tubes molded inhouse, polyester terephthalate (PET) <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing,</b> nylon medical balloons and thermoplastic urethane (TPU) balloons thermally formed in-house.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this in-vitro-study was to analyse the influence of tooth resilience in correlation to the fracture strength of tooth-tooth, tooth-implant and purely implant stored four-unit zirconium-oxide bridges constructed with the LAVA® -CAD/CAM-System. The 80 dies were embedded in Paladur Clear® (Heraeus Kulzer); whereby a defined mobility of the dies was reached using <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> (3 M, type HSR) which was wrapped around the dental roots. 40 full-ceramic bridges of the same dimension were made to substitute an upper premolar and molar. The bridges were fabricated on models whose dies had different resilience. Split into four groups, the mobility of the dies was adjusted to simulate the different resilience’s around natural teeth, implants and the combination of both. The test bodies were split into four groups after having been cemented conventionally with zinc-oxide-phosphate cement (Hoffmann® Berlin) and were then stored in 0, 9 % Sodiumchloride-solution for 21 days. The bridges were then aged artificially by thermocycling. The breaking strength of the bridges was then analysed using the Zwick-machine (model Z 010 /TN 2 A, Roell®). The measured fracture strength values justify the clinical application of the LAVA® - ZrO 2 -ceramics with sufficient dimensions as a scaffolding material for tooth to tooth, tooth to implant and purely implant supported four unit bridge constructions to substitute an upper molar. The results of the fracture strength tests were analysed and described statistically with the Mann-Whitney-U-Test. A {{significant difference in the}} fracture strength of the bridges could be ascertained on account of different types of bridge support and the resilience of the abutment teeth.

40|$|Over {{the last}} years all-ceramic crowns have gained a larger market-share than all-ceramic bridges and thus it seems that all-ceramic bridges are {{implemented}} {{with a great deal}} of caution. The purpose of this study was to show the correlation of the fracture-strength of four-unit zirconium-oxide bridges constructed with the CAD/CAM-designed LAVA-System, in a three point-bending test. Thereby special attention was placed on the different die materials and the influence of thermocycling on them. The die materials used were fibreglass-enforced resins (DC-Tell,Firm DCS), LAVA-Zirconiumoxide-ceramics (3 M ESPE) and yellow brass. Two dies of each material were embedded in Paladur Clear (Heraeus Kulzer), whereby a defined mobility of the dies was reached by a <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> (3 M, type HSR) which was previously wrapped around the dental roots. For each group of die materials 20 bridges were cemented conventionally with zinc-oxide-phosphate cement (Hoffmann Berlin) and were then stored in 0, 9 % Sodiumchloride-solution for 21 days. Subsequently half of the bridges of each group were aged artificially through thermocycling. The results of the fracture strength test were analysed and described statistically with the t-test. The results showed that when using ceramic or metal dies, the fracture strength of the bridges were clearly higher than the bridges that were cemented on resin enforced dies. The artificial aging procedure through thermocycling had no significant influence in the case of ceramic or metal die materials, whereas it lead to a visible but not significant reduction of the fracture strength when full-ceramic bridges were cemented on fibre-enforced resin die material. In conclusion it can be noted that the fracture strength, that was detected for these ceramics, implies a clear indication for use in the cantilever region. The previous reconstruction of teeth using ceramic or brass core materials, even under constant influence of changing temperatures and fluids in the oral cavity, are clearly recommended. About the implementation of resin-based core materials, when testing these bridges clinically, no reliable conclusion can be done...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications {{require the use of}} high temperature superconductors (HTS) such as (RE=Rare Earth) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (REBCO) coated conductors [1]. HTS conductors show particularly great potential for high field magnets applications [1] due to their high upper critical fields [2], But several groups have shown that REBCO coated conductors are prone to delamination failure [3] [4] [5]. Under relatively low transverse stress the HTS film separates from the substrate and the conductor degrades [6]. This is problematic due to high transverse stresses that occur in fully epoxy impregnated solenoids wound with this conductor. Application of thin walled <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> introduces a weak plane around the conductor, preventing delamination degradation [7]. However, manual application of the shrink tubing is impractical, requiring three operators limited to insulating 100 m lengths or less of REBCO conductor. The high risk of damage to the conductor, also associated with this process, shows the need for a mechanized process. Strict guidelines for the capabilities of the mechanized process were set: a single operator must have the capability to insulate continuous 200 m lengths of REBCO conductor with a minimum insulation rate of 50 m per work day. This thesis presents the ideation, prototyping, and construction of such a mechanized insulation process. Results of prototyping yielded an insulation rate of 100 m per work day with two operators, and the capacity to insulate 130 m of REBCO conductor [8]. Local critical current test indicated that no damage is caused to the tape from the insulation process [9]. A final mechanized Shrink Tube Insulation Apparatus (STIA) was developed, increasing the conductor length capacity to 450 m and reducing the number of operators to one. Due to unforeseen motor and tape tension issues, modifications to STIA were required, which increased the number of operators to two. Through a collaborative effort between the Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC) and the Kyushu University in Japan, a continuous 200 m length of Fujikora-produced REBCO conductor was provided, to be insulated by STIA. An insulation rate of 100 m per work day was achieved with two operators. In the latter of the paper, current work to rectify the issues causing the need for two operators is presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} occurs when {{refrigerant}} fluids wick inside the insulation of thermocouple wires through a compressor's casing feedthrough and then leak into the adjacent disconnect box outside the casing. Leaking fluids create an unfavorable situation inside the disconnect box and may contaminate the fluids. To address this problem, NASA Lewis Research Center s Manufacturing Engineering Division developed a customized hermetic feedthrough for {{a bank of}} Worthington compressors. In these compressors, bearing temperatures are measured by internal thermocouples embedded in bearings located inside the compressor casings. The thermocouple wires need to be routed outside the casing and read at another location. These wires are short and are terminated to a disconnect strip inside the casing. The bearings operate at about 170 F, but because the casing is filled with R 12 refrigerant oil, the casing has a maximum temperature of about 100 F. The operating conditions of these compressors {{permit the use of}} an epoxy that is compatible with the R 12 fluid. The desired finished product is a stainless steel tube that has been filled solid with epoxy after thermocouple wires bonded and sealed by epoxy have been inserted through its length. <b>Shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> extends from both ends of the tube. The process that was developed to isolate the thermocouple wires from the R 12 fluid follows. For this application, use an 8 -in. -long piece of 0. 500 -in. 304 stainless steel tube with six pairs of 24 -gauge stranded, PTFE-insulated (polytetrafluoroethylene) type "T" thermocouple wires for each feedthrough. Use <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> to strain relief the insulated wires at their exit from the stainless steel tube. Cut the wire to length and identify the location of the stainless steel tube sleeve with masking tape. Then, remove the outer insulation from a 2 -in. section of wire that will be inside the tube, and carefully strip to bare wire a 1 -in. section {{in the middle of the}} section with the outer insulation removed. For an effective seal, the epoxy must penetrate between the strands when stranded conductors are used. Make the seal with epoxy bond on the bare wire. The bare wire must be encapsulated with a thin layer of the epoxy that leaves only a very low profile. These encapsulated wires must cure before the assembly can be continued. Then, inspect the cured wires for complete encapsulation before going to the next step. Insert the wires in the stainless steel tube and orient them so that the epoxied stripped sections are staggered within the tube; then, apply <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing</b> to one end of the cleaned wires, positioning it inside the edge of the tube. The small gaps between the wires on the other end will be used to inject the epoxy into the tube. Let the epoxy cure inside the tube, free of any voids. Then, continue to fill the tube until the entire 8 -in. length is nearly filled, allowing room for the other strain-relieving <b>shrink</b> <b>tubing.</b> Since this first design, the process has been adjusted to fit many needs and situations. Customized feedthroughs have been assembled from various wire types, wire gauges, and/or stainless steel tube passages. The fittings selected to mount these feedthroughs allow their use in other areas, such as pressure or vacuum systems...|$|R
