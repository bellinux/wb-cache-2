It is often caused by sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, or viruses which will not grow in bacterial cultures. Sterile pyuria is listed as a side effect from some medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen).

One case is a 48 year-old blind male with an asymptomatic papulo-pustular eruption over the glans and, the other is a 51 year-old male who had kidney transplantation in March 2004, and was referred to our transplantation clinic nine months later with papulonecrotic ulcer on the glans which did not respond to antibiotic therapy. Both patients responded well to anti-TB treatment. Our cases suggest that every papulonecrotic lesion on the glans must raise the suspicion of TB, and an underlying active or healed focus of TB should be thoroughly searched. Also, it is very important, particularly in endemic areas, that prior to transplanting a male patient, his female partner must be examined for TB of the genitalia...|$|R

In the second phase all subjects who were ''positive'' at the screening, as well as a sample who were ''negative'', were examined by means of a semistructured interview. When necessary, clinical and laboratory investigations were performed. The estimated prevalence of psychiatric cases was 6. 4 %. A significant risk was associated with age and education. Somatic diseases frequently associated with psychiatric disorders were <b>genitourinary</b> tract disorders, <b>tuberculosis</b> and disabling cardiopathies.

A 16 -month prospective study was conducted within an ongoing cohort study of HIV infection at a New York City methadone program with on-site primary care services. The study group consisted of 212 seropositive and 264 seronegative drug injectors.

Eighty-one percent of the drug injectors in the study voluntarily used on-site primary care services in the methadone program. Those who were HIV-seropositive made more frequent visits than those who were seronegative (mean annual visits 8. 6 versus 4. 1, P <. 001), which increased with declining CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts; 79 percent of those who were seropositive with CD 4 counts of less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter received on-site zidovudine therapy or prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or both. Common primary care diagnoses for patients seropositive for HIV included not only conditions specific to the human immunodeficiency virus but also bacterial pneumonia, <b>tuberculosis,</b> <b>genitourinary</b> infections, asthma, dermatologic disease, psychiatric illness, and complications of substance abuse; those who were seronegative were most frequently seen for upper respiratory infection, psychiatric illness, complications of substance abuse, musculoskeletal disease, hypertension, asthma, and diabetes mellitus.

40|$|Background: Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the major}} health {{problems}} in India. <b>Genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> comprises 20 % of all extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and is the most common extrapulmonary system to be affected by this disease. The recent surge in the incidence of HIV-infected patients in India has further ignited the fury. Though the members of the Mycobacterium species are well identified, the incidence could not be controlled due to its complex etiopathogenesis and genetic background. Pathological Spectrum: The spectrum of pathological changes of <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> is wide, which varies from normal morphology to markedly scarred kidney, bladder, and epididymis with autocystectomy. A thorough knowledge is required to prevent the end-stage complications. The sequel can be detrimental for the patientâ²s physical, behavioral, psychological, and financial health. Diagnostic Dilemmas: Though culture and polymerase chain reaction are available for the detection of tuberculosis, the sensitivity and specificity varies widely and one should be aware.

40|$|<b>Genitourinary</b> <b>{{tuberculosis}},</b> {{the second}} most common extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB), is very difficult to diagnose unless one maintains a high index of suspicion. Isolated tuberculous epididymitis (ITE), defined as tuberculous epididymitis without clinical evidence of either renal or prostate involvement, is a rare entity among <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> When diagnosed correctly, ITE can be cured with anti-TB medications. However, patients with poor response to medical treatment may require surgery. Here, we report a 20 -year-old man who presented with a slow-growing painless scrotal tumor for 2 months, with the initial workup suspicious for a right paratesticular tumor. Surgical resection of the tumor was therefore scheduled. However, severe pain and redness over the patient's right hemi-scrotum were noted on the day of surgery. A repeat scrotal ultrasound was performed that revealed findings suggesting a chronic inflammatory process rather than a malignancy.

40|$|SUMMARYBACKGROUND. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antibiotic therapy efficacy of quinolones in <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS. Twenty nine patients with urinary tuberculosis were treated with ofloxacin (200 mg/ 12 h, 6 months), rifampin (600 mg/day, 3 months) and isoniazid (300 mg/day, 3 months) between 1989 and 1992. All patients, new cases, were diagnosed by isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one of the three morning urine samples. Bacteriological culture conversion (negativization) was assesed as a clinical guide of efficacy, comparing it, as the only parameter, against a control group (150 patients) with <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> and conventional therapy. Bacteriological follow-up studies were performed in both groups monthly for 6 months, then again 6 months later and then every year for 10 years after completion of treatment. RESULTS. In the 29 patients, the initial culture was positive with over 100 colonies per culture (62 %), and the smear was positive in 56 % of the patients. All strains were susceptible to rifampicin, isoniazid and ofloxacin. Three patients discontinued therapy, one due to liver disease and another due to an allergic reaction and the third for not compliance. Beginning with the first month of treatment, the bacteriological conversion was 92. 6 % (first and second month) and 100 % in the remaining controls. In the control group, wich received conventional treatment, the conversion was: 90 %, 87 %, 93 % and 100 % in the remaining controls. Treatment with ofloxacin showed a bacteriological conversion similar to the conventional treatment (p> 0. 05, Fisher`s exact test). CONCLUSION. After 10 years of patient follow-up, we conclude that ofloxacin, in combination with rifampin and isoniazid (both for 3 monts only) is effective in <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> providing satisfactory bacteriological and clinical efficacy...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Although {{tuberculosis}} (TB) is a curable disease, {{it continues}} {{to be one of the}} leading infections associated with death in the world. Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) occurs in approximately 10 % of the total cases, presenting with lymph nodes, pleura, bone and genitourinary tract as the most common locations. <b>Genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> the second most common EPTB, is very difficult to diagnose unless there is a high index of suspicion. Isolated TB orchitis or prostatitis without clinical evidence of renal involvement is a rare entity among <b>genitourinary</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> We presented the first reported case of TB prostatitis and orchitis associated with pulmonary TB and the presence of an acute massive caseous pneumonia in an immunocompetent man. Despite the anti-TB therapy, the patient presented a rapid progression of disease and deterioration of general conditions taking to death, which occurred four days after TB treatment had started. Disseminated TB is a relatively uncommon cause of acute massive caseous pneumonia; however, there should always be suspicion of the disease, since it is a potentially treatable cause. This rare case supports the assertion that TB should be considered as an important differential diagnosis of genitourinary tumors irrespective of evidence of active TB elsewhere in the body...|$|E
