500|$|Metal Storm {{reviewed}} the DVD {{recording of the}} live performance and called it [...] "a perfect way to discover the music of Wednesday 13 that I could describe as a mix of Glam with Punk". Justin Donnelly {{reviewed the}} album for The Metal Forge and wrote favorably about the DVD portion: [...] "Shot with six cameras, Fuck It, We'll Do It Live is a raw and honest representation of Wednesday 13 live in concert". A review by Metal Rage was critical of the DVD, but praised the audio on the CD: [...] "All in all I definitely recommend the CD, 'cause you <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> representative image of what a good Wednesday 13 show sounds like." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon's {{character}} Will Hunting says, [...] "I wanna {{move up to}} Nashua, <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little spread, {{get some}} sheep and tend to them," [...] to Robin Williams' character Sean.|$|E
2500|$|In a talking-head interview, in {{the episode}} [...] "Tallahassee", Dwight {{talks about how}} first {{impressions}} last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that [...] "slightly rubbed [...] the wrong way", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode [...] "The Whale", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his best friend and ensures that she and Jim <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.|$|E
50|$|Borislav Ivkov vs Bent Larsen, Santa Monica 1966, Queen's Indian Defence (E16), 1-0 Larsen {{defeated}} Ivkov {{in their}} match, {{and had the}} career edge, but Ivkov <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> win here.|$|R
5000|$|The second man, Lord Peter Wimsey, says: “Nowhere [...] [...] [...] De mortuis” {{and then}} some [...] [...] [...] Yes, {{he seems to be}} <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> derangement of epitaphs, poor old creature.” ...|$|R
50|$|A {{troublesome}} Senator {{agrees to}} leave politics behind if he <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> diplomatic posting. But, {{unfortunately for the}} Central Policy Unit, Phillip is about {{to give a speech}} outlining a plan commissioned by the PM announcing restrictions that mean only the most qualified people are eligible for appointment as ambassadors for the nation.|$|R
2500|$|The second puppy clip is {{also called}} the Scandinavian clip or puppy clip. It was invented by Swedish and Norwegian show groomers in the 1970s. It {{is the most common}} one in all sizes for shows in Europe, and is allowed for adult poodles to be shown in the FCI countries. The face, throat, belly, feet and the base of the tail are shaved five to seven days before the show to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> smooth {{appearance}} of the shaved areas. The hair on the head is left to form a [...] "topknot", fixed in place using latex bands, because in most European countries, hair spray is banned. The rest of the dog is shaped with scissors.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} segments along the route occur in this area as the train clings precariously to the mountainsides – particularly Groundhog Mountain and Mount Cheadle. One place in particular is known as Little Hells Gate (Port d'Enfer), an area featuring treacherous rapids on the river similar to those in Hells Gate farther south on the Fraser River. Passengers will note railway slide fences {{on one side of the}} train. These wire fences protect the tracks and train from falling debris. When a wire breaks or is compromised, it sends a signal to stop or proceed at a much slower speed. As it is, the train creeps along at a cautious pace – [...] – along this stretch. It is not difficult to see why. On the other side of the train are views to the North Thompson River down below as well as toward the often-snow-covered mountains in the distance. One of the prettiest sights in this area is of Pyramid Falls, which cascades [...] down the side of Mount Cheadle. The train slows down enough for passengers to get close-up looks and maybe <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> picture or two. The Cariboo Mountains and Slide Mountain are to the west. Malton Range is to the east. The train crosses the Canoe River over a [...] bridge shortly before arriving Valemount. It was also south of Valemount and north of the Canoe River where the Canoe River crash occurred on November 21, 1950. Memorials can be seen from the train. The icefields of the Albreda Glacier should be visible for several miles.|$|E
6000|$|As {{she did not}} {{immediately}} reply, he continued uneasily, [...] "Miss Preston says we kin <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little house that is near the Fort, until we want to build." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{preference}} for easy arrests, rather than [...] "bag of shit" [...] cases who require supervision or medical treatment. One sergeant said: [...] "Listen, don't bring Mr. Medicine into the stationhouse, because he's {{going to get}} free medical care from us that we all pay for, OK, and plus then he <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> police escort the whole time that he's there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, {{friend of}} my youth. We have no secrets from each other. I know you're after what's in there, {{and you know that}} I know. I don't want to harp on it, but you'll be {{spending}} to-night in the house, and I think you had better make up your mind to spend it in your room, <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> sleep to prepare you for your journey. Do you follow me, old friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a smart wench, Lucy," [...] he persisted; [...] "I {{mean to do}} well by ye, and <b>get</b> ye <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> {{place down}} river; and you'll soon <b>get</b> another husband,--such <b>a</b> likely gal as you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Purday at last, [...] "if pigs was reasonable, {{you might}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little one to fat, at Kattern Hill fair, somewhere about ten shillings, or maybe twelve--{{sometimes}} more, sometimes less." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll have {{to guard}} against accidents," [...] admonished Marilla. [...] "Anne, if Mr. Shearer comes today <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> roast and some steak. If he doesn't you'll have to kill a fowl for dinner tomorrow." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CICELY. No: he'll {{treat me}} like one of Nature's gentlemen: look at his {{perfectly}} splendid face! (Addressing Osman {{as if he were}} her oldest and most attached retainer.) Osman: be sure you choose me a good horse; and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> strong camel for my luggage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{sit down}} by the window and watch for it," [...] said Mary Margaret to herself. [...] "Then, when it is lighted, I'll <b>get</b> up <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> warm supper for Mother and Uncle Martin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} the carpet up in the dining-room," [...] added Mrs. Langford, [...] "and Daniels, the carpenter, shall bring his violin, and we can <b>get</b> up <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little set for a dance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I guess you'd be, too, Urner, if {{you could}} <b>get</b> such <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> girl to notice you," [...] {{returned}} Tom dryly. And then he added: [...] "You must remember we are all old friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be better, at first," [...] said I, [...] "to call upon them in the name of about twopence a head. Then, when we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little body of adherents to begin with, the other {{subjects}} will fall in, of their own accord, if we manage the thing right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't {{possibly}} get out anywhere, {{and as soon}} we 've cut up the candy, we 'll unbolt the door and run. Come and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> dish to put it in," [...] said Fan, when Polly proposed to go halves with Tom, lest he should come bursting in somehow, and seize the whole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, thank you," [...] Mrs. Conway replied. [...] "Now that I am fairly {{awake and}} realize where I am, I am {{perfectly}} {{ready to get}} up. I could not think the first moment I opened my eyes where I had got to, and fancied I had overslept myself and should <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> scolding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll have to {{skin that}} wolf," [...] said Gif. [...] "Spouter, you can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> rug out of it, or maybe use the fur {{for some kind}} of a garment." ...|$|R
5000|$|When first {{announced}} in late 2007, the Kama was simply dubbed the [...] "Wireless Nunchuck". It was given its final name shortly before its release, upon which IGN observed that Nyko had [...] "molded the Kama body very much {{along the lines}} of the Nunchuck's curves and ergonomics, and at first grasp the two feel nearly identical." [...] Likewise, CNET said that [...] "the only real difference between the Kama and original are the C and Z trigger buttons, which have <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> transparent makeover. The joystick, however, is nearly identical." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Miss Annie, we haven't no pig," [...] said Mrs. Higgins. [...] "Ben says, says he, 'Mother, when I'm {{taken on}} for carter boy, see if I don't <b>get</b> you <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little pig, as will eat the garden stuff, {{and pay the}} rent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|When the {{landlord}} himself had preceded them up-stairs {{to the two}} rooms which the shoeman had engaged for the Applebys at the Star Hotel, Father chuckled: [...] "Does it look more possible, now, with these rooms, eh? Let's see, we must <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little picture of a kitten in a basket, to hang over that radiator. Drat {{the landlord}}, I thought he'd stick here all evening, and--I want to kiss you, my old honey, my comrade!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{that puts}} me {{in mind of}} a story!" [...] put in Shadow, eagerly. [...] "A girl {{who was going to}} get married had a shower, as they call 'em. Well, a wag of the town--maybe he was sore because he couldn't marry the girl himself--told all his friends, in private, that she was very anxious to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> bread-box. The shower was to be a surprise, and it was, too, for when it came off the girl got exactly eleven bread-boxes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I know that," [...] he said; {{and with}} this a perverse desire to tempt her to the impossibility awoke in him, though he was really quite cold about the affair himself now. [...] "Fulkerson thought we could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> flat in New York for about what the {{interest}} and taxes came to here, and provisions are cheaper. But I should rather not experiment at my time of life. If I could have been caught younger, I might have been inured to New York, but I don't believe I could stand it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's no dew!' said Clara; 'and {{if there}} was, {{it would not}} hurt, and if it did, I should be too glad to catch a cold, or {{something}} to keep me at home. Oh, if I could only <b>get</b> into <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> precarious state of health!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, let's go to Brighton, Philip, I like Brighton, you <b>get</b> such <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> {{class of}} people there." [...] Philip had vaguely thought of some little fishing village in Cornwall, but as she spoke it {{occurred}} to him that Mildred would be bored to death there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{it is like}} a bit of England, Master Wilfrid! That {{might very}} well be the Thames there, and this some gentleman's place near Reading; only the trees are different. When we <b>get</b> up <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> house here, with a garden round it, it will be like home again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{you think}} the large Adelaide {{photograph}} very sad. I really don't remember it; I fancy I thought it a very fair likeness. But you know that I have a heavy lumpy dull look, except when talking--indeed, then too for aught I know--and this may {{be mistaken for a}} sad look when it is only a dull stupid one. You can't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> picture out of an ugly face, so it's no use trying, but you are not looking for that kind of thing. You want to see how far the face is any index of the character and life and work.|$|E
6000|$|Rolled-up beds {{went flying}} over the rail; lashed chests went sliding down the gangway--mighty few of both at that. [...] "The rest is having a cruise off the Cape," [...] {{explained}} Knowles enigmatically to a dock-loafer {{with whom he had}} struck a sudden friendship. Men ran, calling to one another, hailing utter strangers to [...] "lend a hand with the dunnage," [...] then with sudden decorum approached the mate to shake hands before going ashore.--"Good-bye, sir," [...] they repeated in various tones. Mr. Baker grasped hard palms, grunted in a friendly manner at every one, his eyes twinkled.--"Take care of your money, Knowles. Ough! Soon <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> wife if you do." [...] The lame man was delighted.--"Good-bye, sir," [...] said Belfast, with emotion, wringing the mate's hand, and looked up with swimming eyes. [...] "I thought I would take 'im ashore with me," [...] he went on, plaintively. Mr. Baker did not understand, but said kindly:--"Take care of yourself, Craik," [...] and the bereaved Belfast went over the rail mourning and alone.|$|E
60|$|After an {{interval}} the man spoke to me. He said that {{my friend was}} a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school. I was going to reply indignantly {{that we were not}} National School boys to be whipped, as he called it; but I remained silent. He began to speak on the subject of chastising boys. His mind, as if magnetised again by his speech, seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre. He said that when boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well whipped. When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a good sound whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good: what he wanted was to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> warm whipping. I was surprised at this sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face. As I did so I met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from under a twitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what we {{have set}} our minds on, and {{what we were going}} to save up our money to <b>get,</b> was <b>a</b> piano for George's mother. I heard her say that we could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> one for about thirty pounds, and it would be splendid if you were all to give it her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{we always}} do it Sundays and Thanksgivings? Wouldn't Ma wish the {{children}} kept safe and warm anyhow? Can I <b>get</b> up <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> dinner with four rascals under my feet all the time? Come, now, if you want roast turkey and onions, plum-puddin' and mince-pie, you'll have to do as I tell you, and be lively about it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “...all I {{want you}} to do for me is <b>get</b> me <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> private room.” Well, there she went on her way to speak to the owner of the hospital, and they were terribly nice. They got me a huge private room, lots of space, very nice...and just to keep me company, they put eighty-five other {{patients}} in the room! ...|$|R
