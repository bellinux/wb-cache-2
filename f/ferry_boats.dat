5|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} decreased from 12.3 million passengers in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949, due to passengers switching from SIRT to city-operated buses due to a bus fare cut. On September 5, 1948, 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut; the express service would be reduced during rush hours, and all night trains after 1:29 A. M. would be cancelled. Thirty percent of the company's personnel were laid off. On September 7, 1948, Staten Island Borough President Cornelius Hall continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers. Previously, they said, the trains pulled out with only one boatload of passengers. On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. On September 22, 1948, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries, Inc of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16.|$|E
50|$|The River Dee <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat</b> Disaster {{occurred}} on the 5th April 1876. Thirty two people drowned {{in the mouth of}} the River Dee, Aberdeenshire, Scotland when their <b>ferry</b> <b>boat</b> capsized. Overcrowding, fast flowing current and a poorly spliced wire rope were blamed.|$|R
50|$|The {{provincial road}} was opened in 1951. From 1951 to 1986, {{one had to}} cross the Matalag River with a <b>ferry</b> <b>boat</b> made out of bamboos and drum. The <b>ferry</b> <b>boat</b> loaded only one jeep or bus at a time. Traveling to Rizal from Tuao to Tuguegarao or vice versa {{in those days was}} slow and {{tiresome}} because it took the <b>ferry</b> <b>boat</b> almost an hour to ferry its load to and {{from the other side of}} the river. Vehicles were ferried on a first-come, first-served basis.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat</b> has been traced {{as far back as}} 1822, when it is thought to have been called the Horse Packet. It was known as the Steam Barge by 1830, and in 1867 its name was changed to the Steam Packet. It was first known as the <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat</b> in 1925. In the mid 1970s a second bar was opened in a {{converted}} boat shed {{at the rear of the}} pub. It was here that the pub began putting on live music. The <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat</b> was originally a venue for cover bands, but in the late 1990s local promoters began booking their own nights at the venue to put on local originals bands, and touring bands from all over the world. Over the next few years the <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat</b> became established as one of the most important venues for local bands, catering for all types of alternative music, with a leaning towards punk rock, ska punk, metal, hardcore and Post-rock. In 2005 a protest was held after the <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat</b> faced losing its public entertainment licence due to noise complaints from residents of a newly built block of flats nearby. The protest was a success, and the <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat's</b> licence was renewed. However the <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boat</b> was forced to close a year later in 2006 due to continued noise complaints and financial difficulty. The final gig was an all-day-long event featuring local bands with Norwich based five piece Dragline closing the night to a sweaty room packed to full capacity.|$|R

25|$|Steam powered <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> {{replaced}} the old pole boats in 1873. These boats were much heavier and required deeper water {{to cross the}} Susquehanna River.

These walls are still used today and {{are an important part}} of the ferry's designation as a Registered Historic Place.|$|E

25|$|Two companies, Bristol <b>Ferry</b> <b>Boats</b> and Number Seven Boat Trips, operate {{scheduled}} passenger {{ferry boat}} services in Bristol Harbour in {{the centre of}} Bristol. The services run {{the length of the}} harbour from Hotwells to Bristol Temple Meads railway station via SS Great Britain and The Centre, serving 15 landing stages. They are used for both commuting and leisure purposes.|$|E
25|$|Rivers form {{physical}} {{boundaries and}} are only crossed with either trouble or expense. At {{the port of}} Irvine itself <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> took passengers across to Ardeer, further upstream fords and /or stepping stones were present in many places. These were often treacherous and could turn from tranquil to lethal {{in a matter of}} minutes, often with no warning as the rainfall could well have fallen far upstream or at the moors that form the watershed.|$|E
25|$|The {{abolition}} of tax-free sales on <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> travelling between destinations within the European Union made Finland demand {{an exception for}} the Åland Islands on the European Union value added tax rules. The exception allows for maintained tax-free sales on the ferries between Sweden and Finland (provided they stop at Mariehamn or Långnäs) and at the airport, but has also made Åland a different tax-zone, meaning that tariffs must be levied on goods brought to the islands.|$|E

25|$|P. T. Barnum, {{the famous}} circus owner, owned a {{tract of land}} which ran through the village. His {{intention}} was to make Port Jefferson the home base for his circus. The residents {{put a stop to}} his plans, and he eventually sold his land. Barnum Avenue now runs though the area that was once his land, and one of the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson <b>Ferry</b> <b>boats</b> is named the P.T. Barnum. A house he had constructed also still exists but is privately owned.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} anachronistic {{yet still}} widely used system of reaction <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning {{the river at}} a height of 20 or 30 metres. To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45° from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.|$|E
25|$|Santa Fe {{maintained}} and operated {{a fleet of}} three passenger <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> (the San Pablo, the San Pedro, and the Ocean Wave) that connected Richmond, California with San Francisco by water. The ships traveled the eight miles between the San Francisco Ferry Terminal and the railroad's Point Richmond terminal across San Francisco Bay. The service was originally established as {{a continuation of the}} company's named passenger train runs such as the Angel and the Saint. The larger two ships (the San Pablo and the San Pedro) carried Fred Harvey Company dining facilities.|$|E

25|$|In 1801 Floyd {{moved to}} Clarksville, Indiana. In {{the same year}} Floyd became Deputy Sheriff of Clark County and the Clark County Recorder. Floyd, along with his father, was {{appointed}} to the Clarksville Board of Trustees. Floyd would <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> through the Falls of the Ohio rapids until 1808. Floyd was elected as a Clark County delegate to the territory's slavery convention in 1802, the convention would set in motion events that would attempt to legalize slavery and indentured servitude in the Indiana Territory. Floyd would become the Sheriff of Clark County in 1803 and served until 1806.|$|E
25|$|Ferries often {{replaced}} these earlier fording points, {{and were}} essential {{where the water}} was too deep, such as the tidal section of the lower river. As they were a source of income, they were recorded in the Domesday Book {{at a number of}} locations including Weston on Trent and Fiskerton, both of which were still in operation {{in the middle of the}} 20th century. The <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> used along the Trent ranged in size from small rowing boats, to flat decked craft that could carry livestock, horses, and in some case their associated carts or wagons.|$|E
25|$|AT {{maintained}} and operated {{a fleet of}} three passenger <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> that connected the railroad with San Francisco by water. Ships traveled the eight miles between the San Francisco Ferry Terminal and the railroad's Point Richmond terminal across the Bay. The service was originally established as {{a continuation of the}} company's named passenger train runs such as the Angel and the Saint. The larger two ships, the San Pablo and the San Pedro, each featured a newsstand-lunch counter located on the main deck, and a dining room on the upper deck. Meals, sandwiches, sweet rolls, pastries, and coffee were served. AT discontinued ferry service in 1933 due to the effects of the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|There {{are large}} <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> that link islands {{as well as}} fast ferries linking most of the islands. Both types can {{transport}} large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles). Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel relatively quickly (in excess of 30 knots) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some 20 knots). A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about 2 {{and a half hours}} and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.|$|E
25|$|Transport: Primary {{transportation}} on {{the island}} is by privately owned used car or car-rental for visitors. The Waiheke Bus Company (owned by Fullers) services most inhabited parts of the island, linking to the ferry sailings from Matiatia. Numerous other taxi, shuttle, bus and boutique services cater to visitors. Due to the hills, bicycles {{on the island}} tended {{to be limited to}} the young and fit, including an active mountain bike group, until the advent of ebikes. With an ebike rental company in Oneroa that also sells ebikes, they are becoming a common feature on both local roads, and on the <b>ferry</b> <b>boats</b> to the mainland. Walking continues to be a popular means of island transport, both for access and recreation with many walking trails that are not along roads. Horse riding tends to be for recreation rather than transport, but the island does support both a pony club and adult riding club.|$|E
25|$|In the Arabi Park area, {{the surge}} crossed over {{elevated}} railroad tracks {{and the resultant}} wave washed many homes off of their foundations, and completely destroyed others. Again, as in Hurricane Betsy the locals immediately began evacuating themselves and their neighbors using private boats. They {{brought them to the}} Mississippi river levee, which for several days was the only dry ground {{on the east side of}} the river for many miles. Local officials including U.S. Wildlife and Fisheries agents stationed in the parish moved quickly to seal off the area and supply food and water to the survivors. A makeshift evacuation was begun by confiscating small <b>ferry</b> <b>boats,</b> and moving the people to the west bank of the river at Algiers Point, where buses were used to move them out of the area. Most of this activity was not covered by the media due to the greater coverage of nearby New Orleans.|$|E
