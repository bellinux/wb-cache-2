25|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the adjacent community of Northport is a significant economic activity, with landings by fishing boats totalling 3 million <b>kilograms</b> of <b>species</b> such as American lobster, mussels, snow crab, soft shell clams, cod, herring, American plaice, mackerel, sea scallop, yellowtail, eel, winter flounder, smelt, rock crab, tomcod, silversides, porbeagle, and blue shark.|$|R
50|$|This genus {{consists}} of large-sized catfishes. H. wyckioides {{is the largest}} Bagrid catfish in central Indochina and may reach 80 <b>kilograms.</b> It includes <b>species</b> with depressed (flattened) heads, rugose (ridged or wrinkled) head shields not covered by skin, and moderately long adipose fins.|$|R
50|$|The lake has rich eco-diversity {{and holds}} {{many species of}} blue-green algae. Large brown trout {{are found in the}} lake, up to about seven <b>kilograms.</b> About 26 <b>species</b> of {{vascular}} plant exist in the area, with Asteraceae the most commonly found species. Other species commonly found in the region are: Ranunculaceae, Compositae, Cruciferae, Gramineae, Apiaceae, Leguminosae, Scrophulariaceae and Polygonaceae.|$|R
50|$|When {{trying to}} {{determine}} the differences between these species, a few noticeable traits stand out. The first difference is size; C. villosus is the larger species. It can grow to a length of 34 cm. C. vellerosus is much smaller, being able to fit {{in the palm of}} a hand when fully grown, usually weighing only a <b>kilogram.</b> Both <b>species</b> are covered with much more hair than any other armadillos, mostly sprouting from its underside or between the bony plates along its back. When C. villosus is sexually aroused with an erect penis, species determination is easier. Its penis can be as long as 35 mm, and usually remains completely withdrawn inside a skin receptacle. The lesser hairy armadillo can usually be found in higher altitudes because its smaller size and slower metabolic rate helps it survive in areas with less food.|$|R
50|$|The order Peramelemorphia {{includes}} the bandicoots and bilbies: it equates approximately {{to the mainstream}} of marsupial omnivores. All members of the order are endemic to the twin land masses of Australia-New Guinea and most have the characteristic bandicoot shape: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, very large upright ears, relatively long, thin legs, and a thin tail. Their size varies from about 140 grams up to 4 <b>kilograms,</b> but most <b>species</b> are about {{the weight of a}} half-grown kitten: somewhere around one kilogram.|$|R
500|$|Poaching of Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is a {{cause for}} concern, {{as the price of}} its horn has been estimated as high as US$30,000 per <b>kilogram.</b> This <b>species</b> has been overhunted for many centuries, leading to the current greatly reduced– and still declining– population. The rhinos are difficult to observe and hunt directly (one field researcher spent seven weeks in a treehide near a salt lick without ever observing a rhino directly), so poachers make use of spear traps and pit traps. In the 1970s, uses of the rhinoceros's body parts among the local people of Sumatra were documented, {{such as the use of}} rhino horns in amulets and a folk belief that the horns offer some protection against poison. Dried rhinoceros meat was used as medicine for diarrhea, leprosy, and tuberculosis. [...] "Rhino oil", a concoction made from leaving a rhino's skull in coconut oil for several weeks, may be used to treat skin diseases. The extent of use and belief in these practices is not known. Rhinoceros horn was once believed to be widely used as an aphrodisiac; in fact traditional Chinese medicine never used it for this purpose. Nevertheless, hunting in this species has primarily been driven by a demand for rhino horns with supposedly medicinal properties.|$|R
40|$|In this study, pomfret fishery {{data were}} {{collected}} from the 93 commercial fishing trawlers from July 2008 to June 2009 in Bangladesh. Total fish production of these fishing trawlers was 30191. 071 MetricTons (MT). Among them, the estimated catch of pomfret was 305. 466 MT of which caught within total 18651961. 05 hours and an average catch per hour of pomfret was 0. 016 <b>kilogram</b> (kg). Three <b>species</b> of pomfret were recorded under the family stromateidae and carangidae. The average tow duration of per trawler per day was 16. 25 hours. The percentage contribution by weight showed that, the highest catchof percentage was 1. 88 and the lowest was 0. 38; and the average catch percentage of pomfret was 1. 01 of the total fish production in the trawl fishing. The highest landing of pomfret was recorded 65. 460 MTin the month of November, 2008 and lowest was 1. 146 MT in July, 2008 at the same study period...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Woody biomass {{transportation}} costs and market values/costs are strongly {{correlated with the}} woody biomass moisture content. Properly managing moisture content can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages in biomass energy markets. Good management requires accurate moisture content measurements. Therefore, availability of accurate, precise, reliable, and efficient tools to assess woody biomass moisture content is essential. In this study, six different tools (Fibre-Gen HM 200, IML Hammer, Humimeter BLW, Timbermaster, Humimeter HM 1 and Wile Bio Meter) were evaluated. The six tools employed three different measurement technologies; acoustic, conductance, and capacitance. Woody biomass samples were collected over one season (summer 2011) at three different locations in western Oregon (Corvallis, Dallas, and Clatskanie) for three softwood species and three hardwood species: Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa L.), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), hybrid poplar (Populus spp.), Madrone (Arbutus spp.), and Garryana Oak (Quercus garryana Dougl. ex Hook). Twenty 3 -meter long log (20 to 400 mm diameter) specimens were collected per species; 18 specimens {{were divided into two}} different treatments (open vs. covered), and the two remaining specimens were chipped. In addition, approximately 100 <b>kilograms</b> per <b>species</b> of hogfuel (limbs and tops) were collected and chipped. Moisture content measurements of logs, chips, and hogfuel were made regularly over a four month period. These data was used to develop multiple linear regression models for assessing the moisture content of the six species using the six tools. The major factors considered in the regression models were species (6), treatment (2), and tools (6). The data were also used to estimate the sample size needed for each tool. The best tool from each technology type was identified. The results generated from this study show that (1) none of the tools are accurate without calibration for different species, (2) the best model/tool combination could only explain about 80...|$|R
5000|$|Sumatran {{rhinoceroses}} {{were once}} quite numerous throughout Southeast Asia. Fewer than 100 individuals are now estimated to remain. The species is classed as critically endangered (primarily due to illegal poaching) while the last survey in 2008 estimated that around 250 individuals survived. From the early 1990s, the population decline {{was estimated at}} more than 50% per decade, and the small, scattered populations now face high risks of inbreeding depression. Most remaining habitat is in relatively inaccessible mountainous areas of Indonesia.

5000|$|The {{southern}} {{bluefin tuna}} ranching industry reported increasing interactions with fur seals in the 2010s. Marcus Stehr, son of Hagen Stehr and executive of the Stehr Group told The Advertiser in 2012 that fur seal interactions were costing their {{southern bluefin tuna}} ranching aquaculture business [...] "at least $1 million" [...] annually. He stated:"Seals cost the entire industry millions of dollars every year and we do need support from the State Government {{to look at how}} we manage them. In SA we have failed to develop any strategies to manage growing seal numbers and it's vital that this begins."In 2013 Brian Jeffriess told The Advertiser:"Attacks by seals are a major problem for tuna ranching. They are the largest cause of tuna deaths in the pontoons and frighten the other tuna so they do not eat for days."In 2013 The Advertiser reported that New Zealand fur seals ate an average of 4.5 <b>kilograms</b> of marine <b>species</b> each per day. At that time the state population was estimated at over 85,000 animals. In 2015, Dr Brad Page told the ABC that the population had reached 100,000 animals. He also stated that most of the fur seals' diet consists of red bait and arrow squid, and not species which are typically caught and sold for human consumption.|$|R
