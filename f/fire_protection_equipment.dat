50|$|Fire engineering's roots {{date back}} to Ancient Rome, when the Emperor Nero ordered the city to be rebuilt {{utilizing}} passive <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> methods, such as space separation and non-combustible building materials, after a catastrophic fire. The discipline of fire engineering emerged in the early 20th century as a distinct discipline, separate from civil, mechanical and chemical engineering, in response to new fire problems posed by the Industrial Revolution. <b>Fire</b> <b>protection</b> engineers of this era concerned themselves with devising methods to protect large factories, particularly spinning mills and other manufacturing properties. Another motivation to organize the discipline, define practices and conduct research to support innovations {{was in response to}} the catastrophic conflagrations and mass urban fires that swept many major cities during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (see city or area fires).

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of thesis I want to describe few primary characteristics of the South Bohemia Region. It is a region with unique characteristics, which is frequently visited by domestic and foreign tourists. It is popular for its clean environment, historic monuments and especially for sport and recreational activities near water areas, which South Bohemia region has plenty of. Tourists are also frequently seeking recreational boating activities as ferry services for their travel and recration. The development of this economic phenomenon means more employment opportunities for the region, but it also increases chances of accidents and emergencies due to an unforseen accidents which can threaten the lives and wellbeing of the crew and the environment. <b>Fire</b> <b>protection</b> units should be fitted for an emergencies such as: drowning, drowned person search, icy water search and rescue and rescue in stream waters. The thesis is divided into the theoretical and the practical parts. The theoretical part deals with the definition of basic terms describing the issue of fire of the vessels {{as well as the}} tasks and procedures during fire fighting operations. It also presents a possible danger to rescuers exposed during operations such as rescue from the vessel burning on the water. There is a listing of the basic terms related to the complex vessel shape and the aquatic characteristics of the vessel. The practical part deals with the study of publications and current legislation, analysis of the <b>Fire</b> <b>protection</b> Units <b>equipment</b> and their readines for rescue work in case of a vessel fire. The enclosed data map illustrates a water area with ferry service in the South Bohemia Region and selected boarding platforms for <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> units. It describes the use of container technology; modern and economical way of transportation used by the Fire and Rescue Service of South Bohemia Region since 2004. The proposed fire vessel, mounted on a standardize container frame and equipped with special container with stored technical equipment will be transported to the location of event by container carrier from FRS of South Bohemia Region. My theosis also describes the <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> <b>fire</b> <b>equipment,</b> personal protective equipment, equipment for working with hazardous substances, rescue tools, communication and portable emergency equipment which is normally used by the fire units of FRS of South Bohemia Region. To achieve the objective of the thesis and to answer the research questions, I did rely on the reference material obtained via search of the professional literary sources relevant to the Fire Fighting equipment and carrying out rescue work. To process the diploma thesis I did use the following: controlled interview with the station sergeants of various fire stations of FRS of South Bohemia, a collection of internal acts of the Ministry of Interior - General Directorate of Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, a collection of internal acts - Regional Directorate of FRS of South Bohemia, Regulations of Mechanical services of FRS of CR and the methodological aids of the Ministry of Interior of CR.

40|$|To {{inform the}} Commission {{about the results}} of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff's review of Kaowool fire {{barriers}} at Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2 (FNP) and the staff's plans to address technical issues with Kaowool and FP- 60 barriers. BACKGROUND: In a memorandum dated June 9, 1998, the staff informed the Commission that the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) was evaluating the fireresistive capabilities of Kaowool fire barriers in response to a Task Interface Agreement (TIA) with Region II regarding the barriers installed at FNP. As detailed below, the staff could not find a sound technical basis for concluding that Kaowool barriers provide adequate <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> for <b>equipment</b> that needs to remain functional during and after a nuclear power plant fire. The questions regarding the Kaowool fire barriers at FNP may also apply to FP- 60 barriers and to other plants that use Kaowool or FP- 60 barriers. DISCUSSION: Kaowool is a noncombustible, flexible, ceramic-fiber blanket originally manufactured by Babcock and Wilcox. FP- 60 is basically an upgraded version of Kaowool with aluminum foil laminated to both surfaces. It is manufactured by Thermal Ceramics. Certain reactor licensees wrap Kaowool or FP- 60 blankets around electrical raceways that contain circuits needed to achieve and maintain post-fire safe shutdown. To the best of the staff's knowledge, Kaowool and FP- 60 are used to construct barriers intended to have a 1 -hour fire resistance rating, but not barriers with a 3 -hour rating. Some licensees may also use Kaowool and FP- 60 barriers to separate certain electrical systems in accordance with the guidance of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1. 75, "Physical Independence of Electrical Systems. " The technical issues detailed below apply only to Kaowool and FP- 60 fire barriers installed to protect th...|$|R
