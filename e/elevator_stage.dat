5000|$|On February 7, 1880, The Spirit of the Times announced: [...] "Tonight Mr. J. Steele MacKaye {{will open}} the most {{exquisite}} theatre in the world, and all New York will assemble to do honor to the realization of his artistic visions…Mr. MacKaye will play the drama Hazel Kirke through with only two-minute waits between the acts, and will then exhibit the double stage—one compartment set for the kitchen of Blackburn Mill and other as boudoir at Fairy Grove Villa." [...] MacKaye’s <b>elevator</b> <b>stage</b> was an important development of American drama and theatre. It was {{a solution to the}} problem posed by the increasing use of box sets to reproduce interior scenes in detail. With the <b>elevator</b> <b>stage,</b> multiple scenes could be changed in a fast and detailed way. This greatly improved the speed and efficiency of scenic changes, and that design didn’t have to be simplified, they could still be detailed. The <b>elevator</b> <b>stage</b> was described in Scientific American, April 5, 1884."consists of two theatrical stages, one above another, to be moved up and down as an elevator car is operated in a high building, and so that either one of them can easily and quickly be at any time brought to the proper level for acting thereon in front of the auditorium. While the play is proceeding before the audience, the assistants arrange another scene on the upper stage." ...|$|E
50|$|Several {{important}} technical innovations {{were introduced}} between 1875 and 1914. First gas lighting and then electric lights, introduced in London's Savoy Theatre in 1881, replaced candlelight. The <b>elevator</b> <b>stage</b> was first {{installed in the}} Budapest Opera House in 1884. This allowed entire sections of the stage to be raised, lowered, or tilted to give depth and levels to the scene. The revolving stage was introduced to Europe by Karl Lautenschläger at the Residenz Theatre, Munich in 1896.|$|E
50|$|After the Dungeon section {{the player}} {{must go through}} an <b>elevator</b> <b>stage</b> where the player dodges falling rocks and must jump out at the {{appropriate}} floor to enter the next level. The player cannot explore freely, but instead jumping on the wrong floor forces him to replay the previous level. The Lizard King's throne room {{is located at the}} bottom and can be entered anytime to recover all the gold that the Lizard King has stolen from the player. Unlike everywhere else, here touching the Lizard King leads to an instant death. Artwork for the game was provided by Don Bluth, animator of the original Dragon's Lair laserdisc game.|$|E

50|$|According promise {{strategic}} partners, the new giant {{will have}} all the amenities for both spectators and artists. It will have a floor area of 10,000 square meters, three meeting rooms and press room, nine areas of baths, 20 dining venues, a full 12 dressing rooms, five-door access, <b>elevator,</b> modular <b>stage</b> and 20 exclusive boxes, among others.|$|R
50|$|The 320 m {{platform}} was strategically {{built to}} offer total visibility. It has portable risers which allow choir and orchestra to alternate in mid concert, {{as well as}} a <b>stage</b> <b>elevator</b> for a piano.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, a new annex was {{completed}} {{and added to}} the Opera House on its adjacent lot. It provides disability access to the <b>stage,</b> a freight <b>elevator,</b> additional back <b>stage</b> areas, offices and the Stage Left Café.|$|R
50|$|The Main Stage is {{the largest}} of the theatres in the complex with a {{capacity}} of 1014 seats. (759 Orchestra and 255 Balcony). The theatre is outfitted with state-of-the-art sound and lighting systems. The theatre is accessible on the ground and second level atrium lobbies and via <b>elevator.</b> The <b>stage</b> is 45 ft deep by 100 ft wide, with a 48 ft proscenium opening. There is room for a total of 30 wheelchairs and 31 companion seats.|$|R
50|$|The Met {{is one of}} {{the most}} technologically {{advanced}} stages in the world. Its vast array of hydraulic <b>elevators,</b> motorized <b>stages</b> and rigging systems have made possible the massive staging requirements of grand opera in repertory and have made possible complex productions such as Franco Zeffirelli's 1981 production of La bohème, as well as productions of mammoth operas, including Prokofiev's War and Peace, Verdi's Aida and Wagner's four-part, 16-hour Der Ring des Nibelungen. The Met stage has also been home to several world premieres of operas, including John Corigliano's The Ghosts of Versailles, Phillip Glass's The Voyage and the US premiere of Nico Muhly's Two Boys in 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{stage was}} {{shaped like a}} big flower and {{consisted}} of several <b>elevators</b> throughout the <b>stage</b> floor. Above the stage were six large contractible pieces that could come {{together to create a}} large ball over the entire stage. Above the stage in the centre, a large projector screen faced all sides of the area playing both live footage as well as video backdrops. There were also LED screens in the centre of the stage floor.|$|R
5000|$|As Mickey and Minnie exit stage right, {{the curtain}} rises {{to reveal the}} band [...] - [...] Pluto (in a rare human-like appearance) on trombone, two goats on violins, a Scottish Terrier on sousaphone, a pig on the cornet, Clarabelle Cow on a double bass, two Dachshunds on saxophones, and Horace Horsecollar on a drum set and xylophone; Mickey reappears through a <b>stage</b> <b>elevator</b> to conduct. After several interruptions, Mickey plays a {{clarinet}} and parodies Jazz bandleader Ted Lewis.|$|R
50|$|The Opera has 6 main stages: 1 visible for the audience, and 5 for rehearsals and set preparation. It {{has almost}} {{everything}} needed for opera, ballet etc., including <b>stage</b> <b>elevators,</b> movable balletfloors, etc. The building totals 41,000 m² and has 14 floors, of which 5 are below ground. It {{contains more than}} 1000 rooms, including a large orchestral rehearsal room. Despite its luxurious equipment, there are only approximately 1500 seats because {{a larger number of}} seats would hamper the quality of sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{restoration and}} window replacement {{was completed in}} 1994, and the interior renovation began in 1996. It included restoration of the horseshoe-shaped balcony. An additional 10000 sq ft {{was added to the}} original building {{in order to create a}} full theatrical production facility: a new loading dock, an <b>elevator,</b> a second <b>stage</b> for rehearsal, and dressing rooms. The total cost of the renovation was approximately $5.5 million. Architects for the renovation and addition were Craig Gaulden Davis of Greenville, South Carolina.|$|R
50|$|Major opera houses {{throughout}} the world often have highly mechanized stages, with large <b>stage</b> <b>elevators</b> permitting heavy sets to be changed rapidly. At the Metropolitan Opera, for instance, sets are often changed during the action, as the audience watches, with singers rising or descending as they sing. This occurs in the Met's productions of operas such as Aida and Tales of Hoffman. London's Royal Opera House, which was remodeled in the late 1990s, retained the original 1858 auditorium at its core, but added completely new backstage and wing spaces {{in addition to an}} additional performance space and public areas. Much the same happened in the remodeling of Milan's La Scala opera house between 2002 and 2004.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} before the episode was finished, Gillian Anderson {{said she was}} most {{looking forward to the}} scene in which Scully works her way through FBI headquarters in her quest to locate Mulder. She later compared the episode to live theater, which she had worked in previously. The four acts of [...] "Triangle" [...] were filmed in several continuous shots, and edited together to give the impression of four seamless acts. This included the scenes in the FBI; when the actors entered the <b>stage</b> <b>elevator,</b> the set that they would next move onto had to be constructed behind the closed doors. Many times during filming, these doors would open before the set behind had been completed, which ruined the shot.|$|R
50|$|For theatres {{like the}} Dresden, {{that did not}} have an {{underside}} to their stage, each sector of the revolve would have two wheels operating directly on the stage floor and propelled by a small motor fixed to the underside of the turntable. Some revolves had only two separate sections while some had as many as seven. Not all sections had to be split into equal proportions. Sections could be very shallow or very deep, according to what the scene required. Rectangular sections were even used many times for indoor scenes. Some revolves had sections that connected to each other to give the appearance of travel and help give the set perspective. Eventually traps, <b>elevators</b> and rotating <b>stages</b> combined in some theatres. The individual sections of the turntable could be lowered and raised to and from underneath the stage to make scene changes even more efficient.|$|R
40|$|Since 2006 EUV Lithographic tools {{have been}} {{available}} for testing purposes giving a boost {{to the development of}} fab infrastructure for EUV masks. The absence of a pellicle makes the EUV reticles extremely vulnerable to particles. Therefore, the fab infrastructure for masks must meet very strict particle requirements. It is expected that all new equipment must be qualified on particles before it can be put into operation. This qualification requirement increases the need for a low cost method for particle detection on mask substrates. TNO developed its fourth generation particle scanner, the Rapid Nano. This scanner is capable of detecting nanometer sized particles on flat surfaces. The particle detection is based on dark field imaging techniques and fast image processing. The tool was designed for detection of a single added particle in a handling experiment over a reticle sized substrate. Therefore, the Rapid Nano is very suitable for the validation of particle cleanliness of equipment. During the measurement, the substrate is protected against particle contamination by placing it in a protective environment. This environment shields the substrate from all possible contamination source in the Nano Rapid (<b>stages,</b> <b>elevator,</b> cabling). The imaging takes place through a window in the protective cover. The geometry of the protective environment enables large flexibility in substrate shape and size. Particles can be detected on substrates varying from 152 x 152 mm mask substrates to wafers up to 200 mm. PSL particles of 50 nm were detected with signal noise ratio of 26. Larger particles had higher signal noise ratios. By individually linking particles in two measurements the addition of particles can be detected. These results show that the Rapid Nano is capable of detecting particles of 50 nm and larger of a full reticle substrate. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R
5000|$|While in Building 26, Peter {{determines that}} Daphne {{is not in}} the building, and then copies a video file pointed out to him by Rebel of the [...] "fugitives" [...] being put onto the {{transport}} plane. However, Peter and Matt don't both make it out of the building, as Matt allows himself to be captured to allow Peter to escape. Peter calls Nathan to arrange a trade - he won't release the video to the media if Matt and Daphne are released to him. Nathan agrees, and they arrange to meet. At that time, Noah Bennet shows up to take him into custody, as expressed verbally, but he silently by way of Peter's telepathy warns him of the sniper rifle trained on him. Danko fires, and Peter falls off the building, only to be caught and flown away by Nathan. The Petrellis gather and discuss the incident and the government's operation. Peter pretends to make nice with Nathan and then reabsorbs Nathan's ability while hugging him, subsequently fleeing and apparently passing the tape on to the media. Peter later returns to rescue his mother after Danko orders his men to take her prisoner. He flies into an <b>elevator</b> shaft to <b>stage</b> a rescue and retreats to the statue of liberty where they decide what to do next. Peter brings Angela to a church. Angela tells Peter she and Arthur were married in the church. Soon Danko's agents come inside the church looking for him and Angela. They hide in a confessional. Angela apologizes to Peter despite the danger of being heard by the soldiers. Noah Bennet appears to hear them but tells the agents that all is clear. Later Angela tells Peter after dreaming that they need to meet with Nathan and Claire, then find her sister.|$|R
