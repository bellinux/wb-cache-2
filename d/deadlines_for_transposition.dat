While some aspects of the new rules are to be welcomed (as for example the duty to inform consumers on the possibility to ask for ADR), it will be finally stated that such a measure could be useful only in some cases to avoid civil jurisdiction, but not to make consumer feel more at ease with international transaction...|$|R
40|$|This {{article has}} as main {{objective}} {{to evaluate the}} role of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs), in particular the eHealth (electronic health), in the implementation of the directive 2011 / 24 /EU, of the European Parliament and of the Council of March 9 th, on the exercise of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare within Member States of European Union. Being currently underway the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> of the Directive, it is important to analyze the probable results for national health systems. Innovatively, the Directive specifically proposes the implementation of a European network of eHealth in the provision of cross-border healthcare. Within ICT, we focus on telemedicine as a key tool for the implementation, on a context of public budgets constrains. In this context, it is assumed that the EU will support and promote cooperation and the exchange of scientific information between member states within the framework of a voluntary network composed by the national authorities responsible for health (or eHealth). We apply the S. W. O. T. (strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis to forecast the main points that should be focused on deeper research. We discuss the technological, economic and social aspects of the use of ICT on the implementation of the directive. It is thus important to evaluate the context of ICT by S. W. O. T. tool to define strategies to sensitize policy-makers, health managers, and citizens, {{in order to be able}} to turn threats into opportunities and mitigating the weaknesses in the implementation of the Directive and to promote a better healthcare access for citizens, ensuring safe, effective healthcare and with different quality...|$|R
40|$|The Payment Services Directive (PSD) was {{published}} in late 2007, constituting the legal basis for the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The industry initiative launched on 28 January 2008 aims at replacing fragmented national markets for payment services with one integrated system. Although <b>deadlines</b> <b>for</b> both the <b>transposition</b> of the PSD into national law and the full availability for SEPA standards are set, many questions lack clear answers {{and need to be}} addressed accordingly. Given the numerous directives and different regulations affecting payment service providers, the partial duplication and interlinking between the various provisions are prone to creating a legislative labyrinth. This ECRI Research Report attempts to address the main concerns, as it tests the PSD against some of the most advanced payment business models, and to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the Community regulation of payment services within SEPA. While evidencing a number of critical issues in the reading and implementation of the PSD, the paper looks at this ambitious and challenging exercise of the European institutions and presents a number of provocative considerations that it is hoped will be of general value...|$|R
