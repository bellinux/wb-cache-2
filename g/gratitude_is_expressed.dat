Aside from those, a central data collection server was implemented. The server collected the app’s logs from all the users in real time via the Internet.

The going forth of {{the women}} of Israel after Miriam with timbrels and with dances, was, as you doubtless remember, their {{expression}} of passionate triumph and thankfulness, after the full accomplishment of their deliverance from the Egyptians. That deliverance had been by the utter death of their enemies, and accompanied by stupendous miracle; no human creatures could in an hour of triumph be surrounded by circumstances more solemn. I {{am not going to}} try to excite your feelings about them. Consider only for yourself what that seeing of the Egyptians [...] "dead upon the sea-shore" [...] meant to every soul that saw it. And then reflect that these intense emotions of mingled horror, triumph, and <b>gratitude</b> <b>were</b> <b>expressed,</b> in the visible presence of the Deity, by music and dancing. If you answer that you do not believe the Egyptians so perished, or that God ever appeared in a pillar of cloud, I reply, [...] "Be it so--believe or disbelieve, as you choose;--This is yet assuredly the fact, that the author of the poem or fable of the Exodus supposed that, under such circumstances of Divine interposition as he had invented, the triumph of the Israelitish women would have been, and ought to have been, under the direction of a prophetess, expressed by music and dancing." ...|$|R
