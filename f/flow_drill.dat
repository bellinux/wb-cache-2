This contribution presents new type of solar absorbers where the above-mentioned disadvantages are reduced while keeping relative production simplicity. The solar absorber is characterized by the creation of the appropriate spatial structure in sheet metal by forming through a technology of drawing in flexible tools. This spatial structure not only increases the heat-transfer surface but also eliminates the need for perpendicular incidence of the incoming solar radiation.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new joining technology, which is used to manufacture high strength hybrid constructions with thermoplastic composites (FRP) and metals, is introduced. Similar to natural regulation effects at trees, fibers around the FRP joint become aligned along the lines of force and will not be destroyed by the joining process. This is achieved by the local utilization of the specific plastic flow properties of the FRT and metal component. Compared with usual joining methods—such as <b>flow</b> <b>drill</b> screws, blind and self-piercing rivets—noticeably higher tensile properties can be realized through the novel process management. The load-bearing capability increasing effect could be proved on hybrid joints with hot-dip galvanized steel HX 420 LAD and orthotropic glass—as well as carbon—fiber reinforced plastics. The results, which were determined in tensile-shear and cross-shear tests according to DIN EN ISO 14273 and DIN EN ISO 14272, are compared with holding loads of established joining techniques with similar joining point diameter and material combinations...|$|E
40|$|Reliable line {{production}} processes and simulation tools {{play a central}} role for the structural integration of thermoplastic composites in advanced lightweight constructions. Provided that material- adapted joining technologies are available, they can be applied in heavy-duty multi-material designs (MMD). A load-adapted approach was implemented into the new fully automatic and faulttolerant thermo mechanical <b>flow</b> <b>drill</b> joining (FDJ) concept. With this method it is possible to manufacture reproducible high strength FRP/metal-joints within short cycle times and without use of extra joining elements for the first time. The analysis of FDJ joints requires a simplified model of the joint to enable efficient numerical simulations. The present work introduces a strategy in modeling a finite-element based analogous-approach for FDJ-joints with glass fiber reinforced polypropylene and high-strength steel. Combined with a newly developed section-force related failure criterion, it is possible to predict the fundamental failure behavior in multi-axial stress states. The functionality of the holistic approach is illustrated by a demonstrator that represents a part of a car body-in-white structure. The comparison of simulated and experimentally determined failure loads proves the applicability for several combined load cases...|$|E
40|$|The major {{research}} project Next Generation Car (NGC) concentrates {{the expertise of}} the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in ground based traffic for a sustained and safe mobility of tomorrow. A tool for the automatic selection of joining technologies for multi material design (MMD) is being developed within the NGC project. A particular function of this tool is to consider the increased demand MMD structures place on corrosion resistance. In this paper, the influence of corrosive conditions on the mechanical performance of <b>Flow</b> <b>Drill</b> Screw (FDS) joints is investigated in greater detail. Different combinations of light metals such as high strength/stainless steel, aluminium and magnesium alloys served as the test material. The joint strength, under quasi-static and cyclic loading, of FDS joints was measured before and after six weeks of corrosion climate change testing. Furthermore metallographic sections of the samples were compared in order to evaluate the stage of surface, galvanic and crevice corrosion. To classify the effect of progressing corrosion on the mechanical properties of FDS joints the following factors are taken into account: corrosion resistance of the materials, joining parameters, geometry of the joint, as well as corrosion protection by coating. For all material combinations there is an apparent change in both the fatigue strength and the failure behaviour after corrosion testing.

40|$|This thesis in Thermal Flow Drilling and Flowtap in thin {{metal sheet}} and pipes of copper and copper alloys had as {{objectives}} {{to know the}} comportment of copper and copper alloys sheet metal during the Thermal <b>Flow</b> <b>Drill</b> processes with normal tools, to know the best Speed and Feed machine data for the best bushing quality, to known the best Speed for Form Tapping processes and to know the best bush long in pure copper pipes for water solar interchange equipment. Thermal Flow Drilling (TFD) and Form Tapping (FT) {{is one of the}} research lines of the Institute of Production and Logistics (IPL) at University of Kassel. At December 1995, a work meeting of IPL, Santa Catarina University, Brazil, Buenos Aires University, Argentine, Tarapacá University (UTA), Chile members and the CEO of Flowdrill B. V. was held in Brazil. The group decided that the Manufacturing Laboratory (ML) of UTA would work with pure copper and brass alloys sheet metal and pure copper pipes in order to develop a water interchange solar heater. The Flowdrill BV Company sent tools to Tarapacá University in 1996. In 1999 IPL and the ML carried out an ALECHILE research project promoted by the DAAD and CONICyT in copper sheet metal and copper pipes and sheet metal a-brass alloys. The normal tools are lobed, conical tungsten carbide tool. When rotated at high speed and pressed with high axial force into sheet metal or thin walled tube generated heat softens the metal and allows the drill to feed forward produce a hole and simultaneously form a bushing from the displacement material. In the market exist many features but in this thesis is used short and longs normal tools of TFD. For reach the objectives it was takes as references four qualities of the frayed end bushing, where the best one is the quality class I. It was used pure copper and a-brass alloys sheet metals, with different thickness. It was used different TFD drills diameter for four thread type, from M- 5 to M 10. Similar to the Aluminium sheet metals studies it was used the predrilling processes with HSS drills around 30 % of the TFD diameter (1, 5 – 3, 0 mm D). In the next step is used only 2, 0 mm thick metal sheet, and 9, 2 mm TFD diameter for M- 10 thread. For the case of pure commercial copper pipes is used for ¾” inch diameter and 12, 8 mm (3 / 8 ”) TFD drill for holes for 3 / 8 ” pipes and different normal HSS drills for predrilling processes. The chemical sheet metal characteristics were takes as reference for the material behaviour. The Chilean pure copper have 99, 35 % of Cu and 0, 163 % of Zinc and the Chilean a-brass alloys have 75, 6 % of Cu and 24, 0 % of Zinc. It is used two German a-brass alloys; Nº 1 have 61, 6 % of Cu, 36, 03 % of Zinc and 2, 2 % of Pb and the German a-brass alloys Nº 2 have 63, 1 % of Cu, 36, 7 % of Zinc and 0 % of Pb. The equipments used were a HAAS CNC milling machine centre, a Kistler dynamometer, PC Pentium II, Acquisition card, TESTPOINT and XAct software, 3 D measurement machine, micro hardness, universal test machine, and metallographic microscope. During the test is obtained the feed force and momentum curves that shows the material behaviour with TFD processes. In general it is take three phases. It was possible obtain the best machining data for the different sheet of copper and a-brass alloys thick of Chilean materials and bush quality class I. In the case of a-brass alloys, the chemical components and the TFD processes temperature have big influence. The temperature reach to 400 º Celsius during the TFD processes and the a-brass alloys have some percents of Zinc the bush quality is class I. But when the a-brass alloys have some percents of Lead who have 200 º C melting point is not possible to obtain a bush, because the Lead gasify and the metallographic net broke. During the TFD processes the recrystallization structures occur around the Copper and a-brass alloy bush, who gives more hardness in these zones. When the threads were produce with Form Tapping processes with Flowtap tools, this hardness amount gives a high limit load of the thread when hey are tested in a special support that was developed for it. For eliminated the predrilling processes with normal HSS drills it was developed a compound tool. With this new tool it was possible obtain the best machining data for quality class I bush. For the copper pipes it is made bush without predrilling and the quality class IV was obtained. When it is was used predrilling processes, quality classes I bush were obtained. Then with different HSS drill diameter were obtained different long bush, where were soldering with four types soldering materials between pipes with 3 / 8 ” in a big one as ¾”. Those soldering unions were tested by traction test and all the 3 / 8 ” pipes broken, and the soldering zone doesn’t have any problem. Finally were developed different solar water interchange heaters and tested. As conclusions, the present Thesis shows that the Thermal Flow Drilling in thinner metal sheets of cooper and cooper alloys needs a predrilling process for frayed end quality class I bushings, similar to thinner sheets of aluminium bushes. The compound tool developed could obtain quality class I bushings and excludes predrilling processes. The bush recrystalization, product of the friction between the tool and the material, the hardness grows and it is advantageous for the Form Tapping. The methodology developed for commercial copper pipes permits to built water solar interchange heaters...|$|E

The applicability of this work is demonstrated for joining magnesium alloy AZ 31 B and carbon-fibre reinforced plastics. Dynamic effects, thermomechanical coupling, material damage laws, and contact criterion were taken into account in the model. The Johnson–Cook material constitutive equation was used, considering the effects of strain, strain rate, and temperature on material properties. Finally, through simulation, the joint formation, stress distribution and riveting temperature were obtained. Furthermore, a series of experiments were carried out to validate the simulation results.
