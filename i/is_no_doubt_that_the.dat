Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, and intervention by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.|$|E
5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family {{home and in the}} courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E

5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E
25|$|All this {{theories}} {{may indicate}} that it's very likely that throughout the 19th century the tiple was already part of Colombia's culture. There is no clear conclusion on where in Colombia the tiple first originated since the documentation is sketchy. Nevertheless, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tiple {{is linked to the}} Spanish guitar and the timple from the Canary islands.|$|E

25|$|The earlier text, {{of which}} five short {{fragments}} {{have come down}} to us, {{is known as the}} Pactus Alamannorum, and judging from the persistent recurrence of the expression et sic convenit, was most probably drawn up by an official commission. The reference to aifranchisement in ecciesia shows that it was composed after the conversion of the Alamanni to Christianity. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> text dates back at least to the reign of the Frankish king Dagobert I, i.e. to {{the first half of the}} 7th century.|$|E
25|$|Though there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{demographic}} {{crisis of}} the 14th century caused a dramatic fall in production and commerce in absolute terms, {{there has been a}} vigorous historical debate over whether the decline was greater than the fall in population. While the older orthodoxy held that the artistic output of the Renaissance was a result of greater opulence, more recent studies have suggested that {{there might have been a}} so-called 'depression of the Renaissance'. In spite of convincing arguments for the case, the statistical evidence is simply too incomplete for a definite conclusion to be made.|$|E
25|$|The Embassy {{perspective}} {{is that there}} <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch, while accepting {{that there may be}} a prima facie case that Zelaya may have committed illegalities and may have even violated the constitution. There is equally no doubt from our perspective that Roberto Micheletti's assumption of power was illegitimate. Nevertheless, it is also evident that the constitution itself may be deficient in terms of providing clear procedures for dealing with alleged illegal acts by the President and resolving conflicts between the branches of government.|$|E

25|$|Haile Selassie died in 1975. It {{is rumored}} that Mengistu smothered the Emperor using a pillow case, but Mengistu has denied these rumors. Though several groups were {{involved}} in the overthrow, the Derg succeeded to power. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Derg under Mengistu's leadership ordered the execution without trial of 61ex-officials of the Imperial government on 23 November 1974, and later of numerous other former nobles and officials including the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Theophilos, in 1977. Mengistu himself has acknowledged that the Derg ordered these deaths, but refuses to accept personal responsibility. Members of the Derg have contradicted him in interviews given from prison, saying he conspired and was in full agreement with their decisions.|$|E
25|$|While {{nothing is}} known about the use of {{tortoise}} shells as money, gold and cowries (either real shells or replicas) were used to the south of the Yellow River. Although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> well-known spade and knife money were used as coins, it has not been demonstrated that other items often offered by dealers as coins such as fish, halberds, and metal chimes were also used as coins. They are not found in coin hoards, and the probability is that all these are in fact funerary items. Archaeological evidence shows that the earliest use of the spade and knife money was in the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE). As in ancient Greece, socio-economic conditions at the time were favourable to the adoption of coinage.|$|E
25|$|To {{find jobs}} {{for all these}} new Malay graduates, the {{government}} created several agencies for intervention in the economy. The {{most important of these}} were PERNAS (National Corporation Ltd.), PETRONAS (National Petroleum Ltd.), and HICOM (Heavy Industry Corporation of Malaysia), which not only directly employed many Malays but also invested in growing areas of the economy to create new technical and administrative jobs which were preferentially allocated to Malays. As a result, the share of Malay equity in the economy rose from 1.5% in 1969 to 20.3% in 1990, and the percentage of businesses of all kinds owned by Malays rose from 39 percent to 68 percent. This latter figure was deceptive because many businesses that appeared to be Malay-owned were still indirectly controlled by Chinese, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Malay share of the economy considerably increased. The Chinese remained disproportionately powerful in Malaysian economic life, but by 2000 the distinction between Chinese and Malay business was fading as many new corporations, particularly in growth sectors such as information technology, were owned and managed by people from both ethnic groups.|$|E

500|$|Silk {{was made}} using various breeds of lepidopterans, both wild and domestic. While wild silks were {{produced}} in many countries, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese {{were the first}} to begin production on such a large scale, having the most effective species for silk production, the Bombyx mandarina and its domesticated descendent B. mori. Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090. The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water, the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings, and would be wound onto a large spool, thanks to a backwards and forward motion. Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China. [...] The spinning wheel, in all likelihood moved by hand, was known {{by the beginning of the}} Christian era. The first accepted image of a spinning wheel appears in 1210. There is an image of a silk spinning machine powered by a water wheel that dates to 1313.|$|E

A. A. Gill for The Times recommended that people should [...] "eat here at least once {{to find out what}} is really going on in your mouth". Also in 2005, German food critic Wolfram Siebeck visited the restaurant complained of the delays in service and of several of the dishes, described the mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup as a [...] "fart of nothingness", while chef Nico Ladenis said of the restaurant, [...] "Someone who makes egg and bacon ice cream is hailed a genius. If you vomit and make ice cream out of it, are you a star?" [...] Tony Naylor of The Guardian enjoyed his trip to the restaurant in 2008, and afterwards criticised those who thought that spending £323.13 on a meal for two at lunchtime was too much.|$|E
500|$|The Reform Act {{strengthened}} the House of Commons {{by reducing the}} number of nomination boroughs controlled by peers. [...] Some aristocrats complained that, in the future, the government could compel them to pass any bill, simply by threatening to swamp the House of Lords with new peerages. The Duke of Wellington lamented: [...] "If such projects can be carried into execution by a minister of the Crown with impunity, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> constitution of this House, and of this country, is at an end. [...] here is absolutely an end put to the power and objects of deliberation in this House, and an end to all just and proper means of decision." [...] The subsequent history of Parliament, however, shows that the influence of the Lords was largely undiminished. They compelled the Commons to accept significant amendments to the Municipal Reform Bill in 1835, forced compromises on Jewish emancipation, and successfully resisted several other bills supported by the public. It would not be until decades later, culminating in the Parliament Act 1911, that Wellington's fears would come to pass.|$|E
500|$|While her {{steering}} {{was being}} repaired in Malta, the Illustrious was bombed again on 16 January by 17 Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers and 44 Stukas. The pilots of 806 Squadron {{claimed to have}} shot down two of the former and possibly damaged another pair, but a 500kg bomb penetrated her flight deck aft of the rear lift and detonated in the captain's day cabin; several other bombs nearly hit the ship but only caused minor damage. Two days later, one of three Fulmars that intercepted an Axis air raid on the Maltese airfields was shot down with no survivors. Only one Fulmar was serviceable on 19 January, when the carrier was attacked several times and it was shot down. Illustrious was not struck during these attacks but was near-missed several times and the resulting shock waves from their detonations dislodged enough hull plating to cause an immediate 5-degree list, cracked the cast-iron foundations of her port turbine, and damaged other machinery. The naval historian J. D. Brown noted that [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> armoured deck saved her from destruction; no other carrier took anything like this level of punishment and survived." ...|$|E
