5|$|The {{advent of}} the global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–2008 caused a resurgence in Keynesian thought. <b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics</b> provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken {{in response to the}} crisis by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.|$|E

There she {{was influenced by the}} ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. <b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics,</b> they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.|$|E

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that <b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics</b> were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-1970s, the Conservative Party {{was mostly}} {{controlled}} by one-nation conservatives. The {{rise of the}} New Right in conservative politics led to a critique of one-nation conservatism which contended that <b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics</b> and welfarism had damaged the economy and society. The Winter of Discontent of 1978–79 was portrayed by the New Right as illustrative of the overextension of the state. Figures such as Margaret Thatcher believed that to reverse the national decline, {{it was necessary to}} revive old values of individualism and challenge the dependency culture created by the welfare state.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of <b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics</b> has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E

25|$|In his 1980 {{campaign}} speeches, Reagan {{presented his}} economic proposals as {{a return to}} the free enterprise principles, free market economy that had been in favor before the Great Depression and FDR's New Deal policies. At the same time, he attracted a following from the supply-side economics movement, which had formed in opposition to <b>Keynesian</b> demand-stimulus <b>economics.</b> This movement produced some of the strongest supporters for Reagan's policies during his term in office.|$|R
5|$|<b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics</b> were officially {{discarded}} by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek {{it was as if}} Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of <b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics</b> was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist <b>Keynesian</b> <b>economics,</b> and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid).

40|$|Summary Much of the {{academic}} literature on globalisation and resistance has tended to focus narrowly on the opposition of states against markets, of <b>Keynesian</b> welfare <b>economics</b> against the neo?liberal model behind globalisation. This literature obscures the fact that other forms of resistance are emerging at the local level. These developments are largely spontaneous, and insofar as they reflect a political agenda, it is one which is derived from an alternative, Green perspective rather than traditional social democracy. Local currency systems {{can be seen as}} one such form of resistance. In this article I consider the environmental credentials of local exchange trading systems (LETS) and assess their potential to build an alternative economic model at the local level. I conclude by discussing some of the obstacles which face LETS development and consider how they may be addressed...|$|R
