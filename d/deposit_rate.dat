40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} interest rate regulation, and subsequent deregulation, on the efficacy of monetary policy and rigidity of retail bank <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> in Hong Kong. Using an error-correction model, we find that interest rate deregulation increases the efficacy of monetary policy by improving the correlation between retail bank <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> and market interest rates and increasing the degree of long-term pass-through for retail bank <b>deposit</b> <b>rates.</b> Our study also shows that the adjustments in retail bank <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> are asymmetric and rigid upwards during the regulated period, but tend to be rigid downwards during the deregulated period. The spreads between retail bank <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> and market rates have also tightened sharply after the removal of interest rate controls.

[...] On 5 June, the central bank cut the prime interest rate to 0.15%, and set the <b>deposit</b> <b>rate</b> at −0.10%. [...] The latter move in particular was seen as [...] "a bold and unusual move", as a negative interest rate had never been tried on a wide-scale before. [...] Additionally, the ECB announced it would offer long-term four-year loans at the cheap rate (normally the rate is primarily for overnight lending), but only if the borrowing banks met strict conditions designed to ensure the funds ended {{up in the hands of}} businesses instead of, for example, being used to buy low risk government bonds.

2500|$|In July 2009, Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, set {{its policy}} repo rate, the {{interest}} rate on its one-week deposit facility, at 0.25%, {{at the same time}} as setting its overnight <b>deposit</b> <b>rate</b> at -0.25%. The existence of the negative overnight <b>deposit</b> <b>rate</b> was a technical consequence of the fact that overnight deposit rates are generally set at 0.5% below or 0.75% below the policy rate. This is not technically an example of [...] "negative interest on excess reserves," [...] because Sweden does not have a reserve requirement, but imposing a reserve interest rate without reserve requirements imposes an implied reserve requirement of zero. The Riksbank studied the impact of these changes and stated in a commentary report that they led to no disruptions in Swedish financial markets.|$|E

2500|$|Upon the {{parallel}} introduction of quantitative easing and interest on excess reserves in 2009, banks {{were no longer}} required to set out a target, and so were no longer penalised for holding excess reserves; indeed, they were proportionally compensated for holding all their reserves at the Bank Rate (the Bank of England now uses the same interest rate for its bank rate, its <b>deposit</b> <b>rate</b> and its interest rate target).

30|$|The {{interest}} rate pass-through may be asymmetric because bank concentration leads to oligopolistic behaviors. On one hand, the collusive behavior hypothesis of Hannan and Berger (1991) suggests that following {{an increase in}} the monetary policy <b>rate,</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> could be rigid upwards because higher <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> represent an additional cost for banks. Similarly, the lending rates could exhibit downward rigidity in reaction to a reduction in the monetary policy rate as lower lending rates imply lower profits for banks. On the other hand, the adverse customer reaction hypothesis indicates that if customers have bargaining power <b>deposit</b> <b>rates</b> could be rigid downwards when the monetary policy rate falls and lending rates may be rigid upwards when the monetary policy rate increases.|$|R
