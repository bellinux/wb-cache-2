40|$|Zincor {{operates}} four Lurgi fluidised-bed roasters at its roast-leach-electrowin refinery in Springs, South Africa. In 2006, Zincor’s four roasters {{had reached}} ages ranging between 26 and 38 years, while the expected {{life of this}} type of roaster is generally 20 to 25 years. Based on its condition, Roaster 3 was the first to be rebuilt in 2006. Roaster 4 is being rebuilt in 2007 and the last two roasters will be rebuilt {{over the next few years}} as necessary. The main damage to Roaster 3 was caused by buckling of the roaster steel shell. This caused the freeboard and dome areas to shift, resulting in cracks in the <b>dome</b> <b>brick</b> lining and crumbling of the bricks lining the freeboard. The steel shell buckled due to the combined effects of too-high operating temperatures and corrosion caused by the following two main factors: • Thicker external insulation was installed during a previous maintenance shut which resulted in and increased steel shell temperature and exacerbated the normal metal fatigue; • SO 2 /SO 3 containing gas that had permeated through the brick lining, passed through its dew point during frequent planned and unplanned shuts over the life of the roaster. This caused acid formation between the refractory brick lining and steel shell, resulting in corrosion of the shell. The initial plan was to replace only the damaged areas of Roaster 3, but upon dismantling more damage was found and the roaster was rebuilt from the tuyeres upwards. During the rebuild, the opportunity was taken to modify the design of some of the brickwork to extend its life and make future repairs easier. This paper discusses the mode of failure of Roaster 3 and the lessons learnt during its dismantling and rebuilding...|$|E

50|$|The {{last major}} Islamic tomb built in India was {{the tomb of}} Safdar Jang (1753-54). It is a brick {{structure}} clad in sandstone and marble stripped from the earlier tomb of Khan-i-Khanan (d. 1627). Shallow <b>brick</b> <b>domes</b> cover the perimeter chambers of the building, and the central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner <b>brick</b> <b>domes</b> and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second <b>brick</b> <b>domes</b> are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top.|$|R
50|$|Three major {{earthquakes}} {{have affected}} the capital since its construction. The first, in 1949, damaged the cupola of the Legislative Building's dome so badly {{it had to be}} completely replaced. A 6.5 magnitude earthquake in 1965 had even worse results, with the <b>dome's</b> <b>brick</b> buttresses left in such poor condition that a major aftershock could have caused them to collapse entirely, according to a state report. The state performed work after both earthquakes to reduce the impact of future occurrences, and performed additional seismic improvements in 1975. The Nisqually earthquake of 2001 caused further damage, including a splintered buttress, but the earthquake-resistance work prevented more serious harm to the building.|$|R
50|$|Sikandar Shah’s Tomb, {{the tomb}} of the last ruler of Champaner, who was assassinated by Imad-ul-Mulk, Khusqadam in 1526 A.D., is seen near Halol. It is a {{single-storey}} building in Muslim architectural style. It consists of a central chamber and entrance porches with fluted <b>domes.</b> The <b>brick</b> <b>dome</b> of the central chamber and the side chamber have collapsed. Sikandar Shah’s brothers, Latifkhan and Nasirkhan, were also buried here. The structure is very simple but the brackets, plinth base and finial of the dome are elaborately carved with floral and geometrical patterns.|$|R

Early stones domes were plastered externally when not cut precisely enough, but improvements in technique over time would make this unnecessary. Spiral ribs were developed in the 1370s and zigzag patterns were common both {{by the end of the}} fourteenth century and again at the end of the fifteenth century. In the fifteenth century, interlaced star and floral designs were used in a tiled pattern. The uniqueness of a pattern on a mausoleum dome helped to associate that dome with the individual buried there.|$|R

40|$|Bricks {{from the}} Agia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey, were {{investigated}} to better formulate {{a plan for}} restoration. According to an ancient text, these bricks are extremely light and were manufactured {{on the island of}} Rhodes. Results of neutron activation analysis, grouped by multivariate statistics, show that the brick samples do not correlate with clays thought to be local and used in contemporary churches in Istanbul. The bricks are similar to those used in the Great Basilica of Rhodes. However, the Agia Sophia bricks are lighter (45 % porosity) than the bricks from the other churches (35 % porosity). The Agia Sophia bricks are made of a noncalcareous, fine paste with quartz temper, fired at low temperature (similar to 750 degreesC). The exceptional characteristic is their homogeneity and small pore-size distribution (0. 3 - 0. 8 mum). The tensile strength of the <b>dome</b> <b>bricks</b> is unexpectedly high (up to 1. 3 MPa), even though the bricks have high porosity...|$|R

50|$|Twelve coke ovens, {{known as}} the Mihi Ovens, were soon {{constructed}} on the hillside above Mihi Creek. Coke ovens erected on the West Moreton Coalfield were exclusively of the beehive type, so called because of their domed appearance. Beehive coke ovens consisted of a <b>brick</b> <b>dome</b> with a small circular opening (an exit flue) at the apex, and a larger arched opening at one side to permit charging and drawing. They were usually constructed in double rows known as batteries. The space between ovens was usually filled with rubble and earth to provide insulation and the whole battery surrounded by a stone retaining wall to resist the outward thrust of the <b>brick</b> <b>domes.</b> The Mihi Ovens remained in use until 1890/1 when Wright's attention was diverted a new coal development at the New Bishop Mine located nearby.|$|R

40|$|Multivariate {{statistics}} is {{a well-known}} and invaluable tool in archaeological science but its use is limited in monument restoration. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the characterization, technology and weathering condition investigation of building materials from historical monuments. Towards this aim, three examples are given: The first one is a provenance and technology investigation of the Aghia Sophia (Istanbul, Turkey) bricks, some of {{which had to be}} replaced due to weathering, during recent restoration works. It was proved by PCA that the original clay, used for the construction of the bricks, is not similar to the clay of other contemporary constructions in Istanbul but presents high similarity to the raw material of the bricks from a contemporary church in the island of Rhodes (Dodecanese, Greece). Additionally, the technology of the bricks was studied by mercury intrusion porosimetry, strength tests and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The use of PCA gives a very comprehensive way to present the difference in the technology of the <b>dome</b> <b>bricks.</b> The second presents a classification of mortars from medieval (Byzantine) monasteries, based on their microstructural characteristics (porosity, reverse hydraulicity ratio) and strength measurements. The PCA grouping gives an illustrative diagram depicting the correlation between mortar syntheses and resulting characteristics. The third case shows an example of the correlation between environmental pollution data and data from the weathering layers of marble surfaces (patina composition, orientation of the monument surface, etc.).

50|$|By the 9th century, the Bamar {{people had}} {{established}} a kingdom centered at Bagan (Pagan). In the 11th century, King Anawrahta unified the Irrawaddy Valley and its periphery, and founded the Pagan Empire (Bagan Empire). By the mid-12th century, Bagan with over 10,000 of Myanmar's red brick stupas and pagodas had become an established center for Buddhist architecture. During this time the Pyu-style stupas were transformed into monuments that favored an alms bowl or gourd-shaped <b>domes,</b> unbaked <b>brick,</b> tapered and rising roofs, Buddha niches, polylobed arches, and ornamental doorways which show influence from India's Pala Empire and its monuments.

50|$|A {{by-product}} of coal mining was {{the production of}} coke. The production of coke was usually regarded as a somewhat unimportant side industry to the actual mining of coal. Unlike coal mining, it was not regulated by legislation and as such no systematic records were kept of the early coke production industry in Queensland. Coke is used as both a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore and is produced from baking bituminous coal in ovens at temperatures as high as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The coke ovens erected on the West Moreton Coalfield were exclusively of the beehive type, so called because of their domed appearance. Beehive coke ovens consisted of a <b>brick</b> <b>dome</b> with a small circular opening (an exit flue) at the apex, and a larger arched opening at one side to permit charging and drawing. They were usually constructed in double rows known as batteries. The space between ovens was usually filled with rubble and earth to provide insulation and the whole battery surrounded by a stone retaining wall to resist the outward thrust of the <b>brick</b> <b>domes.</b> The Klondyke ovens had a capacity of four to five tons.|$|R
