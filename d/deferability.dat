40|$|AbstractHemodynamic factors, such as Wall Shear Stress (WSS), play a {{substantial}} role in arterial diseases. In the larger arteries, {{such as the}} carotid artery, interaction between the vessel wall and blood flow affects the distribution of hemodynamic factors. In the present study, both rigid-wall and deformable-wall models are developed in a 3 D numerical simulation to assess the effectiveness of arterial rigidity on worsening hemodynamics, especially WSS. Two different rheological models (Newtonian and Carreau–Yasuda) have been employed to evaluate the influence of blood, non-Newtonian properties, as well. The importance of vessel wall deformability was compared with the rheological model of blood. Although the deformability changes hemodynamic factors under the steady state boundary condition, or at the last two phases of the cardiac cycle (when the blood flow in carotid looks like a steady condition), WSS distribution is mostly affected by the blood rheological model. In other words, the influence of shear-thinning behavior at the end-diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle is undeniable unlike the <b>deferability.</b> However, the effects of deformability, like the rheology of blood on WSS could not be neglected at the first two phases of the cardiac cycle when pressure reaches its highest values...|$|E
30|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{and distributed}} generation are increasingly {{integrated into the}} electricity customer side, which increases diversity and uncertainty of electricity demand. Evaluating energy efficiency, safety and demand response capacity of electricity users becomes correspondingly more essential and complicated. The major issue for SEU is how to enhance energy efficiency and demand response capability of electricity users while ensuring electricity safety. Thus, proper evaluation indices for electricity users are crucial in SEU. Much research on evaluation indices has been reported, focused {{on the performance of}} either single pieces of electrical equipment [1] or the entire system [2, 3]. In [4], demand response strategies applied to air-conditioning peak load in Australia were described. Reference [5] evaluated the impact of electrical substations on the static and dynamic performance of electric power systems, while considering their possible operating states. Economic and low-carbon day-ahead Pareto-optimal scheduling was discussed in [6] for wind farms integrated into power systems with the use of demand response. The future evolution of automated demand response systems in smart grids for a low-carbon economy was presented in [7]. However, existing literature rarely evaluates electricity users according to their distinct features such as load aggregation, regularity, and <b>deferability,</b> and pay very limited attention to the changing characteristics of electricity users in various scenarios. In addition, existing research largely ignores the interaction between electricity users and distributed generation and other new energy equipment when evaluating the demand response capability of electricity users.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{engineering}} economics of interventions to reduce consumer inconvenience due to unreliable electricity supply in rural India. The work introduces and applies {{a novel approach}} to estimate interruption costs as loss in consumer surplus due to restricted consumption of electricity services. Chapter 2 reports an assessment that compares grid extension with distributed generation (DG) alternatives, based on the subsidies they will necessitate, and costs of service interruptions that are appropriate in the rural Indian context. Despite the inclusion of interruption costs, standalone DG {{does not appear to}} be competitive with grid extension at distances of less than 17 km. However, backing up unreliable grid service with local DG plants is attractive when reliability is very poor, even in previously electrified villages. Introduction of energy efficient lighting changes these economics, and the threshold for acceptable grid unreliability significantly reduces. Chapter 3 analyzes supply rostering (alternatively, “load shedding”) in metropolitan, small town and rural feeders in and around Bangalore city. The inequity in load shedding is analyzed through transfers due to differential tariffs between the urban and rural residential consumers, and the relief provided to BESCOM, through avoided procurement of additional supply from generators, because rural and small town feeders are load shed higher than Bangalore city. The values of the load shedding transfers are estimated to be in the range of Rs. 120 - 380 /consumer-year from the rural consumers, and Rs. 220 - 370 /consumer-year from the small town consumers. The metropolitan consumers are found to be net beneficiaries. The viability of using smart meters to provide current limited but uninterrupted supply is investigated as one alternative to outright blackouts. Chapter 4 develops a broader theoretical framework that can be used to model consumer demand for electricity services with unreliable supply and adaptation. Demand for energy ‘services’ is modeled by incorporating time of use, duration and <b>deferability.</b> Supply reliability is disaggregated into its constituent dimensions– mean and variance of supply availability in times of high demand, and supply predictability, and their respective impacts on consumer welfare are discussed. Primary data collected from Karnataka inform the discussion, especially with backup adoption. New consumer-oriented reliability indices are proposed...|$|E
