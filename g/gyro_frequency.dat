We demonstrate that wave propagation significantly affects the electron scattering rates. We show that stormtime chorus waves outside the plasmapause can scatter equatorial electrons ≤ 60 keV into the loss cone and accelerate trapped electrons up to ∼ MeV energies at large pitch-angles. Using ray tracing {{to map the}} waves to higher latitudes, we show that the decrease in the ratio between the electron plasma and <b>gyro</b> <b>frequencies,</b> along with the normalized chorus frequency bandwidth, enable much higher energy electrons ∼ 1 MeV to be scattered into the loss cone.

50|$|In 2015, new exact {{explanation}} for the original Bohm’s experiment is reported, in which the cross-field diffusion measured at Bohm’s experiment and Simon’s experiment were explained by {{the combination of the}} ion gyro-center shift and the short circuit effect. The ion gyro-center shift occurs when an ion collides with a neutral to exchange the momentum; typical example is ion-neutral charge exchange reaction. The one directional shifts of gyro-centers take place when ions are in the perpendicular (to the magnetic field) drift motion such as diamagnetic drift. The electron gyro-center shift is relatively small since the electron gyro-radius is much smaller than ion’s so it can be disregarded. Once ions move across the magnetic field by the gyro-center shift, this movement generates spontaneous electric unbalance between {{in and out of the}} plasma. However this electric unbalance is immediately compensated by the electron flow through the parallel path and conducting end wall, when the plasma is contained in the cylindrical structure as in Bohm’s and Simon’s experiments. Simon recognized this electron flow and named it as ‘short circuit’ effect in 1955. With the help of short circuit effect the ion flow induced by the diamagnetic drift now becomes whole plasma flux which is proportional to the density gradient since the diamagnetic drift includes pressure gradient. The diamagnetic drift can be described as (kBT/eB)∇n/n, (here n is density) for approximately constant temperature over the diffusion region. When the particle flux is proportional to (kBT/eB)∇n/n, the other part than ∇n/n is the diffusion coefficient. So naturally the diffusion is proportional to kBT/eB. The other front coefficient of this diffusion is a function of the ratio between the charge exchange reaction rate and the <b>gyro</b> <b>frequency.</b> A careful analysis tells this front coefficient for Bohm’s experiment was in the range of 1/13 ~ 1/40. The gyro-center shift analysis also reported the turbulence induced diffusion coefficient which is responsible for the anomalous diffusion in many fusion devices; described as (2/π)(δn/n)2(kBT/eB). This means different two diffusion mechanisms (the arc discharge diffusion such as Bohm’s experiment and the turbulence induced diffusion such as in the tokamak) have been called by the same name of “Bohm diffusion”.|$|E

It might explain the results obtained for the run MSIS(U), MSIS(O), IGRF(U), and IGRF(O) in Table  2. Furthermore, changes in the IRI model outputs lead to uncertainties up to 3.01  % in ΔEy and up to 3.70  % in ΔEz and, the lowest electric field uncertainty obtained in this study resulted from the IRI(O) run, − 2.16  % in ΔEy. Consequently, we may assume that ΔEy and ΔEz are less sensitive to changes in the variables provided by the IRI outputs as compared to the variables provided by the MSIS model. Therefore, it seems fair to attribute the high uncertainties (more than 10  %) in ΔEy and ΔEz obtained in the runs MSISεIRI(U) and MSISεIRI(O) to the MSIS outputs.|$|R

In this paper we re-examine these modes using a relativistic formulation for the hot electrons which we also treat as highly anisotropic by neglecting their parallel momenta relative to the perpendicular momenta and their rest mass energy. We find a significant enhancement in the ion beta value as a result of treating the ring electrons relativistically. For typical present day EBT parameters we find that the value of the ion beta increases by about 50 % as a result of increasing the hot electron mean energy from about several keV to few MeV. At such an energy the microwave power for heating these electrons is also optimum since the drag on the background plasma also reaches its minimum value...|$|R

Due to their importance, there is an interest in accurately measuring and modeling the electric fields for both climatological and near real-time studies. In this work, we present the daytime vertical (Ez) and eastward (Ey) electric fields for a reference quiet day (February 7, 2001) at the São Luís Space Observatory, Brazil (SLZ, 2.31 °S, 44.16 °W). The component Ez is inferred from Doppler shifts of type II echoes (gradient drift instability) and the anisotropic factor, which is computed from ion and electron <b>gyro</b> <b>frequencies</b> as well as ion and electron collision frequencies with neutral molecules. The component Ey depends on the ratio of Hall and Pedersen conductivities and Ez. A magnetic field-line-integrated conductivity model is used to obtain the anisotropic factor for calculating Ez and the ionospheric conductivities for calculating Ey. This model uses the NRLMSISE- 00, IRI- 2007, and IGRF- 11 empirical models as input parameters for neutral atmosphere, ionosphere, and geomagnetic field, respectively. Consequently, it is worth determining the uncertainties (or errors) in Ey and Ez associated with these empirical model outputs in order to precisely define the confidence limit for the estimated electric field components. For this purpose, errors of ± 10  % were artificially introduced in the magnitude of each empirical model output before estimating Ey and Ez. The corresponding uncertainties in the ionospheric conductivity and electric field are evaluated considering the individual and cumulative contribution of the artificial errors. The results show that the neutral densities and temperature may be responsible for the largest changes in Ey and Ez, followed by changes in the geomagnetic field intensity and electron and ions compositions.|$|R

The attitude estimator is a low computational linear attitude fusion algorithm that effectively incorporates high <b>frequency</b> components of <b>gyros</b> and low <b>frequency</b> components of accelerometers and magnetometers to guarantee both accuracy and bandwidth of attitude estimation. The velocity and position estimator uses two cascaded complementary filters which fuse translational acceleration, GPS velocity, and position to improve the bandwidth of velocity and position. The designed navigation system is feasible for miniature UAVs due to its low cost, simplicity, miniaturization, and guaranteed estimation errors. Both ground tests and autonomous flight tests of miniature unmanned helicopter and quadrotor have shown the effectiveness of the proposed system, demonstrating its promise in UAV systems...|$|R
40|$|We study {{here the}} {{precession}} of the spin {{of a test}} gyroscope attached to a stationary observer in the Kerr spacetime, specifically, to distinguish naked singularity (NS) from black hole (BH). It was shown recently that for gyros attached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily large {{in the limit of}} approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to stationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity Ω, this divergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such <b>gyros,</b> the precession <b>frequencies</b> diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and regular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine detection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that for a near-extremal NS (1 1. 089 for a certain range of r. For 1 <a_*< 1. 089, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains positive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT frequencies for BH and NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to observed QPOs, these features might allow us to determine whether a given rotating compact astrophysical object is BH or NS.
