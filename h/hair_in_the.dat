5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
5|$|The maximum hair length that is {{possible}} to reach is about 15cm (6in) for infants (below the age of 1), about 60cm (24in) for children, and generally 100cm (40in) for adults. Documentation for decrease of the maximum length with age cannot {{be found in the}} literature. Some individuals can reach excessive lengths. Lengths greater than 150cm (59in) are frequently observed in long hair contests.

5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much thinner and consist of more bones {{than that of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings inwards towards their body on the upstroke, they use 35% less energy during flight than birds. The membranes are delicate, ripping easily; however, the tissue of the bat's membrane is able to regrow, such that small tears can heal quickly. The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the Notch signaling pathway regulates the differentiation of sensory <b>hair</b> cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vertebrate inner ear [1 – 9]. We have shown previously that in mice homozygous for a targeted null mutation of the Jagged 2 (Jag 2) gene, which encodes a Notch ligand, supernumerary <b>hair</b> cells differentiate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cochlea of the inner ear [7]. Other components of the Notch pathway, including the Lunatic fringe (Lfng) gene, are also expressed during differentiation of <b>the</b> inner ear <b>in</b> mice [6 – 10]. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> Jag 2 gene, which is expressed <b>in</b> <b>hair</b> cells, <b>the</b> Lfng gene is expressed in non-sensory supporting cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouse cochlea [10]. Here we demonstrate that a mutation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lfng gene partially suppresses the effects of the Jag 2 mutation on <b>hair</b> cell development. <b>In</b> mice homozygous for targeted mutations of both Jag 2 and Lfng, the generation of supernumerary <b>hair</b> cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>hair</b> cell row is suppressed, while supernumerary <b>hair</b> cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>hair</b> cell rows are unaffected.

30|$|We {{also found}} in this work that the yield of EO {{increases}} significantly when the plants are mycorrhizal. This increase {{may be related to}} the number of glandular <b>hairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leaves. ESM observations of leaves show an increase <b>in</b> glandular <b>hairs</b> <b>in</b> mycorrhizal plants. These results are confirmed by the work of Andrea Copetta et al. [26, 27] who showed that Mycorrhizal colonization of O. basilicum L plants by Glomus mosseae, Gigaspora margarita, and Gigaspora rosea increases the number of glandular <b>hairs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leaves compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. Zolfaghari et al. [56], Gupta et al. [38], Freitas et al. [36], and Mucciarelli [68] reported an increase in yield of EOs in Mentha arvensis and Mentha piperita L inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi, and this increase related to a change in plant secondary metabolism and the number of glands per leaf; this increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> levels of EO may also be related to fungal colonization. According to Copetta et al. [26, 27], the production of terpenoids and constituents of EOs possess fungicidal properties which are considered a defensive response to colonization by the fungus and causing increased yield and increased production of these metabolites in mycorrhizal plants.|$|R
