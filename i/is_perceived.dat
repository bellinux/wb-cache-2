5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what <b>is</b> <b>perceived,</b> noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{perceived}} forms and drivers of sexual and gender based violence in post conflict settings with focus on Northern Uganda. It applied qualitative approaches primarily using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Study findings revealed that although {{all forms of}} violence <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> prevalent, physical and emotional violence <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> the most occurring. Men <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> the main perpetrators of violence. However, there were cases of men who reported to experience violence from women. Few men reported violence to authorities because it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> stigmatizing; such men would <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as weak in a patriarchal society that perceives ideal men {{to be strong and}} less susceptible to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Early marriages are a major form of gender based violence which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as normal in a number of communities despite the evidence that it contributes to negative social and reproductive health outcomes. Sexual violence cases in form of rape, defilement as well as incest <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> on the rise in the sub-region. The study identified several drivers of SGBV including poverty, power imbalances in access to and control over resources, insecurity, blaming HIV infection on female partners, HIV related stigma and discrimination, alcohol and substance abuse...|$|R

He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether students at two universities perceive social power differences {{between male and}} female business faculty. Using gender schema and social power theories, we posit that female faculty members will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by students as having greater referent power and that male faculty members will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by students as having greater expert, legitimate, reward and coercive power. Results of a survey involving 892 students at two universities indicate that male faculty members <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as having greater expert power, while no gender differences exist on referent, reward and coercive power. Contrary to our hypotheses, female faculty members <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as having greater legitimate power...|$|R

Shortly after, the Football Association banned women's football.

5|$|The Studio {{series was}} {{inspired}} by Matisse paintings, and Diane Waldman claims that this particular effort was modelled upon Matisse's L'Atelier Rouge (The Red Studio), although the Lichtenstein Foundation website credits two other Matisse works as inspiration as well as Fernand Léger's The Baluster, 1925, which is represented in the far right corner. Léger was one of Lichtenstein's closest friends. By incorporating Matisse in his own studio setting, Lichtenstein <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as presenting himself as Matisse's peer {{and in so doing}} repositions pop art as a historical style rather than a contemporary one.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, {{as it is}} relatively easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity. While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries. Though animal welfare <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> to have improved significantly over the last few decades, many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse.|$|E
5|$|They {{may also}} serve as {{religious}} symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: יוֹנָה, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves.

In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms.

5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised for what <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> {{as a sort}} of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{assessing}} {{the impacts of}} information communication technologies (ICTs) on tourism businesses, this study adopted a case study blueprint, with a questionnaire survey being used to collect data from selected tourism businesses. The respondents rated ICT impacts on tourism on a 5 - point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The {{results show that the}} impacts on hotels <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 4. 07 (improved company image) to 4. 92 (increased market share), whereas the impacts on bed and breakfast establishments <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 3. 88 (improved company image) to 4. 86 (speeded up service). The impacts on travel agents <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 4. 48 (improved service quality) to 4. 94 (improved service quality), whereas the impacts on tour guides <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 4. 58 (improved company image) to 4. 81 (heightened customer satisfaction levels). The impacts on backpackers <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ranging from 3. 78 (improved company image) to 4. 75 (increased market share). Since ICT <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to impact relatively little on company image improvement, tourism businesses should use such technology to improve company image.

5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> there.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{economic}} growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained {{the largest number}} of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, the proportion having decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005; under its later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011. 30.7% of India's {{children under the age of}} five are underweight. According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.
