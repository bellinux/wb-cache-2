He found ordnance supplies in abundance, but no food. Lee waited 24 hours in vain there for R trains to arrive with badly needed supplies. Union cavalry, meanwhile, sped forward and cut the Richmond & Danville at Jetersville. Lee had to abandon the railroad, and his army stumbled across rolling country towards Lynchburg. On the morning of April 9, 1865, Palm Sunday, Lee met Grant in the front parlor of Wilmer McLean's home near Appomattox Court House to surrender.|$|E
25|$|Anxious {{that others}} should profit by his discovery, and {{encouraged}} by the patriarch and the king, Mesrop founded numerous schools {{in different parts of}} the country, in which the youth were taught the new alphabet. It is historically proven, that Saint Mesrop himself taught in Amaras monastery of Artskah region of Armenia (located in contemporary Martuni region of unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). But his activity was not confined to Eastern Armenia. Provided with letters from Isaac he went to Constantinople and obtained from the Emperor Theodosius the Younger permission to preach and teach in his Armenian possessions. Having returned to Eastern Armenia to report on his missions to the patriarch, his <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> to provide a religious literature for his countrymen. Having gathered around him numerous disciples, he sent some to Edessa, Constantinople, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and other centres of learning, to study the Greek language and bring back the masterpieces of Greek literature. The most famous of his pupils were John of Egheghiatz, Joseph of Baghin, Yeznik, Koryun, Moses of Chorene, and John Mandakuni.|$|E

Admitting that he does not like to read, Nolasco was amazed that the script was a [...] "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role.|$|E

The gear was let go and the submarine's fire was returned. The submarine's fourth shot went through the port bow just below the water line and the seventh shell struck the skipper, partially disembowelling him, and passed through the deck and out through {{the side of the}} ship. In spite of the terrible nature of his wound Skipper Crisp retained consciousness, and his <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> to send off a message that he was being attacked and giving his position.

500|$|Red Headed Stranger is the 18th studio album by American outlaw {{country singer}} Willie Nelson. After the wide {{success of his}} {{recordings}} with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson {{signed a contract with}} Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the [...] "Tale of the Red Headed Stranger", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "The depiction of Terri in the Family Guy episode on March 21 is not only inaccurate, it seems to take the position that certain people are simply not worthy of receiving medical care because they are viewed as burdens {{on the health care}} system." [...] In addition, Schindler has also stated that he hopes to soon enlist the aid of other advocacy groups to protest the episode, [...] "and perhaps see some sponsors end support of the show." [...] Other pro-life activists, including Jill Stanek, wrote of the opening, [...] "Last night's episode of Family Guy opened with a truly shocking scene [...] This is the same television series that had an abortion episode canceled in August 2009.

500|$|With {{the loss}} of the ship the transcontinental plans were abandoned, and the focus shifted to that of survival.

His <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> for Paulet Island, where he knew there was a hut containing a substantial food depot, because he had ordered it 12years earlier while organising relief for Otto Nordenskiöld’s stranded Swedish expedition. Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island, which had been Nordenskiöld’s winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies, [...] or Robertson Island. Shackleton believed that from one of these islands {{they would be able to}} reach and cross Graham Land, and get to the whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay. He calculated that on the day Endurance [...] was abandoned they were 346 miles from Paulet Island. Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be , with a further [...] to Wilhelmina Bay. He believed the march was too risky; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water, and then escape in the boats. Shackleton overruled him.|$|E

[...] The Oxford team learned of the impending merger and the new name from Smith {{in the dressing room}} at Belle Vue just before the match against Doncaster on 16 April. Mark Jones, one of the Oxford midfielders, recalled that the room [...] "went totally quiet", and that his <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> that it might be hard to him to keep his place in the first team with Reading's players also on the books. According to Jones, Smith attempted to assuage the Oxford players' fears by telling them that [...] "we're only doing it so we can buy Kerry Dixon. All your places are safe". Alan Judge, the Reading goalkeeper, reported his team reacting in a similar way—indeed, he described the Reading players as even more worried as Oxford had far outperformed them in the League that season. Ley, who accompanied the Oxford team on the bus ride home after the game, recalled that the players were almost silent, their victory over Doncaster overshadowed by [...] "a feeling of incredulity, confusion, worry and fear".|$|E
500|$|In September 1935, Zhang {{returned}} to China at his family's request. [...] Hergé meanwhile set about preparing the strip {{for publication in}} book form through Casterman. Proud of this Adventure, he encouraged them to increase the level of marketing and advertising for the work. At their advice, he renamed the story from The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East to The Blue Lotus, commenting of this new title: [...] "It is short, it sounds Chinese and it is mysterious." [...] At Casterman's prompting, he also inserted a number of coloured plates throughout the work, and devised a new design for the front cover. The book was finally published in October 1936. Hergé {{was pleased with the}} product, commenting, [...] "I was just bowled over! It is the height of luxury and my <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> 'It's much too good for children!'... I was far from expecting that." [...] He sent a copy to Zhang, who replied to thank him. After news of its publication reached China, in 1939 political leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed The Blue Lotus, asked his wife Soong Mei-ling to invite Hergé to visit them there, although he was unable to do so due to the impending Second World War. He finally took up her offer in 1973, visiting her on the island of Taiwan.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, my <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was,</b> 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently. I was having so much fun hanging on a wire like Peter Pan, hanging onto a broom and doing other crazy stuff."

Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just leave it to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her {{to come to terms with}} what happened. When Toyah came face to face with Phil, her <b>first</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do.
