500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... and I must say that <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it</b> every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different." ...|$|E

[...] When asked if Silk still ties up the skates he said “I skate maybe {{once or twice a}} year for a charity event. [...] I can’t say <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> [...] I’m content. [...] I’m good friends with former teammates Jack O’Callahan and also with Jack Hughes and Ralph Cox, who were the last two cuts from the team that year. [...] The friendships, like I said, are the most important things for me to ever come out of my time in hockey” (Carroll).|$|E

6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{said the}} Blacksmith, [...] "I {{was trying to}} do what a better man than I did, and where he hit the mark <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> by an ell. Twas a pretty scrape I was in that day." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 30 December 1985, Connolly became tee-total, {{having been}} an alcoholic. [...] "I don't miss drinking. It has taken me by surprise," [...] Connolly stated 24 years later. [...] "I miss the craic. I miss {{the joy of}} it all. The headbanging stupidity, the loveliness, the craziness of it. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it</b> terribly." [...] He recalls blackouts that he would fill in upon {{returning}} to sobriety. [...] "Well, [...] stopped coming back. But when I drank, I would go, 'Oh, I remember now.'" [...] Psychologists call it state-dependent learning. [...] "That was frightening. I remember thinking, 'Beware, Billy boy. Beware. All is not well. Do something.'" [...] Regarding the decision he made to stay sober: [...] "If [...] goes away, I'm on my own. There's nothing. There's only me and it. So the choice becomes very apparent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Bob Costas {{claimed that}} despite still loving the game, he now felt a certain {{alienation}} from the institution. By {{the time that}} NBC lost Major League Baseball {{for the second time}} in twelve years, the sport endured a strike, realignment, the introduction of the wild card round, and NBC's complete loss of the regular season Game of the Week. Costas would add that since NBC only did a few games each year and he lacked the forum that he would eventually have (on HBO's On the Record with Bob Costas, Inside the NFL and Costas Now as well as Costas on the Radio) to express his views, he to some extent, started editorializing in games. When asked about whether or not the fact that NBC no longer had the baseball rights was disappointing, Bob Costas said [...] "I'm a little disappointed to lose baseball, but that's the way the business is. And it's not nearly as disappointing as it was when we lost it at the end of the '80s. Because then it was like baseball was the birthright for NBC. ... (Baseball is) not going to affect any decision that I have in the future. It's nowhere near as devastating as a decade ago. Different circumstances, different time. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it</b> a little bit but not a lot. I am very philosophical about this stuff. I have had wonderful opportunities in my career and no one wants to hear me complain about anything." [...] In 2009, Costas would become a contributor and occasional play-by-play announcer for MLB Network.|$|E

6000|$|ROBERTS: 'His own!' He {{abandons}} himself powerlessly upon a chair. 'Yes; I left my own watch here, {{and when}} that person brushed against me in the Common, <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> for the first time. I supposed he had robbed me, and ran after him, and--' ...|$|R
2500|$|Interviewed in 2009 he explained: “A bond of {{friendship}} producing heartfelt and honest music {{reminded me of}} our early days. <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>I</b> suppose the small notion of Red Box ‘riding again’ planted itself then. I suppose Plenty really began in the woods outside Gainesville, Florida. ” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Drummond moodily, [...] "you'd better {{leave me}} alone. There's something--if I'm quiet, I may get what I'm feeling for."

6000|$|... "No, it was horrid; so cold in winter, and hot in summer. And I got tired; {{and they}} were cross sometimes; and I didn't get enough to eat." [...] Nat paused to take a generous bite of gingerbread, as if to assure himself that the hard times were over; and then he added regretfully: [...] "But I did love my little fiddle, and <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> Nicolo took it away when father died, and wouldn't have me any longer, 'cause I was sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{saw them}} enter yesterday?" [...] said Hatton. [...] "I was sorry <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> but <b>I</b> {{was taking a}} walk with the Gerards up Dale to see the cottage where they once lived, and which they used to talk of so much! Was it a strong body?" ...|$|R

6000|$|There {{were not}} above {{a dozen other}} people in the room, and Basil contrasted the scene with that which the same place {{formerly}} presented. [...] "In the old time," [...] he said, [...] "every table was full, and we dined to the music of a brass band. I can't say I liked the band, but <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> I wonder if our Southern friend misses it? They gave us a very small allowance of brass band when we arrived, Isabel. Upon my word, I wonder what's come over the place," [...] he said, as the Southern party, rising from the table, walked out of the dining-room, attended by many treacherous echoes in spite of an ostentatious clatter of dishes that the waiters made.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{still think}} it was a great misfortune. Frankly, I have no idea what to make of my life. I don't know how to start again, to deal with the pieces in any {{intelligent}} fashion. Now that I am outside the thing, I see the narrowness of it all, I see that I was giving up many things which are interesting and beautiful, many friendships that might have been delightful, {{but on the other hand}} there was always the pressing on, the big, vital side, the great throb of life. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>it.</b> I feel to myself as a great factory sounds on Sundays and holidays, when the engine that drives all the machinery of the place is silent. I wander among the empty, quiet places, and I am lonely." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{returning}} to Earth and sharing his experiences to an audience, Skvorsov said [...] "I love spicy food, I make really hot chili sauce myself. <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> badly. <b>I</b> finished {{off all the}} spicy ketchup stock on the ISS and shocked everyone by making and eating wasabi sandwiches. That's my fuel, {{as good as a}} rocket's".|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs--Petty," [...] he said, trifling with a morsel of cheese, [...] "it {{is useless}} to disguise, from you that I {{may be going}} a journey, and I feel that I shall {{not be able to}} part from all the care you have, {{bestowed}} on me without recording in words my heartfelt appreciation of your devotion. <b>I</b> shall <b>miss</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>miss</b> <b>it</b> terribly, if, that is, I am permitted to miss anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{still love}} touring ...

50|$|My War Gone By, <b>I</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>It</b> So, is a noted book {{based on}} his {{experiences}} in Bosnia and Chechnya. The memoir is a chilling depiction of the depravity of war and adrenalin addiction Loyd experienced covering the violent dissolution of Yugloslavia in the mid-1990s. In the book Loyd staggers chapters about war in Bosnia, Chechnya, and boredom tinged with heroin addiction in London.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four, praising the film as [...] "an {{argument}} for the kinds of thrillers <b>I</b> <b>miss.</b> <b>It</b> entertains with story elements, in which the scares evolve from human behavior." [...] "Unlike too many thrillers that depend on stunts, special effects and the Queasy cam, this one devises a plot where it matters what happens. It's not all kinetic energy." ...|$|E
50|$|She began {{singing in}} 1962, after {{a return to}} Haiti. “Because in my family, we always loved singing and <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> started a little bit by chance: in a hotel…and on that evening I {{remember}} that I sang a song”.

6000|$|... 'Contented?' he answered, merrily. 'I am never contented, {{except with}} your freshness, my gentle Daisy.

60|$|We {{lived here}} very easy and quiet, and yet I cannot say I was so in my mind; I {{was like a}} fish out of water.
