In 1917, Keith sent Morris to Shanghai to open a new dried and frozen egg production company, the Amos Bird Company (which became part of The Borden Food Corporation).|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} compare the egg {{production}} and hatchability of local ducks under different management systems, namely semi-intensive and extensive. The research conducted was an experimental one-way classification with two treatments. Each treatment used 15 male and 120 females (mating ratio 1 : 8), and ducks aged 13 - 14 months. Eggs production was recorded during three weeks period. About 300 eggs were selected from each treatment to be hatched. Fertility was observed at 4 th days of hatching process using <b>egg</b> <b>candler.</b> Data of eggs production, eggs weight, fertility, and hatchability were analyzed using unpaired two sample Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test. The results showed that average of egg weight, fertility and hatchability were not different under two management system, but egg production in the semi-intensive maintenance was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) {{than those in the}} extensive system. Egg production in the semi-intensive was 12. 3...|$|E
