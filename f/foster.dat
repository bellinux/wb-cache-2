5|$|The {{house was}} built in 1878 for Theodore Waters <b>Foster,</b> born on May 19, 1847, to Chauncey <b>Foster</b> and Ophelia Remington. He was educated in Pawtucket and joined the Rhode Island Cavalry in 1863. He served in the American Civil War under Nathaniel P. Banks in the Red River Campaign. In 1873, he formed a jewelry-manufacturing {{partnership}} with Walter E. White and Samuel H. Baily, named White, <b>Foster</b> & Company. After White retired in 1878, the company was renamed <b>Foster</b> & Bailey. During this time, <b>Foster</b> constructed the house and lived in it {{for a period of}} four years, commuting to his place of business in Providence, Rhode Island. <b>Foster</b> would continue to be successful in his jewelry manufacturing business and his son, Theodore Clyde <b>Foster,</b> would succeed him upon his death in 1928. In 1882, Theodore <b>Foster</b> sold the home to George W. Payne, the owner of the G. W. Payne & Company.|$|E

Padayappa's father, the {{chieftain}} of the village, refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his <b>foster</b> brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies. Suryaprakash then cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's <b>foster</b> brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.|$|E

5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into <b>foster</b> care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for adopted children to get adopted from <b>foster</b> care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E
5|$|After a month {{without a}} club, <b>Foster</b> went on trial at League One club Preston North End in November 2012, managed by former Stevenage manager Graham Westley. The trial proved successful, and he signed on non-contract {{terms with the}} club on 18 December 2012. He made his debut {{on the same day}} in a 3–3 draw against Bury in the Football League Trophy, with Preston {{progressing}} following a penalty shoot-out. After impressing in his first four matches for the club, <b>Foster</b> signed a permanent contract, keeping him at Preston {{for the remainder of the}} 2012–13 season. In the club's next match, on 10 January 2013, a televised 3–2 defeat to Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena in the Football League Trophy, <b>Foster</b> scored his only goal for Preston, briefly restoring parity in the match as Coventry scored two injury-time goals to win the match. <b>Foster</b> made eight appearances in all competitions during his time with the club, and at the end of the season, new Preston manager Simon Grayson told him that his contract would not be renewed when it expired in June 2013.|$|E

He {{played in the}} club's opening {{pre-season}} fixture, coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute in a 1–1 draw with Ilkeston. No move materialised, and <b>Foster</b> signed non-contract terms with Northern Premier League Premier Division side Matlock Town to build match fitness ahead {{of a return to}} the professional game. He made his Matlock debut just a day after signing, on 18 August, playing the whole match as Matlock opened the season with a 5–0 home loss to Nantwich Town. <b>Foster</b> made ten appearances in all competitions for the club, leaving in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, <b>Foster</b> {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for <b>Foster</b> because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. <b>Foster</b> ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and <b>Foster</b> set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E

A year later, Landells launched Punch magazine, and as early as 1842 had Evans illustrate covers for the new publication. Evans worked and became friends with Myles Birket <b>Foster,</b> John Greenaway and George Dalziel. <b>Foster</b> and Evans became lifelong friends. When Landells received a commission from the Illustrated London News to provide illustrations of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, he sent Evans and <b>Foster</b> to Balmoral to make sketches, which Evans engraved. Toward the end of his apprenticeship, the demands of the Illustrated London News caused Evans to work late into the night and return early in the morning.|$|E

5|$|<b>Foster</b> joined newly {{promoted}} League Two side Stevenage on {{a two-year}} contract on 31 May 2010. <b>Foster</b> made his Stevenage {{debut in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, a 2–2 draw against Macclesfield Town, playing the whole game in the centre of defence. After the Macclesfield game, <b>Foster</b> did {{not appear in the}} first-team until late September 2010, coming on as a late substitute in Stevenage's 1–0 away win at Lincoln City. He then appeared as a 52nd-minute substitute in the club's victory over Burton Albion, but was sent-off for a foul on Shaun Harrad. <b>Foster</b> scored his first goal for Stevenage in January 2011, scoring the first goal of the game in Stevenage's 4–2 home win over Barnet. <b>Foster</b> received his second red card of the 2010–11 season in a game against Northampton Town, receiving the red card for a foul on Nana Ofori-Twumasi, a game that Stevenage went on to lose 2–0. Stevenage appealed against the sending off, but the appeal was subsequently rejected. This ultimately meant that <b>Foster</b> had played his last game of the 2010–11 season, serving a four-match suspension that ruled him out of Stevenage's end of season 3–3 draw with Bury, as well as the club's subsequent play-off campaign. <b>Foster</b> played 23 times for Stevenage in his only season with the club, scoring once, and the team went on to win promotion into League One via the play-offs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Foster</b> {{was named}} on standby for the England C team in November 2007 for a match against Finland C, {{but did not}} receive a call-up.
