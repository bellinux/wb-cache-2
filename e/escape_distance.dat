40|$|Camouflage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} antipredator strategies in the animal kingdom, yet no animal can match its background perfectly in a complex environment. Therefore, selection should favor individuals that use information on how effective their camouflage is in their immediate habitat when responding to an approaching threat. In a field study of African ground-nesting birds (plovers, coursers, and nightjars), we tested the hypothesis that individuals adaptively modulate their escape behavior in relation to their degree of background matching. We used digital imaging and models of predator vision to quantify differences in color, luminance, and pattern between eggs and their background, as well as the plumage of incubating adult nightjars. We found that plovers and coursers showed greater <b>escape</b> <b>distances</b> when their eggs were a poorer pattern match to the background. Nightjars sit on their eggs until a potential threat is nearby, and, correspondingly, they showed greater <b>escape</b> <b>distances</b> when the pattern and color match of the incubating adult's plumage-rather than its eggs-was a poorer match to the background. Finally, <b>escape</b> <b>distances</b> were shorter in the middle of the day, suggesting that escape behavior is mediated by both camouflage and thermoregulation.

50|$|While <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> {{has been}} {{generally}} {{used as a}} measure of tolerance, other changes in animal behavior in presence of humans, such as increased vigilance time at the cost of decreased feeding time, may have significant overall impact on wildlife. Therefore, it is suggested that a more conservative measure, namely, the alert distance, should be used in determining minimum approaching distance. The latter typically adds a certain buffer distance to the given tolerance measure.|$|E

These animals root through the leaf litter for 80% {{of their day}} looking for grasshoppers, beetles, spiders and other small invertebrates. The golden-rumped elephant shrew evolved various strategies to avoid predators, particularly snakes (such as black mambas and cobras) and the southern banded snake-eagle. This animal is fast, capable of running up to 25 km/h. When it detects a predator within its <b>escape</b> <b>distance,</b> it will adopt a defensive position and will try to escape taking advantage of its agility and speed. If, however, the predator is outside its <b>escape</b> <b>distance,</b> the elephant shrew will advertise its presence by slapping the leaf litter, letting the predator know it has been spotted. In {{the event of a}} chase or an ambush, the golden-rumped's flash of fur will often deflect the predator's attention away from the head and onto the rump, which has thicker skin and could give them an opportunity to survive and attack. The protected rump is more pronounced in males than female, and this dermal shield is roughly three times thicker than the skin in the middle of its back. [...] Each shrew maintains several nests so they cannot be easily found by leaving a trace or establishing a pattern.|$|E

The use of lead ammunition can result in severe contamination of game meat, thus posing a health risk to consumers. With any kind of ammunition for hunting, the terminal effectiveness of bullets is an animal welfare issue. Doubts {{about the effectiveness of}} non-lead bullets for a humane kill of game animals in hunting have been discussed. The length of the <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> after the shot has been used previously as an indicator for bullet performance. The object {{of this study was to}} determine how the bullet material (lead or non-lead) influences the observed escape distances. 1, 234 records of the shooting of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 825 records of the shooting of wild boar (Sus scrofa) were evaluated. As the bullet material cannot be regarded as the sole cause of variability of escape distances, interactions of other potential influencing variables like shot placement, shooting distance, were analyzed using conditional regression trees and two-part hurdle models. The length of the <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> is not influenced by the use of lead or non-lead ammunition with either roe deer or wild boar. With roe deer, the length of the <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> is influenced significantly by the shot placement and the type of hunting.

40|$|Predator-prey {{interactions}} are a primary structuring force in aquatic systems. A {{change in the}} predator-prey interactions may cause {{a change in the}} strength of trophic cascades and even resulting in ecosystem shifts. However, individual properties of predators and prey, as well as environmental conditions, may affect the relative strength of predator-prey interactions. In our studies we observed two different behavioural defences against predators. Both crucian carp and perch decreased their activity when exposed to pike chemical or visual cue. However, the behavioural response elicited by the chemical cue was context dependent, i. e. crucian carp only reacted to the cue if information from visual senses was limited (turbid or brown water). Another behavioural response to predation threat is schooling as shown in roach, a common prey fish, that group into schools to limit predation risk. The interaction between the predator and prey fish was influenced by optical conditions. Reaction distance of pike showed to be negatively affected by reduced visual conditions. The reaction distance and attack distance of pike and <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> of roach was also context dependent, where brown water increased the reaction and attack distance in pike and reduced the <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> in roach. This resulted in an overlap in attack and <b>escape</b> <b>distance,</b> which may have positive effects on the capture success of pike. Pikeperch was less affected by changes of the visual conditions in the water. However, pikeperch was indirectly affected by changing optical conditions through a change in prey behaviour. Pikeperch showed a strong preference for perch under good optical conditions, but shifted their food preference to roach in poor optical conditions. The underlying mechanism to this pattern was observed in behavioural studies. Roach escaped long before the pikeperch initiated an attack, whereas perch was inactive which allowed pikeperch to approach and successfully attack. In poor optical conditions roach shoals were splitting up and roach <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> was strongly reduced, which increased the foraging success of pikeperch resulting in that both roach and perch were included in the diet. These changes in the predator-prey interactions may explain some of the changes in fish growth rate observed in lakes along a gradient of brown colouration. Here, I found that the growth rate of pike and roach were reduced in browner lakes. Changes in environmental drivers, such as eutrophication and brownification, affecting the optical climate should thus have consequences for the strength of predator-prey interactions. This in turn may affect lake ecosystems through higher-order interactions...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of host-parasite interactions is increasingly recognized, few studies examine factors regulating how infection alters host behavior {{and the consequences of}} parasite-induced behavioral changes for predation risk. The present study assessed how infection by trematodes (parasitic flatworms) altered larval amphibian activity and whether these effects depended on trematode species, infection intensity, time post-infection, and/or host size. To examine the implications of these results for tadpole susceptibility to predation, we evaluated how infection by the most virulent trematode altered tadpole <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> from a simulated predator. Of three trematodes (Echinostoma trivolvis, Ribeiroia ondatrae and Alaria), only R. ondatrae significantly reduced activity of Chorus frog tadpoles (Pseudacris regilla) one day after exposure to 40 cercariae (larval trematodes). Increased R. ondatrae exposure correlated with decreased host activity, especially in smaller hosts. Whether hosts were exposed to acute or chronic parasite infections influenced recovery time to normal activity. Hosts exposed to parasites in a one-time pulse returned to normal activity within five days post-infection, whereas those exposed to smaller doses of parasites daily maintained reduced activity levels for five days. Finally, infection by R. ondatrae reduced host <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> from a simulated predator in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that trematode infection could increase predation susceptibility. These results show that significant components of host behavior, including activity levels and predator avoidance, are affected by parasite infection in a manner dependent on dose, parasite identity and host traits.

40|$|Pursuit and evasion {{behaviors}} in many predator-prey encounters {{occur in a}} geometrically structured environment. The physical structures in the environment impose strong constraints on the perception and behavioral responses of both antagonists. Nevertheless, no experimental or theoretical study has tackled the issue of quantifying {{the role of the}} habitat's architecture on the joint trajectories during a predator-prey encounter. In this study, we report the influence of microtopography of forest leaf litter on the pursuit-evasion trajectories of wolf spiders Pardosa sp. attacking the wood cricket Nemobius sylvestris. Fourteen intact leaf litter samples of 1 m √ó 0. 5 m were extracted from an oak-beech forest floor in summer and winter, with later samples having the most recently fallen leaves. Elevation was mapped at a spatial resolution of 0. 5 mm using a laser scanner. Litter structuring patterns were identified by height transects and experimental semi-variograms. Detailed analysis of all visible leaf-fragments of one sample enabled us to relate the observed statistical patterns to the underlying geometry of individual elements. Video recording of pursuit-evasion sequences in arenas with flat paper or leaf litter enabled us to estimate attack and fleeing distances as a function of substrate. The compaction index, the length of contiguous flat surfaces, and the experimental variograms showed that the leaf litter was smoother in summer than in winter. Thus, weathering as well as biotic activities compacted and flattened the litter over time. We found good agreement between the size of the structuring unit of leaf litter and the distance over which attack and escape behaviors both were initiated (both ‚àº 3 cm). There was a four-fold topographical effect on pursuit-escape sequences; compared with a flat surface, leaf litter (1) greatly reduced the likelihood of launching a pursuit, (2) reduced pursuit and <b>escape</b> <b>distances</b> by half, (3) put prey and predator on par in terms of pursuit and <b>escape</b> <b>distances,</b> and (4) reduced the likelihood of secondary pursuits, after initial escape of the prey, to nearly zero.

Escape rate (total number of escapes/total number of attacks x 100), <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> and the number of larvae remaining at the end of the experiment were measured. In the experiment with gobies, in the UV-treated larvae, both escape rate and <b>escape</b> <b>distance</b> (36 %, 38 +- 7. 5 mm respectively) were significantly lower than those of control larvae (75 %, 69 +- 4. 7 mm respectively).

No apparent escape response was observed, and survival rate was not significantly different, between treatments (UV: 66 %, Control: 74 %) in the experiment with jellyfish.

Prey exposed to elevated CO 2 (880 ¬µatm) or a present-day control (440 ¬µatm) interacted with similarly exposed predators in a cross-factored design. Predators had the lowest capture success when exposed to elevated CO 2 and interacting with prey exposed to present-day CO 2.
