30|$|Entrepreneurship {{intention}} is the motivation/desire {{to establish and}} run an electronic business venture or an enterprise. Entrepreneurship {{intention is}} the product of the individual’s attitude and values. Entrepreneurship intention is the state of mind of an individual to foster creativity in a business venture Rasli et al. (2013). Intention is a state of an individual’s mind which directs the individual towards something or object(s) for achieving a specific objective (Rasli et al., 2013). The intention of an individual manifests in the behaviour of such individual. Krueger et al. (2000) explained that entrepreneurship is a type of planned behaviour for which intention models are appropriate. Entrepreneurship intention is the desire which one has either to establish <b>electronic</b> business <b>enterprise</b> or not. Such a desire is translated into action once the individual is able to meet the conditions necessary for starting the <b>electronic</b> business <b>enterprise.</b> Entrepreneurship intention is determined by attitude towards behaviour (perceived desirability and feasibility), perceived behavioural control and subjective norms (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975). Attitude towards behaviour is an individual’s behaviour towards entrepreneurship factors, which is regarded in this study as Attitude Towards Entrepreneurship Factors (ATEF). Perceived desirability is the level of interest and attraction an individual has towards <b>electronic</b> business <b>enterprise.</b> Müller (2008), is of the view that perceived desirability is the perceived attractiveness of a specific behaviour, such as becoming an entrepreneur. It reflects an individual affection towards electronic entrepreneurial venture. It shows the desire of such an individual towards <b>electronic</b> business <b>enterprise</b> with the possibility that if appropriate criteria are met, such an individual is likely to start the desired <b>electronic</b> business <b>enterprise.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Targowski {{based his}} master thesis on his {{involvement}} in the development of enterprise-wide systems in the heavy machinery industry in Poland, while in the U.S. defined his first version of the theory of enterprise-wide systems. It is composed of the Generic Enterprise Processive Model, Bill of Systems Processor (BOSP), the Federational Architecture of Information Management Complex, and the System Planning Technique of Enterprise-wide IMS. He published this theory in Journal of Management Information Systems, Fall 1988 (vol.5, no.2, pp. 23-38). He expanded this theory into the Architecture of Hierarchical IMS, strategic and tactical planning http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/tactical-planning.html of enterprise-wide systems and defining the generic systems architectures for such systems as MIS, control system, Management Support System, Manufacturing Operation IS, Construction Operation IS, Office IS, and Home IS. He published these in his book The Architecture and Planning of Enterprise-wide IMS (1990). He continued the development of this theory by defining models of 8 enterprise systems configurations; off-line enterprise, on-line enterprise, integrated enterprise, agile enterprise, informated enterprise, communicated enterprise, mobile enterprise, <b>electronic</b> <b>enterprise,</b> and virtual enterprise. This approach should provide a clear target for the enterprise systems software development, just as in civil engineering the architecture of a church should be different from that of a school. To understand the invisible complexityof thousands of electronic systems of an enterprise, he defined the generic architecture of Enterprise Information Infrastructure, composed of 6 layers, such as 1-Telecommunication Layer, 2-Computer Networks Layer, 3-Internet Layer, 4-Computing Layer, 5-Communication Layer, and 6-Application Layer. He also defined analytical approaches to align business and IT strategies and published these new approaches in his book Electronic Enterprise: Strategy and Architecture (2003). He generalized the Enterprise Systems Approach through the classification of enterprises into the following categories; industrial enterprise, service enterprise, <b>electronic</b> <b>enterprise,</b> virtual enterprise, value-creation enterprise, sustainable enterprise and defined their basic characteristics. He also defined the evolution of the enterprise systems development and published these new approaches in his chapter on The Enterprise Systems Approach in the book Social, Managerial, and Organizational Dimensions of Enterprise Information Systems(2010) edited by Maria Manuela Cruz-Cunha. Further work led him to defining the generic architecture of a service enterprise, what he published in his paper on The Architecture of Service Systems as the Framework for the Definition of Service Science Scope in International Journal of Information Systems in the Service Sector, January-March2009, vol.1, No.1. In 2009 he expanded his approach to enterprise systems by presenting his information systems-based model of a sustainable enterprise at the International Conference CENTERIS-2009, October 7-9 in Ofir, Portugal—How to Transform the Information Infrastructure with respect to sustainability and global-orientation, and to Monitor and Predict the Sustainability of Civilization: the Organizational and Social Aspect. (Proceedings, pp. 17-28). He generalized mathematically the generic model of hierarchical information systems in his chapter on [...] "Info-Mathics-The Mathematical Modelling of Information Systems (including BOSP)" [...] in L.

40|$|Enterprises {{often need}} to {{communicate}} and exchange data among each other. Previously, such communication was mainly achieved by human contact, letter exchange, by telephone and by fax. In the early stage of the Internet and <b>electronic</b> procurement (e-Procurement), <b>enterprises</b> built the channel for exchanging data by using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). However, in the later stage {{of the development of}} the Internet, which is known as the globalized electronic marketplace (e-Marketplace) stage, the standard of data interchange has become the major factor for suppliers to succeed in e-Marketplace.

40|$|The {{electronics}} {{sector is}} one of the fastest developing industry branches. Rapidly changing product systems and components are a challenge for producers and designers to create ecodesign suitable electronic products. Therefore a fast and flexible tool is needed to accomplish ecodesign on products and processes with reasonable effort. Due to the fact that ecodesign should reflect life cycle thinking (a consideration of only one stage of the life cycle might lead to a shifting of burdens), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a proper tool to fulfil these requirements. Since the European ecodesign directives (EuP/ErP) are extended to more and more applications including <b>electronic</b> components, <b>electronic</b> <b>enterprises</b> will be faced with an increasing demand to provide their customers information concerning the environmental profiles of their products.
