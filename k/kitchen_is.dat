5|$|This line — {{with many}} non-hamburger sandwiches, {{including}} chicken and fish — significantly expanded {{the breadth of}} the Burger King menu. The amount of new additions, several new sandwiches made with disparate ingredients was made possible due the design of Burger King's kitchen. The chain's <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> modeled around a more flexible concept that allows for a multiple work-flow operations where preparation stations can be re-tasked more easily. In comparison, McDonald's kitchen at the time was a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to new products. This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King and other similar chains that were more flexible and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} floor is the hall, with a kitchen occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The kitchen was replaced by a larger one in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller fireplace was inserted into the large kitchen hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a windowless room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above the <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet walks around the stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|E

5|$|While {{overseen by}} Heston Blumenthal, the head chef in the <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> Ashley Palmer-Watts. Palmer-Watts has {{previously}} worked with Blumenthal since 1999, and {{for five years}} was head chef at Blumenthal's other restaurant, the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck. The two chefs researched historical menu choices {{with help from the}} British Library and food historians. Blumenthal's first experience of historical cuisine was in 2000 when he discovered a recipe for roast chicken which required the bird to be plucked alive, and then cooked with a small volume of mercury. This was further enhanced as he filmed Heston's Feasts for Channel 4, in which he created a variety of feasts from different historical eras including Tudor, Medieval and Victorian. Despite being called Dinner, the restaurant is also open for lunch as the meaning of the name is intended to be the main meal of the day, regardless of the time at which it is eaten.|$|E

25|$|The urban {{middle class}} imitated the luxurious dining {{styles of the}} upper class as best as they could.

Because of this, these middle-class <b>kitchens</b> <b>were</b> often more homely {{than those of the}} upper class, where the <b>kitchen</b> <b>was</b> a work-only room occupied only by the servants. Besides a cupboard to store the kitchenware, there were a table and chairs, where the family would dine, and sometimes—if space allowed—even a fauteuil or a couch.|$|R
