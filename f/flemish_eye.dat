50|$|The {{end of a}} {{wire rope}} tends to fray readily, and cannot be easily {{connected}} to plant and equipment. There are different ways of securing the ends of wire ropes to prevent fraying. The most common and useful type of end fitting for a wire rope is to turn the end back to form a loop. The loose end is then fixed back on the wire rope. Termination efficiencies vary from about 70% for a <b>Flemish</b> <b>eye</b> alone; to nearly 90% for a <b>Flemish</b> <b>eye</b> and splice; to 100% for potted ends and swagings.|$|E

50|$|Johannes Kepler was {{the first}} to realize that Ptolemy's {{estimate}} must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his Rudolphine Tables (1627). Kepler's laws of planetary motion allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the telescope allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked <b>eye.</b> <b>Flemish</b> astronomer Godefroy Wendelin repeated Aristarchus' measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.|$|R

50|$|Ghostkeeper The {{music of}} Ghostkeeper is a continually-evolving organism; the {{defining}} aspect {{of all their}} music to date, coursing through each of their evolutionary stages, is that the band truly sounds like no one else. The current iteration of the band - uniting core members/vocalists Shane Ghostkeeper and Sarah Houle with drummer Eric Hamelin (Chad VanGaalen, Nomoreshapes) and bassist Ryan Bourne (Sleepkit, Devonian Gardens, Chad VanGaalen) - has carved out Ghostkeeper’s most unique soundworld to date. Their songs incorporate elements of '60s girl-group melodies, dashes of country royalty- Lynn, Wynette, and Cline -, and a profound melodic sense drawn equally from ‘90s indie rock, African pop, and traditional Aboriginal pow wow music. And the results are as catchy as they are singular. The group {{takes its name from}} main songwriter: Shane Ghostkeeper. Their debut album Children of the Great Northern Muskeg was released on Saved by Radio on July 15, 2008 in Canada. The band's second album, titled Ghostkeeper, was released on March 9, 2010 by <b>Flemish</b> <b>Eye</b> Records.|$|E

Native Speaker has received mostly positive reviews from critics, with the group's percussive sound likened to Feels-era Animal Collective and praised for its innovative melodies and Standell-Preston's [...] "dynamic" [...] vocals. Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, declaring that he could not stop listening to the record and comparing the importance of the group's debut to early Broken Social Scene and Arcade Fire. The group also garnered positive reviews from Jon Pareles of The New York Times who said that the music is as [...] "mesmerizing and vertiginous as desire can be", while Paul Lester remarked in The Guardian that the band's [...] "experimental dream pop delivered through a shoegaze haze" [...] warrants comparisons to [...] "very important bands". Reviews from Spin, Rolling Stone and Pitchfork were also positive, with the publications rating the record 8 out of 10, 7.9 out of 10 and 3.5 out of 5 stars, respectively.|$|E
