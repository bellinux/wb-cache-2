The factors must be {{validated}} by the other party for validation to occur. In debit cards authentication mechanisms which can be easily cracked using different mechanisms. According to US attorney report at least 7, 000 fake identities are used to obtain more than 25, 000 credit cards and documented $ 200 million in losses, but the figure could rise. The present authentication mechanisms use mechanism where we enter our PIN in pos (point of sale) devices where it is vulnerable in case if we have any skimmer devices installed {{in any one of}} the component. Sometimes we have to enter OTP (one time password) in card reader, but it’s vulnerable in case of lost or theft of both mobile and card together. In proposed method, GSM mobile service is used provide the security. When the Debit card is used, Server will request user to enter a password in his/her mobile phone. If the password valid, Server proceeds the transaction, if not so, denies it. The proposed solution effectively prevents clone cards and relay attacks on Debit cards using mobile phone authentication through the <b>flash</b> <b>message</b> service.

40|$|Heartbeat {{synchronization}} {{strives to}} have nodes in a distributed system generate periodic, local “heartbeat” events approximately {{at the same}} time. Many useful distributed protocols rely {{on the existence of}} such heartbeats for driving their cycle-based execution. Yet, solving the problem in environments where nodes are unreliable and messages are subject to delays and failures is non-trivial. We present a heartbeat synchronization protocol for overlay networks inspired by mathematical models of flash synchronization in certain species of fireflies. In our protocol, nodes send <b>flash</b> <b>messages</b> to their neighbors when a local heartbeat triggers. They adjust the phase of their next heartbeat based on incoming <b>flash</b> <b>messages</b> using an algorithm inspired by mathematical models of firefly synchronization. We report simulation results of the protocol in various realistic failure scenarios typical in overlay networks and show that synchronization emerges even when messages can have significant delay subject to large jitter. 1...|$|R

5000|$|As the war escalated, {{thousands}} of observation posts were established {{on the east}} coast from the top of Maine to the tip of Florida, and roughly inland as far as the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. On the west coast, posts ranged from upper Washington to lower California. Each post had its own code name and number. When aircraft were spotted, the volunteers would record their observations on forms or in log books and then quickly place a call to a regional Army Filter Center and verbally deliver a [...] "Flash Message" [...] which contained the organized data from the observation.

5000|$|Heliograph Peak {{was home}} to a 19th-century {{heliograph}} station. [...] "During General Nelson Miles' mid-1880s campaign against the Apaches led by Geronimo, a U.S. Signal Corps officer named Colonel William A. Glassford established an innovative signal system. Atop mountain peaks throughout southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico, soldiers manned stations using mirrors, or heliographs, to <b>flash</b> <b>messages</b> across great distances. Heliograph Peak, {{as one of the}} highest mountains in southeast Arizona, served as one of the peaks in that system. Miles cornered Geronimo in 1886 and had him sent into exile in Florida. As a reward for their efforts, the Apache scouts that had helped defeat Geronimo were sent into exile along with him. Shortly thereafter, the heliograph system was abandoned along with a number of forts used in the Apache campaign." ...|$|R
5000|$|Known for {{his first}} person {{narratives}} and stylized use of images, White's films explore love, obsession, alienation, memories, and dreams.

He has made three films based on the work of Peabody Award winning radio personality and writer Joe Frank (Dirt, Soulmate, and Magda). White has directed music videos for Radiohead's lead singer Thom Yorke, The Melvins, Tom Brosseau, Chrysta Bell & David Lynch, and collaborated with the Oregon Symphony.

The Royals went up 2-0 in the fourth on Lonnie Smith's two-run double.

White came through with a two-run home run off of Andújar in the fifth. The Cardinals scored their only run of the game in the sixth off of Bret Saberhagen on consecutive singles by Ozzie Smith, Tom Herr, and Jack Clark.
