5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition.

Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch <b>her</b> <b>breast</b> or leg.|$|E
