40|$|AbstractInterventional {{radiology}} (IVR) {{refers to}} a variety of minimally invasive procedures using small-caliber catheters under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance for the treatment of vascular and digestive diseases. Common IVR applications include dilatation, occlusion, and selective cannulation of vessels and the digestive canal without open surgery. Indications for IVR are rapidly increasing. However, ergonomic problems of IVR for physicians have not been considered. Such ergonomic problems and countermeasures were investigated in this study. Ergonomic problems during hepatic arterial catheterization and placement of a stent in the digestive canal, two frequent IVR procedures, were investigated. Ergonomic problems of IVR, problems induced by X-ray protectors, inadequate working postures and asthenopia induced by the apparatus, impaired maneuverability and neuro-muscular fatigue forced by small caliber catheter for intra-vascular catheterization, lacks <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> <b>usability</b> and standardization the devices and instruction documents are revealed in this study. For the continued safe development of IVR, outstanding ergonomic and technological problems must be resolved. Potential solutions include the development of adequate holding and accessory devices for small-caliber devices, improved educational software, and head-mounted displays. Further analyses of the workflow and ergonomic medical device design with input from end users are also critical...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of remote sensing, {{image-based}} object recognition can benefit from direct measurement of characteristic dimensions. But in many cases image resolution and collateral data about the mapping properties do not provide sufficient precision for the intended purposes of object identification. In such cases the recognition performance can often be increased significantly by coupling several characteristic dimensions and taking their mutual relations into account. The approach proposed in this paper defines so-called "keypoint models" that describe certain object classes by the geometrical arrangement of characteristic features, denoted as keypoints. A feature space is spanned by the normalized distances of these keypoints. The complexity of the models as expressed {{by the number of}} keypoints is scalable and gets selected according to the specific recognition needs. Different model variants cover the significance of object features according to the spectral sensitivity of the sensor. Keypoints are intended to be marked interactively by an image analyst while taking into account to inaccuracies caused by image resolution and other possible ambiguities. We demonstrate our approach in the example domain of airplanes where the complexity of our actually most sophisticated model amounts to ten keypoints. We place special emphasis on the aspects <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> <b>usability</b> for image analysts working under time pressure. Perspectives of integrated automatic feature-extraction techniques are also discussed briefly...|$|R

40|$|Decisions and {{judgments}} {{made after}} deliberation can differ from expert opinion {{and be more}} regretted over time than intuitive judgments and decisions. We investigated a possible underlying process of this phenomenon, namely global versus local processing style. We argue that deliberation induces a local processing style. This processing style narrows conceptual attention and can have detrimental effects on judgment and decision-making. Study 1 showed that <b>intuitive</b> judgments <b>of</b> quality of modern paintings were more accurate than were more deliberate, reasoned judgments. Study 2 showed that local versus global processing style is associated with accuracy of quality judgments of paintings, and Study 3 replicated this finding with an experimental manipulation of processing style.

40|$|The rapid {{technical}} progress in cyber threats and cyber security poses increased cognitive demands on cyber officers. The macrocognitive demand characteristics {{placed on the}} cyber officers exceed those in most common military contexts and are new in nature. Research on decision-making competence within the cyber domain is needed to identify strategies and give {{a better understanding of}} how these strategies can have consequences depending on task characteristics. Belief in one’s capabilities to handle a certain task has been shown to be a key factor for cognitive performance. This study investigated how high self-efficacy negatively moderated intuitive decision-making tendencies on performance when facing a problem that required counterintuitive strategies. Twenty-seven cyber officer cadets from the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy participated in an experiment assessing self-efficacy, interoceptive sensitivity, and decision-making. Participants with high situational self-efficacy generally performed better, but this relationship was moderated by interoceptive sensitivity. The findings suggest potential detrimental <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> decision-making tendencies in combination with high self-efficacy.

The project Guardian Angels for a Smarter Life is a {{research}} platform in nanoscience, zero-power research and advanced ICT headed by Prof Adrian Ionescu (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne) and Prof Christofer Hierold (ETH Zurich). The project assembles a pan-European network - 28 academic, R&D and industrial partners from 13 European countries - to create intelligent and autonomous systems serving individuals in their daily lives. It will meet the technological challenge of weaving together energy efficient information processing, sensing, communication and energy harvesting. The project goal is to develop environmentally-friendly, battery-free technologies for these electronic personal assistants, {{so that they will}} harvest their own energy rather than requiring an external power source. The GA flagship project will show the feasibility and functionality of devices in three pre-defined generations of demonstrators: physical, environmental and emotional domains. The applications are based on the concept of a smarter life, e.g. a lifestyle that benefits from the instant availability of relevant information, more interconnectedness between devices fitted with all sorts <b>of</b> sensors, and <b>intuitive</b> <b>usability.</b>|$|R
40|$|DissertationAdult {{women in}} the {{community}} experience a range of problematic relationships with food and their bodies. This is demonstrated in the high prevalence of obesity and overweight, disordered eating, and body image dissatisfaction. Existing interventions targeting these issues are limited in scope and targeted population. More holistic interventions that meet the range of needs of adult {{women in the}} community are needed. This study examines the efficacy of one such intervention, called Eat for Life. The Eat for Life program combines two innovative paradigms, intuitive eating and mindful eating, to help women develop a positive relationship with food and their bodies. The study hypothesized that participants in the Eat for Life program would demonstrate significantly better outcomes {{on a range of}} eating and weight-related measures than those in a wait-list control group. Results demonstrated that at post- 10 weeks, Eat for Life participants demonstrated significantly greater scores on intuitive eating, mindfulness, and body appreciation and significantly lower scores on disordered eating than those in the wait-list group. Results also found mindfulness to serve as a partial mechanism of the significant differences between groups on the other measures. These findings have implications for the positive <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> and mindful eating in the treatment of a range of eating and weight-related issues...|$|R

The ability of the shape model to predict new head shapes is evaluated by considering the prediction error distributions. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> using <b>intuitive</b> anthropometric measurements as parameters is examined and the sensitivity to measurement errors is determined. Using all anthropometric measurements, the average prediction error is 1. 60 ± 0. 36 mm, which shows the feasibility of the new parameters.

30|$|Mindfulness is {{also related}} to the concept <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> eating, which {{describes}} the tendency of an individual to be observant {{of his or her}} body signals and emotions and to eat according to physical hunger and satiety cues rather than emotions and rigid rules about the “right” and “wrong” types <b>of</b> food. <b>Intuitive</b> eating encourages the pleasure derived from eating, along with a healthy relationship with food, mind, and body, instead of engaging in reactive maladaptive eating behaviors. Therefore, intuitive eating encompasses the mindfulness components of acceptance and awareness (Tribole and Resch, 2012). A study by Duarte et al. (2016) found that intuitive eating significantly moderated the relationship between negative affect and binge eating, suggesting that increased levels <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> eating may buffer the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> depressive symptoms on binge eating. Mindful eating and intuitive eating {{have been found to be}} inversely associated with binge and emotional eating (Katterman, Kleinman, Hood, Nackers, and Corsica, 2014). As those concepts <b>of</b> mindful and <b>intuitive</b> eating represent adaptive eating behaviors, related especially with present moment awareness, these variables are naturally inversely associated with eating triggered by emotions or lacking awareness, like in binge or emotional eating. However, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> an DBT skills training-based intervention and time still need to be examined in intuitive eating and mindful eating. Moreover, if DBT skills training leads to the path of mindful eating (Wisniewski, Safer, and Chen, 2007) the mediational role of mindful eating needs to be investigated.|$|R

40|$|Material {{removed from}} thesis due to {{copyright}} reasons: Wright, M. J., Teagle, D. A. H., & Feetham, P. M. (2014). A quantitative {{evaluation of the}} public response to climate engineering. Nature Climate Change, 4 (2), 106 - 110. doi: 10. 1038 /NCLIMATE 2087 This thesis investigates whether marketing theories and methodologies {{can be used to}} facilitate upstream public engagement with contentious scientific issues. Upstream engagement requires the early involvement of citizens in decisions about new science or technology from the conceptualisation stage onwards; before ingrained attitudes, social representations or frames in the media bias responses. Contemporary approaches to science communication lack consensus on the most appropriate approach to engage the public with new science and technology. The research addresses upstream communication in the context of climate engineering. Scientists and the International Panel for Climate Change are considering climate engineering as a potential solution to global warming, given that the present methods of mitigation and adaptation have so far failed to sufficiently reduce global temperatures to a level of 1. 5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The communication of potential solutions to global warming is a vital part of a critical global issue that will impact the planet’s eco-systems, biodiversity and future generations. Marketing may be able to provide methodologies and techniques for evaluating and measuring public perceptions of climate engineering. As well as contributing to upstream science communication and public engagement, the research contributes to marketing theory in two ways. First, it extends the application of brand image research founded on the Associative Network Theory of Memory (ANTM) to science concepts, demonstrating the robustness of the theory. Second, it extends the information dual-processing theory to investigate the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> and deliberative thinking on concept evaluations, and whether these views change with greater deliberation. In the qualitative phase, thirty exploratory semi-structured depth interviews, using two methods of attribute elicitation, provided 12 common attributes associated with climate engineering. The findings identified an overall negative public reaction to the four climate engineering technologies tested. The independent qualitative findings also revealed a strikingly clear result – Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies are perceived more positively than Solar Radiation Management technologies. The subsequent quantitative on-line surveys tested public perceptions of six climate engineering techniques in Australia (n = 1, 006) and New Zealand (n = 1, 022). The results of the on-line surveys supported the qualitative findings that associations with climate engineering techniques are predominately negative, and allowed further diagnostic insights into the sources of these evaluations for each of the individual techniques tested. The analysis established the data are robust and stable across the two countries and the methodologies are validated by the strikingly similar aggregate findings across the qualitative and quantitative stages. For the comparison <b>of</b> <b>intuitive</b> and deliberative thinking on memory associations with climate engineering the effects are measured by comparing within sample groups split by the length of time taken to complete the online survey. In Australia, the findings show that greater deliberative thinking is associated with more negative evaluations, indicating that intuitive and deliberative thinking do give different results in magnitude, if not in direction for these data. In New Zealand, greater deliberative thinking is not associated with more negative evaluations suggesting that the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> deliberative thinking on the evaluation of climate engineering concepts is moderated by the country of study, or by the prior beliefs of the country’s population. A final stage of research used five focus groups in New Zealand to investigate whether deliberative arguments and interactions help participants make sense of unfamiliar, multifaceted or contentious issues, and whether different perspectives are influenced by age, gender or the ethnicity of participants. Overall, most participants were sceptical of climate engineering, although some between-group differences were apparent. Knowledge of climate engineering varied between groups, with younger participants unaware of climate engineering, and reluctant to consider research on the technologies. Conversely, in the retiree group all but one participant had heard of climate engineering and the most of the participants were receptive to the idea of proceeding with research on climate engineering technologies. This further demonstrates that the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> deliberation may be context specific. The results confirm the practicality of extending concept testing and measurement of memory associations to upstream engagement for controversial scientific methods, showing convergent validity across countries and methods. The results demonstrate that mixed mode research using marketing techniques yields a range of insights that are not otherwise available in upstream public engagement. Finally, the research finds that more deliberative responses may affect the magnitude of concept evaluations, but the effect is contextual. This highlights the need for further research to provide better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> deliberation on evaluations...|$|R
