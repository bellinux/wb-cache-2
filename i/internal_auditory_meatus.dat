40|$|Background: Skeletal non-metric {{variables}} {{are widely used}} for population studies. Genetic factors and the usefulness of non-metric traits in population studies were studied by many workers. One of the non-metric traits (shape of external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus)</b> was studied in present study. Methods: For the study 148 skulls (113 males, 35 females) were used. The crania were retrieved in the Department of Anatomy, Pt. B. D. Sharma PGIMS Rohtak, India. The current investigation {{will focus on the}} shape of external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus.</b> Results: Shape of external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> was oval /ellipse in most of the cases in North West Indian crania. Oval/ellipse shape of external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> (EAM) was almost equally distributed (48. 13 % and 47. 80 % respectively) followed by round shape (4. 07 %). No statistically significant bilateral asymmetry was found in present series. Conclusions: Present study has reflected that in addition to caucasoid and negroid features, crania of present series have some resemblance with mongoloid too because of oval/ellipse shape of EAM. Study of shape of meatus will help in racial identification in medico legal cases. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (7. 000) : 2809 - 2811...|$|R

5000|$|Near {{the center}} is a large orifice, the {{internal}} acoustic opening, the size of which varies considerably; its margins are smooth and rounded, and it leads into the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> a short canal, about 1 cm. in length, which runs lateralward.

5000|$|The petromastoid part is {{developed}} from four centers, which make their {{appearance in the}} cartilaginous ear capsule about the fifth or sixth month. One (proötic) appears {{in the neighborhood of}} the eminentia arcuata, spreads in front and above the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> and extends to the apex of the bone; it forms part of the cochlea, vestibule, superior semicircular canal, and medial wall of the tympanic cavity. A second (opisthotic) appears at the promontory on the medial wall of the tympanic cavity and surrounds the fenestra cochleæ; it forms the floor of the tympanic cavity and vestibule, surrounds the carotid canal, invests the lateral and lower part of the cochlea, and spreads medially below the <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus.</b> A third (pterotic) roofs in the tympanic cavity and antrum; while the fourth (epiotic) appears near the posterior semicircular canal and extends to form the mastoid process (Vrolik).|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{impedance}} {{testing is}} an objective method for determining middle ear function. Such {{an aid to}} diagnosis of middle ear pathology and application to clinical audiology was first realized by Metz (1946). Acoustic impedance measures the opposition encountered by an acoustic wave. When a sourxd is introduced to the external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> one can measure the opposition that exists at the lateral surface of the tympanic membrane or at some plane within the external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus.</b> These clinical acoustic impedance measurements may be classified as either static or dynamic. Static acoustic impedance measurements are made with ambient air pressure within the external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus,</b> while dynamic measurements are made when the air pressure is varied within the external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus.</b> Dynamic measurements basically describe the mobility of the tympanic membrane; by knowing the mobility of the tympanic membrane one can determine {{the function of the}} middle ear. Tympanic membrane mobility can also be determined by otoscopic examination, using a Siegle otoscope. The physician varies the air pressure within the external <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> by squeezing on a bulb that is attached to the otoscope. The tympanic membrane moves as the air pressure is varied. Middle ear function is then determined by the amount of mobility. The purpose of this study will be to compare two methods far determining middle ear malfunction: acoustic impedance measurement and otoscopic examination. This will be done by testing patients with middle ear pathologies using both methods and comparing the test results with the surgically-confirmed results. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the clinical application of {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and CT in children with profound deafness before cochlear implant {{and their impact on}} surgical decision. METHODS: The pre-operative CT and MRI data from 71 children with bilateral profound deafness planned for cochlear implant were studied. RESULTS: 12 patients showed enlarged vestibular aqueduct (16. 9 %); 14 patients had Mondini malformation (19. 7 %); 3 patients demonstrated enlarged <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> (4. 2 %); and 2 patients were suspected to have fistulae (2. 8 %) on both CT and MRI examinations. In comparison between MRI and CT, unilateral cochlear fibrosis was detected in 5 patients(7 %) by MRI, but none by CT scans. Bilateral dehiscent facial nerve was detected in 1 patient(1. 4 %) by CT scan, while MRI was normal. CONCLUSION: CT and MRI are essential for the pre-operative planning of cochlear implant, especially in patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct, Mondini malformation, enlarged <b>internal</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>meatus</b> and suspected fistulae. These two imaging modalities are complementary to each other in cases with cochlear fibrosis and facial nerve dehiscence. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
