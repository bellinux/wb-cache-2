50|$|Acetylation and ubiquitination are {{examples}} of two post-translational modifications that affect the function of histone H2B in particular ways. Hyperacetylation of histone tails helps DNA-binding proteins access chromatin by weakening histone-DNA and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Furthermore, acetylation of a specific lysine residue binds to bromine-containing domains of certain transcription and chromatin regulatory proteins. This docking facilitates the recruitment of these proteins to the correct region of the chromosome. Ubiquitinated histone H2B is often found in regions of active transcription. Through the facilitation of chromatin remodeling, it stimulates transcriptional <b>elongation</b> and <b>sets</b> the stage for further modifications that regulate multiple elements of transcription. Specifically, the ubiquitin on histone H2B opens up and unfolds regions of chromatin allowing transcription machinery access to the promoter and coding regions of DNA.|$|R

Just how Aire targets and induces PTA transcripts remains largely undefined. Screening via Aire-targeted coimmunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, and validating by multiple RNAi-mediated knockdown approaches, we identified a large set of proteins that associate with Aire. They fall into four major functional classes: nuclear transport, chromatin binding/structure, transcription and pre-mRNA processing. One set of Aire interactions centered on DNA protein kinase and a group of proteins it partners with to resolve DNA double-stranded breaks or promote transcriptional <b>elongation.</b> Another <b>set</b> of interactions was focused on the pre-mRNA splicing and maturation machinery, potentially explaining the markedly more effective processing of PTA transcripts in the presence of Aire. These findings suggest a model to explain Aire's widespread targeting and induction of weakly transcribed chromatin regions. PaperCli...|$|R
50|$|Mercury is {{technically}} brightest {{as seen from}} Earth when it is at a full phase. Although Mercury is farthest from Earth when it is full, the greater illuminated area that is visible and the opposition brightness surge more than compensates for the distance. The opposite is true for Venus, which appears brightest when it is a crescent, because it is much closer to Earth than when gibbous.Nonetheless, the brightest (full phase) appearance of Mercury is an essentially impossible time for practical observation, because of the extreme proximity of the Sun. Mercury is best observed at {{the first and last}} quarter, although they are phases of lesser brightness. The first and last quarter phases occur at greatest elongation east and west of the Sun, respectively. At both of these times Mercury's separation from the Sun ranges anywhere from 17.9° at perihelion to 27.8° at aphelion.

40|$|Set 2 -mediated H 3 K 36 {{methylation}} is {{an important}} histone modification on chromatin during transcription <b>elongation.</b> Although <b>Set</b> 2 associates with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), the mechanism of Set 2 binding to chromatin and subsequent exertion of its methyltransferase activity is relatively uncharacterized. We identified a critical lysine residue in histone H 4 that is needed for interaction with Set 2 and proper H 3 K 36 di- and trimethylation. We also determined that the N terminus of Set 2 contains a histone H 4 interaction motif that allows Set 2 to bind histone H 4 and nucleosomes. A Set 2 mutant lacking the histone H 4 interaction motif is able to bind to the phosphorylated CTD of RNAPII and associate with gene-specific loci but is defective for H 3 K 36 di- and trimethylation. In addition, this Set 2 mutant shows increased H 4 acetylation and resistance to 6 -Azauracil. Overall, our study defines a new interaction between Set 2 and histone H 4 that mediates trans-histone regulation of H 3 K 36 methylation, which is needed for the preventative maintenance and integrity of the genome...|$|R
40|$|TutorialFlexible sealing elements, {{typically}} elastomeric O-rings {{are commonly}} used to contain fluids within pressurized cavities of turbomachinery at the interfaces between adjoining components. All too often the only selection criteria applied for these sealing element is chemical resistance and a check that the service conditions are within the published temperature limits for the material being considered. This seemingly simplistic selection process can be complicated when the fluid in question, comprised of numerous constituents that dictate several different elastomeric materials, would normally be the optimal selection. Furthermore {{in the case of}} duties where the fluid (typically gas) pressure is elevated, some additional considerations also become more prominent due to explosive decompression (ED) damage that can occur during rapid depressurization events in the pressurized system. Despite the effects of ED being well documented, there is still a relative lack of understanding regarding what makes a sealing device ?ED resistant? and why. This tutorial goes through the composition of flexible sealing element materials and how they compare with a more widely understood engineering material; steel. It also focuses on sizing issues and international standards and how they are applied in given applications. Thermal considerations will also be addressed and an appreciation of the methods used to test such materials will be covered. In addition to ED topics being fully addressed there will also be other issues covered such as storage and longevity, modulus, strength, hardness, <b>elongation,</b> compression <b>set,</b> and stress relaxation.

40|$|The {{study of}} fabric {{development}} and juvenile batholith emplacement across the tilted crustal {{section of the}} Eastern Dharwar craton shows that horizontal, constrictional deformation affected large volumes of the midcrust and lower crust {{at the time of}} regional partial melting and magmatic accretion. Constriction is achieved by a combination of coeval shallow and steep planar fabrics sharing a common horizontal <b>elongation</b> direction, two <b>sets</b> of conjugate strike-slip shears, and extensional shear zones. The Eastern Dharwar craton illustrates an end-member deformation mode by which a particularly weakened lithosphere responds to shortening by developing distributed, horizontal plane strain on a crustal scale, resulting from the combination of crustal shortening and lateral gravity-driven flow. Thinning accompanying constrictional deformation is interpreted as compensating for juvenile magmatic accretion and thickening of greenstone belts and as acting to maintain a stable crustal thickness. Such a midcrustal to lower crustal deformation process may provide a resolution of the batholithic room problem in a softened crust submitted to lateral shortening and may explain nearly isobaric retrograde pressure-temperaturetime paths of high temperature - low pressure high-grade terrains...|$|R

Collectively, these results suggest that the rapid, myosin-powered organelle trafficking is required for the optimal plant growth, whereas a distinct myosin function, presumably the vesicular transport, is involved in elongation of the root hairs. In addition, our data imply that the myosin gene duplication in plants has been followed by a gradual functional specialization of the resulting pairs of myosin paralogs...|$|R
40|$|Polyamines (PAs) are {{biogenic}} polycationic compounds {{implicated in}} a number of processes including plant cell division, cell <b>elongation,</b> flowering, fruit <b>set</b> and development, fruit ripening, senescence and responses to abiotic stresses. Comparatively, little is known about their role in plant-microbe interactions. To address an involvement of PAs in tomato-pathogen interactions, we developed transgenic tomato lines homozygous for the introduced yeast spermidine synthase (ySpdSyn) gene under the CaMV 35 S promoter, which accumulated higher levels of spermidine (Spd). These transgenic and wild type control lines were challenged with the fungal pathogen, Botrytis cinerea. Transgenic tomato leaves were found to be more susceptible to B. cinerea compared to the wild type. During B. cinerea-leaf interactions in the transgenic lines, a significant decrease occurred in the transcript levels of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, such as 1 -aminocyclopropane-lcarboxylate (ACC) synthase, and ethylene signaling. In the leaf from transgenic tomato lines, higher susceptibility to B. cinerea was reversed by exogenous application of ACC or difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of PA biosynthesis. The transcript levels of defense genes regulated by salicylic acid or jasmonates were similar between the Spd-transgenic leaves and the wild type. Collectively, these results demonstrate susceptibility of Spd-accumulating plants to the necrotroph B. cinerea, and suggest a role for both ethylene and PAs in B. cinerea-tomato interactions...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was part of}} a greater research initiative regarding the seismic vulnerability of precast hollowcore floor systems. The primary focus throughout the research programme has been to investigate the susceptibility to loss of vertical support of the floor system, from the seating beam. Previous research firstly focussed on identifying and understanding preconceived deficiencies with existing seating connection details. This was followed by the validation of amended, superior performing, 'new' seating connection details. However, little consideration has been given to retrofit techniques for already existing buildings, with potentially poor performing existing seating connections. A two-dimensional, single hollowcore unit, seating connection sub-assembly is used to experimentally investigate the seismic behaviour of previously un-tested existing seating connections pre- and post-retrofit. Three existing seating connection configurations, with the hollowcore unit seated directly on the bare concrete seating ledge and with varying seating lengths were tested. These tests were followed by a fourth retrofitted specimen. Both relative rotation between the hollowcore unit and seating beam, and beam elongation 'pull-off' deformations (resulting from the supporting frame deformations) were imposed on the test specimens. In conjunction with this experimental investigation and with prior knowledge from previous investigations, three primary failure mechanisms for existing hollowcore seating connections are summarised. A suite of conceptual retrofit techniques which target the critical structural weaknesses attributed to causing the primary failure mechanisms are outlined. In general, unfavourable performance was exhibited by the existing seating connections in the experimental investigation, resulting in loss of vertical support of the hollowcore unit under imposed 'pull-off' effects. In contrast, when the retrofit strategy was implemented, a higher level of seismic performance, leading to collapse prevention was achieved. A review is carried out into existing beam elongation numerical models, which are simple and involve only hand-type calculation procedures. The aim of this was to investigate potential methods for predicting the 'pull-off' effects on suspended floor systems. From this, a modification is made to an existing, loading dependent method developed by Matthews (2004). The modified method aimed to more accurately represent the loading dependant nature of beam elongation (and the resulting 'pull-off' effects) as described by Lee and Watanabe (2003). A number of beam elongation predictions for a suite of experimental beam <b>elongation</b> data <b>sets</b> were carried out with the modified method. Good agreement was generally seen, both in terms of prediction of the magnitude of elongation and the shape of the elongation profile...|$|R
40|$|Input-output {{relations}} were investigated in the slowly adapting stretch receptor organ of crayfish using a Gaussian white noise length input with a 0. 03 - 12. 5 Hz band width {{and the resulting}} action potential output. The noise input {{was presented to the}} de-efferented receptor in situ, at three mean elongations and at four different amplitudes. The three mean <b>elongations</b> were <b>set</b> within the normal range in vivo, two at the extremes close to the minimum and maximum physiological lengths and the other in the mid-range. With white noise inputs there is a finite probability that the system will be tested in all possible conditions within the chosen band width because white noise has the advantage that it contains, with a finite probability, all possible stimulus wave forms at random. The analysis indicated similarities between the effects of the input variables, namely white noise amplitude and mean elongation. With low input variables the activity was periodic. With larger inputs, impulse rates were higher and irregular. The average length trajectories leading to a spike (i. e. the average stimulus) were either biphasic with high inputs or multiphasic and periodic with lower input variables. The frequency of periodicity increased with mean elongation. Although for a given length and noise amplitude a variety of individual length trajectories preceded spikes, the final biphasic shortening-lengthening average stimulus sequence before a spike was similar in all cases irrespective of the input variables. The number of possible trajectories decreased with increments in the input variables. The standard deviation of length values for each average stimulus was computed and displayed as a function of time relative to the spike. It was first constant, and decreased gradually to a minimum value at the spike reference. Standard deviation values were lower for higher white noise amplitudes and mean elongation. Simple, short-lasting stimulus wave forms in the white noise were isolated and the corresponding responses were computed. Responses were periodic at low input variables and aperiodic with larger inputs and also asymmetric, being larger and briefer for lengthenings than for shortenings. Asymmetries augmented with input increments. Investigation of the interactions between the pace-maker and the white noise effects showed that lengthenings were more effective when they occurred just after a spike while the effectiveness of shortenings was greater just before a spike.

40|$|A highly {{elongated}} plasma {{is desirable}} {{in order to}} increase plasma pressure and energy confinement to maximize fusion power output. However, {{there is a limit to}} the maximum achievable <b>elongation</b> which is <b>set</b> by vertical instabilities driven by the n= 0 MHD mode. This limit can be increased by optimizing several parameters characterizing the plasma and the wall. The purpose of our study is to explore how and to what extent this can be done. Specifically, we extend many earlier calculations of the n= 0 mode and numerically determine scaling relations for the maximum elongation as a function of dimensionless parameters describing (1) the plasma profile (β_p and l_i), (2) the plasma shape (ϵ and δ), (3) the wall radius (b/a) and (4) most importantly the feedback system capability parameter γτ_w. These numerical calculations rely on a new formulation of n= 0 MHD theory we recently developed [Freidberg et. al. 2015; Lee et. al. 2015] that reduces the 2 -D stability problem into a 1 -D problem. This method includes all the physics of the ideal MHD axisymmetric instability while reducing the computation time significantly, so that many parameters can be explored during the optimization process. Perhaps the most useful final result is a simple analytic fit to the simulations which gives the maximum elongation and corresponding optimized triangularity as functions κ(ϵ,β_p,l_i,b/a,γτ_w) and δ(ϵ,β_p,l_i,b/a,γτ_w). The scaling relations we present include the effects of the optimal triangularity and the finite aspect ratio on the maximum elongation, and can be useful for determining optimized plasma shapes in current experiments and future tokamak designs.

40|$|Species’ {{geographical}} {{and ecological}} ranges {{are limited by}} the interaction of genotypes with the biotic and abiotic environment, {{and the quality of}} the habitat relative to the species’ niche requirements. A fundamental question in ecology and evolution is how species will respond to changes in their environment; whether species will shift their distribution to track the niche environment, locally adapt, or become extirpated. Along an ecological gradient, the factors defining a species’ limits and abundance are expected to vary. Species are defined by the interactions of genotypes with the environment, and these interactions may be constant in space with a strong genetic basis or vary plastically with the environment. This study assessed the phenotypic differences of Cakile edentula (sea rocket; Brassicaceae) plants along the beach to dune gradient within the species’ Atlantic Canadian range, and attempted to disentangle whether plants growing along this gradient plastically respond or are locally adapted to their home microenvironment (beach vs. dune) within the coastal habitat. Empirical plant surveys in wild populations, and a greenhouse and a reciprocal transplant experiment all revealed significant phenotypic differentiation between beach and dune plants. The patterns of variation for most traits observed in the wild were not reflected in the controlled environment, suggesting plasticity rather than genetically based trait variation accounts for most variation observed in the wild. However, there was evidence that some traits (stem <b>elongation</b> and seed <b>set)</b> had a genetic basis as they varied consistently between beach and dune plants in all environments. A greenhouse experiment manipulating growing density and salinity exposure provided evidence that increased growth and fitness associated with wild beach plants compared to dune plants may be attributed, at least in part, to the combined effects of plant density and sea spray. Moreover, this work supports the expectation for temporally and spatially variable environments that phenotypic variation in plants is primarily plastic, with some influence of maternal plant environment to offspring growth and fitness in the next generation. Overall, this study suggests C. edentula plants are highly plastic, and fitness variation between beach and dune plants likely indicates variation in habitat quality relative to the species’ niche...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{polymerase}} II (RNAP II) transiently {{associates with}} many different proteins and multiprotein complexes during the mRNA transcription cycle, which includes three phases, initiation, elongation, and termination. This thesis describes structural studies of two factors that facilitate transcription through chromatin. The heterodimeric Saccharomyces cerevisiae elongation factor Spt 4 -Spt 5 (human DSIF) {{has been identified}} by biochemical and genetic approaches to help RNAP II transcribe through chromatin. It is assumed that Spt 4 -Spt 5 pauses RNAP II to open a time window for capping enzyme recruitment and addition of a cap to the 5 '-end of the nascent RNA. The preparation of milligram quantities of soluble Spt 4 -Spt 5 variants that are suited for structural studies has been achieved. Several strategies to resolve {{the structure of the}} RNAP II–Spt 4 -Spt 5 complex were unsuccessful, possibly indicating an intrinsic flexibility of the complex. In addition, there is now evidence for direct links between chromatin modification and transcription elongation. A major player in this process is the histone lysine methyltransferase Set 2 which has a modular structure. The catalytic activity of Set 2 is mediated by the SET [Su(var) 3 - 9, Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax] domain. During mRNA <b>elongation,</b> the SRI (<b>Set</b> 2 Rpb 1 -interacting) domain of Set 2 binds to the phosphorylated CTD (carboxyl-terminal domain) of RNAP II. The NMR solution structure of yeast Set 2 SRI domain has been determined. The structure reveals a novel CTD-binding fold consisting of a left-handed three-helix bundle. Unexpectedly, the SRI domain fold resembles the structure of an RNA polymerase-interacting domain in sigma factors that mediate transcription initiation in bacteria (domain sigma 2 in sigma 70). NMR titration experiments show that the SRI domain binds a Ser 2 /Ser 5 -phosphorylated CTD peptide comprising two heptapeptide repeats and three flanking NH 2 -terminal residues. Amino acid residues that show strong chemical shift perturbations upon CTD binding cluster in two regions on the SRI surface.

A total of six species of Fusarium were isolated from diseased rice plants and rice seeds and identified as F. anthophilum, F. chlamydosporum, F. compactum, F. equiseti, F. fujikuroi and F. semitectum. In the translation <b>elongation</b> factor data <b>set,</b> Fusarium equiseti isolates grouped together within the F. incarnatum - equiseti Species Complex (FIESC). The isolates from rice clustered together in a single clade with the F. equiseti and F. incarnatum isolates forming two separate sub-clades. The isolates of F. equiseti present a new phylogenetically distinct species in FIESC. In the pathogenicity tests, isolates of both F. anthophilum and F. fujikuroi caused bakanae disease to rice plants. Fifty four rice cultivars and lines were tested by the standardized test tube inoculation method for resistance and susceptibility against bakanae isolate of F. anthophilum and the bakanae isolate of F. fujikuroi. None of the rice cultivars and lines was found to be resistant to bakanae isolates of Fusarium spp. The fungicide, benomyl was found to be most effective as a seed treatment for controlling bakanae disease of rice due to isolates of both F. anthophilum and F. fujikuroi. Thiram was found to be the least effective fungicide for controlling bakanae disease of rice caused by isolates of both the Fusarium spp. Apart from Fusarium species, other fungi that were also isolated from diseased rice plants and rice seeds were identified as Alternaria alternata, Alternaria longipes, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, Nigrospora sphaerica, Phoma eupyrena, Phoma jolyana, Phoma sorghina and Pithomyces sp. In mycotoxin tests, the isolates of both F. anthophilum and F. fujikuroi produced moniliformin. None of the isolates of F. anthophilum and F. fujikuroi produced fumonisins. This research is important as it identifies many fungal species in rice plants and seeds in South Africa for the first time. Currently, there is very little literature that makes reference to such findings under South African conditions. In addition, this investigation unravels previously unknown information on the resistance of rice to bakanese disease. Finally, information is provided on the effectiveness of commonly used fungicides (benomyl and thiram) to control rice diseases. This knowledge is crucial information that is useful to plant pathologists, the farming community and the scientists that are involved in strategies of fighting or reducing rice diseases so as to help contribute to food security.
