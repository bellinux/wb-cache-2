5|$|In 1957-58 Littleton took a year’s leave. A {{university}} research grant {{allowed him to}} visit Europe to study the influence of Islamic culture on contemporary Spanish pottery. He first stopped in Paris to visit Jean Sala, who had been recommended to him as an artist who worked alone in glass. Though Sala was no longer active in glass, he took Littleton to his now-idle studio. Conditioned by all of his experience at Corning, Littleton <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> of glass-making in an industrial setting, {{by a team of}} workers.|$|E
5|$|Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, {{a rapper}} and disc jockey {{living with his}} parents in Islington, London, N1. He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} {{for the first time to}} detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{grew up in}} {{the rural}} town of Wellington, 360 {{kilometres}} (225 miles) from Sydney. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> one swimming stroke—the breaststroke—and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but she preferred horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and rugby league, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a chlorinated pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange.|$|E

25|$|While some {{cultures}} {{considered the}} knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> certain things. The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death.

25|$|A daily march cycle {{might begin}} at 4:00am with a pause around noon, and {{continuation}} until dusk-6:00pm. Generally there was {{ten minutes of}} rest per hour, with one day of rest every five. Fifteen to twenty-five kilometers were covered daily depending on the terrain. Movement was in column, with point and rear elements. Armed liaison agents, who <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> their section of the Trail, led each infiltrating group between way-stations. Way-stations were located deep in the forest, and contained caches of supplies {{for use by the}} infiltrators. They were guarded by detachments of the 559th Transport Group. Sometimes the troops camped on the Trail itself between stations.|$|E
25|$|Asked {{about the}} {{more than a dozen}} {{abducted}} whites expected to be available for release, Matilda informed the Texians that she <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> about a Mrs. Webster and her two children (who, unknown to her, had just made their escape) and that the Comanche chiefs had decided to ransom them. The Texians believed this was against the conditions for the negotiations which they believed stated that all abducted whites had to be released before the council. The Comanche, of course, had a different view, since the chiefs and bands not in attendance were under no obligation to release anyone, as they had never agreed to anything.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the War of the Ring, Sauron had {{gathered}} great armies to serve him. These included Easterlings and Haradrim, who spoke a variety of tongues, and Orcs and Trolls, who usually spoke a debased form of the Common Speech. Within Barad-dûr and among the captains of Mordor (the Ringwraiths and other high-ranking servants such as the Mouth of Sauron), the Black Speech was still used, the language devised by Sauron during the Dark Years of the Second Age. In addition to ordinary Orcs and Trolls, Sauron had bred a stronger strain of Orcs, the Uruk-hai, and very large Trolls known as Olog-hai who could endure the sun. The Olog-hai <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> the Black Speech.|$|E

25|$|In 1903–1904, the Caragiales {{traveled}} through various European countries, while the dramatist again considered establishing his residence in Transylvania. They eventually moved to Berlin, the Imperial German capital, settling down in spring 1905. The choice was considered unusual, since the writer <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> some basic German expressions. This {{has led some}} commentators to speculate that the move was politically motivated. Mihail Dragomirescu believed that Caragiale was living {{at the expense of}} the German state. Cioculescu rejected this assessment, arguing that it relied on hearsay and pointing out that the chronological order provided by Dragomirescu was inaccurate. In 1992, historian Georgeta Ene proposed that Caragiale was acting as a spy for Romania in Germany.|$|E
25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the missions, the native peoples <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries established manual training in European skills and methods; in agriculture, mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions {{under the supervision of the}} padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. The foundry at Mission San Juan Capistrano was the first to introduce the Indians to the Iron Age. The blacksmith used the mission's forges (California's first) to smelt and fashion iron into everything from basic tools and hardware (such as nails) to crosses, gates, hinges, even cannon for mission defense. Iron in particular was a commodity that the mission acquired solely through trade, as the missionaries had neither the know-how nor technology to mine and process metal ores.|$|E

25|$|The artist sprayed {{his first}} piece {{together}} with Björn Warns – today wellknowed as Schiffmeister from the German Hip-Hop Group Fettes Brot – on a feeder pillar behind the yard of his parents’ house. DAIM, {{in those days}} still under his writer's name CAZA, sprayed his first, still illegal graffiti works {{during a time when}} after a few arrests in Hamburg a low-phase dominated the scene. Therefore, he <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> very few other writers at first and would absorb every trick he could pick up. Of course American influences played a role, especially because of a few trips to the US, but the artist's first book about graffiti was Graffiti Live – Die Züge gehören uns. With this the style of the artist was also very much influenced by European and German sprayers. He was fascinated by the styles of Loomit, Skena and Zebster that could be seen in an article about the fleemarket halls in Munich in the Stern-magazine. During {{the first two years of}} his career he first got to know Hesh and Loomit. Hesh became his partner for several years.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} {{missions}} was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, {{was the most important}} industry of any mission. Prior to the establishment of {{the missions}}, the native peoples <b>knew</b> <b>only</b> how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries discovered that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to the masculine, had to be taught industry in order to learn how to be self-supportive. The result was the establishment of a great manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions {{under the supervision of the}} padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. Wheat, corn, wine grapes, barley, beans, cattle, horses, and sheep were the major crops at San Diego. In 1795, construction on a system of aqueducts was begun to bring water to the fields and the Mission (the first irrigation project in Upper California). The building manager was , who was poisoned by his Indian cook Nazario before the project was completed. In his testimony, in the trial that followed, Nazario stated that he had poisoned the friar due to constant beatings inflicted by Friar Panto.|$|E
