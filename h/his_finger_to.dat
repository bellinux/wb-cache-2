5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The Little Hero of Holland is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. It is an adaptation of the short fictional story popularized in Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates, about a boy who plugs a leaking dike with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from bursting. The role of the boy was played by Marie Eline, but little else {{is known about the}} production and cast of the film. The director may have been Barry O'Neil and the writer may have been Lloyd Lonergan. Parts of the film were shot on Glen Park Island in New Rochelle, New York. The film was released on June 17, 1910 and saw a wide release, including the United Kingdom. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

Towards {{the end of the}} match, Mourinho was escorted from the touchline after putting <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> his mouth in the {{direction}} of Liverpool fans, as a response to taunts directed towards him whilst Liverpool were leading, before the equalising goal.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Beatty {{wrote to}} his wife that Churchill should either give the Admiralty his full {{attention}} or leave it alone, but his “flying about and putting <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> pies which do not concern him is bound to lead to disaster”. Churchill believed that he had “special knowledge” {{and an ability to}} improvise solutions, but others saw it as megalomania.|$|E
25|$|On {{the upper}} surface {{we have a}} {{depiction}} of the distressed Virgin Mary being supported by John the Evangelist and two female saints ("Pamoison de la Vierge"), Mary Magdalene and Mary Salome. In the next scene Jesus is being flogged by two soldiers who tighten the blindfold as they apply their whips. On the frieze below the first sculpture on the left shows Elizabeth (biblical figure) visiting the Virgin Mary (the Visitation (Christianity)), the one pregnant with Jesus Christ {{and the other with}} John the Baptist, this being followed by three scenes relating to the nativity. Firstly we see Saint Joseph sleeping in the stable with two cattle next to him. Then we see the Virgin Mary laying in a bed {{and at the end of}} this bed is a depiction of a standing Jesus aged about 7 years this followed by the Adoration of the Magi. The first wise man is kneeling before the bed whilst the second, dressed in the doublet worn in the reign of Charles VII, is pointing with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> the star which led them to the stable and addressing the third wise man who is smaller in stature.|$|E
500|$|On May 8, 1890, {{southeast}} of Tucson, Arizona Territory, Empire Ranch owner Walter Vail captured {{and thought he}} had killed a Gila monster. He tied it to his saddle and it bit the middle finger {{of his right hand}} and wouldn't let go. A ranch hand pried open the lizard's mouth with a pocketknife, cut open <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> stimulate bleeding, and then tied saddle strings around his finger and wrist. They summoned Dr. John C. Handy of Tucson, who took Vail back to Tucson for treatment, but Vail experienced swollen and bleeding [...] glands in his throat for sometime afterward.|$|E

500|$|Teddy is Mr. Bean's {{teddy bear}} and perhaps Mr. Bean's best friend. The little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs, which {{invariably}} end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotises Teddy, he snaps {{his fingers and}} the bear's head falls backwards {{as if it had}} fallen asleep instantly (Bean used <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> prop Teddy's head up). Mr. Bean behaves as if the bear is real, buying it a Christmas present or trying not to wake it in the mornings. The bear is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated ("Mr. Bean in Room 426"), used as his paint brush ("Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean"), and shrunk in the wash ("Tee Off, Mr. Bean"). Teddy is also Mr. Bean's [...] "pet" [...] in [...] "Hair by Mr. Bean of London" [...] and is used to win a pet show.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{sustaining}} {{an injury}} from a catching error, Tallon {{was selected for}} the First Test at Trent Bridge. He took four catches, including two difficult ones to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} the second innings. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, which was converted into an eight-wicket victory. The teams moved on to Lord's and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings. Tallon made 53 and helped the tail to [...] "wag" [...] and recover from a position of 7/258. Tallon did not concede a bye in England's first innings of 215 and his diving was estimated to have saved around 40runs. One of the three catches he took stood out; it came when Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as [...] "miraculous" [...] because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to take the catch. Another dive to stop a leg glance resulted in a severely bruised left little finger. However, Tallon also conceded 16 byes in England's total of 186. Australia won the Test, and Tallon was rested ahead of the next Test to allow <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> recover.|$|E
2500|$|The third ODI was {{marred by}} umpiring {{controversy}} and disruption from the crowd. During India's innings, Ajay Jadeja was given out, after being caught behind. The umpire initially raised <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> dismiss the batsman, but then changed his mind, and continued raising <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> adjust his hat. He then turned down the appeal, and Jadeja continued to bat. Elmo Rodrigopulle, writing for Cricinfo, reported that [...] "it was a mockery on the umpiring fraternity and what umpiring stands for." [...] Later, in Sri Lanka's reply, when they were 205 for four, needing just 29 more runs for victory, the game was held up because spectators threw bottles onto the field. After a ten-minute delay, the match resumed, and Sri Lanka won by five wickets.|$|E
5000|$|The Doctor {{then goes}} back to the TARDIS and snaps <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> see if what River had said earlier - that she'd seen a future Doctor [...] "swagger back to his TARDIS and open the doors with a snap of his fingers" [...] - would really work. The TARDIS opens with Donna waiting inside. He snaps <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> close it as we see River in the Earth {{simulation}} reading her diary to her children.|$|R

2500|$|Oliver Brett of BBC Sport was {{sympathetic}} {{towards the}} Indians. Brett claimed that Ponting's word {{should not have}} been taken as fact by Procter as Ponting had claimed a catch that was [...] "obviously grassed" [...] and had raised <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> Benson to indicate certainty that a dubious catch had been taken.|$|E

2500|$|When {{photographic}} curator Maya Benton {{began to}} catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the International Center of Photography, she noticed that, {{in his book}} A Vanished World, Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were {{not supported by the}} material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the opposite page a small boy points with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> his eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: [...] "The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935-1938." [...] At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: [...] "The pogromshchiki" [...] (pogrom lynch mob) [...] "are coming. But the iron door was no protection." [...] Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book [...] "almost certainly did not happen".|$|E

2500|$|Mr. America's last WWE {{appearance}} {{was on the}} June 26 episode of SmackDown! when Big Show and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) defeated Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match. After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> his lips telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret. The next week, Hogan quit WWE due to frustration with the creative team. On the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon showed the footage of Mr. America unmasking as Hogan and [...] "fired" [...] him, although Hogan had already quit in real life. The Mr. America charactercame under fire briefly from Marvel Comics, who anointed it a rip-off of Captain America, citing costume similarity. It was later revealed that Hogan was unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick. McMahon decided to terminate Hogan's contract and Hogan left WWE in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} title win, {{commentator}} Gorilla Monsoon proclaimed: [...] "Hulkamania is here!". Hogan frequently {{referred to his}} fans as [...] "Hulkamaniacs" [...] in his interviews and introduced his three [...] "demandments": training, saying prayers, and eating vitamins. Eventually, a fourth demandment (believing in oneself) was added during his feud with Earthquake in 1990. Hogan's ring gear developed a characteristic yellow-and-red color scheme; his ring entrances involved him ritualistically ripping his shirt off his body, flexing, and listening for audience cheers in an exaggerated manner. The majority of Hogan's matches during this time involved him wrestling heels who had been booked as unstoppable monsters, using a format which became near-routine: Hogan would deliver steady offense, but eventually lose momentum, seemingly nearing defeat. After being hit with his opponent's finishing move, he would then experience a sudden second wind, fighting back while [...] "feeding" [...] off {{the energy of the}} audience, becoming impervious to attack a process described as [...] "Hulking up". His signature maneuvers pointing at the opponent (which would later be accompanied by a loud [...] "you!" [...] from the audience), shaking <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> scold him, three punches, an Irish whip, the big boot and running leg drop – would follow and ensure him a victory. That finishing sequence would occasionally change depending on the storyline and opponent; for instance, with [...] "giant" [...] wrestlers, the sequence might involve a body slam.|$|E
