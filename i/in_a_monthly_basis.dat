This study {{was developed to}} verify the potential of seed rain to regenerate forest fragments of a Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) in the Apa River Basin which {{is located in the}} southwestern portion of the Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. To develop the study, we installed 25 collectors measuring 1 m 2 each, which were systematically distributed on an area of 1. 5 ha. Seed gathering was conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>basis</b> throughout the year of 2013. A total of 26. 411 propagules were identified and distributed among 50 species, 45 genera and 32 families.

The value for the Shannon Diversity Index was (H') = 1. 67 and the Pielou Evenness index was (J) = 0. 42.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ichthyofauna structure in the region of the north outfall of the Bertioga Channel (São Paulo, Brazil) and the possible effects of the environmental quality loss. The samples were collected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>basis,</b> from September to December 2005, at two oceanographic stations with an otter-trawl. The fish fauna structure was evaluated by ecological indicators and the environmental quality evaluated by the ABC analysis and the Estuarine Fish Communities Index (EFCI). A total of 1553 individuals from 50 species were sampled. Ariidae and Sciaenidae amounted to 60 % and Cathorops spixii represented 36 % of all specimens collected. The highest richness and ecological diversity were recorded in December, while the highest numerical abundance was found in October. The majority of the species were represented by juveniles. The cluster analysis and canonical correspondence analysis showed a consistent and clear difference between the sampling stations, and the abiotic factors analyzed (temperature, depth and salinity) do not seem to have influence on the community structure. The ABC analysis suggested a moderate disturbed environment and the EFCI allowed classifying the area as "poor", due to the 12 metrics analyzed, concerning the reduction of the species diversity, composition and abundance, and modifications in the nursery function and trophic integrity of the area. Future studies should focus on jointly analyze chemical indicators of water and sediment with the biological indicators, to confirm the ichthyofaunal condition of the north outfall of the Bertioga Channel...|$|E

With the aim to generate preliminary information on reproductive aspects, the present study analyzes its fecundity, based on the estimated number of vitellogenic oocytes in the gonad; in addition, we evaluated its relationship with the jellyfish body length, diameter and wet weight; and we established the relationship of the gonadosomatic index (IGS) with the jellyfish diameter and length. For this, a total of 30 specimens were collected, measured and weighed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>basis,</b> in Las Guásimas lagoon from January to May 2006. In order to estimate the gonad volume, 60 mature females were analyzed and their gonads were extracted and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Gonad images from histological preparations were analyzed and the number of vitellogenic and previtellogenic oocytes obtained. We used catch data from The Guásimas for population recruitment analysis, that was estimated with FISAT II. Among results, we found that fecundity increased with jellyfish length, diameter and total wet weight. The lower fecundity rates occured on February and the highest during May (11 873 071 and 37 528 197 millions of vitellogenic oocytes per gonad, respectively). The IGS increased with length and diameter of the specimens, at its maximum value of 3. 7 % was observed in May. A continuous production of previtellogenic oocytes were observed during the full Collection period. The maximum recruitment was observed in July and November (37. 50 % and 28. 01 % respectively). The high fecundity observed in S. meleagris, suggests a high population reproductive potential that may support the possibility of an important fishery consolidation on this jellyfish...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Yucatan {{coastline}} {{has been}} experiencing beach erosion {{during the past}} few decades, reaching critical levels at some locations such as in Chelem beach located near the Progreso Pier. Despite this problem, only few studies have been devoted to investigate the role of coastal structures on explaining the high erosion rates. Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate the effects of the 6 -km long Progreso Pier on the nearshore wave transformation and alongshore sediment transport in the study area. Field surveys were conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>basis</b> to measure the changes in the beach profiles. Furthermore, wave conditions were determined with an ADCP installed at 8 m water depth. Observations confirmed the high erosion trends(1 m/year) that have produced coastal infrastructure damage and property loss along 10 km of coast. The wave measurements were employed as forcing on a third generation wave transformation model (MIKE 21 SW). Firstly, the numerical model is implemented in the study area for two different scenarios, with and without the Progreso Pier structure, in order to estimate the nearshore wave conditions. Subsequently, wave conditions predicted at 5 m water depth were employed for the estimation of longshore sediment transport in the study area. The modeling results showed that the pier acts as a large scale wave-sheltering structure that induces important longshore sediment transport gradients during mean wave conditions coming from the NE. On the other hand, during winter storms, when the dominant direction of the waves is from the NNW, the structure does not seem {{to play an important role}} on wave transformation into the study area. As a result, the Progreso Pier enhances beach erosion in the Chelem area by inducing longshore sediment transport gradients during mean wave climate and decreasing the capacity of waves to recover the summer beach profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of trace element concentration in aerosols {{is of interest}} for environmental studies and for human health assessment. The temporal variability of total suspended particles (TSP) and its elemental composition in Seville, in SW Spain, is of particular complexity since Atlantic air masses and Saharan Dust Intrusions (SDI) overlap to local natural and anthropogenic sources. This paper is aimed to study the temporal evolution (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>basis)</b> of the concentrations of 25 trace elements, determined by ICP-MS, in high-volume air filter samples from Seville, covering a two-year period: 2001 - 2002. The mean TSP value for this period was 79. 7 μgm- 3 and showed peak values in August 2001 and June 2002, likely related to SDI. Enrichment factors (EF) for Se, Sb and Zn and Pb were above 100, which revealed their anthropogenic sources. The comparison among EF from Seville and Huelva, a highly industrialized city nearby Seville, showed higher levels of anthropogenic elements there than in Seville. Simulations of the transport/dispersion of pollutants starting in Huelva confirm that air pollutants can reach Seville {{in the course of}} around 6 hours although they do not contribute significantly to the levels found in this city. A significant temporal correlation was found between elements which have a common source, being crustal (Al, Ti, Be, Co, Cs, Fe, Cr, Mn, U, Sr and Th) or anthropogenic sources (Zn, Pb, Cd). The temporal variations of those crustal elements are similar and related with the TSP levels for both years, with the clearly visible peaks probably related with the Saharan dust intrusion.
