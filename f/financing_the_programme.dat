40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that poor economic integration and isolation from regional and international markets have contributed significantly to poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. Poor transport infrastructure and border restrictions are major deterrents to trade expansion which would stimulate economic growth and poverty reduction. Using spatial network analysis techniques and gravity trade model estimations, this paper quantifies the economics of upgrading a primary road network that connects the major urban areas in the region. The results indicate that continental network upgrading is worth serious consideration from an economic perspective. Our simulations suggest that overland trade among Sub-Saharan African countries might expand by about $ 250 billion over 15 years, with major direct and indirect benefits for the rural poor. <b>Financing</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> would require about $ 20 billion for initial upgrading and $ 1 billion annually for maintenance.

40|$|More than 4000 ponds {{have been}} created or {{restored}} in Denmark since 1985 {{as part of a}} large-scale pond-digging programme to protect endangered amphibians in particular and pond flora and fauna in general. Most ponds are created on private land with public <b>financing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>programme</b> was triggered by, among other factors, a drastic decline in amphibian populations in Denmark between 1940 and 1980. However, in recent years there has been an increased awareness in Denmark that temporary ponds are important for the conservation {{of some of the most}} rare amphibian species, such as fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina, natterjack toad Bufo calamita and green toad Bufo viridis. Other rare species such as moor frog Rana arvalis and European tree frog Hyla arborea also benefit from temporary ponds. The last 15 years of work on the conservation of endangered species and their habitats has resulted in a last-minute rescue and a subsequent growth in the size of most Danish populations of fire-bellied toad and green toad; some populations of the relatively more common natterjack toad have also increased. The creation of temporary ponds plays an important role in the success of these three species. The creation of ponds to help restore viable populations of the most rare amphibians has not been easy. To study the conditions that may need to be created, Danish herpetologists searched for areas with temporary ponds that had good water quality, natural hydrological conditions and a management regime influenced by traditional agricultural methods. The paper gives an overview of pond creation and restoration projects in Denmark and Poland and their significance for amphibian diversity...|$|E

40|$|This thesis modifies {{the basic}} neoclassical DSGE model of Kiyotaki and Moore (2012) by {{introducing}} a government which levies distortionary taxes on wages and dividends, consumes general output, issues money, and holds privately-issued equity. The thesis answers two questions - Can discretionary policy relieve {{the effects of}} liquidity constraints that limit investment, and thereby stimulate economic activity in normal times? Can discretionary policy ameliorate the effects of an exogenous liquidity shock? Including distortionary taxes is a unique modification within a branch of literature that extends the work of KM and studies liquidity shocks. The thesis belongs to a branch of this literature which modifies KM's basic model, {{but none of these}} papers have distortionary taxes and none examine fiscal policy. The thesis extends the literature with a novel variant of the basic KM model and with a novel set of policies against a liquidity shock. The results are as follows. Firstly, if money supply is constant and government spending varies to always balance the fiscal budget, then across-the-board tax cuts persistently stimulate the economy and a cut in the rate of tax on dividends ameliorates a liquidity shock without additional distortions. These responses are robust to the model's calibration. Secondly, an increase in government spending, financed by more taxes or selling equity holdings, persistently worsens economic activity and exacerbates a liquidity shock; financing the policies is what brings adverse results. Thirdly, the direct effects of a government equity purchase programme are short-lived - investment rises and new equity is added to the market which partially offsets the government's purchase. <b>Financing</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> with spending cuts do less harm than raising taxes. Adding monetary expansion to the policy mix improves aggregate supply but reduces aggregate demand. When used against a liquidity shock, the programme makes a positive but short-lived difference...|$|E

Similarly, analysis of the effectiveness of the GMI in terms of poverty reduction shows that it has a small but positive impact on the poverty rate.

40|$|Abstract Background Targeted outreach, counselling, and {{treatment}} of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{are among the most}} cost-effective interventions aimed at ameliorating the burden of HIV/STIs. Since many new HIV infections occur in people under the age of 25, youth, and especially most at risk adolescents (MARA), {{need to be able to}} access HIV/STI services. Starting in 2006, a programme targeting MARA including outreach, confidential and voluntary counselling and testing, and STI diagnosis {{and treatment}} was piloted in three cities in Tajikistan. This study uses data from these pilot sites to estimate the costs of a national programme. Methods Cost data were collected from the three pilot sites. Then, the target population and the number of patients receiving specific types of services are calculated for other areas. The unit costs from the pilot sites are multiplied by usage rates to determine the total costs of a national programme. Scenarios were developed to reflect data uncertainty. The government's ability to <b>finance</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> was estimated using Ministry of Health budget data. Further analyses were done for one of the pilot cities where more detailed data were available. Results In total, costs were projected for eight programme sites, covering an estimated 8, 020 MARA. Operational and variable cost for <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> are projected to be US$ 119, 159 (range US$ 104, 953 to 151, 524) per year. Including annual equivalent cost for capital and start-up items raises this to US$ 137, 082 (range: US$ 123, 022 to 169, 597) per year. The analyses of potential sources of <b>financing</b> for <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> remain inconclusive, but it may take multiple sources of <b>financing</b> to fund <b>the</b> <b>programme.</b> Conclusion While <b>the</b> cost-effectiveness of similar programmes have been previously assessed using modelled data, more work needs to be done to assess the costs of new programmes in relation to financial resources available. Full costing should consider cost-savings as well as expenditures. If feasible, the impact of <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> should be monitored over time. </p...|$|R

It combines a ‘passive’ component granting monetary benefits to employees dismissed by firms larger than 15 employees, and an ‘active’ component providing an employment subsidy to any firm hiring {{workers from the}} Mobility Lists. Eligibility duration varies with the worker’s age at dismissal. Paggiaro et al.

25|$|Following the {{previous}} bike-sharing systems, {{the first next}} generation bike-sharing system, was introduced in 1991 in Farsø. Even {{though it was a}} small-scale scheme, it paved the way for <b>the</b> Copenhagen's ByCyklen <b>programme,</b> which was introduced in 1995 and was the first large-scale urban bike-sharing programme to feature specially designed bicycles with parts which could not be used on other bikes. To obtain a bicycle, riders paid a refundable deposit at one of 110 special locking bike stands, and the riders then had unlimited use of the bike within a specified 'city bike zone'. The fine for not returning a bicycle or leaving the bike-sharing zone exceeded US$150, and was strictly enforced by the police. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>programme's</b> founders hoped to completely <b>finance</b> <b>the</b> <b>programme</b> by selling advertising space on the bicycles, which was placed on the bike's frame and its solid disc-type wheels.
