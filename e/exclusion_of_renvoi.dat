Where the tort occurred abroad, {{the choice of}} law rule will require Australian courts to apply foreign law. The High Court did not specifically address whether a reference to foreign law means a reference to its internal law or to its choice of law rules - a problem which is addressed in private international law by the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>renvoi.</b> This problem arose directly in Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Australia) v Neilson. This note explains and critically evaluates the decision of the Full Court of Western Australia in this case.

Since 11 January 2009, Regulation (EC) 864/2007 (the Rome II Regulation) {{on the law}} {{applicable}} to non-contractual obligations has been in force, controlling in a uniform way the rules throughout the European Union. Article 24 of this regulation provides: [...] "The application {{of the law of}} any country specified by this Regulation means the application of the rules of law in force in that country other than its rules of private international law."

(International Commercial Law) Abstract: The Commonwealth of Nations is a {{voluntary}} association {{that consists of}} 53 independent and sovereign states, {{most of which are}} former British colonies or dependencies of these colonies. 1 South Africa and Australia are two examples of such commonwealth countries, South Africa having its law rooted in Roman-Dutch law, English common law and customary law, as well as Australia, whose laws are also greatly influenced by the English legal system. 2 Brazil, on the other hand, {{is an example of a}} civil law system. This paper seeks to offer an analytical comparison on the different approaches that these common law and civil law countries follow when faced with the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>renvoi,</b> a doctrine, as will be discussed below, that applies when a court is faced with a conflict of law and must consider the law of another state. 3 The essay will journey into the different stances that South Africa, Australia and Brazil take when confronted with the doctrine. Australia, as a common law jurisdiction, accepts renvoi, this position will be made clear. Brazil is a civil law jurisdiction with an equally clear stance to renvoi, it does not accept the doctrine. South Africa, as a mixed jurisdiction, lacks authority on renvoi and consequently has an unclear stance to the doctrine. Since both South Africa and Australia are influenced by English common law, a discussion of English case law may be necessary to illustrate the different renvoi approaches, and, in turn, may provide guidance for future application <b>of</b> <b>renvoi</b> by South African and Australian courts [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Most U.S. states frown upon renvoi in {{a choice}} of law situation. In this example, they would insist that the only law the courts of State X should look at is the law of {{contracts}} of State Y, not the [...] "whole law" [...] of State Y, which includes that state's law governing choice of law. The basic criticism <b>of</b> <b>renvoi</b> {{is that it can}} lead to an endless circle. In the above example, {{it could be argued that}} if the law of State Y points back to State X, then the law of State X would only once again require application of the law of State Y, and so forth and so on without end.|$|R
5000|$|In {{conflict}} <b>of</b> laws, <b>renvoi</b> (from the French, meaning [...] "send back" [...] or [...] "to return unopened") is {{a subset}} of the choice of law rules and it may be applied whenever a forum court is directed to consider the law of another state.|$|R
50|$|To {{limit the}} damage that would result from forum shopping, it is {{desirable}} that the same law be applied {{to achieve the same}} result no matter where the case is litigated. The system <b>of</b> <b>renvoi</b> is an attempt to achieve that end. If a forum court is directed to consult a foreign law, the first question it must address is whether this is a reference solely to the relevant substantive provisions, or to the state's system of law as a whole which would include its choice of law rules. Forums that do not have renvoi provisions refer only to the specific provisions of relevant law. In this way, the same outcome is achieved no matter where the case is litigated so long as the second state would also have applied its own laws.|$|R

40|$|Ethnophaulisms (A. A. Roback, 1944) are {{the words}} used as ethnic slurs to refer to out-groups in hate speech. The results of {{previous}} archival research have suggested {{that it is the}} complexity, more so than the valence, of ethnophaulisms that predicts the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> ethnic immigrant out-groups from the receiving society. This article reports the results of 3 experimental examinations of the relative contributions of complexity and valence in ethnophaulisms to the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> an ethnic out-group. Experiment 1 demonstrated that <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> the ethnic out-group was increased by the use of low-complexity ethnophaulisms. Experiment 2 demonstrated that <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> the ethnic out-group decreased by the use of high-complexity ethnophaulisms. Experiment 3 confirmed the demonstration that exclusion decreased by the use of a different set of high-complexity ethnophaulisms. The results of these three experiments converge to indicate that low complexity exerts more of an effect than negative valences on the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> an ethnic out-group.
