Folding may sometimes occur along the flexion lines. Though fold lines may be transverse, as in the hindwings of beetles and earwigs, they are normally radial {{to the base of}} the wing, allowing adjacent sections of a wing to be folded over or under each other. The commonest <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> is the jugal fold, situated just behind the third anal vein, although, most Neoptera have a jugal fold just behind vein 3A on the forewings. It is sometimes also present on the hindwings. Where the anal area of the hindwing is large, as in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the whole of this part may be folded under the anterior part of the wing along a vannal fold a little posterior to the claval furrow. In addition, in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the anal area is folded like a fan along the veins, the anal veins being convex, at the crests of the folds, and the accessory veins concave. Whereas the claval furrow and jugal fold are probably homologous in different species, the vannal fold varies in position in different taxa. Folding is produced by a muscle arising on the pleuron and inserted into the third axillary sclerite in such a way that, when it contracts, the sclerite pivots about its points of articulation with the posterior notal process and the second axillary sclerite.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{processing}} {{characteristics and}} difficulties of drum with <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> grooves are analyzed. Three kinds of CNC machining methods, namely three-axis linkage, single-axis servo and two-axis servo, are introduced. With CNC machining methods of single-axis servo and two-axis servo, the spindle motor of machine tool needs not to transform. A CNC system is developed which acquires the absolute {{position on the}} circle of drum through the spindle encoder and spindle zero position switch. It allows simultaneous servo position and velocity control of Z-axis AC servo motor or both Z-axis and X-axis AC servo motors. With the changes of angular displacement of spindle, the system manages the interpolation motion of X-axis and Z axis, so drums with <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> grooves {{can be achieved by}} this way. Both of these methods have been applied to transformation of machine tool with simple, economical and reliable operation. This paper also proposes three methods to improve the processing efficiency of the drum: increasing a function of return to zero rapidly, processing with more tools at the same time, processing external steel sleeve with <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> grooves and then installing it on a smooth drum...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with stability behaviour and imperfection sensitivity of thin elastic shells. The aim {{is to determine the}} reduction of the critical buckling load {{as a function of the}} imperfection amplitude. For this purpose, the direct calculation of the so-called <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> connecting all the limit points of the equilibrium branches when the imperfection varies is performed. This <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> is the solution of an extended system demanding the criticality of the equilibrium. The Asymptotic Numerical Method is used as an alternative to Newton-like incremental-iterative procedures for solving this extended system. It results in a very robust and efficient path-following algorithm that takes the singularity of the tangent stiffness matrix into account. Two specific types of imperfections are detailed and several numerical examples are discussed...|$|E
