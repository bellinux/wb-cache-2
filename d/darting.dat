5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, <b>darting</b> from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E

Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from Bien Hoa Air Base in pursuit of the two rebel planes. Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with 50-calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke-filled streets as a precaution.|$|E

In 2015 the Singapore <b>Darts</b> Masters was deleted but the Japan <b>Darts</b> Masters and Auckland <b>Darts</b> Masters were added. Also in 2015 ended the series with the World Series of <b>Darts</b> Finals. In 2016, the PDC deleted the Japan <b>Darts</b> Masters but added the Shangai <b>Darts</b> Masters and the Tokyo <b>Darts</b> Masters. In 2017, the Tokyo <b>Darts</b> Masters was deleted and the U.S. <b>Darts</b> Masters added. The Sydney <b>Darts</b> Masters was {{replaced}} by the Melbourne <b>Darts</b> Masters.

5|$|The Kalam {{people of}} New Guinea {{highlands}} called it konmayd, and deemed {{it a good}} bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, {{then there would be}} good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is <b>darting</b> and calling around them. It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female <b>darting</b> over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) <b>darting</b> through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach to tend to his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent.

5000|$|In Handly Cup Style Lawn <b>Darts,</b> {{scores are}} based on <b>darts</b> in the ring plus <b>darts</b> closer to the ring {{than any of the}} {{opposing}} team's <b>darts.</b> <b>Darts</b> landing inside the ring, or [...] "ringers", are worth 3 points each, and can be cancelled by an opponent also throwing a <b>dart</b> into the ring. Additionally, any <b>dart</b> that is closer to the ring (but outside) than any other <b>dart</b> by the opposing team is worth one point. This means that if neither team managed to place a <b>dart</b> into the ring, but Team A had two <b>darts</b> closer than any of Team B's <b>darts,</b> Team A would score 2 points. If Team A had one <b>dart</b> in the ring, and one <b>dart</b> closer than any of Team B's <b>darts,</b> they would score 4 points. If both teams have <b>darts</b> in the ring it is impossible for a <b>dart</b> outside the ring to score any points (as it is farther from the ring than the opposing team's <b>dart</b> that is inside). If Team A and Team B each had a <b>dart</b> inside the ring, and Team A also had a <b>dart</b> outside the ring but closer to the ring than Team B's other <b>dart,</b> neither team would score any points for that round. Handly Cup Style matches typically are played in teams of two, with the pairs alternating, until one team's total score is 21 or more. In addition, for a point to count the <b>dart</b> must stick into the ground.|$|R

25|$|Species of {{the order}} Hymenoptera {{typically}} {{communicate with each other}} through behaviors or chemical excretions. In the European hornet, a typical alarm dance is performed outside of the nest and consists of consistent buzzing, <b>darting</b> {{in and out of the}} nest, and attacking or approaching the target of the alarm pheremone. V. crabro has internal venomous sacs, some of which contain pheromones that are secreted in response to alarm. Experiments determined that 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol is the main component which causes V. crabro to express this defensive behavior. Other pentenols and pentanols are contained within these venomous sacs, but their primary purpose is not to warn fellow hornets that there is danger nearby, because these chemicals did not induce any alarm behavior.|$|E

Jenkins wrote that Macleod had “a <b>darting</b> crossword-puzzle mind fortified by a phenomenal memory” adding that “I am not convinced that he was a particularly nice man, but he had insight and insolence”. Jenkins likens him to Benjamin Disraeli or to George Canning, who by attracting the admiration of a clique of younger men left a legend out of all proportion to their actual achievements.|$|E

25|$|The score has a slow {{opening and}} {{immediately}} provides a romantic sense of mystery. However, the music then launches into a quicker tempo, brass fanfares propelling the music {{along with a}} rhythmically incisive motif. An andante section for strings follows using a straightforward lilting rhythm. The simplicity of this section is a marked contrast to the next, marked vivace where the {{different parts of the}} orchestra compete with each other with an underlying consistent rhythmic drive. The following section is also manufactured of contrasts with lyrical strings followed by a solo clarinet and sparse accompaniment. High strings, harp (for the watery effect) and occasional percussion provide another contrasting orchestral sound, before the composer again re-assembles his palette of orchestral colours, using solo instruments in small groups, or alone, or high violins in long notes soaring above moving fragments of ideas below. The finale of Act 1 has an uneven rhythm with sudden accents <b>darting</b> about in Stravinskian fashion, the music being punctuated here and there by astringent wind chords.|$|E
25|$|The Kelb tal-Fenek {{is usually}} taken out to hunt {{at night when}} there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the {{countryside}} and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from <b>darting</b> {{too far to the}} sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom will come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret—"nemes"—may have its roots in the Greek word ''.|$|E
