25|$|Solvent casting and {{particulate}} leaching (SCPL) {{allows for}} the preparation of structures with regular porosity, but with limited thickness. First, the polymer is dissolved into a suitable organic solvent (e.g. polylactic acid could be dissolved into dichloromethane), then the solution is cast into a mold filled with porogen particles. Such porogen can be an <b>inorganic</b> <b>salt</b> like sodium chloride, crystals of saccharose, gelatin spheres or paraffin spheres. The size of the porogen particles will affect {{the size of the}} scaffold pores, while the polymer to porogen ratio is directly correlated to the amount of porosity of the final structure. After the polymer solution has been cast the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate, then the composite structure in the mold is immersed in a bath of a liquid suitable for dissolving the porogen: water in the case of sodium chloride, saccharose and gelatin or an aliphatic solvent like hexane for use with paraffin. Once the porogen has been fully dissolved, a porous structure is obtained. Other than the small thickness range that can be obtained, another drawback of SCPL lies in its use of organic solvents which must be fully removed to avoid any possible damage to the cells seeded on the scaffold.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} factors {{affecting}} surface tension, {{one of which}} is that the composition of the surface may be different from the bulk. For example, if water is mixed with a tiny amount of surfactants (for example, hand soap), the bulk water may be 99% water molecules and 1% soap molecules, but the topmost surface of the water may be 50% water molecules and 50% soap molecules. In this case, the soap has a large and positive [...] "surface excess". In other examples, the surface excess may be negative: For example, if water is mixed with an <b>inorganic</b> <b>salt</b> like sodium chloride, {{the surface of the water}} is on average less salty and more pure than the bulk average.|$|E

2500|$|DESI can be {{coupled to}} {{ultra-fast}} liquid chromatography using an LC eluent splitting strategy. It {{is a strategy}} through a tiny orifice on an LC capillary tube. There is negligible dead volume and back pressure that allows for almost real time mass spectrometry detection with a fast elution and purification. This coupling {{can be used to}} ionize a wide range of molecules, from small organics to high mass proteins. This is different from ESI (electrospray ionization) in that {{it can be used to}} directly analyze salt-containing sample solutions without requiring [...] “make-up” solvents/ acids to be doped into the sample. This set up allows for a high flow rate without splitting. The high resolution that is accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC can be combined with this procedure to produce high throughput screening of natural products as well. The incorporation of the electrochemistry component helps with ionization efficiency via the electrochemical conversion. This method is proved better than ESI in the fact that you don't have to separate the small potential that is applied to the cell from the potential on the spray in DESI. DESI also shows a better tolerance to <b>inorganic</b> <b>salt</b> electrolytes and you can use traditional solvents used in electrolysis.|$|E

40|$|Particles {{containing}} secondary {{organic material}} (SOM) are ubiquitous {{in the atmosphere}} and {{play a role in}} climate and air quality. Recently, research has shown that liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) occurs at high relative humidity (RH) (greater than [*]∼[*]  95  %) in α -pinene-derived SOM particles free of <b>inorganic</b> <b>salts,</b> while LLPS does not occur in isoprene-derived SOM particles free of <b>inorganic</b> <b>salts.</b> We expand on these findings by investigating LLPS at 290  ±  1  K in SOM particles free of <b>inorganic</b> <b>salts</b> produced from ozonolysis of β -caryophyllene, ozonolysis of limonene, and photo-oxidation of toluene. LLPS was observed at greater than [*]∼[*]  95  % RH in the biogenic SOM particles derived from β -caryophyllene and limonene while LLPS was not observed in the anthropogenic SOM particles derived from toluene. This work combined with the earlier work on LLPS in SOM particles free of <b>inorganic</b> <b>salts</b> suggests that the occurrence of LLPS in SOM particles free of <b>inorganic</b> <b>salts</b> is related to the oxygen-to-carbon elemental ratio (O : C) of the organic material. These results help explain the difference between the hygroscopic parameter κ of SOM particles measured above and below water saturation in the laboratory and field, and have implications for predicting the cloud condensation nucleation properties of SOM particles...|$|R
