40|$|<b>Decades</b> <b>of</b> <b>brain</b> <b>research</b> have {{identified}} various parallel loops linking the hippocampus with neocortical areas, enabling {{the acquisition of}} spatial and episodic memories. Especially the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit (entorhinal cortex layer II  dentate gyrus (DG)  cornu ammonis (CA) - 3  CA 1) was studied in great detail because of its seemingly simple connectivity and characteristic structures that are experimentally well accessible. While numerous researchers focused on functional aspects, obtained from {{a limited number of}} cells in distinct hippocampal subregions, {{little is known about the}} neuronal network dynamics which drive information across multiple synapses for subsequent long-term storage. Fast voltage-sensitive dye imaging in vitro allows real-time recording of activity patterns in large/meso-scale neuronal networks with high spatial resolution. In this way, we recently found that entorhinal theta-frequency input to the DG most effectively passes filter mechanisms of the trisynaptic circuit network, generating activity waves which propagate across the entire DG-CA axis. These trisynaptic circuit waves involve high-frequency firing of CA 3 pyramidal neurons, leading to a rapid induction of classical NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA 3 -CA 1 synapses (CA 1 LTP). CA 1 LTP has been substantially evidenced to be essential for some forms of explicit learning in mammals. Here, we review data with particular reference to whole network-level approaches, illustrating how activity propagation can take place within the trisynaptic circuit to drive formation of CA 1 LTP...|$|R

50|$|Responding to the Presidential mandate, {{professional}} organizations began {{to support the}} effort via further promulgation <b>of</b> <b>Decade</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Brain</b> materials, and <b>Decade</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Brain</b> lectures became commonplace at annual meetings of prominent scientific communities.

David J. Mahoney, at the time the Chairman of the Charles A. Dana Foundation for <b>brain</b> <b>research,</b> arranged a gathering of influential neuroscientists in Cold Spring Harbor in 1992 to discuss ways to improve the <b>Decade</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Brain</b> movement.

The Dana Foundation also sponsored the publication of newspapers, newsletters, journals, and other outlets to convey neuroscience research, alongside $34 million in <b>research</b> grants for <b>brain</b> <b>research,</b> and the founding <b>of</b> <b>Brain</b> Awareness Week, a global campaign to promote public interest in neuroscience.|$|R
