5|$|Manchester City's {{third round}} tie {{was against the}} amateur club Corinthians at Crystal Palace. The third round was the furthest Corinithians had ever progressed, though until 1923 the club never entered the cup due to club rules {{preventing}} them from entering any competition with a prize. Manchester City went behind and only equalised three minutes from time. The Corinthians goalkeeper, Benjamin Howard Baker collided with a teammate, causing him to take more than <b>four</b> <b>steps</b> with the ball. From the resulting free kick, Frank Roberts scored in a goalmouth melee to take the tie to a replay, held the following Wednesday. The rematch proved less even. Manchester City won 4–0 courtesy of goals by Austin (twice), Hicks and Johnson. After his goal, Hicks {{had to leave the}} field as he had sustained an injury while performing a celebratory somersault. In the fourth round, City faced league champions Huddersfield Town and again won 4–0. The crowd of 74,799 was by far the highest of the round, and only 1,200 short of the club record.|$|E
5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows <b>four</b> <b>steps.</b> First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

The application of this modeling approach is near universal as in large measure are its criticisms. While the approach has been moderately successful in the aggregate it has failed to perform in most relevant policy tests on both the demand and supply sides. This paper begins with an overview of the <b>four</b> <b>step</b> model (4 SM) in the broader context of transportation systems analysis. This discussion is followed by problem and study area definitions, model applications and data requirements. Finally, the most commonly used models in the <b>four</b> <b>step</b> process are illustrated through a sample application. I argue that the widespread use of the 4 SM is not due to its analytical superiority but simply because it is the only approach available given current institutional requirements and financial limitations...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{alternative}} methodologies for travel demand modeling has become important {{in recent years}} {{due to the lack}} of resources for small and medium communities to adopt conventional <b>four</b> <b>step</b> travel models. Many researchers have proposed alternative tools of travel demand modeling for these communities. But majority of them still require large amount of data and technical sophistication. In this study, the Path Flow Estimator (PFE) is used to estimate the network traffic of Cache County. PFE estimations are based on the collected traffic counts, vehicle production and attractions of zones estimated using Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip generation rates. The daily trips of the <b>four</b> <b>step</b> model are converted into peak hour trips using a common peak hour factor. The PFE estimations are then compared with the estimations of the four-step model. The differences in vehicle trip production and attraction estimates by both models are due to the use of a common peak hour factor to reduce the daily trips of the <b>four</b> <b>step</b> model to peak hour trips. These differences got dis-aggregated spatially in the trip table estimations, leading to similar trip table estimations. The trip length frequency distributions of both models accounting for congestion have similar distribution. The average trip length estimated by PFE is 2. 36 minutes more than the four-step model. Further, PFE has estimated link flows better than the <b>four</b> <b>step</b> model on the links having ground counts due the traffic counts constraint in PFE 2 ̆ 7 s formulation. Low percentage root mean square errors between PFE and the <b>four</b> <b>step</b> model estimated link flows show that PFE has replicated the link flows satisfactorily. The four-step model has overestimated the link flows on Main Street due to the use of daily trips V-C ratio in the zones with high demand due to the slight overestimation of trips by ITE trip generation rates for those zones. On the screenlines identified in the original <b>four</b> <b>step</b> model also PFE has performed better than the <b>four</b> <b>step</b> model. The results of this study show that Path Flow Estimator can be a useful tool in traffic demand modeling for small and medium communities. But PFE should not be used for large communities because of the difficulty in arriving proper trip generation rate for complex land uses. PFE does not distinguish between an internal zone and an external zone...|$|R

25|$|The 4th Army {{had held}} on to the Gheluvelt Plateau in August but its {{casualties}} worsened the German manpower shortage. Haig transferred the main offensive effort to the Second Army on 25 August and moved the northern boundary of the Second Army closer to the Ypres–Roulers railway. More heavy artillery was sent to Flanders from the armies further south and placed opposite the Gheluvelt Plateau. Plumer continued the tactical development of the Fifth Army, during its slow and costly progress in August. After a pause of about three weeks, Plumer intended to capture the plateau in <b>four</b> <b>steps,</b> at six-day intervals to bring forward artillery and supplies. The Second Army attacks were to remain limited and infantry brigades re-organised to attack the first objective with a battalion each and the final one with two battalions, the opposite of the Fifth Army practice.|$|E
25|$|Plumer {{planned to}} capture Gheluvelt Plateau in <b>four</b> <b>steps</b> at six day intervals, for {{time to bring}} forward {{artillery}} and supplies, a faster tempo of operations than that envisaged by Gough before 31 July. Each step was to have even more limited geographical objectives, with infantry units attacking on narrower fronts in greater depth. The practice of attacking the first objective with two battalions and the following objectives with a battalion each was reversed, {{in view of the}} greater density of German defences the further the attack penetrated; double the medium and heavy artillery was available than for on 31 July. Reorganisation in this manner had been recommended in a report of 25 August, by the Fifth Army General Officer Commanding RA (GOCRA) Major-General H. Uniacke. The evolution in organisation and method was to ensure that more infantry were on tactically advantageous ground, having had time to consolidate and regain contact with their artillery before German counter-attacks.|$|E
