40|$|A {{statistical}} {{analysis for the}} comparability of water (H 2 O) and ozone (O 3) data sets sampled during the SPURT aircraft campaigns and the MOZAIC passenger aircraft flights is presented. The <b>Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff</b> <b>test</b> reveals that the distribution functions from SPURT and MOZAIC trace gases differ from {{each other with a}} confidence of 95 %. A variance analysis shows a different variability character in both trace gas data sets. While the SPURT H 2 O data only contain atmospheric processes variable on a diurnal or synoptical timescale, MOZAIC H 2 O data also reveal processes, which vary on inter-seasonal and seasonal timescales. The SPURT H 2 O data set does not represent the full MOZAIC H 2 O variance in the UT/LS for climatological investigations, whereas the variance of O 3 is much better represented. SPURT H 2 O data are better suited in the stratosphere, where the MOZAIC RH sensor looses its sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} the current study was {{studying}} the effect of managerial executive competencies on marketing effectiveness in firms on customer philosophy, integrated marketing efforts, marketing information, market orientation and operational efficiency. The statistical population included seventy marketing managers of a food industry in Jey township located in Isfahan that the whole population was studied {{due to the fact that}} the statistical population was limited. So no sampling was needed. Questionnaire was used to collect the required data that contained 38 questions about research variables. Construct validity was used to investigate validity of the questionnaire and the obtained results revealed that the applied questionnaire had a suitable validity. The reliability was calculated by means of Cronbach's alpha coefficient which was equal to 0. 897 for the whole questionnaire. It was an acceptable coefficient that confirmed reliability of the questionnaire. Descriptive indexes such as frequency tables and statistical diagrams were used to describe the statistical population in order to analyze research data and a general view of subjects was obtained. Then quantitative methods of statistical analysis including <b>Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff</b> <b>test,</b> correlation coefficient and structura...|$|E

In order to realize knowledge commercialization {{it is necessary to}} determine the constituent processes, methods and factors to be used in decision-making for commercialization. Knowledge commercialization in engineering and construction management of national Iranian south oil company was studied in this survey in viewpoint of some effective inter-organizational factors on it including role of senior management, market centrality and customer focus, participation and interaction, intellectual property management and role of individual factors. The survey was conducted using descriptive-field method and the statistical population consisted of management experts and researchers. Simple random sampling was conducted and researcher self-made questionnaire was tool of data collection. Statistical tests like t-test and <b>Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff</b> <b>test</b> were used for data analysis. Results indicate engineering and construction management has knowledge commercialization and role of individual factors in Friedman ranking test has the highest potential. Participation and interaction, intellectual property management, role of senior management and market centrality and customer focus are the next factors...|$|E

40|$|The present Thesis aims to formulate, and validate, {{mathematical}} tools (acquisition, inversion, modelling) able to synthetise {{the description}} of grade distribution, conditioned to size, of particulate systems resulting from primary grindings of polimineral ores. The study uses experimental data, collected from a feldspatic ore, employing adequate analytical methods, with emphasis to Image Analysis. The automation of this technique {{made it possible to}} measure the apparent size and grade of great number of particles, allowing to formulate, and validate, mathematical methodologies that apply the Dirichlet law as a probability model to discribe the grade distribution in a monogranular population of polimineral particles. The hypothesis testing, using both the Chi-Square and the generalized <b>Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff</b> <b>tests,</b> {{came to the conclusion that}} the model should be rejected as a grade descriptor of the distributions observed. Experimental data, corresponding to measurements on planar features, contain stereological bias which were corrected by means of Quantitative Stereological methods. As a practical application of the methodologies developed the ore beneficiation was studied. The study envolved predicting the grinding size, concentrating the feldspar minerals particles, by froth flotation, and prifying the feldspatic concentrate, by magnetic separation. Tests to determine the technological application of the beneficiated material revealed its aptitude to make tiles for flooringAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|The {{duration}} of cabinets in a parliamentary democracy depends both on support from Parliament and, when necessary, on {{agreement among the}} different parties of the governing coalition. Since {{the foundation of the}} Reign of Italy (1861) until 2001, 119 cabinets have ruled, ten of which have not been considered in this analysis because terminated by non-political causes (death or serious illness of chief of government) or because they have not operated under control of Parliament. On the 109 durations, which form the basis for the analysis, a gamma random variable has been adapted through maximum likelihood estimation, which {{has proved to be a}} valid tool for the interpretation of the data. In fact, a <b>Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff</b> <b>test</b> has shown that a gamma with n= 2 well adapts to the three different definitions of duration (political, juridical and until resignation). Cabinets which have not obtained Parliament approval, have been treated separately. Two detailed investigations have confirmed the n= 2 estimation: in the first the cabinets of the Reign have been opposed to those of the Republic and in the second politicians with greater government experience have been opposed to the others. The value taken on by this parameter allows to decompose the duration into the sum of two negative exponential variables with the same parameter ? and to dare the interpretation that Italian governments default on the second occasion of problems they encounter...|$|E
