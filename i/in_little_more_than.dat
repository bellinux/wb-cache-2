5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries <b>in</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> six weeks.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{canceled}} {{due to the}} lockout; many Devils players played in European leagues and in the hockey world championships. Patrik Elias, who was playing in the Russian Superleague, contracted hepatitis A. Faced with Elias' indefinite recovery timetable, plus the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Niedermayer to free agency and Scott Stevens to retirement, Lamoriello signed veteran defenseman Dan McGillis and two former Devils, winger Alexander Mogilny and defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, none of whom finished the season on the ice. In July 2005, the team announced that head coach Pat Burns would not return for the 2005–06 season after being diagnosed with cancer {{for the second time}} <b>in</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year. Assistant Coach Larry Robinson, the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002, was promoted to start the season.|$|E
5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed <b>in</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on {{and he and his}} crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Sannino's {{departure}} {{initiated a}} bizarre {{sequence of events}} which led to Watford having three further head coaches <b>in</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a month. On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Óscar García as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow Championship side Leeds United for his services. García, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains {{a couple of weeks}} prior. Billy McKinlay, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day – his first position in management. A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former Partizan coach Slaviša Jokanović appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.|$|E
5|$|The bishopric of Dunblane {{was a small}} diocese, {{essentially}} {{confined to}} the earldoms of Strathearn and Menteith. Size was a problem for providing the bishopric with adequate income, a problem {{compounded by the fact}} that Gille Brígte, Mormaer of Strathearn, had established Inchaffray Priory in 1200 (promoted to Abbey in 1221). In the 1440s, Bower wrote that Gille Brígte: Divided his earldom into three equal portions. One he gave to the church and bishop of Dunblane, the second to St John the Evangelist and the canons of Inchaffray, the third he kept for himself and his own needs. If this were not enough, much of the income not granted to Inchaffray had since been given to other religious institutions; some revenue was even controlled by the Bishop of Dunkeld. Dunblane had its origins in an older Gaelic monastic establishment, that is, in an institution with an abbot-bishop heading a relatively informal establishment of smaller cells with little geographical compactness. Dunblane emerged as a bishopric in 1155, probably, like bishoprics with a similar history (e.g. Brechin), having changed <b>in</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> name. There was a community of Céli Dé at Muthill until at least the end of the 13th century, and the base for the archdeaconry of the diocese appears to have varied between there and Dunblane until the time of Bishop Clement. The bishopric itself appears to have been without a single base, although it was probably associated with both locations.|$|E
