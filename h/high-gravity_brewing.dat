40|$|<b>High-gravity</b> <b>brewing,</b> {{which can}} {{decrease}} production costs by increasing brewery yields, {{has become an}} attractive alternative to traditional brewing methods. However, as higher sugar concentration is required, the yeast is exposed to various stresses during fermentation. We evaluated the influence of <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing</b> on the fermentation performance of the brewer’s yeast under model brewing conditions. The lager brewer’s strain Weihenstephan 34 / 70 strain was characterized at three different gravities by adding either glucose or maltose syrups to the basic wort. We observed that increased gravity resulted in a lower specific growth rate, a longer lag phase before initiation of ethanol production, incomplete sugar utilization, {{and an increase in}} the concentrations of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate in the final beer. Increasing the gravity by adding maltose syrup as opposed to glucose syrup resulted in more balanced fermentation performance in terms of higher cell numbers, respectively, higher wort fermentability and a more favorable flavor profile of the final beer. Our study underlines the effects of the various stress factors on brewer’s yeast metabolism and the influence of the type of sugar syrups on the fermentation performance and the flavor profile of the final beer...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of volatile esters by yeast is of major industrial interest because {{the presence of}} these compounds determines the fruity aroma of fermented beverages, like beer and wine. The need to understand and control ester synthesis is driven by the fact that esters {{play a key role in}} the sensorial quality of these fermented alcoholic beverages. Especially in the brewery, problems with ester production have been encountered by the introduction of modern brewing practices, such as <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing,</b> the use of tall cylindroconical fermentors and the {{production of}} reduced-alcohol beers. Indeed, it is well-known that the use of worts of high specific gravity results in disproportionate amounts of esters. In contrast to <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing,</b> fermentations in tall ‘Apollo’ fermentors or the production of low alcohol beers result in a reduction of ester formation, so that the produced beers lack desirable fruity tones. As esters are synthesized via several yeasts’ complex metabolic pathways, there is a need to gain a clear understanding of ester metabolism. One needs to take a closer look at the individual genes involved, their functions and regulatory mechanisms. In alcoholic beverages, there are two important groups of esters: the acetate esters and the medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) ethyl esters. For acetate ester synthesis, the genes involved have already been cloned and characterized. Also the biochemical pathways and the regulation of acetate ester synthesis are well-defined. About the molecular basis of MCFA ethyl ester synthesis however, research was only recently successful. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the synthesis of MCFA ethyl esters and discusses the different factors that allow MCFA ester formation to be controlled during fermentation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} environment breweries need to produce high quality alcoholic beverages in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner. This {{has led the}} use of modern technologies such as <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing.</b> However, the benefits of this approach are limited by the ethanol sensitivity of the S. cerevisiae strains. The current study identifies mechanisms contributing to ethanol tolerance in a commercial brewing strain ‘IND 1 ’. This was achieved by creating an ethanol tolerant mutant of the strain and investigating differences between the parent and the mutant in their response to ethanol at a molecular level. Genes contributing to ethanol tolerance were identified and characterised by comparing gene expression profiles of the parent and mutant in the absence and presence of ethanol, using microarray analysis...|$|E
40|$|During fermentation, {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{produces}} {{a broad range}} of aroma-active substances, which are vital for the complex flavour of beer. In order to obtain insight into the influence of <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing</b> and fermentation temperature on flavour formation, we analysed flavour production and the expression level of ten genes (ADH 1, BAP 2, BAT 1, BAT 2, ILV 5, ATF 1, ATF 2, IAH 1, EHT 1 and EEB 1) during fermentation of a lager and an ale yeast. Higher initial wort gravity increased acetate ester production, while the influence of higher fermentation temperature on aroma compound production was rather limited. In addition, there is a good correlation between flavour production and the expression level of specific genes involved in the biosynthesis of aroma compounds. We conclude that yeasts with desired amounts of esters and higher alcohols, in accordance with specific consumer preferences, may be identified based on the expression level of flavour biosynthesis genes. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the initial wort density can determine the final concentration of important volatile aroma compounds, thereby allowing beneficial adaptation of the flavour of beerstatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{fermentation}} of maltotriose, {{the second}} most abundant fermentable sugar in wort, is often incomplete during <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing.</b> Poor maltotriose consumption is due to environmental stress conditions during high-gravity fermentation and especially to a low uptake of this sugar by some industrial strains. In this study we investigated whether the use of strains with an alpha-glucosidase attached {{to the outside of}} the cell might be a possible way to reduce residual maltotriose. To this end, the N-terminal leader sequence of Kre 1 and the carboxy-terminal anchoring domain of either Cwp 2 or Flo 1 were used to target maltase encoded by MAL 32 to the cell surface. We showed that Mal 32 displayed on the cell surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains was capable of hydrolysis of alpha- 1, 4 - linkages, and that it increased the ability of a strain lacking a functional maltose permease to grow on maltotriose. Moreover, the enzyme was also expressed and found to be active in an industrial strain. These data show that expressing a suitable maltase on the cell surface might provide a means of modifying yeast for more complete maltotriose utilization in brewing and other fermentation applications.

40|$|To save energy, space, and time, today's breweries {{make use}} of <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing</b> in which {{concentrated}} medium (wort) is fermented, resulting in a product with higher ethanol content. After fermentation, the product is diluted to obtain beer with the desired alcohol content. While economically desirable, the use of wort with an even higher sugar concentration {{is limited by the}} inability of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) to efficiently ferment such concentrated medium. Here, we describe a successful strategy to obtain yeast variants with significantly improved fermentation capacity under high-gravity conditions. We isolated better performing variants of the industrial lager strain CMBS 33 by subjecting a pool of UV-induced variants to consecutive rounds of fermentation in very-high-gravity wort (> 22 degrees Plato). Two variants (GT 336 and GT 344) showing faster fermentation rates and/or more-complete attenuation as well as improved viability under high ethanol conditions were identified. The variants displayed the same advantages in a pilot-scale stirred fermenter under high-gravity conditions at 11 degrees C. Microarray analysis identified several genes whose altered expression may be responsible for the superior performance of the variants. The role of some of these candidate genes was confirmed by genetic transformation. Our study shows that proper selection conditions allow the isolation of variants of commercial brewer's yeast with superior fermentation characteristics. Moreover, it is the first study to identify genes that affect fermentation performance under high-gravity conditions. The results are of interest to the beer and bioethanol industries, where the use of more-concentrated medium is economically advantageous. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The use of unmalted oats or sorghum in brewing {{has great}} {{potential}} for creating new beer types/flavors and saving costs. However, the substitution of barley malt with oat or sorghum adjunct is not only innovative but also challenging due to their specific grain characteristics. The overall objectives of this Ph. D. project were: 1) to investigate the impact of various types and levels of oats or sorghum on the quality/processability of mashes, worts, and beers; 2) to provide solutions as regards the application of industrial enzymes to overcome potential brewing problems. For these purposes, a highly precise rheological method using a controlled stress rheometer was developed and successfully applied {{as a tool for}} optimizing enzyme additions and process parameters. Further, eight different oat cultivars were compared in terms of their suitability as brewing adjuncts and two very promising types identified. In another study, the limitations of barley malt enzymes and the benefits of the application of industrial enzymes in <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing</b> with oats were determined. It is recommended to add enzymes to high-gravity mashes when substituting 30 % or more barley malt with oats in order to prevent filtration and fermentation problems. Pilot-scale brewing trials using 10 – 40 % unmalted oats revealed that the sensory quality of oat beers improved with increasing adjunct level. In addition, commercially available oat and sorghum flours were implemented into brewing. The use of up to 70 % oat flour and 50 % sorghum flour, respectively, is not only technically feasible but also economically beneficial. In a further study on sorghum was demonstrated that the optimization of industrial mashing enzymes has {{great potential for}} reducing beer production costs. A comparison of the brewing performance of red Italian and white Nigerian sorghum clearly showed that European grown sorghum is suitable for brewing purposes; 40 % red sorghum beers were even found to be very low in gluten...|$|E
40|$|Osmotolerance is an {{essential}} trait of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for several industrial applications, such as high-sugar dough fermentation, <b>high-gravity</b> <b>brewing</b> or wine making and also during high-gravity industrial bioethanol production in which typically high concentrations of sugars are used. Commercial application of very high-gravity (VHG) fermentation technology for bioethanol production has immense potential to increase final ethanol titer, and reduce the energy consumption for distillation {{and the amount of}} distillage residue. However, implementation of this technology requires a robust yeast strain that can efficiently ferment under high-gravity conditions. This work tried to help remediating this industrial bottleneck by exploring three different avenues. First, the natural biodiversity of Saccharomyces species has been extensively explored to identify one or more osmotolerant strains that have potential as a starter culture in bioethanol fermentation. This allowed the identification of several interesting yeast strains that performed well in fermentation experiments mimicking industrial bioethanol production. Moreover, several isolates were identified that were extremely tolerant to specific stressors and are good candidates for inverse metabolic engineering or further strain improvement through genetic engineering, experimental evolution, or breeding. In the second approach, the S. cerevisiae strain that showed most efficient very high-gravity fermentation performance (X 6003) was subjected to polygenic analysis to identify the causative genetic elements responsible for its superior osmotolerance. For this purpose, pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis, a powerful technology for efficient polygenic analysis, was employed. In this method, a haploid segregant (X 6003 - 4 D) of the osmotolerant yeast strain with the most superior trait-of-interest has been crossed with a haploid segregant (ER- 42 A) from an unrelated industrial strain (Ethanol Red) with a comparatively inferior phenotype. Subsequently, the resulting diploid hybrid strain X 6003 - 4 D/ER- 42 A has been sporulated and 32 segregants with the superior phenotype have been selected to construct the superior pool. 32 segregants were also randomly selected regardless of their phenotype to construct the unselected pool. Pooled genomic DNA extraction was performed for both pools separately and submitted to whole-genome sequence analysis. A total of ten quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified with this approach, all of which had a statistically significant linkage. Dissection of QTL 2, QTL 3 and QTL 7 revealed three causative genes, namely RBK 1, GPD 1 and DUS 3. Further analysis is required to identify the remainder of the causative alleles in the other QTLs. This work demonstrated the high genetic complexity of osmotolerance. Moreover, it confirmed the potential of polygenic analysis by pooled-segregant whole-genome sequencing to identify causative gene(s) with a subtle influence on the phenotype. Finally, in the third approach, the huge, yet barely exploited resource of non-conventional yeast biodiversity was explored to identify potential stress-tolerant alternatives for S. cerevisiae. This work resulted in the identification of several promising candidates that may replace or complement S. cerevisiae in second generation bioethanol fermentation, including Pichia kudriavzevii. Moreover, this work yielded a multipurpose database, providing novel insight in the properties of non-conventional yeasts and a resource for future studies to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the extreme phenotypes of some of these yeasts. Altogether, the study supplemented our existing knowledge on the phenotypic diversity within different yeast species and within different strains of the same yeast species. It also gave us a better knowledge of the tolerance limits of different yeast species and strains for traits relevant to bioethanol production. Finally, the polygenic analysis by pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis expanded our current knowledge on S. cerevisiaegenetic elements that contribute to superior fermentation performance under VHG conditions. nrpages: 212 status: publishe...|$|E
