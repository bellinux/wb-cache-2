5|$|Soon North Korean rifle fire {{came in on}} the {{dispersed}} men and E and F Companies {{immediately began}} withdrawing in a disorderly manner. Troops began shying from the front and retreating without orders, ignoring officers' commands to stay in position. Colonel Horton V. White, the regimental commander, heard of the difficulty and drove hurriedly to the scene. He found the battalion coming back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> disorder {{and most of the}} men in a state of panic. Historians blame the retreat as much on officers' ineptitude as individual soldiers panicking. He mustered the men and ordered a retreat but by then many soldiers were withdrawing on their own. The next day the ROK 17th Regiment enveloped the North Korean position that had launched the attack and captured two light machine guns, one mortar, and about 30 North Koreans who appeared to be guerrillas. The ROK 17th Regiment fought in the hills for the next two days, making some limited gains, and then it moved back to Sangju to join other units as part of the ROK Army reorganization in progress around Pusan. This left only the US 24th Infantry Regiment guarding the west approach to Sangju from the Mun'gyong plateau.|$|E

25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E

500|$|During {{his tenure}} Kennedy {{became one of}} the most {{recognizable}} and influential members of his party, and was sometimes called a [...] "Democratic icon" [...] as well as [...] "The Lion of the Senate". Kennedy and his Senate staff authored around 2,500bills, of which more than 300 were enacted into law. Kennedy co-sponsored another 550bills that became law after 1973. Kennedy was known for his effectiveness in dealing with Republican senators and administrations, sometimes to the irritation of other Democrats. During the 101st Congress under President George H. W. Bush, at least half of the successful proposals put forward by the Senate Democratic policy makers came out of Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee. During the 2000s, almost every bipartisan bill signed during the George W. Bush administration had significant involvement from Kennedy. A late 2000s survey of Republican senators ranked Kennedy first among Democrats in bipartisanship. Kennedy strongly believed in the principle [...] "never let the perfect be the enemy of the good," [...] and would agree to pass legislation he viewed as incomplete or imperfect with the goal of improving it <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>In</b> April 2006, Kennedy was selected by Time as one of [...] "America's 10 Best Senators"; the magazine noted that he had [...] "amassed a titanic record of legislation affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman and child in the country" [...] and that [...] "by the late 1990s, the liberal icon had become such a prodigious cross-aisle dealer that Republican leaders began pressuring party colleagues not to sponsor bills with him". In May 2008, soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee John McCain said, [...] " [...] is a legendary lawmaker and I have the highest respect for him. When we have worked together, he has been a skillful, fair and generous partner." [...] Republican Governor of California and Kennedy relative Arnold Schwarzenegger described [...] "Uncle Teddy" [...] as [...] "a liberal icon, a warrior for the less fortunate, a fierce advocate for health-care reform, a champion of social justice here and abroad" [...] and [...] "the rock of his family". At the time of Kennedy's death, sociologist and Nation board member Norman Birnbaum wrote that Kennedy had come to be viewed as the [...] "voice" [...] and [...] "conscience" [...] of American progressivism.|$|E

2500|$|The group {{reportedly}} {{performed the}} song at the Station Inn in Nashville in 2001, {{as part of}} a series of songs commemorating Bob Dylan's 60th birthday. The song has become extremely popular since its inclusion on Old Crow Medicine Show's major label debut, O.C.M.S. in 2004, although the song appeared in an earlier form on the now out-of-print EP Troubles Up and <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> <b>in</b> 2001. The group's version of the song was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 2013.

2500|$|Koechner {{was born}} in Tipton, Missouri, to Margaret Ann (née Downey) and Cecil Stephen Koechner. He has two brothers, Mark and Joe, and three sisters, Mary-Rose, Cecilia and Joan. His father ran a {{business}} that manufactured turkey coops (Koechner has stated that [...] "If you see a turkey going <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> a big truck, most likely its coop is from Tipton..."). He was raised Catholic, and is of German, English, and Irish descent. Koechner studied Political Science at Benedictine College and the University of Missouri, before he eventually decided {{to pursue a career}} in improvisational comedy and moved to Chicago.

A {{passenger}} traveling from Buffalo to Cleveland {{would be forced to}} change trains at the Pennsylvania border because of the different gauges. Only [...] <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> Erie, the passenger would again have to change trains. The process of having to change trains repeatedly would result in lengthy delays, often causing passengers to miss connecting trains and then to be forced to stay in Erie.|$|E

In 1998, McKagan collaborated with his former Guns N' Roses bandmate Izzy Stradlin on his solo album 117°.
