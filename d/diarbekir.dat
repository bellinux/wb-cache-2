2500|$|The {{degree of}} the {{responsibility}} of the Ottoman government and whether the genocide had a systematic nature {{has been the subject of}} different scholarly opinions. Concerning {{the responsibility of the}} Ottoman government, Hilmar Kaiser wrote that Talaat Pasha ordered the deportations of the Assyrians in the area on 26 October 1914, fearing their collaboration with the advancing Russian troops, but the order was postponed and abandoned three days later due to a lack of forces. When the Assyrians did not collaborate with Russians, any plans to deport them were cancelled. Kaiser wrote that the massacres of Assyrians were apparently not a part of the official Ottoman policy and that the Assyrians were ordered to be treated differently from the Armenians. Taner Akçam, a leading specialist in the Armenian Genocide, cites Ottoman official correspondence in 1919, inquiring the number and conditions of Assyrians deported, to state that the Ottoman government was unaware of the full numerical extent of the deportations of Assyrians. Another Ottoman document orders Assyrians to be detained in their present locations, instead of their deportation, which, according to Akçam, indicates that the Assyrian population could have been treated differently from the Armenians, but that they were often [...] "eliminated" [...] alongside them. Donald Bloxham, a genocide scholar, stated that while Assyrians of western Persia, Hakkari, Bitlis, Van and <b>Diarbekir</b> were massacred along with Armenians, they were [...] "not subject to the same systematic destruction".|$|E
6000|$|The {{development}} of Nationalism among the Turks {{was a natural}} phenomenon. Starting in the West, the movement has been spreading for a century through Central Europe, Hungary, and the Balkans, till from the Turks' former subjects it has passed to the Turks themselves. Chance played its part. Dr. Nazim Bey, for instance, the General Secretary of the [...] "Union and Progress" [...] Committee, {{is said to have}} been fired by a work of M. Léon Cahun's on the early history of the Turks and Mongols, lent him by the French Consul-General at Salonika, and the movement was, and still is, confined to a small intelligentsia. But that is the case with other national movements too, and does not hinder them from being powerful forces. Turkish Nationalism was kept alive after 1909 by a small group of enthusiasts at Salonika--their leader was Ziya Bey, who had come up to the Young Turk Congress from <b>Diarbekir,</b> and was one of the first converts to the new idea. It gained ground suddenly during, the Balkan War. The shock of defeat produced a craving for regeneration; the final loss of Europe turned the minds of the Osmanlis to the possibilities of Asia, and they were struck by the action of several prominent Russian subjects of Turco-Tatar nationality, who, out of racial sympathy, had given their services to the Ottoman Government in this time of adversity.

They answered in the negative, saying that the Government had ordered the population to quit the town before the arrival of the Russians and before anyone was killed; but that the Armenians had been summoned to give up their arms and had not done so, dreading an attack by the Kurds, and dreading the Government also; the Government had further demanded that the principal Notables and leading men should be given up to them as hostages, but the Armenians had not complied.All this took place during the approach of the Russians towards the city of Van. As to the adjacent districts, the authorities collected the Armenians and drove them into the interior, where they were all slaughtered, no Government official or private man, Turk or Kurd, having been killed.

[...] He declared that the case brought up against the Armenians was ultimately [...] "in the minds of the common Turkish people, in preparation of atrocities which were to follow." [...] Riggs further noted concerning self-defense measures Armenians had taken in response to being massacred:The loss of Van to the Russians, through the activity and bravery of the Armenians, produced a tremendous impression. Of course it was not then generally known that the Armenians had only acted in self-defense after the Turks had massacred many of them. Outbreaks were reported in various places, and some of these, notably in the region of <b>Diarbekir,</b> were real enough, though the Armenians were the victims not the aggressors in these disturbances.|$|E

Nakhlé, together {{with other members of}} his family, was arrested and sent to Damascus. Djemal Pasha commented later in his Memories: Shortly before my arrival in Syria several important documents, implicating Nahle Mutran Pasha of Baalbek, were handed over to a court martial.

The court martial condemned Nahle Mutran Pasha to penal servitude for life.After my visit to Jerusalem Hulussi Bey told me that the presence of Nahle Pasha in Damascus was open to objection, and he had obtained permission from Constantinople to send him under guard to <b>Diarbekir.</b> During the journey the Pasha had attempted to escape one night when they were near Djerablus, and had been found dead by his guards.'''' ...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{mayor of}} Petrevene after {{the removal of}} the Ottoman rule was Tono Benchev Bakov (Peykin) of Vidrare, born in its hamlet of Smolevica. He used {{to be a member of}} the Revolutionaly Committee [...] "Hasan Kasam" [...] founded by Vasil Levski in the village of Vidrare in 1869. He has moved to Petrevene prior to the Russian-Turkish war (1877/78) due to a {{conflict}} he had with local Ottoman authorities in Vidrare. His brother-in-law, the revolutionary Yosif Poppetrov from Vidrare, also a member of the revolutionary committee of Vasil Levski, has been exiled by the Ottoman authorities to the town of <b>Diarbekir</b> in the Middle Asia, now in Turkey. This was due to his involvement with the robbery of the Ottoman Bank, mastered by Dimiter Obshti, in the Arabakonak pass in Bulgaria in 1872. Tono Benchev has served as a mayor of Petrevene for 16 years. He used to be close to Stefan Stambolov, a major co-revolutionary of Vasil Levski and the current Prime Minister of Bulgaria. He has visited him during his official trips in the Principality of Bulgaria. The first secretary in the village municipality was Tono Benchev' son, Bencho Tonov. In 1878 an elementary school (1st to 4th grade) opened in Petrevene. Till 1891 it was hosted in a former Pomak house, after which it moved to the then newly constructed [...] "old" [...] school, built by Stoyu Stanev of Petrevene. The village Municipality (Bulg.: obshtina) has moved to the vacated former schoolhouse. Andrey Gadzhovski of Lukovit, born in Dranchevo, Macedonia, and Marko Markov of Karlovo were the first teachers in Petrevene. The first native teacher, Velyu Ninov, was hired in 1896. During the 1890s Petrevene was terrorized by the local band of the Bulgarian Yako voyvoda and his Pomak co-brigand Kachamachko.|$|E
