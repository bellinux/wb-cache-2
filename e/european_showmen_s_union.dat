The research is based on standard works on shipping and maritime labor relations, Hearings of the House and Senate Merchant Marine committees, and newspaper and magazine articles which trace the progress of various pieces of maritime legislation.

40|$|The {{author of}} Emil Loriks: Builder of a New Economic Order {{wrote the book}} {{in order to do}} justice to the life of her fellow South Dakotan Emil Loriks (1895 - 1985). Elizabeth Williams, an {{instructor}} of journalism and speech at South Dakota State University, has succeeded in producing a eulogy of an interesting and active farm leader. Her biographical portrait loudly praises Loriks for the variety of roles he played: as state legislator and Farm Holiday leader from 1927 - 34, as unsuccessful liberal Democratic candidate running against Republican Karl Mundt in 1938, as South Dakota Farmer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Union</b> president during the later Depression, as farm cooperative leader throughout the war years and 1950 s, and finally as head of the Farmer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Union</b> Grain Terminal Association (GT A) from 1957 until his retirement in 1967. From beginning to end the book valiantly tries to turn the unpretentious Loriks into a truly heroic figure. Unfortunately, in the course of her lionizing, Williams does not add much to the general picture of South Dakota life and agriculture during our turbulent century...|$|R

40|$|Caption title.; Also {{available}} online [URL] The Klondyke Nugget was a gory melodrama, written by and starring the Wild West <b>showman</b> <b>S.</b> F. Cody, {{set against the}} Klondike gold rush (Klondyke is now usually spelled Klondike). This image {{was one of several}} pictorial advertisements used for the play, and this example still has a printed overlay (c. 13 x 9 cm.) pasted on the top left advertising performances at the Clarence Theatre, Pontypridd, Wales, opening on Monday, December 19 [1898]. The chromolithographed poster shows John Bull, symbol of England, surrounded by a group of people of various nationalities who may be (from right to left) : an Australian bushman in a red shirt, wearing a slouch hat and bandolier, with a kangaroo leaning on his shoulder; a Chinese man; Uncle Sam (representing the United States); a Dutchman; a Scotsman; an African man; John Bull (England); a bearded man (possibly a Boer); an Eskimo; an Irishman; a Frenchman; and a North American Indian chief. Although the man in the red shirt has been identified as Cody, he does not have his long hair and goatee, and the association with the kangaroo is a visual clue he is meant to be seen as Australian. A large number of Australians are believed to have been attracted to the Klondike Gold Rush (1896 - 1899) in Canada's Yukon Territory, although only several hundred actually made it to the goldfields.
