40|$|ABSTRACT: Combustion {{modified}} foams {{have been}} used in various applica-tions for several years and they can be formulated to meet a variety of flam-mability standards. Two general groups are commercially established: foams having margmal fire retardancy and foams having a high degree of resistance to ignition when exposed to high energy open flames such as two sheets of burning paper. The latter include melamine modified HR foams, which drip and develop molten polymer upon flame exposure, and the <b>hydrate</b> <b>alumina</b> modified HR foams that form a surface char upon flame exposure that protects the foam underneath against burning and reduces the rate of fire growth in fur-nishings. Several types of latter foams have been developed, namely: high per-formance COMBUSTION MODIFIED HIGH RESILIENCE (CMHR) foams that contain a sophisticated flame retardant system comprised of hydrated alumina and auxiliary flame retardants; MRC high resilience foams for medium risk category occupancies which also contain hydrated alumina and flame retardants; and ATH/HR that perform within the range bounded by Cali-fornia 117 foams and CMHR foam&mdash;they are high resilience foams that contain only hydrated alumina and a liquid flame retardant. All of these are char formers-a very important attribute for fire safety in furnishings, transit vehicle seating, and other applications. Since all of the said char forming combustion modified foams based on PHD polyol contain organic materials, they are subject to decomposition and igni...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of untreated <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> (UHA) and thermally treated <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> (THA) obtained from hydrolysis of locally manufactured aluminum sulfate to remove fluoride from aqueous solution {{has been investigated}} in batch and continuous operation. The parameters considered were contact time and adsorbent dose, thermal pre-treatment of adsorbent, initial fluoride concentration and pH. The adsorption was rapid during the initial 20 min, but significant amount (> 90 %) was removed within one hour at an optimum adsorbent dose of 1. 6 g/L for initial F- concentration of 20 mg/L. The removal {{efficiency of}} F was increased with adsorbent dosage. Fluoride adsorption efficiencies increase with increase in the thermal treatment temperature up to 200 ° C, but further increase in temperature resulted in decreased removal efficiency. For application in continuous packed bed column, treatment at 300 ° C was taken as an optimum value. Fluoride adsorption capacity increases linearly with increase in F - concentration. High defluoridation efficiency was achieved using both UHA and THA within a pH range of 4. 0 to 9. 0. The adsorption data at ambient pH were well fitted to the Freundlich isotherm model with a minimum capacity of 23. 7 mg F - /g and 7. 0 mg F - /g for THA and UHA, respectively. The kinetic studies showed that the adsorption reaction of fluoride removal by <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> can be well described by a pseudo-second-order rate equation. Continuous packed bed column experiment using THA indicated that 4. 5 g of THA could treat 6 L of water containing 20 mg/L fluoride before breakthrough.

40|$|Many {{components}} in dentifrices potentially interact with dentifrice flavor oil; they interfere with its avail-ability and affect the taste {{perception of the}} dentifrice. Availability of the volatile flavor oil may be deter-mined by headspace-gas chromatographic analysis. Results of this instrumental procedure have previously been reported to correlate with human taste perception. The present study used headspace-gas chromatog-raphy to determine the interaction of three commonly used dentifrice abrasives with a mint-based flavor oil. The abrasives investigated {{in the current study}} were hydrated precipitated silica, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (dical), and <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina.</b> The results show that all three abrasives bind flavor, thereby reducing the amount of flavor released into the headspace. The order of binding to flavor is hydrated silica> dical> hydrated alumina; i. e., dentifrices containing hydrated silica release less flavor than those con-taining dical, and dentifrices containing <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> release more flavor than dical formulations (in both paste and gel humectant systems). This study has also shown that the amount of water and humectant, and the composition of humectant, influence the flavor-binding ability of abrasives.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of soils from widely distributed sites reveal {{the presence of}} clay minerals with 14 / ~ d spacings in the B horizons of podzolized soils in Alberta. The minerals appear to be concentrated in the 2. 0 - 0. 2 micron clay fraction, the fraction less than 0. 2 micron being comprised primarily of material amorphous to X-ray.

Smaller amounts of quartz, kaolinite and illite are also noted in these B horizons.

50|$|In late 1888, {{metallic}} soaps were tried. At first a lead stearate was used, but in {{the summer}} months, these records started to sweat and decompose. In 1889, Aylsworth developed an aluminum wax, using acetate of alumina and stearic acid with sodium hydroxide added as a saponifying agent. It was found these records were much more durable. Problems arose, however, {{since there was no}} tempering agent and hot weather caused these records to decompose. Two problems contributed to this, stearic quality varied from different makers; Aylsworth purchased some from P&G and found it had too much olaic acid in it. The next cause {{of the problem is that}} all stearic acid without a tempering agent takes on moisture, and after many experiments it was found that Ceresine was ideal. To make the wax hard, sodium carbonate was added. Even so, a few batches of records still had some problems and became fogged. The fog problem arose from acetic acid left in the wax; this problem was solved when higher temperatures were used to make sure all the acetic acid was boiled out of the wax. As such, the records from 1889 to 1894 are a reddish-brown color due to the long cooking time. By 1896, Edison started using <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> in place of acetate of alumina. The use of <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> (sheet aluminum dissolved in a mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and distilled water) made better records, and the wax could be manufactured in a shorter period of time. Using the hydrated aluminum resulted in more desirable blanks, with fewer defects and shorter production time.|$|R

40|$|It has {{generally}} been held that adsorbents reduce the rate of absorption of orally administered drugs, partly by limiting {{the availability of the}} drugs and partly by impeding their access to the absorbing surface (Sollmann, 1948).

Preliminary experiments with atropine sulfate and <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> gel (A. mphojel, Wyeth) administered orally to rats, however, demonstrated Un-equivocally that contrary to expectation, this adsorbent did not appreciably limit the availability and activity of the anticholinergic drug but, rather, acted as an intestinal repository and prolonged the duration of its action.

40|$|Alumina oxides assume {{prominent}} catalytic {{applications in}} a wide range of industrial processes. However, alumina surfaces also serve as potent promoters in the heterogeneous formation of the notorious environmentally-persistent free radicals (EPFR). Herein, we theoretically examine dissociative adsorption mechanisms of phenol molecules over Al 2 O 3 and hydrated Al 2 O 3 ·nH 2 O clusters that mimic dehydrated and <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> structures, respectively. We show that fission of the phenol's hydroxyl bond over dehydrated alumina systematically incurs lower energy barriers in reference to the hydrated structures. A 1, 2 -water elimination step marks the most feasible channel in the interaction of phenol with hydrated clusters. The relevance of the acidity sites to the catalytic activity of alumina is clearly supported by the finding that the catalytic activity of the alumina surface in producing the phenoxy/phenolate species reversibly correlates with the degree of hydroxyl coverage.

This {{study is}} focusing on cementitious materials since, depending on their composition, these materials do not display the same behaviour when biogenic sulfuric acid attack occurs. In severe conditions, ordinary Portland cement materials can be deteriorated, while calcium aluminate cement (CAC) materials show good resistance to biogenic corrosion.

The ceramics present a gradient of color, from ochre to dark gray, when from the surface {{to the center of}} the piece, indicating compositional variation caused by inefficient sintering carried out by indigenous people. The goal of this study was to observe the phase transition temperature, decomposition, mass variation and reactions that occur in the archeological and nowadays ceramics (by DSC/TG), together with micro structural analysis (by SEM), phase analysis (by XRD) and chemical composition (by EDS). Ceramics nowadays are sintered with air, in a temperature ranging between 400 - 800 °C for one hour, and presents heterogeneous microstructure. The archeological ceramics were identified by the ilitte, <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina,</b> lutecite and quartz phase, and the caulinite, lutecite and quartz phase in clay produced today from that region differs in all characteristics and aspects according to time. The interaction between different areas of expertise is fundamental to aggregate knowledge: the use of {{ceramic material}} engineering to archeological application...|$|R

That eminent chemist was the first who {{drew attention to the}} distinction which may be made of all substances into two classes, termed by him crystalloids and colloids; or rather, of all states of matter into the crystalloid and the colloidal states, for many substances are capable of existing in either. When in the colloidal state, their sensible properties are very {{different from those of the}} same substance when crystallized, or when in a state easily susceptible of crystallization. Colloid substances pass with extreme difficulty and slowness into the crystalline state, and are extremely inert in all the ordinary chemical relations. Substances in the colloid state are almost always, when combined with water, more or less viscous or gelatinous. The most prominent examples of the state are certain animal and vegetable substances, particularly gelatine, albumen, starch, the gums, caramel, tannin, and some others. Among substances not of organic origin, the most notable instances are hydrated silicic acid, and <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina,</b> with other metallic peroxides of the aluminous class.|$|R
40|$|Enrichment {{of copper}} beneath {{amorphous}} anodic films on relatively dilute, solid-solution Al-Cu alloys is necessary before copper can be oxidized and {{incorporated into the}} oxide layer. A similar enrichment arises during electropolishing, which also develops an amorphous oxide. In these cases, external polarization is applied, usually generating a relatively high oxidation rate. In contrast, enrichment behaviour at the corrosion potential has received less attention. The present study examines the corrosion of Al-Cu alloys, containing up to 6. 7 at. % Cu, in 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide solution at 293 K. Copper is again found to enrich in the alloy, similarly to behaviour with anodic polarization. However, following enrichment, discrete copper-rich particles appear to be generated in the corrosion product. These are suggested to be nanoparticles of copper, since the corrosion potentials of the alloys are low relative to that required for oxidation of copper. The corrosion rate increases with increase of both time and copper content of the alloy, probably associated with a greater cathodic activity due to {{an increasing number of}} nanoparticles. The corrosion proceeds with loss of aluminium species to the sodium hydroxide solution, but with retention of copper in the layer of <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina</b> corrosion product. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} optimization of the curing time using the Weibull distribution model, analyzing {{the rate of change}} of compressive strength of the nano cement based concrete. In this investigation, the nano cement was synthesized by sol-gel method using nano silica and <b>hydrated</b> <b>alumina.</b> Additionally, nano cement based concrete was fabricated varying the aggregate and alkali activator content. After measuring the compressive strength of the concrete at four desired curing times viz., 3, 7, 14 and 28 days, the required curing time to achieve a particular rate of change of the compressive strength has been predicted utilizing the equation derived from the variation of the rate of change of compressive strength with the curing time, prior to the optimization of the curing time (at the 99. 99 % confidence level) using the Weibull distribution model. Results revealed that the required curing time to achieve complete maturity of the nano cement based concrete is similar to 21 days, while for Portland cement, it is 28 days. Therefore, it can be assessed that the required time for building construction would be less considering the nano cement as a primary binding material instead of Portland cement.
