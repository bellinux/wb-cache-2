40|$|Solid Waste Management (SWM) is a {{necessary}} part of life, and effective management of this has been identified as essential for sustainable development. Effective SWM is of concern to developed countries and also developing countries, although the former has a longer history of concern with adverse effects of SWM upon social and environmental factors. It has been argued that such adverse effects can be reduced by assigning them a monetary value and that the identification and measurement of these effects assists in controlling the social and environmental costs of SWM facilitating movement toward sustainable development. Therefore, the need to integrate social and environmental costs in the accounting management system is widely recognised in SWM, and <b>integrated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> is a well accepted approach for achieving this objective. Although there is urgent need for integration of waste management into strategies for sustainable development, the degree of success with which both developed and developing countries cope with the problem differs. Most developing countries are still in the early process of the concept of sustainable development. Therefore, practices have been slow even though there appears to be initiative within the SWM activity to implement such a concept. In order to solve the problem, this study attempted to develop an <b>integrated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system for improvement of Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) system in developing countries, is a systematic approach based on accounting principles to calculate the positive and negative impact of a SWM activity, its not only for identifying, summing, and reporting the actual costs of solid waste management, but also combined with environmental costs (often are termed ???externalities??? by economists) are the costs of environmental degradation caused by SWM activity were previously difficult to be analyzed, so it {{can be used as a}} tool to assess and determine the strategy improvement of MSWM in developing countries with all their limitations. This <b>integrated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system for MSWM would support: informational goals by determining and reporting how much MSW management and environmental costs, management goals by identifying potential cost savings and providing a sound basis for municipality decisions such as enhancing of the public and private sector involvement in waste sector, and planning goals by documenting current benchmarks and further assessment that can be used when making or evaluating projections. In Chapter 1, the background of <b>integrated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system for improvement of municipal solid waste management in developing countries were addressed. Then the literature review, objectives, scopes, and analytical framework of the study were presented. In Chapter 2, Study result were assessed the SWM service cost estimate system and develop as standards for SWM service costs in developing countries, which consist of: collection, transfer and treatment, transportation, landfill management costs analysis using cost breakdown analysis (CBA) of the questioner and SWM stakeholder interviews results in several major Indonesia cities as a developing countries sample...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{pervasive}} {{health care system}} was not very old {{but there is still}} a little bit ubiquity between the evaluations of this concept, mean when and from where this concept was developed or evolved. But, the concept of pervasive health care system was developed in late 90 's on the background of some growing medical crisis of baby bom after the Second World War in many industrial countries [Morris et al. ]. Due to the increase of the life-span among the adults, they need the proper treatment from the enormous health care providers. Still many of the diseases that severely limit place an enormous difficult to manage in their later stages like cancer, diabetics, asthma and heart problems, but can be treated more effectively and less expensively if caught in early stages. After World War II, advancement in medical technology began to have an effect on hospital operations. And due to World War II atomic reaction increase in new type of diseases which are not curable at that time [Morris et al. ]. " the early 1990 's, hospitals undergoing another series of changes. This era, in its early stages, appears to be time of consolidation and competition. Within the next 15 to 20 years, a for - profit system composed of hospitals, primary care physicians, specialists, and prepayment plans has been anticipated" [Menon, 2000]. This is a time when most of the hospitals have involved IT and the physicians also involve with IT as well. So after late 1990 's "personal computers were increasingly used by individual departments for specific purposes such as inventory control in pharmacy. Automating clinical records is a relatively a new objective for hospitals. Only in recent years have hospitals attempted to develop <b>integrated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> systems. This dynamic operating environment offers a unique setting in which, to study IT productivity" [Menon, 2000]. Faculty of Technolog...|$|E

40|$|Medicare has {{put into}} effect a {{reimbursement}} payment policy of inpatient hospital care that {{is known as the}} Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). This change has forced hospitals to know specifically what the operational costs are, especially as it relates to patient care. This change by Medicare of the reimbursement payment system has resulted in complex cost accounting systems that tie together the medical and financial data. The knowledge produced by these systems enable hospitals to evaluate performance {{as it relates to the}} DRG reimbursement. The Indian Health Service currently is reimbursed by DRG. The problem involves changing medical information systems so that it will provide the groundwork necessary for financial resource management and patient care information systems. The Patient Care Information System (PCIS) under development by IHS for some time can be described as an outpatient medical management system. Although highly praised by the IHS medical staff it is limited by financial and inpatient capabilities. The Indian Health Service will use the PCIS as the foundation when developing a system that incorporates both patient and financial data. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the readiness of IHS to develop an <b>integrated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system containing both medical and financial information. The data collection procedures used in the evaluation consisted of: 1) examining documents of the current IHS management information systems (MIS); 2) interviewing IHS employees with the purpose of documenting IHS intentions, plans, and progress toward a more comprehensive management information systems; 3) examining activities by other agencies of the federal government who attempted to develop a health care MIS; and 4) develop a draft statement of work by using previous information gathered. The Indian Health Service has made the PCIS the core system and is currently utilizing or adapting systems presently in use by other federal agencies such as the Veterans Administration system. The current approach also includes the conversion of the PCIS language so that it is compatible with others. The plan of action further involves the development of software and communications that would allow for a full communication network between all IHS facilities, as well as purchasing the necessary computer hardware and supporting software for each area office and service unit. Although IHS is seriously committed to updating its management systems, there are technical areas that remain unresolved. First, the agency supports medical management more than cost management. In other words, IHS uses the approach that patient care should be the most important consideration rather than cost implications. This was found to be confusing by the evaluators because numerous decisions by IHS concerning patient care were made due to financial considerations, e. g., contractual decisions for health care. Problems found in the present IHS approach include: 1) relying on PCIS as the core [...] inpatient systems, rather than outpatient systems, seems more adequate as a base because It produces more cost; 2) relying on present systems used in other agencies which may not be fully developed. e. g., the VA system which was partially adopted by IHS does not contain cost accounting; 3) greater amounts of new systems design and programming will be required, when commercially produced systems are currently available; and 4) costly mistakes are more likely made when plans proceed without a blueprint of the systems requirements. It was determined by the evaluators that any approach for the enhancing of management information capabilities will require 5 or more years to complete. The IHS should undertake a systems requirements study before proceeding further. New systems designs and programming should not be developed until an examination takes place of available commercially produced systems that include the integration of financial and medical data. The adaptation of portions of the VA system should not take place until the examination of commercial systems are found to be inadequate. Finally, the enhancement of PCIS and the purchase of hardware should also be delayed...|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century the former glory of Italian accounting was overshadowed by its decline during the eighteenth century, and literature from France, England, Germany, America and other countries took centre-stage. 'Theories of accounts' (rather than 'accounting theories') dominated not merely the early but also the later part of this century when Italian accounting had regained a prominent position beside other countries. The relation of those theories to the 'charts of accounts'-which later became so prominent in Continental Europe is historically important. The controversies over personalistic versus materialistic accounts and that between entity versus proprietary theories, as well as the emergence of other theories are discussed with reference to individual authors. Diverse topics from railroad accounting and auditing to various aspects of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> are investigated. Particularly important are the pioneering efforts of this period that anticipated further developments. These manifested themselves in the following ideas: entity theory, flow of funds statement, matrix accounting, different aspects of valuation, allocation and depreciation, price-level adjustments and indexation, current values, exit values, residual income valuation, managerial control, the emergence of competing accounting (and Bilanz) theories, the separation of fixed from variable costs, fixed and flexible budgeting, zero-based budgeting, PERT, transfer prices, break-even charts, variance analysis, job-order costing, labour and machine hour rates, standard <b>costing,</b> price determination, <b>integrating</b> financial and <b>cost</b> <b>accounting,</b> clean surplus theory, agricultural accounting, holding gains, and other topics.
