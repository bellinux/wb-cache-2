5000|$|Operating at Portland International Airport {{since the}} summer of 2013, House <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery</b> {{upgraded}} and expanded their presence {{at the airport in}} 2017 from a mobile kiosk to a larger, permanent retail location within concourse C, across from gate C6. Known for the anchor of Portland's famous [...] "Distillery Row", House <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery</b> was recognized as the nation's [...] "Best New Specialty Retail Concept, Small Operator" [...] as awarded in 2015 by the Airport Revenue News. They were recognized for their immersive retail experience at the airport and its offerings of product tastings, branded apparel and distilled beverages. House <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery</b> is currently the first distillery in the world to operate a spirits tasting room within an airport location.|$|R
5000|$|Following the war, {{it became}} part of the People's Republic of Poland. Economic {{activities}} included clothing manufacture, cereal-milling, <b>spirit</b> <b>distillery,</b> potato farming and other agricultural activities. In 1957 the knitting plant [...] "Sira" [...] was founded.|$|R
50|$|After {{the white}} wine is fermented, the remnant pulp (Moscatel grapes) is {{distilled}} at high temperatures. This process {{results in a}} <b>grape</b> <b>spirit,</b> destilado de uva (label “Espírito da Caldeira”), that is bright and clear. (<b>Grape</b> <b>spirits</b> are usually known by their Italian name, grappa.) The spirit's strength enables the drinker to taste, and feel on his/her palate, the flavor of Moscatel grapes. The after taste is smooth and has a hint of sweetness to balance the spirit's high alcohol content (45%).|$|R
5000|$|Some local off-licences in the {{northeast}} of England where there are strong historic links with Norway {{have been known to}} sell Norwegian akevitt occasionally. The drink tends to be popular amongst older people. Psychopomp Microdistillery [...] in Bristol, England, started producing an aquavit (termed 'Aqvavit' due to EU regulations) in 2017. In Canada aquavit is produced by Okanagan <b>Spirits</b> Craft <b>Distillery,</b> and Island <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery.</b> Small distilleries in the United States also produce aquavit, especially in parts of the country with high populations of people of Nordic heritage, such as the distilleries in Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oregon and Washington. See List of Akvavit Producers in the United States for specifics.|$|R
25|$|The {{practice}} of adding <b>grape</b> <b>spirits</b> to wine was once considered manipulative and fraudulent but today is accepted {{practice for the}} production of all fortified wines, like Port.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to selling spirits and other curated items, House <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery</b> {{will also provide}} mini classes to introduce PDX fliers to their products during airport down time. The new retail experience is inspired by their new facility in Southeast Portland which opened in November 2015 and expanded the company's production capacity sixfold.|$|R
50|$|Top of the Hill made {{additions}} {{to its original}} location in 2010, building the TOPO Great Room complex and TOPO Back Bar in an adjoining space formerly occupied by the Carolina Theater. In 2012, Top of the Hill opened their own organic <b>spirits</b> <b>distillery</b> three blocks south of the brewery, branding it TOPO.|$|R

50|$|Lacassine (French: La Cassine) is an unincorporated {{community}} in Jefferson Davis Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The Little Kahuna Water Park was being constructed off Interstate 10 in Lacassine, but was never completed due to monetary problems. Lacassine is {{home of the}} Louisiana <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery,</b> where Bayou Rum, a popular adult beverage in Louisiana, is distilled. Construction began in 2011 and Bayou Rum was created in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Port wine is {{typically}} richer, sweeter, heavier, and higher in alcohol content than unfortified wines. This {{is caused by}} the addition of distilled <b>grape</b> <b>spirits</b> to fortify the wine and halt fermentation before all the sugar is converted to alcohol, and results in a wine that is usually 19 to 20% alcohol.|$|R
2500|$|The {{high levels}} of sugars and lack of harsh tannins, makes Grenache well adapted to the {{production}} of fortified wines, such as the vin doux naturels (VDN) of the Roussillon region and the [...] "port-style" [...] wines of Australia. In these wines, the must ferments for 3 days before <b>grape</b> <b>spirit</b> is added to the must to halt the fermentation and the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The high alcoholic proof <b>grape</b> <b>spirit</b> brings the finish wine up to 15-16% alcohol. These wines can be made in a rancio style by leaving it outside in glass demi-johns (or carboys) or wooden barrels where the wine bakes in the sun for several years until it develops a maderized character and flavors of sour raisins, nuts and cheese. These fortified VDNs and port-style wines have longevity and can be drinkable well into their third decade.|$|R
50|$|Vodka {{production}} {{on a much}} larger scale began in Poland {{at the end of}} the 16th century, initially at Kraków, whence spirits were exported to Silesia before 1550. Silesian cities also bought vodka from Poznań, a city that in 1580 had 498 working <b>spirits</b> <b>distilleries.</b> Soon, however, Gdańsk outpaced both these cities. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands, Denmark, England, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Black Sea basin.|$|R
50|$|House <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery</b> is an American craft {{distiller}} {{based in}} Portland, Oregon. It {{was founded in}} Corvallis in 2004 and moved to Portland in 2005. Its production facility and tasting room is located on Portland's Distillery Row in the Central Eastside Industrial District. The distillery's flagship brand is Aviation American Gin, which comprises 80% of its production. Other products include Krogstad Festlig aquavit, Westward Oregon Straight Malt Whiskey, made from malted barley grown in the Pacific Northwest, and Volstead Vodka.

5000|$|Around 1790, in {{the village}} of Pieschen near Dresden, the first {{building}} outside the village core was a peasant shed, which was jacked up and enlarged in 1804. In this house the housekeeper Gottlob Dietzen ran a <b>spirits</b> <b>distillery.</b> Dietzen, however, received no license and was thus to blame for the fact that his house had to be auctioned for 855 thalers. The buyer was the brewer, Gottlob Wilhelm Hübner. In 1814, he received the Schankerlaubnis for [...] "Branntwein, Dresden Stadtbier und Wein" [...] and set up a restaurant.|$|R
5000|$|The used barrels {{from this}} renowned sherry {{producer}} {{are used by}} Scotch Whisky producers during the maturation of the premium <b>spirits.</b> Dalmore <b>distillery</b> use 30-year-old barrels in their 18-year-old single malt.|$|R
50|$|Between 1894 and 1906 {{the village}} was {{connected}} with the world by a railroad linking Bielsk Podlaski and Siedlce with Wołkowysk. Hajnówka became a minor transport junction and in 1900 a road was built between Białowieża and Bielsk Podlaski. During World War I, in 1915, the area was captured by Kaiser Germany. Protection of the forest was ceased. The new authorities started large-scale industrial exploitation of the area's nature resources. Because of its nodal position, Hajnówka became a seat of two lumber-mills, wood <b>spirit</b> <b>distillery</b> and a major train station for 90 km of narrow gauge railways were built across the forest.|$|R
50|$|Stark <b>Spirits</b> <b>Distillery</b> is an artisan {{distillery}} in Pasadena, California, {{that produces}} a range of alcoholic beverages {{under the direction of}} Head Distiller Greg Stark. The micro-distillery is owned by husband and wife, Greg Stark and Karen Robinson-Stark. Stark Spirits is located just blocks from the Pasadena Rose Bowl. It is Pasadena’s first micro-distillery, currently it’s only distillery, and one of two distilleries operating in Los Angeles County. Stark Spirits is a Certified Craft Distillery, certified by the American Distilling Institute. The Pasadena micro-distillery is known for producing hand crafted small batches of these spirits currently: whiskey, rum, gin, brandy.|$|R
50|$|Liqueur Muscat {{essentially}} {{starts out}} being a late harvest wine with the grapes {{allowed to stay}} on the vine till they are in a partially raisined state. The grapes are then pressed and go through partial fermentation where it is halted by the addition <b>grape</b> <b>spirits.</b> The wine is then aged in oak in a system resembling the Sherry solera system. Similar to Madeira, the wines are often exposed to high temperatures.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes and Muscat de Frontignan are all {{made from the}} white Muscat grape, whilst Banyuls and Maury are made from red Grenache. Regardless of the grape, {{fermentation}} is stopped {{by the addition of}} up to 10% of a 190 proof (95%) <b>grape</b> <b>spirit.</b> The Grenache vins doux naturels can be made in an oxidised or unoxidised style whereas the Muscat wines are protected from oxidation to retain their freshness.|$|R
25|$|Usually {{during this}} maceration, the {{fermentation}} process starts with ambient yeasts in the cellar. Often the wine will have fermented {{to the point}} where the <b>grape</b> <b>spirits</b> are added before maceration has ended and the wine is pressed off the skins, a process known as mutage sur grains. The added alcohol during maceration allows for more ethanol-soluble phenolics and flavor compounds to be extracted. After pressing, the wine is left to settle in concrete vats over the winter before it is racked into barrels or other containers.|$|R
2500|$|Absinthe is {{traditionally}} prepared from a distillation of neutral alcohol, various herbs, spices and water. Traditional absinthes were redistilled {{from a white}} <b>grape</b> <b>spirit</b> (or eau de vie), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes. The principal botanicals are grande wormwood, green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called [...] "the holy trinity." [...] Many other herbs {{may be used as}} well, such as petite wormwood (Artemisia pontica or Roman wormwood), hyssop, melissa, star anise, angelica, peppermint, coriander, and veronica.|$|R

40|$|The first {{initiator}} of {{the industrial}} activity was Antoni Ignacy Rostworowski who owned a cigarette and cigar manufacture, probably between 1860 and 1873. He closed the plant after becoming indebted at Jewish merchants from Lublin and Łęczna. His son, Antoni Jan, opened a mill, <b>spirit</b> <b>distillery</b> and dairy cooperative in Milejów and brick plant in Starościce. But the real impulse for economic development of Milejów was establishing in 1907 – 1908 the sugar refinery (registered as joint stock company), that employed 160 people. Establishing of the factory resulted in intensifying agriculture production (white beet plantations), cattle breeding (Dutch cows) and development of housing. The sugar company survived until 1935, when during the economic depression it was merged with Lublin sugar refinery...|$|R
25|$|The initial {{winemaking}} {{steps of}} Madeira start out {{like most other}} wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines – Bual and Malvasia – are often fermented on their skins to leach more phenols from the grapes to balance {{the sweetness of the}} wine. The more dry wines – made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole – are separated from their skins prior to fermentation. Depending on the level of sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral <b>grape</b> <b>spirits.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of vins doux naturels was perfected by Arnaud de Villeneuve at the University of Montpellier in the 13th century {{and they are}} now quite common in the Languedoc-Roussillon of southwest France. As the names suggest, Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes, Muscat de Frontignan, Muscat de Lunel, Muscat de Mireval and Muscat de St-Jean Minervois are all made from the white Muscat grape, whilst Banyuls and Maury are made from red Grenache. Regardless of the grape, fermentation is stopped with up to 10% of 95% <b>grape</b> <b>spirit.</b> The Muscats are made in a somewhat oxidised style, the Grenaches less so.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There were {{investigated}} <b>grape</b> marc <b>spirits</b> regarding their safety on consumers. Major volatile compounds which present risk {{to human health}} (such as methanol, furfural, and acetaldehyde) and ethyl alcohol content were compared to European Union Regulation and other values found in previous studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety of <b>grape</b> marc <b>spirits</b> considering their content in major volatile compounds by comparison {{with the requirements of}} European Union Regulation. We investigated the ethyl alcohol content by electronic densimetry and 10 major volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 2 -butanol, isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, amyl active alcohol and furfural) by Gas Chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector. We used reference chemicals to identify these compounds and 3 -pentanol as internal standard to quantify the volatiles. Results were compared with the requirements of European Union Regulation. All major volatile compounds registered values in accordance to EU Regulation and the <b>grape</b> pomace <b>spirits</b> samples do not present any kind of risk for consumption...|$|R

5000|$|Dafnes is an {{agricultural}} centre producing sultanas, <b>grapes,</b> wine, <b>spirits,</b> vegetables and olive oil. Since the 13th century {{it is known}} for its rich, sweet red [...] "Dafnes" [...] wines made from the Liatiko grape variety.|$|R
25|$|The {{style of}} {{winemaking}} {{that would become}} associated with Maury {{has its roots in}} the work of the Catalan alchemist and physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova. He perfected the technique of stopping fermentation with distilled alcohol in the late 13th century and was given an exclusive patent on the process by King James II of Majorca. In 1872, Roussillo politician François Aragon convinced the French government to legally recognize the style of vin doux naturels as wines which had residual sugar and sweetness retained from having their fermentation stopped with <b>grape</b> <b>spirits.</b> In 1936, the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) established Maury as an officially recognized AOC.|$|R
5000|$|Carcavelos {{can be a}} {{blend of}} up to nine {{different}} grapes. The principal grapes of the Carcavelos region includes Arinto, Boal, Galego Dourado, Negra Mole, Trincadeira and Torneiro [...] The wines are usually fermented completely dry with some fermenting must known as the vinho abafado containing some residual sugar set aside prior to the fermentation's completion. The wine is fortified with a distilled <b>grape</b> <b>spirit</b> to bring the wine up to an alcohol level of 18-20% and the vinho abafado is added back in to add sweetness to the wine. Carcavelos wines are then aged in oak barrels for {{three to five years}} to give the wines a tawny color and nutty flavor.|$|R
5000|$|During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), in {{addition}} to standard <b>spirits</b> the <b>distillery</b> produced [...] "Molotov cocktails" [...] for the war effort. The plant was severely damaged by a German bomb on July 22, 1941; despite heavy damage production continued. For contributions during the war the distillery was awarded the Banner of the State Defense Committee.|$|R
