The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and <b>is</b> <b>historically</b> notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E

5|$|Other {{important}} {{texts of}} Shaktism include the Shakta Upanishads, {{as well as}} Shakta-oriented Upa Puranic literature such as the Devi Purana and Kalika Purana, the Lalita Sahasranama (from the Brahmanda Purana). The Tripura Upanishad <b>is</b> <b>historically</b> the most complete introduction to Shakta Tantrism, distilling into its 16 verses almost every important topic in Shakta Tantra tradition. Along with the Tripura Upanishad, the Tripuratapini Upanishad has attracted scholarly bhasya (commentary) {{in the second half}} of 2nd-millennium, such as by Bhaskararaya, and by Ramanand. These texts link the Shakti Tantra tradition as a Vedic attribute, however this link has been contested by scholars.|$|E
5|$|The 1761 Milestone is a {{milestone}} on 640 South Main Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.

The complex is architecturally significant as an example of late-19th century and early 20th century industrial mill design being adapted for new industry. The American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.|$|E
