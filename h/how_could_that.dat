6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] cried Elizabeth; [...] "but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be? How could {{his will}} be disregarded? Why {{did you not}} seek legal redress?" ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. So {{much the}} better. He gets {{on my nerves}} after a while. (Pretending to forget himself.) <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> man have so {{beautiful}} a daughter! ...|$|E
60|$|Terror seized {{him while}} he looked, and, as George had done, he turned to fly. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> thing move its head? The head ought to fall off.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} my {{story in a}} moment of despicable weakness--of {{impulsive}} folly. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I dream <b>that</b> you would ever meet her? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I imagine <b>that</b> you would speak to her as you have done?" [...] He groaned, and began to creep giddily about the room in his misery. [...] "Oh, oh, oh! What shall I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I chose for {{you what}} I {{would have chosen}} for myself. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I know <b>that</b> you would have the spirit of my father in you? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I know <b>that</b> you would love what I hated?--if you really love to be a Jew." [...] The last words had such {{bitterness}} in them that any one overhearing might have supposed some hatred had arisen between the mother and son.|$|R
6000|$|Adam. Call it my care, and not {{mistrust of}} thee; Yet thou art weak, {{and full of}} art is he; Else <b>how</b> <b>could</b> he <b>that</b> host seduce to sin, Whose fall has left the heavenly nation thin? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But whose spirit? Whose?" [...] I persisted. [...] "When I am {{here alone}} in the garden, why, it is just peace. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be, if an evil spirit haunted here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure Sir Magnus {{will not}} care for our coming now. Besides, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be {{retiring}} into private life? Sir Magnus, as ambassador, has his house always full of company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The gods forbid!" [...] exclaimed Licinia in horror. [...] "And <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be?" [...] {{she added}} with a shrug of the shoulders, [...] "seeing that he died such a shameful death." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>could</b> I resist <b>that?</b> I {{put my hand}} on his shoulder, {{and tried}} to make him lift up his head and look at me.|$|R
5000|$|Play the part: Remember {{to be as}} you write, scholarly, literate, {{practically}} a god. You must understand that when you seem smart, when you seem to believe in yourself, others will do the same, because, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> someone <b>that</b> is so smart and so pompous be wrong? ...|$|R
6000|$|Out up then spake a bonny bird, [...] Sat high upon a tree,-- [...] <b>How</b> <b>could</b> {{you kill}} <b>that</b> noble lord? [...] "He came to marry thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To Woodstock Lodge, to {{look after}} my uncle's property," [...] {{answered}} Markham Everard: [...] "I am informed that soldiers have taken possession--Yet <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be if thou foundest the party drinking in Woodstock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{was that}} bit of pencil moved? The {{messages}} he ignored--they didn't matter--but the method of their production seemed to eliminate all trickery, conscious or unconscious. Why did his mother's left hand quiver--and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> writing shape itself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, poor child!" [...] said I; [...] "no {{doubt it}} must have been sick, and being a burden, has been left behind. But stay. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be {{possible}} if it was found between the camp and this village?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{is nothing}} of the sort, father. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> you think <b>that</b> I <b>could</b> do {{anything}} so foolish and wrong? Surely you must know me better than that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Leo. No more, lest I should chide you {{for your}} stay: Where have you been? and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> you suppose, <b>That</b> I <b>could</b> live these two long hours without you? ...|$|R
6000|$|CURTIS--[With {{a gesture}} of aversion.] I loathe this book-writing. It isn't my part, I realize now. But when I made the plans you speak of, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I know <b>that</b> then? ...|$|R
6000|$|But how {{was this}} aid to be procured? From the {{surgeons}} of the French fleet, which probably still {{lay in the}} bay of Nukuheva, it might easily have been obtained, could I have made my case known to them. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be effected? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For twenty years!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Oh, Jack, {{you must}} be wrong; for <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be? I was only {{eighteen}} when all this happened. How could my real father have been twenty years away from me, when I was only eighteen, and I remember him so perfectly?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ferrars {{caught her}} meaning, {{and the next}} moment had leaped over the gutter, and splashed into the water meadow, but in utter {{hopelessness}} of being beforehand with the runaway steed! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> gate be other than fatal? The horse was nearing it--the pursuer far behind--Mr. Ferrars not half way over the fields.|$|E
6000|$|Mel. Out upon him, how he looks, madam! now he's {{found no}} prince, {{he is the}} strangest figure of a man; <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I make <b>that</b> coup d'etourdi to think him one? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And it was you," [...] she cried, [...] "who {{spoke to}} me from the tower! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I dream <b>that</b> my beloved Virginian lay behind that fierce beard and that yellow skin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fault was {{not exactly}} mine," [...] he said, with a faint {{hoarseness}} in his voice. [...] "For one thing, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I know <b>that</b> you would be pleased to see me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Braid-Beard, {{waving his}} pipe, {{this thing is}} just as I say. Imbedded in amber, do we not find little fishes' fins, porpoise- teeth, sea-gulls' beaks and claws; nay, butterflies' wings, and {{sometimes}} a topaz? And <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be, unless the substance was first soft? Amber is gold-fishes' brains, I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|Certainly, {{whether you}} think this true or not, St. John thought it true; for he says so most {{positively}} in the text. He says that the Life was manifested--showed plainly upon earth, {{and that he had}} seen it. And he says that he saw it in a man, whom his eyes had seen, and his hands had handled. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he exclaimed; {{on which}} she saw how much, how hopelessly he was afraid. She had {{supposed}} at the caf√© that it was of his rebellion, of his gathering motive; but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be when his temptations--that temptation for example of the train they had just lost--were after all so slight? Mrs. Wix was right. He was afraid of his weakness--of his weakness.|$|E
6000|$|WILLIS: 'And {{keep his}} watch? I don't see <b>how</b> you <b>could</b> manage <b>that.</b> What {{would you do}} with the watch? You might sell it, of course--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that all, my dear Henry? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> {{you suppose}} <b>that</b> {{my first thought}} would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Empress Dowager Cixi once {{complained about}} Lady Alute:"We {{made a mistake}} in {{selecting}} a wife for him. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> we tell <b>that</b> her beauty was false? She was very beautiful, but she hated us." ...|$|R
60|$|My father enacted that {{he should}} be treated as usual. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be when papa himself did not know how changed were his own ways from his kindly {{paternal}} air of confidence? All trust had been undermined, so that Clarence could not cross the threshold without being required to state his object, and, if he overstayed the time calculated, he was cross-examined, and his replies received with a sigh of doubt.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of it, but why not?" [...] asked Leo quietly. [...] "Do you {{remember}} a certain scene in the Caves of Kor yonder, when the living looked upon the dead, and dead and living were the same? And {{do you remember what}} Ayesha swore, that she would come again--yes, to this world; and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be except by re-birth, or, what is the same thing, by the transmigration of the spirit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Clara {{felt very}} uncomfortable. The awful thought had come upon {{her that this}} ambassadress {{had come to her}} as a proxy with a {{proposal}} of marriage. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>that</b> be? She had not spoken more than three or four times with her nephew, and knew nothing more of him than he had told her on the evening before. It was impossible, then. And yet what could his aunt mean by this discussion of his private affairs? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me dear," [...] {{replied the}} O'Kelly, {{throwing}} up his part with promptness and satisfaction, [...] "how could ye expect it? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> he believe <b>that</b> any man <b>could</b> look at ye and hate ye?" ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> she {{contrive}} <b>that</b> {{it should}} be so? That conversation with her mother had taken place on the day preceding the party, and Lady de Courcy had repeated it with dismay to Margaretta.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't," [...] {{declared}} Sproatly with {{a decision}} which carried conviction with it. [...] "I certainly saw them at the hotel, but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> I imagine <b>that</b> they had anything of the kind in view?" ...|$|R
