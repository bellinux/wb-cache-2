5|$|The Australian Government is {{planning}} to sell the Hornets and associated spare parts after the type is retired from RAAF service. In August 2017 the Canadian Government initiated discussions to purchase a number of Australian F/A-18s to augment the Royal Canadian Air Force's fleet of similar McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornets {{in the event that}} a planned purchase of Super Hornets does not proceed. A Canadian delegation also visited Australia that month to inspect RAAF Hornets. An article in Australian Aviation stated that it is unclear whether Canada would use the aircraft operationally or as a source of spare parts. The Canadian Government lodged a formal <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to purchase Australian F/A-18s on 29 September 2017. A response from the Australian Government is expected by the end of 2017.|$|E

500|$|On May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to {{mark the}} arrival of the communityâ€™s final homesteader. Accompanying her on the trip was the wife of Henry Morgenthau, Jr., the president's Secretary of the Treasury. [...] "I am no believer in paternalism. I do not like charities," [...] she had said earlier. But {{cooperative}} communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to [...] "our rather settled ideas" [...] that could [...] "provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [...] in the future." [...] Residents were so taken by her personal <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor. (The new town name, Norvelt, was a combination of the last syllables in her names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.) The Norvelt firefighter's hall is also named Roosevelt Hall in honor of her.|$|E
