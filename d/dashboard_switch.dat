25|$|The latter {{company also}} carried out {{modifications}} to many FTOs {{during the period}} in which they were imported to the UK via that company, based at King Street in Dudley. These included installation of an aftermarket rear fog-light and its illuminated <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch</b> to meet UK legislation (Not OEM, or a requirement in Japan). The Company may also have fitted an 'English' text version of fuse box cover in the engine bay, and/or a RalliArt oil cap.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the model year, all Eagles carried over the new-for-1980 permanent all-wheel drive system with viscous fluid coupling that protected the suspension or driveline components from wear during dry pavement use. A [...] "Select Drive" [...] option, which allowed the Eagle to run in two-wheel-drive (RWD) mode and be switched to four-wheel-drive via a <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch,</b> was offered as a fuel economy measure at midyear. Select Drive required the vehicle to be stationary when switching between two-wheel and four-wheel-drive.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: AMC Eagle's [...] "Shift on the Fly" [...] <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch</b> mounted {{near the}} {{steering}} column ...|$|E
50|$|The car's {{interior}} had its secondary <b>dashboard</b> <b>switches</b> {{illuminated by}} a central bulb with fibre optic distrubtion to the switches.|$|R
50|$|New {{seats were}} fitted which allowed the fitment of head restraints, as {{required}} by U.S. law beginning in 1969. The interior and dashboard were also redesigned; rocker switches that met US health and safety regulations were substituted for toggle <b>switches.</b> The <b>dashboard</b> <b>switches</b> also lost their symmetrical layout.|$|R
5000|$|Air {{controls}} can {{be installed}} as floor mounted levers or <b>dashboard</b> mounted <b>switches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 a <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch</b> was {{provided}} for the heated rear window, which had previously remained [...] "on" [...] {{as long as the}} ignition was on, leading to instances of flat batteries.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, a {{sequential}} transmission {{was made}} {{available in the}} GTvi version only from 2002. This was an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission with sequential mode activated by a <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch,</b> then gear selection by buttons on the steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|The SEAT Salsa was {{described}} as a Multi Driving concept car, because its driver could select through a <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch</b> several driving modes (sport, comfort, city) thus modifying not only the engine and the gearbox parameters but also the driving position, the interior lighting or even the layout of the dashboard.|$|E
5000|$|A padded <b>dashboard,</b> {{deformable}} <b>switches</b> and controls, and a four-spoke {{steering wheel}} with impact absorber and broad impact cushion aimed to reduce occupant injury during collisions.|$|R
2500|$|In 1978 {{the revised}} Series 2 (or S2) Esprit was introduced. External changes {{included}} intake and cooling ducts added behind the rear quarter windows, taillights from the Rover SD1, and an integrated front spoiler. S2 Esprits also had [...] Speedline alloy wheels designed by Lotus. Other changes included relocating the battery from above {{the right side}} fuel tank under the rear quarter window {{to the rear of}} the car, adding an access door to the engine cover, installing wider seats and replacing the Veglia instrument cluster with individual gauges made by Smiths and a new style of illuminated <b>dashboard</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Electric {{controls}} {{are the most}} expensive and only come as <b>dashboard</b> mounted <b>switches.</b> The disadvantage of these systems, is that the control is either on or off, and thus controlling the load by feathering is not an option.|$|R

50|$|Hutchison {{himself had}} a {{limousine}} custom-built in May 1908 to showcase {{the latest in}} automotive electrical technology. The Witherbee Igniter Company installed storage batteries that could be recharged from an on-board generator, or by plugging into a light socket. The car was equipped with three Klaxon horns and an external speaker to warn other traffic. An intercom similar to the dictograph allowed passengers {{to talk with the}} chauffeur. Many of the novel innovations in his vehicle are standard equipment today. Besides headlights with a <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch,</b> interior lamps lit automatically when doors were opened. The dashboard included lighted gauges, and alarms to indicate dangerous conditions. The car featured audible and visual back-up warning mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|Automotive - direct part marking with text, graphics, {{bar codes}} and data matrix codes; laser welding, laser marking and engraving, {{resistance}} welding, and hot bar reflow soldering of sensors, <b>switches,</b> <b>dashboard</b> electronics, lighting components, and brake shoes.|$|R
50|$|A {{combination}} {{steering lock}} and ignition key was fitted to the steering column, which replaced the <b>dashboard</b> mounted ignition <b>switch</b> and charismatic push button starter. A new steering column was {{fitted with a}} collapsible section {{in the event of}} an accident.|$|R
50|$|Electrically engaged {{overdrive}} gearboxes were an available {{option on}} all MGBs. The overdrive unit was operational in {{third and fourth}} gears (until 1977, when overdrive was only operational in fourth) but the overall ratio in third gear overdrive was roughly the same as fourth gear direct. The overdrive unit was engaged by a toggle switch located on the <b>dashboard.</b> The <b>switch</b> {{was moved to the}} top of the gearshift knob in 1977. Overdrives were fitted to less than 20% of all MGBs.|$|R
5000|$|The Suburban {{was offered}} {{with the choice}} of either a 5.7-liter Vortec V8, {{producing}} [...] and 447 Nm of torque, or a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 outputting [...] and 583 Nm. The former choice was designated the [...] "1500" [...] name, while the turbodiesel saw the [...] "2500" [...] identify. The 5.7-liter petrol engine is LPG-compatible, and such systems can be retrofitted if desired. Regardless of the engine specified, the car was equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission. However, what differed {{was the type of}} transmission. Petrol motors were fitted with the GM 4L60-E transmission, with the GM 4L80-E reserved for the diesel. A <b>dashboard</b> <b>switch</b> allows the vehicle to power all four wheels simultaneously, or just the rear wheels, and even allows for the low range gearing to instigate.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the Wilson, these {{clutches}} {{were controlled}} by a simple <b>dashboard</b> or column-mounted <b>switch,</b> described as [...] "a cherry on a cocktail stick", and relays. There was no mechanical servo action, so {{no need for the}} Wilson's cam or toggle arrangements and the change gear pedal.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, TSheets {{released}} the TSheets Accountant View — a TSheets account functionality {{available only to}} TSheets PROs. Accountant View allows accountants to view their clients’ TSheets accounts in a simple <b>dashboard.</b> Accountants can <b>switch</b> {{back and forth between}} client accounts without having to log in and out of each account individually.|$|R
50|$|The Limousine {{was based}} on the floorpan of Jaguar's 420G {{flagship}} (not {{to be confused with the}} smaller Jaguar 420), but with a wheelbase extended an extra 21 in. The frontal styling was similar to the original Daimler Sovereign, with the Jaguar four-headlight treatment first seen on the 420G's predecessor, the Mark X, mated to a Daimler radiator grill bearing the traditional fluting. Jaguar Mark X/420G underpinnings were also apparent from the twin ten gallon fuel tanks set in each of the rear wings, each with its own electric SU pump selected by a <b>dashboard</b> mounted <b>switch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Next {{came the}} SL-Class 230 SL, a new design with a 2.3-litre {{mechanically}} fuel injected six cylinder engine. It featured a low waistline and big curved greenhouse windows, and a Coupe Roadster with detachable hardtop, whose distinctive roofline earned the nickname [...] "pagoda top." [...] The design was by Paul Bracq. Around 1967, the engine received a displacement increase {{and the model}} {{became known as the}} 250 SL. Within a year the engine displacement was increased for the final time and the model designation became 280 SL. Beginning with later versions of the 250 SL changes were made to <b>dashboard</b> padding, <b>switches</b> and knobs, door pockets (US models only) and steering wheel. In addition, on the 230 SL formerly separate centre hub caps and wheel trim rings became full wheel covers.|$|R
50|$|For the 1968 {{model year}} the entire line was updated {{with a new}} body {{featuring}} a taller integrated windshield with an integrated rear-view mirror, a padded <b>dashboard</b> with non-toggle <b>switches,</b> built-in headrests, and lifting door handles. This version was first shown at the 14th Tokyo Motor Show in October 1967 and {{was developed to meet}} the new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In the US the engines were also fitted with new emissions controls, and the lesser 1600 continued as a companion model through the end of production. Australia had no such emission controls.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was sold}} in Europe from 1979 to 1982, when {{production}} ended. There was only one model change, when <b>dashboard</b> and column <b>switches</b> were modified in January 1980. With demand always outstripping supply, British importer Heron Suzuki sold 4696 SC100s in Britain, where the car has since then gained minor classic status. Nimag sold 3290 SC100s in the Netherlands, while the 1299 remaining cars were delivered to New Zealand, South Africa, and Latin America. This production includes the Chilean SS80 version. As of mid 2014, there were 96 [...] "Whizzkids" [...] registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in the UK.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous <b>dashboards</b> hid the <b>switches</b> in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{revision}} of the third-generation Legacy, introduced during 2001, made several important but subtle changes {{to the front of}} the car. The fenders, grille, and headlights were altered slightly, making interchangeability with A-C type impossible. The headlights in the Japanese market kept using HID bulbs as in previous years, but the shape on the headlight was altered slightly. The grille was made slightly taller than the A-C models, and the shape of the bumper around the grille was altered slightly to accommodate a lower joint where the hood and bumper meet. Consistent with previous models, the HID headlights had a <b>dashboard</b> mounted adjustment <b>switch</b> that allowed the driver to re-aim the headlights to reduce glare to approaching traffic, although the switches were altered slightly internally to adjust for the increase in power needed to adjust the new style headlights. The bonnet became a lighter aluminum alloy, similar to that available on the STI's at the time. Compression and timing changed in order to further reduce the effect of loss of boost during the switch over from the primary to secondary stages. The ECU also got an upgrade, it is now tunable by the manufacturer or third party tuning workshops. Additional optional extras were offered upon purchase including but not limited to; a new body kit, head light surrounds, and 4-pot brakes - the stock wheels were designed to accommodate this upgrade. The D-Type Legacy is Subaru's best shot at the sequential twin turbo engine besides the STI revision.|$|R
