40|$|Literature {{about the}} {{psychological}} consequences of stroke in those under 65 is reviewed focussing on services and work. Despite similarities, {{young and old}} survivors have different experiences and needs. These are attributable {{to the effects of}} stroke on age-normative roles and activities, self-image, and the young person’s stage in the life-cycle, especially family and work. “Hidden” cognitive impairments, a disrupted sense of self, and the incongruity of suffering an “older person’s” disease are salient. Young survivors benefit from services, but experience lack of congruence between their needs and service philosophy,methods, and aims, and consequently have unmet needs. Employment is psychologically salient, and the evidence about return rates, factors that affect return, and the adequacy of <b>employment-related</b> <b>service</b> provision is reviewed. Specific and general recommendations are made for increasing congruence between young survivors’ needs and service provision and also for facilitating their return to work...|$|E

50|$|After World War I, many {{veterans}} {{returned to}} Canada with disabilities due to war injuries, and had difficulty re-integrating into society. The {{needs of these}} veterans gave rise to disability advocacy organisations such as War Amps, which fought for the need for services like rehabilitation, training in sheltered workshops, and other <b>employment-related</b> <b>services.</b> A disparity formed between the status of veterans with disabilities and that of civilians with disabilities, which would continue to widen until after World War II.

30|$|Federal/state {{vocational}} rehabilitation (VR) agencies provide rehabilitation and <b>employment-related</b> <b>services</b> to individuals with significant disabilities with vocational goals. Each state has either {{one or two}} VR agencies, and in 2010, more than 1.4 million individuals received services from VR agencies (U.S. Department of Education 2012). When demand exceeds available funding, VR agencies must ration services, either by making qualified applicants wait or, in some instances, not providing services at all. Often, agencies provide services on a first-come, first-served basis. But, when agencies are severely financially constrained, they operate in an order of selection (OOS) status, meaning that they have developed a service delivery plan that prioritizes services based on applicant need and had that plan approved by the Department of Education (Silverstein 2010). Operating in OOS is not uncommon; 41 of the 72 state VR agencies we consider in our analysis reported being in OOS during {{at least one year}} from fiscal year 2002 through 2005.|$|R

In spite of nearly two decades of ANC rule, local economic development options remain limited.

The project has been something of a departure for how NGOs attempt to tackle systemic economic problems in the region and, if successful, might point towards a more inclusive model for improving the delivery of aid through intentional learning processes. Here we present findings based primarily on a series of interviews with community members involved in the project.

40|$|This paper uses an econometric {{framework}} {{introduced by}} Athey and Imbens (2003) to esti-mate {{the effect of}} a treatment on the entire employment distribution of a program that provides <b>employment-related</b> <b>services</b> to disadvantaged individuals when they leave welfare for jobs. To explore {{the effect of a}} treatment program, the entire counterfactual distribution of employment duration that would have occurred in the absence of treatment is estimated using a nonlinear DID methodology that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity. To test the estimator, I use simulated data and I apply the estimator to a subsample from a social experiment, the National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW). The results obtained on the simulated data show that the estimator is able to account for the differences in unobserved heterogeneity between the control and treatment groups. When applied to the NSW data, it shows that the estimated measure of the treatment effect is significantly different than the observed measure of the treat-ment effect. This result {{can be explained by the}} differences in the response rates between the control group and the treatment group, differences that cannot be captured by the observed average measure of treatment effect. ∗I am very grateful to Tiemen Woutersen for the stimulating suggestions and for encouraging me to work on this project, and to Lance Lochner and Chris Robinson for very helpful comments...|$|R

40|$|Far {{too many}} of the young people who age out of foster care in Illinois fare poorly in the labor market during their {{transition}} to adulthood. Since the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program was created in 1999, it has been providing states with funds to help foster youth making the transition to adulthood achieve self-sufficiency. A major purpose of the program is to ensure that youth who remain in foster care until age 18 or older "receive the education, training and services necessary to obtain employment. " Unfortunately, the limited research that has been done on young adults who "aged out" of foster care has found that their labor market outcomes are generally quite poor. This study describes what Illinois young people told us about their current and prior participation in the labor force, including work-related training or services they received. Throughout the report, we make comparisons between the young people who were under the care and supervision of the juvenile court in Cook County (hereafter referred to as the Cook County sample), and the young people who were under the care and supervision of juvenile courts in other counties (hereafter referred to as the Other Counties sample). Although most had some work experience, they had difficulty staying employed. Moreover, {{despite the fact that the}} percentage of young people who were working was greater than the percentage who were not, most of those who were employed were not working at a job that paid a living wage.

These briefs are consistent with and reflect the overarching goal of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) — to develop a seamless workforce investment system that includes multiple agencies and programs. The series includes briefs on the One-Stop Career Centers established under Title I of the WIA and the one disability-related mandatory partner participating in the workforce investment system (vocational rehabilitation agencies). In addition, the series includes <b>employment-related</b> <b>services</b> and supports provided by other federal, state, and local agencies and programs serving people with significant disabilities, including Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Special Education. Further, the series explains the potential role the Medicaid program can play in supporting employment and the work incentive provisions in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, and describes the Ticket to Work Program operated by the Social Security Administration. Each brief provides information on the purpose of the program, eligibility for benefits or services, funding sources, administrative structure, and resources provided to support jobseekers and employers. Further, the briefs provide considerations for assessing the respective programs in each state and suggestions for the development of collaborative relationships. The concepts and strategies of Customized Employment—a dynamic set of assessment and job development tools—will be used to contextualize the collaborative strategies discussed in each brief. Most importantly, the briefs show that no agency is alone or limited to their own resources in serving people with significant disabilities; this series should be used as a source for the basic information upon which cross-system partnerships are built. Collaborative relationships between One-Stop Career Centers, Vocational Rehabilitation, community provider organizations, and other systems that provide benefits and services will create new employment opportunities for people with significant disabilities...|$|R
40|$|The New York WORKS {{demonstration}} project {{was designed to}} improve employment outcomes for persons with psychiatric disabilities receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability payments. This article shows how the individual characteristics of participants were related to outcomes at each stage of the multistage recruitment process used in the project and how those characteristics contributed to enrollment. The findings are important to program administrators {{who are interested in}} ensuring that SSI recipients receive equal access to <b>employment-related</b> <b>services</b> and who want to improve recruitment strategies for future {{demonstration project}}s. The New York WORKS recruitment process used administrative records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify the population of over 68, 000 SSI recipients with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disability in Erie County and New York City. Staff involved in the project documented the results of each stage of the recruitment process. The New York WORKS project included four stages: (1) the provision of information (sending a letter and information packet); (2) demonstrated awareness of the project (response to a letter containing an overview of the project); (3) expression of interest (indication of interest in the project, using a postmarked form returned to New York WORKS project staff); and (4) participation (actual enrollment in the program). The project staff members were also able to identify data from administrative records that described the characteristics of the population, including age, sex, type of psychiatric diagnosis, the number of months that the person collected benefits before the recruitment process, employment experience before the recruitment process, and annual earnings in the year before the recruitment process. The data on outcomes at each stage of the recruitment process and the characteristics of SSI recipients were analyzed using an empirical method recently suggested by Heckman and Smith. The analysis identified the relationship between the characteristics of SSI recipients and the outcomes at each stage of the recruitment process and demonstrated how those characteristics contributed to the overall likelihood of enrollment.
