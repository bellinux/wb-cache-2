50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{are most}} {{abundant}} in open forest stands with little understory vegetation; {{they are not}} found in stands with dense undergrowth. Ideal habitat is small stands of large trees interspersed with agricultural land. The size and spacing of pines and oaks are among the important features of <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> habitat. The actual species of pines and oaks themselves {{may not always be}} a major consideration in defining <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> habitat. <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> are often observed foraging on the ground several hundred meters from the nearest woodlot. <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> also commonly occupy forest edge habitat.|$|R
5000|$|Relatively few natural predators can {{regularly}} capture adult <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels.</b> Of these predators, most {{only take}} <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> opportunistically. <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> predators include: bobcats (Felis rufus), foxes (Vulpes spp. and Urocyon spp.), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), barred owls (Strix varia), and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Nestlings and young <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{are particularly vulnerable}} to climbing predators such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta), and pine snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus). In those states where <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> are not protected, they are considered a game animal. [...] <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> were {{an important source of}} meat for European settlers in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are still hunted over most of their range, typically more for trophy than for food. Overharvest by hunting has been reported from small woodlots and public shooting areas in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.|$|R
50|$|Food {{habits of}} <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> depend largely on {{geographic}} location. In general, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> foods include mast, tree buds, insects, tubers, bulbs, roots, bird eggs, seeds of pines and spring-fruiting trees, and fungi. Agricultural {{crops such as}} corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, and fruit are also eaten. Mast eaten by <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> commonly includes turkey oak (Quercus laevis), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), post oak (Quercus stellata), and live oak (Quercus virginiana).|$|R
50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>{{squirrels}}</b> in Ohio prefer hickory nuts, acorns, corn, {{and black}} walnuts. The squirrels are absent where {{two or more}} of these mast trees are missing. <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> also eat buckeyes, seeds and buds of maple and elm, hazelnuts (Corylus spp.), blackberries (Rubus spp.), and tree bark. In March, they feed mainly on buds and seeds of elm, maple, and willow. In Ohio, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> have the following order of food preference: white oak (Quercus alba) acorns, black oak (Quercus velutina) acorns, red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns, walnuts, and corn.|$|R
40|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Sciurus niger) {{was first}} {{introduced}} to Los Angeles in 1904. Since that time, this species has spread throughout many of the urban and suburban areas of Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange Counties. In this paper we document that the <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> can replace the western gray squirrel within a particular habitat {{in a short period}} of time...|$|R
50|$|In <b>eastern</b> Texas, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{prefer the}} acorns of bluejack oak, pecans, {{southern}} red oak (Q. falcata), and overcup oak (Q. lyrata). The least preferred foods are acorns of swamp chestnut oak (Q. michauxii) and overcup oak. In California, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> feed on English walnuts (J. regia), oranges, avocados, strawberries, and tomatoes. In midwinter, they feed on eucalyptus seeds.|$|R

50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> use leaf nests or tree {{cavities}} {{for shelter}} and litter rearing. Forest stands dominated by mature to over mature trees provide cavities and {{a sufficient number}} of sites for leaf nests to meet the cover requirements. Overstory trees with an average d.b.h. of 15 in or more generally provide adequate cover and reproductive habitat. Optimum tree canopy closure for <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> is from 20% to 60%. Optimum conditions understory closure occur when the shrub-crown closure is 30% or less.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{have two}} types of shelters: leaf nests (dreys) and tree dens. They may have two tree cavity homes or a tree cavity and a leaf nest. Tree dens are {{preferred}} over leaf nests during the winter and for raising young. When den trees are scarce, leaf nests are used year-round. Leaf nests are built {{during the summer months}} in forks of deciduous trees about 30 feet (9 m) above the ground. <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> use natural cavities and crotches (forked branches of a tree) as tree dens. Den trees in Ohio had an average diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of 21 in and were an average of 58.6 yd from the nearest woodland border. About 88% of den trees in eastern Texas had an average d.b.h. of 12 in or more. Dens are usually 6 in wide and 14 - 16 in inches deep. Den openings are generally circular and about 2.9 to 3.7 in. <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> may make their own den in a hollow tree by cutting through the interior; however, they generally use natural cavities or cavities created by northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) or red-headed woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus). Crow nests have also been used by <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Species foundThe most {{abundant}} species is the white-footed mouse. Other mammals found include, the common raccoon, northern short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossum, meadow vole, woodchuck, red <b>squirrel,</b> <b>eastern</b> mole, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and the white-tailed deer ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>fox</b> <b>{{squirrel}}</b> (Sciurus niger), {{also known}} as the <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> or Bryant's <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel,</b> is the largest species of tree squirrel native to North America. Despite the differences in size and coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for American red squirrels or eastern gray squirrels in areas where the species co-exist.|$|R
50|$|Species foundThe white-footed mouse, {{northern}} short-tailed shrews, two eastern gray squirrels, eastern chipmunk, {{and southern}} flying squirrel. Sign {{may be seen}} of white-tailed deer; eastern chipmunk and <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel,</b> <b>eastern</b> mole, <b>eastern</b> gray <b>squirrel,</b> gray <b>fox,</b> long-tailed weasel, and eastern skunk.|$|R
40|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel,</b> {{native to}} the eastern and midwestern United States, was {{recently}} documented in the Sonoran Desert {{in the vicinity of}} Yuma, Arizona, constituting the first state record for this species. We surveyed the people of Yuma to determine when and how the squirrels arrived. The squirrels were first observed in the 1960 s, but may have been resident for a longer period. Since the 1960 s, squirrels have spread throughout the city limits and extended south similar to 15 km into Somerton, Arizona. How the squirrels arrived is not clear, but must be the result of an introduction, as no nearby populations exist. The persistence of <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> in this unique habitat is due to synanthropic relationships...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{the spread}} and {{distribution}} of introduced species in an area can be challenging due {{to a variety of}} issues. Range expansion may exceed expected rates if the area of introduction is more suitable than expected, and may be slowed by an area in which it is difficult to establish a population. The species of interest in this study is the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel</b> (Sciurus niger rufiventer) and the focus of the study is the spread of the species in Southern California. Previous studies have shown a steady and continuous spread from main points of introduction in Southern California and the species is now considered well established in the Los Angeles area. In this study, we collect, display, and discuss the spread of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel</b> in this area from 2005 through 2014 and include habitat suitability models to predict the future distribution of the species over time. Results show that the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel</b> has spread east into Rancho Cucamonga, into southern portions of Irvine, and has maintained isolated populations in places such as San Diego and Riverside. Our models suggest future paths of movement for contiguous range expansion. Suggestions for species mitigation include controlling initial introductions of the species into new areas, and informing the public about continued spread of the species...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{distributions}} {{are constantly}} changing. Some distributional shifts reflect habitat change, climate change, and human transplantations; thus, such shifts {{are due to}} actual expansions or contractions of populations. However, other species ranges that appear to shift {{as the result of}} new records being added to known distributional limits actually might reflect populations that previously were undetected {{due to a lack of}} past surveys or species that are difficult to detect. In 2013, multiple techniques were employed to document mammalian distributional records in southwestern Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma. We discovered three new county records in Morton County, Kansas (Crawford’s Desert Shrew, Notiosorex crawfordi; American Beaver, Castor canadensis; and <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel,</b> Sciurus niger), with Crawford’s Desert Shrew also representing the first records of the species in Kansas. We documented five new county records in Cimarron County, Oklahoma (Least Shrew, Cryptotis parva; American Parastrelle, Parastrellus hesperus; Wapiti, Cervus canadensis; White-tailed Deer, Odocoileus virginianus; and <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel,</b> Sciurus niger). The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel</b> and Least Shrew likely are expanding their distribution in this region along the Cimarron River, whereas the Wapiti, White-tailed Deer, and American Beaver likely are recolonizing the area after extirpation during the last century. Occurrence of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrels</b> in Elkhart, Kansas, and Boise City, Oklahoma, might represent human introductions. The American Parastrelle and Crawford’s Desert Shrew likely have gone undetected at those sites and have not recently experienced range expansions. Our results demonstrate the importance of continued surveys using various methods to document mammals. Both counties have been intensively surveyed for mammals, indicating that targeted surveys and various techniques are important to document distributional shifts as well as rare or difficult to capture species. Understanding the species present in an area is requisite for managing habitats and wildlife and will allow biologists to better elucidate future changes in distributions...|$|R
50|$|In captivity, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{have been}} known to live 18 years, but in the wild most <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> die before they become adults. Their maximum life {{expectancy}} is typically 12.6 years for females and 8.6 years for males. Because of overhunting and the destruction of mature forests, many subspecies of <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> (the Delmarva <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> for example) are endangered. Another major cause of <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> population decline is mange mite (Cnemidoptes sp.) along with severe winter weather.|$|R
50|$|Species foundThe white-footed mouse is {{very common}} with raccoons; {{northern}} short-tailed shrews; eastern chipmunks; Virginia opossum, masked shrew, meadow vole, woodchuck, and <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel.</b> White-tailed deer and chipmunks are also found. There is evidence of red squirrels, eastern moles, domestic dog, eastern cottontail, meadow vole, woodchuck, and meadow vole.|$|R
50|$|Species foundThe white-footed mouse, {{northern}} short-tailed shrews, eastern gray squirrels, eastern chipmunk, and {{a southern}} flying squirrel. Signs were seen for white-tailed deer {{were recorded in}} three plots; eastern chipmunk and <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> and <b>eastern</b> mole, <b>eastern</b> gray <b>squirrel,</b> gray <b>fox,</b> long-tailed weasel, and eastern raccoons, and eastern cottontail.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{come into}} estrus in mid-December or early January then again in June. They {{normally}} produce two litters a year, however, yearling females may only produce one. Females become sexually mature at 10 to 11 {{months of age}} and usually produce their first litter when they are a year old.|$|R
5000|$|The Delmarva <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> {{also known}} as the <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> or Sciurus niger cinereus, was an {{endangered}} subspecies of <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel.</b> Its historical range included the Delmarva Peninsula, southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, but its natural occurrence is now limited to parts of the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia. In these areas the Delmarva <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel's</b> habitat has been degraded and its survivability rates have decreased. It has, however, been successfully reintroduced in other parts of its historical range.|$|R
50|$|Species foundThe mammals of this habitat are {{the eastern}} cottontail and the white-tailed deer. Other mammals include the meadow vole, woodchuck and the prairie deer mouse. They {{are common in}} areas with {{the least amount of}} ground cover.

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the distribution of lowland and otherwise isolated populations of the western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) in the Los Angeles area of southern California, an area that has experienced a recent and ongoing invasion by the non-native <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Sciurus niger), an urban-adapted species introduced a century ago. Away from its strongholds in the western Santa Monica Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, and Santa Ana Mountains, the western gray squirrel is resident locally in both the Santa Susana and the Verdugo Mountains, in Griffith Park, in low hills at the eastern periphery of the San Gabriel Valley and in Claremont, and along the Santa Ana River canyon near Yorba Linda. It also persists east of the Los Angeles area in residential areas of Redlands and Yucaipa, which as of 2014 are still outside the range of the <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel.</b> Here we document several gray squirrel extirpation events within its lowland range, and discuss factors influencing its persistence and its extirpation...|$|R
50|$|In Illinois, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{rely heavily}} on hickories from late August through September. Pecans, black walnuts (Juglans nigra), osage orange (Maclura pomifera) fruits, and corn are also {{important}} fall foods. In early spring, elm buds and seeds {{are the most important}} food. In May and June, mulberries (Morus spp.) are heavily used. By early summer, corn in the milk stage becomes a primary food.|$|R
50|$|Species foundThe meadow voles and shrews {{reflect the}} former fields {{rather than the}} current shrubs. In the woody {{vegetation}} there is a range of animals from small to large including meadow voles, short-tailed shrews, white-footed mice, raccoons, masked shrew. prairie deer mouse, prairie vole, and meadow jumping mouse. Signs of white-tailed deer, eastern cottontail, <b>eastern</b> chipmunk, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel,</b> domestic dog, and red fox were found.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} in Kansas, osage orange is a staple item {{supplemented}} with seeds of the Kentucky coffee tree (Gymnocladus dioicus) and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), corn, wheat, eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides var. deltoides) bark, ash seeds, and eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) berries. In the spring, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> feed primarily on buds of elm, maple, and oaks but also on newly sprouting leaves and insect larvae.|$|R
50|$|The {{nuts are}} food for many rodents {{and make up}} to 10% of the diet of <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels.</b> The nuts are also eaten by species of birds. The leaves are browsed by white tailed deer, {{although}} {{they are not a}} preferred food. Squirrels benefit this species by distributing and burying the seeds; if the seeds are not reclaimed by the squirrel, they will germinate and help disperse the species.|$|R
50|$|Tree {{squirrels}} develop slowly {{compared to}} other rodents. At birth, the young are blind, without fur and helpless. Eyes open at 4 to 5 weeks of age and ears open at 6 weeks. <b>Eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> are weaned between 12 and 14 weeks but may not be self-supporting until 16 weeks. Juveniles usually disperse in September or October, but may den either together or with their mother during their first winter.|$|R
40|$|Continued range {{expansion}} of introduced <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus niger) {{in the western}} United States could lead to widespread damage to agricultural crops, facility infrastructures, and displacement of the native western gray squirrel (S. griseus). Because traditional managment alternatives may not be feasible in many areas, public interest {{in the use of}} immunocontraceptive to control local populations has increased. We evaluated the efficacy of GonaCon TM immunocontraceptive vaccine for controlling <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> reproduction in Davis, California. We administered GonaCon to 33 male and 26 female <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels,</b> and a control substance to 33 males and 24 females. We subsequently compared the reproductive status, health, and serum concentrations of testosterone and progesterone of our treated and control populations. In our treated population, we also measured serum concentrations of antibodies to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). To determine potential side effects of the vaccine, we recorded body weight and body condition of all animals, examined injection sites during each recapture, and observed the treated squirrels in the field for signs of discomfort and impaired mobility. Over 17 months, none of the recaptured GonaCon-treated females (n¼ 20) reproduced, compared to 12 of 15 control females. Treated males and females developed sufficient antibodies to GnRH to suppress reproduction, suggesting that GonaCon {{has the potential to be}} 100...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel</b> (Sciurus niger) {{has been}} {{introduced}} to many areas within California. Over time, the <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> has expanded its geographic range and has displaced the native Western Gray Squirrel (Sciurus griseus) in many urban/suburban habitats.

40|$|To {{determine}} habitat {{characteristics that}} influence Sciurus niger (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrel)</b> abundance and distribution within a suburban/urban landscape in the midwestern United States, I documented the density and placement of <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> leaf nests in 20 woodlots in the Indianapolis metropolitan area, Marion County, IN. The woodlots varied in size (0. 94 to 19. 5 ha), approximate age, shape, {{and degree of}} isolation from other woodlots and suitable squirrel habitat in the surrounding area. Only 8. 0 % of nests were located in a tree with another nest, and nests were randomly distributed {{in all but one}} woodlot, where they were uniformly dispersed. Nest density was not significantly related to woodlot size, approximate age, shape, or degree of isolation. <b>Fox</b> <b>squirrel</b> leaf nests were not found in greater densities along the edge of each woodlot, contrary to previous reports.

50|$|Listed as extirpated in some California areas, {{the western}} gray {{squirrel}} in southern California is generally {{found only in}} the mountains and surrounding foothill communities. Local rehabilitation experts recount the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>Squirrels</b> were released in urban regions of Los Angeles throughout the 20th Century. <b>Fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Sciurus niger) were introduced to the Los Angeles area in about 1904. Civil War and Spanish-American War veterans residing at the Sawtelle Veterans Home on Sepulveda and Wilshire Boulevards brought <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> as pets to this site from their homes in the areas surrounding the Mississippi Valley (possibly Tennessee). Other introductions of <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> to the Los Angeles area may have taken place during more recent times but detailed records are not available. These aggressive cousins drove the more reclusive western grays back into the mountains, where competition was not so strong. This non-native species introduction appears to be the largest threat in the southern California area.|$|R
50|$|In Michigan, <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrels</b> feed on {{a variety}} of foods {{throughout}} the year. Spring foods are mainly tree buds and flowers, insects, bird eggs, and seeds of red maple (Acer rubrum), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and elms. Summer foods include a variety of berries, plum and cherry pits, fruits of basswood (Tilia americana), fruits of box elder (Acer negundo), black oak acorns, hickory nuts, seeds of sugar (Acer saccharum) and black maple (Acer nigrum), grains, insects, and unripe corn. Fall foods consist mainly of acorns, hickory nuts, beechnuts, walnuts, butternuts (Juglans cinerea), and hazelnuts. Caches of acorns and hickory nuts are heavily used in winter.|$|R
50|$|Common mammals seen by {{visitors}} and residents include the eastern cottontail, the <b>eastern</b> <b>fox</b> <b>squirrel,</b> the white-footed mouse, the white-tailed deer, and the meadow vole.
