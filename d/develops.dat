However, the recent declining trend from <b>developed</b> countries {{and the emergence of}} FDI from <b>developing</b> countries at a huge amount have triggered our interest on the issue whether (or not) FDI from <b>developed</b> countries are more risk averse than FDI from <b>developing</b> countries. This could imply that FDI from <b>developing</b> countries could be contributing more towards economic development in host <b>developing</b> countries. Focusing on Malaysian manufacturing sector, this study attempts to identify the risk averseness of FDI from <b>developed</b> countries against FDI from <b>developing</b> countries...|$|R

5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects <b>develops</b> relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance <b>develops</b> to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects <b>develops</b> more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

To understand the influence of the CAP among a wealth of factors, the argument is in several parts: the importance of the EU in relation to trade with <b>developing</b> countries; the incentives theoretically open to <b>developing</b> countries given the CAP’s effects on world markets; the impact of development policy on agriculture in <b>developing</b> countries; finally, the trade and production processes in food products between <b>developing</b> and <b>developed</b> countries...|$|R

Unfortunately, the literature does not provide a single view, and there are likely to be differences between <b>developing</b> and <b>developed</b> countries. This paper examines the impact of three host country government policies on the host’s FDI stock: taxation, good governance, and infrastructure. We focus on whether the impact of these factors on FDI differs depending on the level of development of the host country. The regression results indicate that FDI is sensitive to host country taxation in <b>developed</b> countries, but not in <b>developing</b> countries; FDI is sensitive to host country corruption in <b>developing</b> countries but not developed; and FDI shows sensitivity to host country infrastructure quality in both <b>developed</b> and <b>developing</b> host countries, though FDI appears to be more sensitive in <b>developing</b> host countries.
