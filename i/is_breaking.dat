25|$|The pupal form of {{the beetle}} is similar in {{appearance}} to the adult form. They have outer cells produced in the larval stages that are reinforced with proteinaceous cement. This makes their outer shell harder and protects them during this vulnerable stage. While they pupate they breathe through spiracles on the abdomen. The beetle is non-feeding and immobile in this stage, as their internal structure <b>is</b> <b>breaking</b> down and rebuilding to its adult form. Under good temperature conditions the Hister beetle will stay in the pupal stage for about a week.|$|E
25|$|Surfing can {{be broken}} into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance.

Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly {{as soon as the}} wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave <b>is</b> <b>breaking.</b> Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a Balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art.|$|E
