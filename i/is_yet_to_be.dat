5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name.

Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks <b>is</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E

In the film, she collaborated with mother Moon Moon Sen. Riya was slated to appear in Anjan Dutt's Bengali-English bilingual film The Bong Connection with her sister, but she was eventually dropped from the project and replaced by Peeya Rai Chaudhary. The two sisters were later cast together in director Ajai Sinha's The Bachelor, a Bengali film that, as of 2008, <b>is</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> finished.|$|E

His company, KW Foods LLC, bought {{the rights to the}} chain in Chicago. Ultimately, in 2009, only two locations actually opened.

5|$|A new {{parking lot}} has been {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking lot {{has replaced the}} former Joan of Arc parking lot, which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan of Arc dormitory (JOA). The former parking lot was torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle <b>is</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this <b>is</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and contract law, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E
5|$|The result, as {{confirmed}} by Russell, also contains {{the distribution of}} solution counts for the 44 equivalence classes. The listed values are before application of the 9! factor for labeling and the two 72 factors (722 = 5184) for each of Stack 2,3 and Band2,3 permutations. The number of completions for each class is consistently {{on the order of}} 100,000,000, while the number of Band1 permutations covered by each class however varies from 4 – 3240. Within this wide size range, there are clearly two clusters. Ranked by size, the lower 33 classes average ~400 permutations/class, while the upper 11 average ~2100. The disparity in consistency between the distributions for size and number of completions or the separation into two clusters by size <b>is</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> examined.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reception from critics. Some praised it and deemed it a spectacle, while others believed it lacked profundity and portrayal of Cyrus' personality. The Wonder World Tour was commercially successful despite the financial recession that {{was present in}} 2009. It was able to sell-out all European dates in ten minutes and marks the largest attendance at The O2 Arena in London. During {{the first leg of}} the tour, one bus overturned several times on a highway. The accident resulted in the injury of one person and the death of another. The cause of the accident <b>is</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> specified, yet multiple theories for it exist. A filtered version of the Wonder World Tour was broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on June 18, 2010 and received a total of over 2.6 million viewers. The full-length concert film was released on the limited, deluxe edition of Cyrus' third studio album Can't Be Tamed (2010).|$|E
