50|$|Successive {{decreases}} in water level {{and changes in}} substratum help members of Cyperaceae and <b>Graminae</b> such as Carex spp. and Juncus to establish themselves. They form a mat of vegetation extending towards {{the centre of the}} pond. Their rhizomes knit the soil further. The above water leaves transpire water to lower the water level further and add additional leaf litter to the soil. Eventually the sedge peat accumulates above the water level and soil is no longer totally waterlogged. The habitat becomes suitable for invasion of herbs (secondary species) such as Mentha, Caltha, iris, and Galium which grow luxuriantly and bring further changes to the environment. Mesic conditions develop and marshy vegetation begins to disappear.|$|E

Vegetation was {{classified}} by Letouzey as primarily Biafran coastal forest dominated by Caesalpinioideae trees, a Leguminosae sub-family. There is no evidence of any major historical human disturbance and at least the south part of the park is likely primary forest. Floristically, Korup is very rich with over 1,100 tree, shrub, herb and liana species described to date and high levels of endemism (30%). Large emergent trees, reaching up to 50 m tall, puncture a mostly continuous but uneven canopy layer of predominantly Annonaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Leguminosae, Olacaceae, Scytopetalaceae and Verbenaceae trees at about 15 to 25 m. The understory layer is quite dense with both lianas and small trees (dominated by Rubiaceae species), while the herbaceous layer (mainly Acanthaceae, Araceae, Commelinaceae, <b>Graminae,</b> Marantaceae, Rubiaceae, and Zingiberaceae) is mostly sparse. Plant ecological processes in Korup are strongly seasonal with flowering typically occurring between January and July (peak March-May), followed by peak fruiting season. The degree of flowering and fruiting varies considerably between years for most species. Mast fruiting occurs in intervals of more than a year.|$|E

These elements resemble animal retroviruses in their structure and possess a life cycle similar to theirs that includes transcription, translation, and integration of daughter copies. We have investigated if retrotransposons are generally transcribed in the grasses and other plants, and whether the various families of elements are translationally and integrationally active in multiple grass species. A systematic search of 7. 8 × 105 publicly available expressed sequence tags from plants revealed widespread retrotransposon transcripts at a frequency of one in 1, 000. Monocot retrotransposons found relatively more expressed sequence tags from non-source species than did those of dicots. Antibodies were raised to the capsid protein, GAG, of BARE- 1, a transcribed and translated copia-like retrotransposon of barley (Hordeum vulgare). These detected immunoreactive proteins of sizes identical to those of the BARE- 1 GAG and polyprotein, respectively, in other species of the tribe Triticeae as well as in oats (Avena sativa) and rice (Oryza sativa). Retrotransposon-based markers showed integrational polymorphisms for BARE- 1 in different subfamilies of the <b>Graminae.</b> The results suggest that grasses share families of transcriptionally, translationally, and integrationally active retrotransposons, enabling a comparative and integrative approach to understanding the life cycle of retrotransposons and their impact on the genome...|$|E
40|$|Processes {{controlling}} {{the exchange of}} ammonia between grassland and the atmosphere (<b>GRAMINAE)</b> Editor(s) : K. Pilegaard, J. K. Schjoerring, and M. A. SuttonDeposition of atmospheric ammonia (NH 3) to semi-natural ecosystems leads to serious adverse effects, such as acidification and eutrophication. A step in quantifying such effects is the measurement of NH 3 fluxes over semi-natural and agricultural land. However, measurement of NH 3 fluxes over vegetation {{in the vicinity of}} strong NH 3 sources is challenging, since NH 3 emissions are highly heterogeneous. Indeed, under such conditions, local advection errors may alter the measured fluxes. In this study, local advection errors (?Fz,adv) were estimated over a 14 ha grassland field, which was successively cut and fertilised, as part of the <b>GRAMINAE</b> integrated Braunschweig experiment. The magnitude of ?Fz,adv was determined up to 810 m downwind from farm buildings emitting between 6. 2 and 9. 9 kg NH 3 day- 1. The <b>GRAMINAE</b> experiment provided a unique opportunity to compare two methods of estimating ?Fz,adv: one inference method based on measurements of horizontal concentration gradients, and one based on inverse dispersion modelling with a two-dimensional model. Two sources of local advection were clearly identified: the farm NH 3 emissions leading to positive ?Fz,adv ("bias towards emissions") and field NH 3 emissions, which led to a negative ?Fz,adv ("bias towards deposition"). The local advection flux from the farm was in the range 0 to 27 ng NH 3 m- 2 s- 1 at 610 m from the farm, whereas ?Fz,adv due to field emission was proportional to the local flux, and ranged between - 209 and 13 ng NH 3 m- 2 s- 1. The local advection flux ?Fz,adv was either positive or negative depending on the magnitude of these two contributions. The modelled and inferred advection errors agreed well. The inferred advection errors, relative to the vertical flux at 1 m height, were 52 % on average, before the field was cut, and less than 2. 1 % when the field was fertilised. The variability of the advection errors in response to changes in micrometeorological conditions is also studied. The limits of the 2 -D modelling approach are discussed...|$|E
