25|$|The {{origins of}} the Urewe culture are {{ultimately}} in the Bantu expansion originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in Sub-Saharan Africa has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by {{the descendants of the}} first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. <b>Given</b> <b>our</b> current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information <b>given</b> <b>our</b> police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 6, and Obama was projected the winner at about 11:14 pm Eastern Standard Time. [...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine battleground states, and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had {{thought they were going to}} win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. We have <b>given</b> <b>our</b> all to this campaign. I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E

Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value? <b>Given</b> <b>our</b> cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but once you get past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E

He writes that, {{in order to}} consider the [...] "system reply" [...] as remotely plausible, a person must be [...] "under the grip of an ideology". The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any [...] "system" [...] can have consciousness, just {{by virtue of being}} a system with the right behavior and functional parts.

2500|$|Cryonics {{goes further}} than the {{mainstream}} consensus that the brain doesn't have to be continuously active to survive or retain memory. Cryonics controversially asserts that a human person survives even within an inactive brain that's been badly damaged provided that original encoding of memory and personality can, in theory, be adequately inferred and reconstituted from structure that remains. Cryonicists argue {{that as long as}} brain structure remains intact, there is no fundamental barrier, <b>given</b> <b>our</b> current understanding of physical law, to recovering its information content. Cryonicists argue that true [...] "death" [...] should be defined as irreversible loss of brain information critical to personal identity, rather than inability to resuscitate using current technology. The cryonics argument that death doesn't occur as long as brain structure remains intact and theoretically repairable has received some mainstream medical discussion {{in the context of the}} ethical concept of brain death and organ donation.|$|E

2500|$|Plato's Problem is {{the term}} given by Noam Chomsky to [...] "the problem of {{explaining}} how we can know so much" [...] <b>given</b> <b>our</b> limited experience. Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) how we should account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, when it seems undetermined by extrinsic evidence presented to a person during human development. In linguistics this {{is referred to as}} the [...] "argument from poverty of the stimulus" [...] (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always [...] "underdetermined by evidence". Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors. Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the Meno dialogue, in which Socrates demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, {{a former}} {{director}} of the Penn State Confucius Institute, Eric Hayot, said he suspected that the Confucius Institute might not have been providing enough of a return on Penn State's investment. [...] "I will say that in my experience as CI director one of the major frustrations with the relationship was that we consistently had more ambitious ideas for the ways CI funding could be used", such as research projects proposed by Penn State professors on topics concerning the environment, science, and politics. He said the Hanban regularly rejected such proposals [...] "too far outside the official CI ambit (which they would tell us was mainly 'cultural')," [...] "A lot of what the Hanban wanted us to do didn’t make sense <b>given</b> <b>our</b> institution, faculty population, and student population," [...] said Professor Hayot, who was not involved in the CI contract negotiations this summer. [...] "Had they been flexible, it would have helped Confucius Institute succeed here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whatever {{the meaning}} of Laius's oracle, the one {{delivered}} to Oedipus is clearly unconditional. <b>Given</b> <b>our</b> modern conception of fate and fatalism, readers of the play {{have a tendency to}} view Oedipus as a mere puppet controlled by greater forces, a man crushed by the gods and fate for no good reason. This, however, is not an entirely accurate reading. While it is a mythological truism that oracles exist to be fulfilled, oracles do not cause the events that lead up to the outcome. In his landmark essay [...] "On Misunderstanding the Oedipus Rex", E.R. Dodds draws a comparison with Jesus's prophecy at the Last Supper that Peter would deny him three times. Jesus knows that Peter will do this, but readers would in no way suggest that Peter was a puppet of fate being forced to deny Christ. Free will and predestination are by no means mutually exclusive, and such is the case with Oedipus.|$|E

2500|$|Grosvenor Bedford, in an April 1815 Quarterly Review article, stated, [...] "The {{critic who}} {{undertakes}} {{to give an}} epitome of a poem of so high a rank as Roderick, {{has little to do}} but to point out in the mass of admirable matter those things which strike him as most worthy of admiration. Original in its plan, true in its fundamental elements, and consistent in its parts, it rouses the feelings, and stimulates those powers of the imagination, which rejoice in the consciousness of exertion." [...] The review concluded, [...] "Of the versification which Mr. Southey has employed we have <b>given</b> <b>our</b> readers sufficient specimens to enable them to judge for themselves. The variety of its cadences gives a spirit which relieves its grandeur, and the redundant syllable at the end of many of the lines prevents the majesty of its tone from oppressing the ear. The language is such as the best authors of the best era of our literature would acknowledge, nor can we give it higher praise than to say that its standard worth would be admitted in the mint of Queen Elizabeth's age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Päts {{was allowed}} to stay in office, but on 21June was forced to appoint the Soviet puppet Johannes Vares as Prime Minister. Now {{effectively}} a puppet himself, for an entire month Päts signed about 200 decrees for the new Soviet regime. Among other things, he signed a decree to change the electoral law, allowing the new regime to organize preliminary elections. This law was illegal, since the upper house of the Riigikogu had been dissolved and never reconvened. The new elections were only for the lower chamber, the Riigivolikogu, with voters being presented with a single list of Communists and fellow travellers. On Victory Day of 23June 1940, Päts declared: [...] "the greatest thing we have accomplished {{is the creation of}} the Estonian state. To her we have <b>given</b> <b>our</b> strongest love, our loyalty, our work, and our life." [...] From 29June 1940, Päts remained under permanent house arrest. Even in early July, Päts declared to the German ambassador that he did not believe Estonia would be Sovietized. On 21July 1940, the Estonian SSR was proclaimed and it is claimed that only then Päts realized the essence of the Soviet occupation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Hanson gave {{a mostly}} {{favorable}} review {{to the book}} Colossus by the British historian Niall Ferguson, where Ferguson argued that the United States should be an imperial power {{in the sense of}} preserving the post war order of global free trade, communications, and commerce, and the principal problem with Americans was that they were unwilling to embrace global leadership {{in the same way that}} people in 19th century Britain did. Hanson found much to approve of in Ferguson's book, writing: [...] "In reality, we should be natural imperialists, <b>given</b> <b>our</b> wealth and expertise. Americans are also endowed with an exceptional moral sense. We are a generous people, whose checkered imperial interventions in the past rarely proved profitable or exploitive." [...] Hanson agreed with Ferguson that the principle problem with Americans was an unease at playing the role of an imperialistic power, argued that post-1945 histories of Germany and Japan proved the beneficial results of American occupation and predicted that Iraq under American occupation would become just as much a prosperous and democratic society as Germany and Japan are. Hanson praised Ferguson for his defense of the British Empire as a benevolent force and his thesis that the United States should play the same role in the world as the British Empire, writing: [...] "Does Ferguson propose a new American liberal empire? In fact, he does almost, but not before noting that the British Victorians themselves got a bad rap as exploitive colonialists. In fact, the record of the 18th and 19th centuries prove exactly the opposite: Former and once-prosperous colonies, following autonomy, quickly turned into self-induced miseries, while Britain itself thrived as never before once free of these costly obligations. Empire turns out not to be a means of making money, but instead an idealist pursuit to keep sea lanes open, bullies at bay and nations trading rather than fighting. The world has been lucky to have the Americans fill this vacuum, inasmuch as the British once did a pretty good job of it as well." [...] Hanson, well before the immigration and financial crises of the EU, also praised Ferguson for his very negative picture of the European Union as being both [...] "busy triangulating with our enemies" [...] and [...] "running huge trade deficits with us as we supply their own security needs." [...] He cites appears to agree with Ferguson that Europe is undemocratic, and statist, but that with a population in decline and even worse entitlement overspending than the US, a more broken melting pot, and socialist response to these issues ensuring Europe will be unable generate the unity or idealism required to supplant the US.|$|E
