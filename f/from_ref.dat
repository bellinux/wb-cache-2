5000|$|The {{roles of}} membrane-associated and cytoplasmic fatty-acid binding {{proteins}} in placental fatty acid uptake and metabolism. The location of fatty acid translocase (FAT) and fatty acid transporter protein (FATP) {{on both sides}} of the bipolar placental trophoblast cells and the lack of specificity for particular types of free fatty acids (FFA) allows transport by all FFAs (non-essential, essential and long-chain PUFAs) bidirectionally, i.e. from the mother to the fetus and vice versa. Whereas, by virtue of its exclusive location on maternal side of placental trophoblasts and its preference for long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), placenta specific plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein ( [...] p-FABPpm) sequesters maternal plasma DHA/ARA to the placenta for fetal supply. Placental supply of DHA/ARA is critical for fetal brain development in utero. Cytoplasmic fatty acid-binidng proteins (FABPs) are responsible for transcytoplasmic movement of FFAs to their sites of esterification, ß-oxidation, or to the fetal circulation via placental basal membranes (Figure 2). <b>From</b> <b>ref.</b> DOI: 10.1023/A:1006852230337.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} sperm chemotaxis {{is still not}} fully known. The current knowledge is mainly based on studies in the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata, where binding of the chemoattractant resact (Table 1) to its receptor, a guanylyl cyclase, activates cGMP synthesis (Figure 1). The resulting rise of cGMP possibly activates K+-selective ion channels. The consequential hyperpolarization activates hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. The depolarizing inward current through HCN channels possibly activates voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, resulting in elevation of intracellular Ca2+. This rise leads to flagellar asymmetry and, consequently, a turn of the sperm cell.Figure 1. A model of the signal-transduction pathway during sperm chemotaxis of the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata. Binding of a chemoattractant (ligand) to the receptor — a membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase (GC) — activates the synthesis of cGMP from GTP. Cyclic GMP possibly opens cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) K+-selective channels, thereby causing hyperpolarization of the membrane. The cGMP signal is terminated by the hydrolysis of cGMP through phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and inactivation of GC. On hyperpolarization, hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels allow the influx of Na+ that leads to depolarization and thereby causes a rapid Ca2+ entry through voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (Cav), Ca2+ ions interact by unknown mechanisms with the axoneme of the flagellum and cause an increase of the asymmetry of flagellar beat and eventually a turn or bend in the swimming trajectory. Ca2+ {{is removed from the}} flagellum by a Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism. <b>from</b> <b>ref.</b>|$|E
