5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} of the boat. The captain thought <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate {{the surface of the}} sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E
5|$|P. canariensis, the Canary Islands {{chiffchaff}} is a non-migratory species formerly occurring on {{the major}} Canary Islands, which is differentiated from P. collybita by morphology, vocalisations and genetic characteristics, and, of course, is not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs. The nominate western subspecies P. c. canariensis of El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria is smaller than common chiffchaff, and has shorter, rounder wings. It is olive-brown above and has a buff breast and flanks; it has a rich deep chip-cheep-cheep-chip-chip-cheep song, and a call similar to the nominate race. The eastern P. c. exsul of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less rufous below than its western relative, and had a harsher call; <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> distinct species, but it became extinct in 1986 at latest, probably much earlier. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, but it appears always to have been scarce and localised, occurring only in the Haria Valley of Lanzarote.|$|E

Rahkonen's speculation has been criticized by other scientists, such as by the Russian Uralist Vladimir Napolskikh. Nowadays, Mishar Tatar dialect is a Turkic language.|$|E

25|$|In the {{inscription}} {{on the base}} of the statue he dedicated to his father-in-law, Quintus Fabius Memmius Symmachus calls Flavianus historicus disertissimus. In fact, Flavianus wrote a history of Rome entitled Annales ("Annals"), now lost; it was dedicated to Theodosius (probably when Flavianus was quaestor sacri palatii in the 380s) and written in annalist form. As the title suggests, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> continuation of the Annals by Tacitus: in fact, in the often unreliable Historia Augusta, inside the book devoted {{to the life of the}} Roman emperor Aurelian (270–275), it is included a letter from Aurelian to queen Zenobia that the author claims reported by a Nicomachus; it is therefore possible that Nicomachus' work was a continuation of Tacitus' until, at least, Aurelian. Flavianus' Annals was maybe used by Ammianus Marcellinus as a source.|$|E

Alasdair Wilkins, at The A.V.

He also said that it was a [...] "blatant example" [...] of Enterprise repeating the story mechanics of previous seasons. Chaz Lipp at The Morton Report called [...] "Acquisition" [...] a [...] "goofy" [...] episode, and one of several which were [...] "weak and uninspired".|$|E

She called Saviers, who sedated him and admitted him to the Sun Valley Hospital; from there he was returned to the Mayo Clinic for more electroshock treatments. He was released in late June and arrived home in Ketchum on June 30. Two days later, {{in the early morning hours}} of July 2, 1961, Hemingway [...] "quite deliberately" [...] shot himself with his favorite shotgun. He had unlocked the basement storeroom where his guns were kept, gone upstairs to the front entrance foyer of their Ketchum home, and according to Mellow, shot himself with the [...] "double-barreled shotgun that he had used so often <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> friend".|$|E

500|$|The fossils {{found in}} Java are {{considered}} the type specimen for H. erectus. Because the fossils of Java Man were found [...] "scattered in an alluvial deposit"they had been laid there by the flow of a riverdetractors doubted that they belonged to the same species, let alone the same individual. German pathologist Rudolf Virchow, for instance, argued in 1895 that the femur {{was that of a}} gibbon. Dubois had difficulty convincing his critics, because he had not attended the excavation, and could not explain specifically enough the exact location of the bones. Because the Trinil thighbone looks very much like that of a modern human, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> [...] "reworked fossil", that is, a relatively young fossil that was deposited into an older layer after its own layer had been eroded. For this reason, there is still dissent about whether all the Trinil fossils represent the same species.|$|E
500|$|Tubman {{was born}} Araminta [...] "Minty" [...] Ross to slave parents, Harriet ("Rit") Green and Ben Ross. Rit {{was owned by}} Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large {{plantation}} near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate. Kate Larson records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement, while Jean Humez says [...] "the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> year or two later." [...] Catherine Clinton notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. In her Civil War widow's pension records, Tubman claimed {{she was born in}} 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of when she was born.|$|E

500|$|Twelve {{hours after}} the Great Miami {{hurricane}} struck Alabama, the eighth tropical storm of the season formed in the east-central Atlantic about [...] southwest of Horta in the Azores on September 21. Over the next three days, it moved north of due east and rapidly strengthened, becoming a minimal hurricane by 12:00 UTC on September 22 and later peaking at —equivalent to a moderately strong Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale—on the morning of September 24. For about 24 hours thereafter, the cyclone briefly curved to the northeast before turning sharply to the east early on September 26. Late that day, the cyclone swerved precipitously to the north, making landfall {{on the island of}} São Miguel near Ponta Delgada at peak intensity. Curving northwest and then south of due west, the cyclone weakened after striking São Miguel and reverted to a minimal hurricane late on September 27.

500|$|Famitsus reviewers each {{praised the}} gameplay, story, and the {{introduction}} of full-motion movies. One reviewer cited it as the series' new exemplar, while another pointed out rough edges in the graphical redesign and that the new 3D perspective made seeing some parts of the map difficult. 1UP.com's Shane Betternhausen was positive overall, saying [...] " [...] delivers a superbly paced and rewarding adventure". RPGamer's Chris Privitere said [...] "While Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance doesn't necessarily add anything new to the tactical genre, it does everything very well", recommending it to players while stressing the need for patience. Peer Schneider of IGN called the game [...] "yet another worthy installment in Intelligent Systems' venerable strategy RPG series". RPGFan reviewer Mark Tjan said that while not the best Fire Emblem game he had played, [...] "it's certainly a good game and worth picking up if you're searching for an SRPG worth your time and money". Nintendo World Report's Karl Castaneda was also highly positive, though commenting that its graphical quality were more suited to {{the early days of the}} GameCube's life and that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> great success if released during that period. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the Fire Emblem formula, enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished. Greg Kasavin, writing for GameSpot, saying that [...] "by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role-playing games with a fun and exciting turn-based combat system, and by going out of its way to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role-playing games attempt, but very few actually manage to do". The majority of praise went to the game's story and gameplay, while criticism was focused on the graphical quality.|$|E

It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together.
