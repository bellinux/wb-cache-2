40|$|The type of {{learning}} exhibited during foraging {{has been studied}} in {{a large number of}} species. Species that feed on food sources that temporally vary in quality could be well suited for exhibiting evidence of spatial learning. The foraging strategies of captive <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> were examined using an experimental foraging task. Two <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> were exposed to a modified radial arm maze in order {{to determine whether or not}} they would demonstrate evidence of spatial learning. Both subjects demonstrated significant improvement in performance by visiting baited feeders more consistently across learning trials. A disruption in performance occurred when the task was reversed, indicating that <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> may use spatial learning to locate food sources. Obtaining a more sound understanding of the cognitive abilities of <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> may help to enhance their welfare in captive settings...|$|R
40|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) are {{specialized}} insectivores {{and consume}} mainly ants and termites in the wild. In captivity, <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> are either fed a complete diet, {{or a combination}} of a domestic carnivore diet with leaf eater pellets, or a traditional gruel-type diet. Soft faeces are a frequently encountered problem with this type of feeding. In the present study, we analysed diet and faeces composition, calculated digestibility and measured mean retention time on various diets in eight <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> (total of n = 64 experiments). The results suggest that the digestive physiology of <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> {{is similar to that of}} domestic dogs and cats in terms of nutrient digestibility and digesta retention. When testing correlations between faecal dry matter content and other variables, no relationship with dietary crude fibre content or mean digesta retention time could be detected. However, acid insoluble ash intake was significantly and positively correlated with faecal dry matter content. The amount of acid insoluble ash excreted with the faeces was higher than that ingested with the diet offered, indicating that the <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> ingested soil from their enclosure of up to 93 g per day. This finding is consistent with observation of faeces of wild <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> that contain soil or sand most likely due to indiscriminate feeding. It also corresponds to reports that indigestible materials such as peat, soil, chitin or cellulose contribute to a firmer faecal consistency in various carnivore species. Therefore, offering <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> the opportunity to voluntarily ingest soil from their enclosure might be beneficial...|$|R

50|$|Although {{they are}} shy and {{typically}} {{attempt to avoid}} humans, <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> can inflict severe wounds with their front claws and {{have been known to}} seriously injure or kill humans who corner and threaten them. Between 2010 and 2012, two hunters were killed by <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> in Brazil; in both cases, the hunters were agitating and wounding cornered animals and the attacks appeared to be defensive behaviors. In April 2007, an anteater at the Florencio Varela Zoo mauled a zookeeper with its front claws.|$|R
25|$|The white-headed {{capuchin}} is {{native to}} the forests of the province, as is the mantled howler. Other mammals native to Alajuela include Baird's tapir, the <b>giant</b> <b>anteater,</b> the silky anteater, margays, ocelots, and other wild cats. Jaguars, while rarely seen, also inhabit the province's national parks. Deer are native to the highlands {{as well as the}} Northern Plains.|$|E
25|$|The wild canids {{found in}} Brazil are the maned wolf, bush dog, hoary fox, short-eared dog, crab-eating fox and pampas fox. The felines found in Brazil are the jaguar, the puma, the margay, the ocelot, the oncilla, and the jaguarundi. Other notable animals include the <b>giant</b> <b>anteater,</b> several {{varieties}} of sloths and armadillos, coati, giant river otter, tapir, peccaries, marsh deer, Pampas deer, and capybara (the world's largest existing rodent). There are around 75 primate species, including the howler monkey, the capuchin monkey, and the squirrel monkey, the marmoset, and the tamarin.|$|E
25|$|During 1962 and 1963 {{a mysterious}} skin ailment afflicted the polar bears {{and would not}} respond to treatment. Two adult males, Natuk and Brunus and an adult female Natasha had to be euthanised. Natasha {{was the mother of}} the only cub to survive to {{adulthood}} in the seventy years Auckland Zoo exhibited polar bears. His name was Chimo and he was born in the early sixties. This period also saw the arrival of many new animals, including a pregnant zebra, a female giraffe Anita, a pair of Bengal tigers, two young polar bears, a <b>giant</b> <b>anteater,</b> two capuchin monkeys, and four spider monkeys. The giraffe herd and spider monkey troop at the zoo today are descended from these imports.|$|E

50|$|Other prey {{include the}} larvae of beetles and western honey bees that have located their hives in termite mounds. Anteaters may target termite mounds with bee hives. In captivity, anteaters are fed {{mixtures}} made of milk, eggs, mealworms, and ground beef. To drink, an anteater may dig for water when no surface water is available, creating waterholes for other animals. <b>Giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> are prey for jaguars and pumas. They typically flee from danger by galloping, but if cornered, will rear {{up on their}} hind legs and slash at the attacker. The <b>giant</b> <b>anteater's</b> front claws are formidable weapons, capable of killing a jaguar.|$|R
50|$|Silky anteaters and {{northern}} tamanduas extend their ranges {{as far north}} as southeastern Mexico, while <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> can be found {{as far north as}} Central America. Southern tamanduas range south to Uruguay (<b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> did also until their recent extirpation there) and the ranges of all species except the northern tamandua overlap in eastern Brazil. Anteaters were confined to South America, which was formerly an island continent, during most of the Cenozoic Era. Once the Isthmus of Panama formed about three million years ago, however, anteaters invaded Central America as part of the Great American Interchange.|$|R

In E. escomeli oocysts were 23. 9 +/- 1. 89 by 19. 7 +/- 1. 60 microm and its sporocysts were 11. 47 +/- 1. 25 by 6. 48 +/- 0. 80 microm. In E. tamanduae oocysts were 23. 52 +/- 0. 95 by 20. 59 +/- 0. 92 microm and its sporocysts were 12. 19 +/- 0. 65 by 7. 15 +/- 0. 55 microm. In E. marajoensis oocysts were 13. 5 +/- 1. 7 by 13. 1 +/- 1. 8 microm and its sporocysts were 7. 4 +/- 0. 58 by 5. 4 +/- 0. 8 microm. Eimeria escomeli was described before parasitizing <b>giants</b> <b>anteater</b> from Bolivia, and it was point out as {{the first time in}} Brazil.

40|$|Diet of the jaguar Panthera onca in the Cerrado, central Brazil, was {{investigated}} {{based on a}} sample of genetically identified jaguar scats. At least nine prey species were observed in 35 scat samples. <b>Giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> Myrmecophaga tridactyla contributed more than 75 % of biomass to the observed diet. Tapirs Tapirus terrestris and peccaries Tayassu pecari and Pecari tajacu contributed approximately 6 % to jaguar diet each, and small mammals contributed least to the jaguar diet. At 0. 121, dietary niche breadth was narrower than reported in most other studies. Due to their physical characteristics and abundance, <b>giant</b> <b>anteaters</b> are likely the most profitable prey for jaguars in Emas National Park, and as an important prey, they {{should be included in}} jaguar conservation efforts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
