5|$|Even {{within the}} King family, members {{disagree}} about his {{religious and political}} views about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. King's widow Coretta said publicly that she believed her husband would have supported gay rights.

5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu {{for the better part}} of a decade, Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E

60|$|Margaret learned, however, {{from her}} friends that the <b>king</b> <b>had</b> made his escape, and was {{probably}} {{in a place of}} safety, and this gave her great consolation. It was thought that the <b>king</b> <b>had</b> succeeded in making his way to Scotland.|$|R
5|$|At Doncaster, {{the king}} awaited Montagu, {{who was in}} the north raising a {{substantial}} force in Edward's name. Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the <b>king</b> <b>has</b> been called 'decisive'. The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to Bishop's Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 151 {{authors have}} had works nominated; 43 {{of them have}} won, including ties. Five authors have won twice: Gene Wolfe, out of eight nominations; Tim Powers, out of five; Patricia McKillip, out of four; Jeffrey Ford, out of three; and James K. Morrow for both of his nominations. Wolfe has the most nominations for an author who has won at least once, while Stephen <b>King</b> <b>has</b> the most nominations without winning, at nine, followed by Charles L.

5|$|Gurnemanz {{asks the}} lead Knight for {{news of the}} King's health. The Knight says the <b>King</b> <b>has</b> {{suffered}} during the night and is going early to bathe in the holy lake. The squires ask Gurnemanz {{to explain how the}} King's injury can be healed, but he evades their question and a wild woman – Kundry – bursts in. She gives Gurnemanz a vial of balsam, brought from Arabia, to ease the King's pain and then collapses, exhausted.|$|E

5|$|The Chhera Pahara (sweeping with water) is a {{significant}} ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra. During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots. The king cleans {{the road in front}} of the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder. As per the custom, although the Gajapati <b>King</b> <b>has</b> been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.|$|E
5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Toniná {{continued}} after most other Classic Maya cities had fallen, perhaps {{aided by the}} site's relative isolation. Ruler 10 {{is associated with a}} monument dating to 904 in the Terminal Classic and a monument dating to 909 bears the last known Long Count date although the name of the <b>king</b> <b>has</b> not survived. Ceramic fragments indicate that occupation at the site continued for another century or more.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> sold {{soft drinks}} from the Coca-Cola Company in its home market. In 1983, PepsiCo {{garnered}} the $444million beverage supplier contract from its rival, and, {{in the midst}} of extreme market debate over the future of the contract, had it renewed for a second term in 1987. The company won the contract by strengthening the marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself. The contract lasted three more years when, partially based upon Pepsi's growth as a restaurant operator with its Tricon Restaurants division, Burger King moved its beverage contract back to Coca-Cola.|$|E
5|$|While Link {{is celebrating}} his coming of age, a {{gigantic}} bird drops a girl, pirate captain Tetra, into Outset Island's forest. Link rescues Tetra from monsters, but the bird carries off Link's sister Aryll. Tetra agrees to help Link find his sister, and they sail to the Forsaken Fortress, where the bird, the Helmaroc <b>King,</b> <b>has</b> been taking girls with long ears. Link finds Aryll and other kidnapped girls, but the Helmaroc King captures him and takes {{him to a}} man in black, who orders Link thrown into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Original Chicken sandwich, Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> sold or sells {{several other}} {{sandwiches}} {{that are similar}} to the Specialty Sandwiches. Several burgers have been sold on this family of sandwiches, including a pair of triple cheeseburgers called the Limo Burger and the X-Tra Long Cheeseburger, the Bull's-Eye Barbecue Burger which was a type of double cheeseburger that included two hamburger patties, American cheese, bacon and Kraft Bull's-eye brand barbecue sauce, and the BBQ Hero which was also another type of double cheeseburger with barbecue sauce, bacon, lettuce, tomato and onions. The company introduced another burger in this family called the Extra Long BBQ Cheeseburger in June 2014. The sandwich consisted of two burger patties, BBQ sauce and onion rings. It is similar in composition to the chain's Rodeo Cheeseburger.|$|E

5|$|Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several {{different}} names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal {{in the international}} markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> sold beer {{in several of}} its {{international}} locations, such as Germany, but not in its home territory. The company began to sell beer at its BK Whopper Bar limited service concept restaurants in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles in 2010. The company is selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch, including Budweiser, Bud Lite, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} several instances {{in the story}} that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy {{was that of the}} blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the <b>King</b> <b>has</b> to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{the king}} decides {{to take a}} drive with his daughter. The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their {{carriage}} passes. The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The <b>king</b> <b>has</b> the young man brought from the river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, and seated in the coach with his daughter, {{who falls in love}} with him at once.|$|E
5|$|Since being {{founded in}} 1954, Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> {{undergone}} five changes of ownership. Further, during the ownership tenure of Grand Metropolitan, Grand Met merged with Guinness in 1997 {{to form a}} new company, Diageo. TPG Capital's ownership was shared with Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, both of which held minority shares. During 3G Capital's ownership, 3G divested a 29% stake of the chain to Justice Holdings of Great Britain when the chain was again taken public in 2012. When Burger King merged with Tim Hortons in 2014, Berkshire Hathaway bought into the newly combined chain as part of an debt-equity financing deal.|$|E
5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger <b>King</b> <b>has</b> used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight on the shoulders of the company.|$|E
