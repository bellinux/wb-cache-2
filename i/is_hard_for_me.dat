25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what you have done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to leave}} you and sister," [...] I replied, [...] "but I must. I'm only rotting here. I'll come back--at least to visit you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to speak}} of her at any time. It is {{very hard for me}} to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to advise}} you, Henry," [...] said Simon; [...] "but this I must ask you: Have you, {{or have you}} not, {{reason to think that}} this poor unfortunate Oliver has been mistaken for you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Fortunately my bernouse will hide that; but it were {{certainly}} best to staunch the blood before I start, <b>for</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to get at}} the wound myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have forgiven <b>me</b> <b>for</b> my insistence this morning?" [...] she asked. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe}} that you were not indeed the person for whom I mistook you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know any}} reason why you shouldn't," [...] confessed Peter. [...] "But somehow it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to think of birds as living in holes in the ground. I've only just found out that Rattles the Kingfisher does. But I didn't suppose there were any others. Did you make that hole yourself, Banker?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Manston {{found himself}} alone {{a few minutes}} later. He {{buried his face in}} his hands, and murmured, 'O my lost one! O my Cytherea!

6000|$|... "Surely I said `my late master,' did I not?" [...] {{returned}} Hadji Baba, {{rubbing his}} forehead {{as if he}} were confused--as, in truth, the poor fellow was, by the terrible scenes that had lately been enacted in the palace. [...] "As I meant to say, then,--it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to talk sense when my late master hired me expressly to talk nonsense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bostil, I'm sorry I can't {{take you}} up on the job," [...] rejoined Slone, swiftly. [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to decide. You've been good to me. I'm grateful. But it's time I was tellin' you." ...|$|R
6000|$|MARGARET (hugging his arm). It would <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> if {{you lost}} me, {{but it would}} be worse for you. I don't know how I know that, but I do know it. What would you do without me? ...|$|R
30|$|ST: At that time, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to talk to}} strangers. At {{the moment}} it’s better because I have some uhm (.) yeah it’s a lot – I {{remember}} it’s the first time I come, I came to Australia,...((narrates his experience)).|$|R
6000|$|... "You must not!" [...] Though {{her voice}} was strained, Helen, who dared not do otherwise, looked him {{steadily}} in the eyes. [...] "You must not go. Now, when, if you stay in the Province, fame and prosperity lie within your grasp you will not overwhelm me by adding to the knowledge of all I have robbed you of. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to express myself plainly--but I dare not take this from you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to ask {{a great deal of}} you, and remind you of a promise you once made." [...] There was a little tremor in her voice. [...] "You will not think it ungracious if I say there is no one else who can do what seems so necessary, and ask you if you do not {{consider}} that you owe something to my father.

"Of course Old Mother Nature knows, {{but just}} the same it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> not to believe that Teeny Weeny {{is a member of}} the Mouse family," [...] said Happy Jack Squirrel to Peter Rabbit, as they scampered along to school. [...] "I never have had a real good look at him, but I've had glimpses of him lots of times and always {{supposed}} him a little Mouse with a short tail. It is hard to believe that he isn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have not}} pity. I told you then how sorry I {{was that a}} sudden {{uncontrollable}} pain drove me to do a thing which immediately I bitterly regretted.

5000|$|Abdul {{criticized the}} way the program's {{segments}} were edited. She explained, [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to watch. Disturbing. They’d put a camera on me when I got wind that my dog was in a coma, and they’d make it (seem) like it was about hair and makeup." ...|$|R
5000|$|The public {{perception}} of what Michael is {{as a human being}} has been highly exaggerated. Those articles <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to relate to. For instance, Bubbles is more fun than a lot of people I know. I saw Bubbles at a wedding in a tux. He has great table manners. Quincy Jones.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} nice. But I {{feel as if}} I must go my plans are all made, and I've set my heart on it," [...] {{answered}} Mac, looking so eager that Rose released him, saying sadly: [...] "I suppose it is natural for you all to get restless and push off, but it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to let you go}} one after the other and stay here alone. Charlie is gone, Archie and Steve are wrapped up in their sweethearts, the boys away, and only Jamie left to 'play with Rose.'? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said the Altrurian. [...] "I didn't dream of accusing you of such inhumanity. But, you see, our whole {{system is so}} very {{different}} that, as I said, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to conceive of yours, and I am very curious to understand its workings. If you shot your fellow-man, as you say, the law would punish you; but if, for some reason that you decided to be good, you took away his means of living, and he actually starved to death--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've noticed that," [...] said Peter. [...] "He {{almost always}} has company when he passes through here. Some of those Sparrows {{are so much}} alike that it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to tell them apart, but I can always tell Whitethroat because {{he is one of}} the largest of the tribe and has such a lovely white throat. He really is {{handsome}} with his black and white cap and that bright yellow spot before each eye. I am told that he is very dearly loved up in the north where he makes his home. They say he sings all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear dad! How {{could you}} {{possibly}} know? As {{he says in his}} letter, it has given me a lesson. But he was so much older and so much more experienced, that it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to ask to examine his books. But we must waste no time. I must go to the City." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do so, and I {{will show}} you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that which it <b>is</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to say and for you to hear: {{there has been an}} {{understanding}} between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not that I know of; but I did it very well. I {{seemed to}} {{comprehend}} the work at once, and needed no instruction. Often during these two years I have encountered similar curious conditions. I sold goods in a store and seemed to know the stocks; I worked two weeks in a telegraph office and discovered I knew the code perfectly; I've shod horses for a country blacksmith, wired a house for electric lights and compounded prescriptions in a drug store. Whatever I have undertaken to do I seem able to accomplish, and so it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to guess what profession I followed before my memory deserted me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘In my own dear land,’ she pursued, ‘things are {{differently}} ordered. There, I must own, a girl {{is bound}} by many and rigorous restrictions; little is permitted her; she learns to be distant, she learns to appear forbidding. But here, in free England—oh, glorious liberty!’ she cried, and threw up her arms {{with a gesture}} of inimitable grace—‘here there are no fetters; here the woman may dare to be herself entirely, and the men, the chivalrous men—is it not written on the very shield of your nation, honi soit? Ah, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to learn, {{hard for me to}} dare to be myself. You must not judge me yet awhile; I shall end by conquering this stiffness, I shall end by growing English. Do I speak the language well?’ ...|$|E
60|$|And all {{the time}} I was {{wondering}} who he was. I didn't know him from Adam; I couldn't recall him a bit. I don't mean that my memory is weak. On the contrary, it is singularly tenacious. True, I find {{it very hard to}} remember people's names; very often, too, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to recall a face, and frequently I fail to recall a person's appearance, and of course clothes are a thing one doesn't notice. But apart from these details I never forget anybody, and I am proud of it. But when it does happen that a name or face escapes me I never lose my presence of mind. I know just {{how to deal with the}} situation. It only needs coolness and intellect, and it all comes right.|$|E
2500|$|.....By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) {{had ordered}} me to shift one of the {{mountains}} {{it would not have}} <b>been</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Quran... So I started locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I'll invest {{five hundred}} in the bonds. I {{had already decided}} {{to put in a}} hundred dollars, but for a moment this veiled {{accusation}} bewildered me. You're right; it's treasonable. It will <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to raise five hundred, just now, but I'll do it. I want that to be my answer to the German." ...|$|R
5000|$|Responding to a {{question}} about whether being in the closet affected him: [...] "On a professional level, no, because I knew I had a job to do. On a personal level, in some ways, yes, because it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to live sometimes knowing that I was alone or that I couldn't be open about who I wanted to date." ...|$|R
