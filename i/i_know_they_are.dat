500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine {{is going to have}} trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> capable of this." ...|$|E
500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Maryan Nuh Muse, in the 400 metres. Muse had {{previously}} competed {{on behalf of}} Somalia at international youth athletic competitions around the world. Prior to the competition, she spoke {{of the difference in}} the quality of the training facilities in Somalia compared to those in other countries, saying [...] "A number of countries will be participating among them Jamaica and United States; but I am hoping to shine. We don’t have the same training facilities, theirs is better than ours. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> determined to win but we are also equally determined." [...] She competed in the sixth heat of the 400 metres competition on 13 August; she came in last place with a time of 1:10:14, over 18 seconds behind the heat's winner Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain.|$|E
2500|$|Martin Luther King {{was jailed}} on October 19, 1960, for {{picketing}} {{in a department}} store. After being released three days later, Coretta's husband {{was sent back to}} jail on October 22 for driving with an Alabama license while being a resident of Georgia and was sent to jail for four months of hard labor. After her husband's arrest, King believed he would not make it out alive and telephoned her friend Harris Wofford and cried while saying [...] "They're going to kill him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to kill him." [...] Directly after speaking with her, Wofford contacted Sargent Shriver in Chicago, where presidential candidate John F. Kennedy was campaigning at the time, and told Shriver of King's fears for her husband. After Shriver waited to be with Kennedy alone, he suggested that he telephone King and express sympathy. Kennedy called King, after agreeing with the proposal.|$|E

2500|$|Owen's wife, Eliza, {{said that}} one of the men wore {{civilian}} clothes and the four others wore RIC caps and carried revolvers. John McMahon, one of Owen's sons, said [...] "Four of the five men were dressed in the uniform of the RIC but, from their appearance, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> Specials, not regular RIC". All of the men had hidden their faces. The four men in police uniform rushed up the stairs and herded the males into the dining room. The women were taken into another room. Eliza [...] "got down on her knees and pleaded for mercy, but was struck {{on the side of the}} head and fell to the floor". When Owen asked why his family was being singled-out, one of the gunmen said it was because he was [...] "a respected papist". The men were told, [...] "you boys say your prayers", before the gunmen opened fire. The shooting continued for five minutes; five of the men were killed outright and two were wounded, one fatally.|$|E
6000|$|... "They won't harm us, mother," [...] {{said the}} younger woman huskily. [...] "They are friends. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> friends. Come, sit by me, mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a mystery. Many of your tricks {{can be done}} by our conjurers at home, {{but there}} are some that have never been solved." ...|$|E
60|$|JULIA.--Hush, hush! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> taken. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{you were}} very good to us. You helped my poor papa out of many a difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "How should <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> great {{fighters and}} unafraid?" [...] Tyee demanded, spurred to defence by {{recollection}} of the dark looks and vague complaints.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so lively," [...] remarked the giantess, as she crawled {{from beneath}} the table, [...] "we should have eaten them before this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, my friend. Since <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> here, there's an end on't. Show {{me where}} they are hid if you would save your own neck from the halter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not worried}} about them, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{worrying}} about us. They'll surely start back this morning; {{but they may not}} be able to reach us till night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So far as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> natives," [...] Malchus replied. [...] "The {{chief of}} the party is that man who lies {{bleeding}} there; {{he is one of}} your attendants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have {{you nothing}} to say?' she continued. 'Your {{footsteps}} were audible {{to me from}} the very bottom, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> yours. You look almost restored.' ...|$|R

2500|$|... "At {{that time}} {{no one had}} heard of the Beatles here (the US), but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> great writers so I just picked up on one of their songs," [...] Shannon said later.|$|R
6000|$|His merriness gladdened her. [...] "They {{are only}} little things," [...] she said, [...] "and I {{have grown to}} love them. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> flaws; but I love them because----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll take my chances!" [...] {{returned}} Uncle Barney. [...] "I've {{got those}} deeds, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all O. K. Now, you clear out--and don't you dare {{to come here}} again!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I guess so--anyway <b>they</b> <b>was</b> prowlin' {{around the}} hen house an' the barn. I called an' asked 'em {{what they wanted}} and they ran for dear life--so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>was</b> up to no good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The rascals!' said Latimer, getting {{now into}} a rage, {{though he had}} seemed quite meek when Stockdale first came up. ''Tis {{the same set of}} fellows. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Moynton chaps to a man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s no use finding {{fault with}} me," [...] said Fraser, quickly, {{as he stepped}} along beside him, [...] "so don’t try it. They came down into the cabin before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> aboard, even." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in force; but, {{what are}} the red-skins about? Is the hatchet buried, among the Six Nations, that you are {{satisfied}} with being a runner, when scalps may be had near Ticonderoga?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you don't}} like strangers?' laughed Birkin. 'I myself can never see why one should {{take account of}} people, just because {{they happen to be}} in the room with one: why SHOULD <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> there?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your word is sufficient, Mr. Pendennis," [...] {{the other}} {{said in his}} sad tone. [...] "You {{say they are not}} here, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not. And I hope they never have been here, and never will come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dears," [...] said Aunt Viney placidly, [...] "Mrs. Amador and I {{have always}} nodded to each other, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only {{waiting for the}} {{slightest}} encouragement. I gave it, and they're coming." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They {{can never}} walk comfortably {{along the bottom}} of a river, as they could on the bank, though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often talked of as doing it. They too, no doubt, empty their air-bags, to make going under water a little less difficult." ...|$|E
60|$|These, my worthy friend, are my ideas; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not far {{different}} from yours. It becomes a man of sense to think for himself, particularly in a case where all men are equally interested, and where, indeed, all men are equally in the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... “How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not afraid?” I queried {{a moment}} later, after having rowed {{a few more}} strokes along the beach. “Perhaps, if I were to step boldly ashore, they would cut for it, and I could not catch up with one.” And still I hesitated.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of {{continuing}} your recitals of travel?" [...] Walkirk said to me later in the day. [...] "I should think they would interest you, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> vastly interesting to me. You must have a great deal more to tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe the {{two things}} go together. Anyhow, I couldn't let her go. Besides, with this crowd about, it was well {{that she should have}} someone near to look after her. Then, when the cable came, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> bound to make a move." ...|$|R
