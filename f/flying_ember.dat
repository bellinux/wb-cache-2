Truly, the scene was one worthy of being viewed, and is not altogether unfit for description.|$|R

On that night, by {{the tower of}} Roquetes, outside Sant Andreu de Palomar the <b>flying</b> <b>embers</b> {{were said to be}} witches fleeing the smoke from the bonfires; the flying witches were said to take embers in their hands to try to light the mountain afire, but they would fail because of the virtue that all herbs were said to have on this night.

5000|$|On August 5, 1896 {{the town}} {{narrowly}} escaped total destruction by fire. The fire {{started in the}} two-story residence of John Churchill and spread rapidly, five residences and two large barns were destroyed. A high wind was blowing and at one time a dozen residences were ignited by <b>flying</b> <b>embers.</b> Washington at this time {{did not have an}} organized fire department and {{had it not been for}} the prompt assistance rendered by the fire crews of the Southern Pacific Railroad shops the entire town would have been consumed.|$|R
5000|$|... 520 {{was built}} by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in December 1916. While pulling freight from Altoona, Pennsylvania to Conway, Pennsylvania on November 14, 1942 during World War 2 the boiler on 520 {{exploded}} near Cresson. The explosion killed both the engineer and the brakeman, injured the fireman and conductor, and shattered windows on a nearby house. Two occupants of the house were also injured by scalding water and <b>flying</b> <b>embers,</b> which also set a rug on fire. The force of the blast derailed the tender and six tank cars. 520 was eventually repaired and placed back into service.|$|R
50|$|The fire's spread was {{aided by}} the city's use of wood as the {{predominant}} building material in a style called balloon frame. More than {{two thirds of the}} structures in Chicago {{at the time of the}} fire were made entirely of wood, with most of the houses and buildings being topped with highly flammable tar or shingle roofs. All of the city's sidewalks and many roads were also made of wood. Compounding this problem, Chicago had received only 1 in of rain from July 4 to October 9, causing severe drought conditions before the fire, while strong southwest winds helped to carry <b>flying</b> <b>embers</b> towards the heart of the city.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{environmental}} conditions, and the relative effectiveness of a given firebreak, firebreaks often have to be backed up with other firefighting efforts. Even then, it is still sometimes possible for fire to spread across a seemingly impenetrable divide. During {{the worst part of}} the fire season in southern California, strong Santa Ana winds will blow carpets of burning embers across eight-lane freeways. During the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park, hot embers managed to cross the Lewis Canyon, a natural canyon up to a mile wide and 600 feet (180 m) deep. In Australia, firebreaks are less effective against eucalyptus forest fires, since intense fires in tinder-dry eucalyptus forest spread through <b>flying</b> <b>embers,</b> which can be carried by the winds to trigger new blazes several kilometres away.|$|R
50|$|As {{they are}} driving, a luxurious {{roadside}} estate bursts into flames. The girls park {{the car and}} make sure that no one is trapped inside. In doing so, Nancy sees someone fleeing the property, and discovers an anonymous Swedish diary on the ground. She picks up this clue, and as firefighters and gawkers arrive on the scene, she notices an attractive young man moving her car away from the <b>flying</b> <b>embers.</b> At first suspicious of Ned Nickerson, Nancy warms to him when he helps her out of a jam. Ned proves to be a good friend, and is a perennial admirer of Nancy's from then on. Meanwhile, Mrs. Swenson's husband is missing, and she identifies his diary as the one picked up at the fire. To top it all off, the owner of the burned house, Felix Raybolt, is missing, and his wife claims Joe Swenson has murdered her husband. Raybolt, it turns out, swindles inventors like Swenson out of their patents and copyrights, and used one such invention to start the fire.|$|R
5000|$|This {{triangle}} {{would lose}} a leg on April 14, 1977, when a fire raged undetected at Garden State Park in the Colonial Room restaurant's kitchen during a racing program. Despite no functional firefighting system, the wooden grandstand would last {{long enough to}} allow more than 11,000 patrons and employees to escape the inferno. At 4:45 p.m., the walls and massive roof overhang of the grandstand {{gave way to the}} flames and reduced the structure to a smoking ruin. Despite the <b>flying</b> <b>embers</b> very nearly igniting The Rickshaw Inn across the street and the wooden barns & stables on the backstretch, the damage was contained to the massive grandstand complex. Three lives were lost in the fire- one patron (Ed Bucholski) and one employee were later found in the rubble- and one fire officer (McWilliams) {{died of a heart attack}} on-scene. But, the very next day, the vault with the previous days' [...] "take" [...] was opened, with the money intact; while outside on the track, horses continued to train.|$|R

2500|$|On August 19, {{the fire}} {{remained}} out of control, {{running along the}} ground and igniting crown fires in some areas as it moved forward. [...] As a result, residents of several subdivisions south and west of Sisters were ordered to evacuate their homes. During the day, firefighters continued to work fire lines on {{the north and east}} flanks of the blaze, trying to protect private property and the Whychus Creek watershed. [...] Crews cleared away ground fuels using heavy equipment and burn-out operations widened fire breaks. [...] They also suppressed numerous spot fires caused by <b>flying</b> <b>embers</b> carried on gusty winds. [...] In addition, air tankers made numerous retardant drops along the front line of the fire. [...] By the end of the day, firefighters had completed fire lines on the northeast and southeast corners. By August 20, the fire had grown to , but the 487 firefighters on scene had checked the fire's progress toward Sisters. [...] Cooler temperatures and higher humidity slowed the fire, allowing firefighters to close gaps in the north side fire line. [...] Crews cleared heavy fuels along the fire line using bulldozers and other heavy equipment while ground crews continue to burnout areas within the fire line to strengthen containment. During the day, four large air tankers and several helicopters were dedicated to the Milli Fire, supporting fire crews on the ground. [...] Reinforcements consisting of eight fire engines and two water tenders from the Oregon State Fire Marshal's office arrived and began clearing burnable materials from around evacuated homes south of Sisters. [...] During the day, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the Deschutes County Public Health Department issued an air quality warning, advising people in the Sisters area who are sensitive to smoke to stay indoor if possible.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of rural fires in Iowa shows that sparks ejected from house chimneys and falling on combustible roofs {{account for a}} large portion of the total fire waste. These sparks originate from soot deposits on the chimney wall, which upon being ignited are loosened and carried out by the chimney gases. If the combustion in the firebox were reasonably complete or if the chimney were kept clean by mechanical means, the soot accumulations would not occur. If the roof were of fireproof or fire-resisting material, the sparks would not constitute a serious problem as is now the case. The use of a spark arrester, as considered in this manuscript, is an attempt to remedy a bad situation. Spark arresters have been used successfully on locomotives and industrial chimneys for years. Their application to residences is comparatively recent and a different problem from their industrial use; spark arresters used with success industrially will not operate satisfactorily on dwellings. Therefore this study was made to discover the requirements of a domestic spark arrester. the suitability of a number being offered for sale and the possible design of one which might perform 2 ̆ 7 a better service. In density and in burning characteristics sparks of incandescent soot escaping from the chimney differ considerably from,wood <b>embers</b> <b>flying</b> from a burning building. The first section of this study was devoted to a determination of the source and character of these sparks and the condition under which they might ignite both new and weathered wood shingles. Investigations were made of flue gas velocities as may occur in domestic chimneys and those velocities necessary to expel soot particles of dangerous size...|$|R
5000|$|Fernow {{moved quickly}} to acquire a tract of land {{to serve as a}} {{demonstration}} forest and purchased some. Fernow's plan called for clearcutting the forestland at the rate of several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. He contracted with the Brooklyn Cooperage Company to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods. The years 1899, 1903, and 1908 were terrible years for forest fires in the Adirondacks. Many, tens of thousands of acres were consumed by forest fires. Most fires were started by sparks or <b>embers</b> <b>flying</b> from coal-burning locomotive stacks and landing on logging slash. Louis Marshall, with a summer residence at Knollwood Club on Lower Saranac Lake, branded locomotives as [...] "instruments of arson." [...] The worst sin of the lumbermen was the fire menace that they left behind, and which caused incalculable destruction. Nevertheless, Fernow had a 6 mi long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the Brooklyn Cooperage Company facility. The company turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into methanol and charcoal, through a process called destructive distillation. Historic charcoal kiln photo: [...] To his credit, Fernow established the first tree nursery in New York State at Axton, the site of an old lumber settlement originally called Axe-town. But most of the non-native conifer species he planted, such as norway spruce, did not do well for many years, with a denuded area as a result. Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's arrogant disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public. Fernow's actions drew criticism also from Adirondack guides such as Ellsworth Petty (father of Clarence Petty), who protested the plan and, in a letter writing campaign, successfully lobbied the State to assign a special [...] "Committee of the Adirondacks" [...] to tour the Axton site. In its findings, the commission concluded that [...] "the college has exceeded the original intention of the State when the tract was granted the university for conducting silvicultural experiments." ...|$|R
40|$|Fire, other disturbances, {{physical}} setting, weather, {{and climate}} shape {{the structure and}} function of forests throughout the Western United States. More than 80 years of fire research have shown that physical setting, fuels, and weather combine to determine wildfire intensity (the rate at which it consumes fuel) and severity (the effect fire has on vegetation, soils, buildings, watersheds, and so forth). Millions of acres of forestlands (mainly in dry forests dominated by ponderosa pine and/or Douglas-fir) contain a high accumulation of flammable fuels compared to conditions prior to the 20 th century. Forests with high stem density and fuel loading combined with extreme fire weather conditions have led to severe and large wildfires (such as those seen in the summers of 2000, 2002, and 2003) that have put {{a number of important}} values at risk. Although homes in the path of a wildfire are perhaps the most immediately recognized value, these wildfires also put numerous other human and ecological values at risk, such as power grids, drinking water supplies, firefighter safety, critical habitat, soil productivity, and air quality. For a given set of weather conditions, fire behavior is strongly influenced by stand and fuel structure. Crown fires in the dry forest types represent an increasing challenge for fire management as well as a general threat to the ecology of these forests and the closely associated human values. Crown fires are dependent on the sequence of available fuels starting from the ground surface to the canopy. Limiting crown fire in these forests can be accomplished by actions that manage in concert the surface, ladder, and crown fuels. Reducing crown fire and wildland fire growth across landscapes decreases the chances of developing large wildfires that affect human values adjacent to forested areas. However, a narrow focus on minimizing crown fire potential will not necessarily reduce the damage to homes and ecosystems when fires do occur. Homes are often ignited by <b>embers</b> <b>flying</b> far from the fire front, and by surface fires. Fire effects on ecosystems can also occur during surface fires where surface and understory fuels and deep organic layers are sufficient to generate high temperatures for long periods. Fuel treatments can help produce forest structures and fuel characteristics that then reduce the likelihood that wildfires will cause large, rapid changes in biophysical conditions. Fuel treatments can also help modify fire behavior sufficiently so that some wildfires can be suppressed more easily. Subsequent, sustained fuel treatments can maintain these conditions. Different fuel reduction methods target different components of the fuel bed. Thinning mainly affects standing vegetation, and other types of fuel treatments such as prescribed fire and pile burning woody fuels are needed to modify the combustion environment of surface fuels. In forests that have not experienced fire for many decades, multiple fuel treatments—that is, thinning and surface fuel reduction—may be required to significantly affect crown fire and surface fire hazard. Fuel treatments cannot guarantee benign fire behavior but can reduce the probability that extreme fire behavior will occur. Fuel treatments can be designed to restore forest conditions to a more resilient and resistant condition than now exists in many forests, and subsequent management could maintain these conditions, particularly in dry forests (ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir) where crown fires were historically infrequent. The degree of risk reduction will depend to some degree on the level of investment, social and economic acceptability of treatments, and concurrent consideration of other resource values (for example, wildlife). This report describes the kinds, quality, amount, and gaps of scientific knowledge for making informed decisions on fuel treatments used to modify wildfire behavior and effects in dry forests of the interior Western United States (especially forests dominated by ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir). A review of scientific principles and applications relevant to fuel treatment primarily for the dry forests is provided for the following topics: fuels, fire hazard, fire behavior, fire effects, forest structure, treatment effects and longevity, landscape fuel patterns, and scientific tools useful for management and planning...|$|R
