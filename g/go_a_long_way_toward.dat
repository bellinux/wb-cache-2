500|$|In 2009, Pond's autobiography, {{written in}} the two years before his death, was {{published}} by Hyoogen Press through the efforts of Chicago architect David Swan. [...] At the time of the autobiography's release, architecture historian Robert Bruegmann opined that the Pond brothers [...] "have remained relatively obscure because they didn't fit in with narratives that wished to see Chicago architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a prelude to European modernism of the 1920s." [...] Nevertheless, Bruegmann noted that [...] "Chicago architecture was always a great deal more than that" [...] and expressed his satisfaction that the publication of Pond's autobiography [...] "should <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> bringing back into focus one of America's most interesting and important architectural practices." ...|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Salon.com and The Scotsman. Louis Bayard of Salon.com {{disagreed}} with the delivery of the final chapter, on ecological debt, writing that Atwood [...] "forsakes artistic engagement for ideological reflex". William Skidelsky in The Guardian agreed that the chapter was [...] "by no means {{the highlight of the}} book". [...] He also wrote: [...] "Because Atwood constantly veers off in new directions she doesn't always give herself time to sink her claws deep into a topic. The result is that, although Payback is packed with information, it can seem oddly thin... Still, Atwood's enthusiasm for her subject and lively style <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> making up for these flaws. She can be a brilliant phrase-maker, and has a gift for summing up an idea with a single vivid image." [...] Allan Massie, reviewing for The Scotsman, could not find a coherent argument being presented and found her writing style [...] "veering uncomfortably between the academic and the jokily colloquial, [...] tiresome, [...] some of her writing is pretentious, much obvious and platitudinous". The reviewers in Salon.com and The Scotsman, as well as The Economist, were all uncomfortable with Atwood not distinguishing or contrasting 'good' and 'bad' debt.|$|E

500|$|God of War: Ghost of Sparta was {{received}} positively by various media outlets. Nicole Tanner of IGN stated {{that in terms}} of gameplay, [...] "there's nothing unique here, but that's not a bad thing." [...] 1UP's Chris Pereira said that the controls are [...] "largely the same" [...] as Chains of Olympus, but it [...] "is still an extremely well-paced action game." [...] He said that it is put together so well that it is worth playing, [...] "unless you've become truly tired of the franchise". Joystiq's Randy Nelson stated that the scope of the game seems like it [...] "was planned for release on consoles", but [...] "if you were hoping for something really innovative, you're out of luck." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer stated that [...] "the other core fighting mechanics are familiar, but the tweaks <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> improving gameplay". [...] stated [...] " [...] Sparta offers an immersive experience on par with many of the best PS3 games". Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised the battle system as strong, however, he stated [...] "There is a sense that Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series" [...] and claimed that it is [...] "best enjoyed by newcomers" [...] or [...] "those yet to play" [...] God of War III.|$|E

[...] If higher Jewish enrollment provoked greater prejudice against them, he asked, [...] "How can we cause the Jews to feel and be regarded {{as an integral part of}} the student body?" [...] He also suggested that Harvard would not be facing this issue if other universities and colleges would admit Jews in similar numbers: [...] "If every college in the country would take a limited proportion of Jews, I suspect we should <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> eliminating race feeling among the students." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Hilburn of The Los Angeles Times favorably {{reviewed}} the tour, exclaiming [...] "There {{is so much}} of the ambition and glamour of a Broadway musical in Janet Jackson's new Velvet Rope Tour that it's only fitting that the concert program credits her as the show's creator and director." [...] Although [...] "those aren't terms normally employed in the pop-rock world", Hilburn applauded Jackson's credibility in portraying [...] "a dazzling package, complete with snappy choreography, a colorful array of costumes and often striking staging." [...] Hilburn observed [...] "there were several moments in the show when Jackson stepped beyond the production values and touched us in a way the best pop performers have done over the years." [...] Emphasis was placed on the [...] "playfulness of the fairy tale staging" [...] of [...] "Escapade", the [...] "artful musical stretch" [...] of [...] "Got 'Til It's Gone", and the intimacy of [...] "soul-searching" [...] ballad [...] "Special", adding [...] "Jackson has put a personal stamp on this show that humanizes not only the music but also the performer too." [...] Jackson's [...] "radiance and warmth" [...] was believed {{to be the result of}} [...] "her own new-found self esteem", overcoming some of the insecurities plaguing her since childhood. Upon the show's encore Jackson [...] "lingered, clinging to the thunderous applause" [...] in a way which [...] "demonstrated a personal vulnerability and warmth", considered its [...] "real breakthrough." [...] Hilburn stated [...] "the tour and album should <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> helping Jackson finally get the credit she deserves as an artist." [...] The tour's [...] "computer design-phase" [...] was considered [...] "a marvel of precision" [...] by Tom Moon of The Inquirer. Its [...] "eerie, robotic aura of a video game" [...] was thought to be complimented by pyrotechnics detonated [...] "At all the right, surprising moments", a troupe of [...] "lockstep" [...] dancers likened to [...] "a phalanx of marching insects", and [...] "stylized stage sets", ranging from [...] "a child's nursery to a swing-era street scene." [...] The show's lengthy [...] "high-concept medleys" [...] and [...] "power-as-aphrodisiac theme" [...] where analyzed to be commanding and accentuated her physical presence, ripping off her blouse with [...] "theatrical grandeur." [...] Additionally, Jackson's rapid [...] "clockwork" [...] movement was thought to be [...] "high price", declared as nearly mechanical in certain segments. Moon declared [...] "The audience cheered throughout the lavish production; the glossy, every-note-in-its-place music hardly mattered: This was Janet, the noted control freak.
