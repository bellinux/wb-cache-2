5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be <b>humanised</b> while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be <b>humanised,</b> too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably {{excluded}} from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
5|$|In the late-13th century, many of {{the newly}} {{emerging}} painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a <b>humanised</b> Virgin and Child, {{as suggested by the}} realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|Potter's {{adolescence}} was a {{quiet as}} her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed {{her to be a}} permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She wanted to lead a useful life independent of her parents and considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of <b>humanised</b> animals to a greeting card publisher.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} <b>humanising</b> {{approach}} to students’ experience of law school. The impetus {{for such an}} approach is research that suggests that law students’ well-being is negatively impacted by the dominant analytical-adversarial paradigm of legal education. The <b>humanising</b> approach proposed is adapted from scholarship and practice in alternative (appropriate) dispute resolution (ADR) and centralises the concept of “relationships” as a <b>humanising</b> feature of an alternative paradigm for legal education...|$|R

It then offers an overview of the <b>humanising</b> framework, its background and embodiment in the undergraduate nursing curriculum.

25|$|Four major {{antibody}} {{types that}} have been developed are murine, chimeric, <b>humanised</b> and human. Antibodies of each type are distinguished by suffixes on their name.|$|E
25|$|<b>Humanised</b> {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by grafting murine hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. This results in a molecule of approximately 95% human origin. <b>Humanised</b> antibodies bind antigen much more weakly than the parent murine monoclonal antibody, with reported decreases in affinity of up to several hundredfold. Increases in antibody-antigen binding strength have been achieved by introducing mutations into the complementarity determining regions (CDR), using techniques such as chain-shuffling, randomization of complementarity-determining regions and antibodies with mutations within the variable regions induced by error-prone PCR, E. coli mutator strains and site-specific mutagenesis.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Gregory Paul Winter [...] (born 14 April 1951) is a British biochemist, {{a pioneer}} of {{therapeutic}} monoclonal antibodies. He invented techniques to both <b>humanise</b> (1986) and, later, to fully <b>humanise</b> using phage display, antibodies for therapeutic uses. Previously, antibodies had been derived from mice, which made them difficult to use in human therapeutics because the human immune system had anti-mouse reactions to them.|$|R

25|$|Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela {{originally}} {{coined the}} concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference. This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann's systems theory transcends the classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising {{a solution to the}} problem of the <b>humanised</b> 'subject'.|$|E
25|$|During {{a battle}} against the body-stealing Ophidians and their {{gigantic}} snake-shaped techno-organic warship, the Doctor and Izzy encountered a brash and adventurous fish-woman called Destrii. While seemingly friendly and bonding with Izzy, Destrii was secretly on the run and she swapped bodies with Izzy to cover her escape; when Destrii was seemingly killed, Izzy seemed trapped within an alien body. The Doctor's next few journeys were spent trying to help her in this situation, both in {{coming to terms with}} the change and finding out what her new body's abilities were. Frida Kahlo helped Izzy mentally deal with the change, but the attempt at testing Izzy's abilities led her and the Doctor into a turbulent encounter with the <b>humanised</b> Daleks he had created in his second incarnation. Unable to prevent their tragic end – self-destructing to escape the machinations of the malevolent psychic Kata-Phobus -, the two of them were distracted and caught off-guard when Helioth and Hassana, two of the energy-beings called the Horde, abducted Izzy thinking she was Destrii.|$|E
500|$|Like many fairy tales, Jemima Puddle-Duck {{belongs in}} a remote, but not-too-distant, past. Jemima's shawl {{reflects}} the typical farm dress of the Lake District {{at the time}} of the tale's composition, but the poke bonnet does not, and the fox's long tail coat and exquisite manners also suggest another time. Jemima is a more interesting character when <b>humanised</b> with the clothing; without it, she is just a farmyard duck. As Potter pointed out, the tale is a revision of a fairy tale and belongs in the indefinite period of [...] "once upon a time".|$|E

500|$|In 1900 Beatrix Potter revised a {{tale about}} a <b>humanised</b> rabbit {{she had written}} in 1893, worked up a dummy book in {{imitation}} of the small format bestseller Little Black Sambo (1899), and, after multiple rejections from London publishers, privately published her tale in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. was eager {{to compete in the}} burgeoning and lucrative small format children's book market, and accepted the [...] "bunny book" [...] (as the firm called it) after their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke gave it his enthusiastic endorsement. Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours, and in October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, as Casino Royale entered post-production, Eon Productions {{announced}} that the next film {{would be based on}} an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson. In June 2007 Marc Forster was confirmed as director. He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen Casino Royale prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been <b>humanised</b> in that film, arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character. Forster found Casino Royales 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be [...] "tight and fast... like a bullet".|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in South Africa, Haggard {{developed}} an intense hatred for the Boers, but also came to admire the Zulus. However, his admiration of the Zulus did not extend to other African peoples; rather, he shared many of the assumptions that underlay contemporary Victorian politics and philosophy, such as those expressed by James Hunt, the President of the Anthropological Society of London: [...] "the Negro is inferior intellectually to the European... can only be <b>humanised</b> and civilised by Europeans. The analogies are far more numerous between the Negro and apes, than between the European and apes." [...] The Victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the 'darker races' made them {{the object of a}} civilising impulse in the European Scramble for Africa. Although disenchanted with the colonial effort, Haggard remained committed to this ideology. He believed that the British [...] "alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty".|$|E

Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon.

500|$|Koushik Banerjea, a {{sociologist}} in the London School of Economics, notes that Sholay exhibits a [...] "sympathetic construction of 'rogue' masculinity" [...] {{exemplified by the}} likeable outlaws Jai and Veeru. Banerjea argues during the film, the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes. Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought [...] "a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order" [...] to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot {{and the application of}} Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are <b>humanised</b> by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{their low}} status, some retiarii became quite popular {{throughout}} the early Empire. The fact that spectators could see net-fighters' faces <b>humanised</b> them and probably added to their popularity. At Pompeii, graffiti tells of Crescens or Cresces the retiarius, [...] "lord of the girls" [...] and [...] "doctor to nighttime girls, morning girls, {{and all the}} rest." [...] Evidence suggests that some homosexual men fancied gladiators, and the retiarius would have been particularly appealing. Roman art depicts net-men just as often as other types. A mosaic found in 2007 in a bathhouse at the Villa dei Quintili shows a retiarius named Montanus. The fact that his name is recorded indicates that the gladiator was famous. The mosaic dates to c. CE130, when the Quintilii family had the home built; the emperor Commodus, who fought in gladiatorial bouts as a secutor, acquired the house in CE182 and {{used it as a}} country villa. In modern times, popular culture has made the retiarius probably the most famous type of gladiator.|$|E
40|$|As {{technology}} increasingly {{plays a role}} {{in improving}} the lives of an aging population, this paper argues that it {{is the role of the}} creative disciplines to <b>humanise</b> technological developments. Roger Coleman describes how the establishment of DesignAge at the Royal College of Art led to an approach which unified different fields of study: gerontology, art and design, market research, sociology, ergonomics and others. The author provides examples of cross-disciplinary projects with a ‘human-centred approach’. He concludes that the <b>humanising</b> of technology will always remain the province of the creative disciplines, and that to pursue this aim successfully requires a contextual and cross-disciplinary approach, not a narrow and specialised one...|$|R

40|$|In {{order for}} {{consumers}} to connect emotionally with brands, brands must be transformed from inanimate entities {{into the realm of}} acquiring human characteristics. Following a review of more than 1000 breweries from online sources and beer companion books, we explore how a sense of place, derived from myths, folklores, and heroes, enables marketers and consumers to co-create narratives that <b>humanise</b> brands. We add to the theory on brand humanisation as we conclude that a sense of place offers a novel, and different, approach to humanisation strategies based on anthropomorphisation, personification, and user imagery, but can also operate in tandem with them. Further research is recommended to understand how and why consumers respond to branding strategies that use a sense of place to <b>humanise</b> brands...|$|R
500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of the New Mexico State University {{writes in}} Beatrix Potter (1986) that the tale is about {{housekeeping}} {{and dealing with}} insect pests in the home, and points out that it reflects Potter's pride and pleasure in keeping her house at Hill Top tidy. Tales about <b>humanised</b> mice came easily to Potter, but, unlike the urban mice in The Tailor of Gloucester and The Tale of Two Bad Mice, Mrs. Tittlemouse is a country mouse living beneath a hedge somewhere near Potter's Sawrey. With its narrow passages, small rooms, low ceilings, and well-stocked storerooms, Mrs. Tittlemouse's dwelling is similar to Potter's own at Hill Top. The author's obvious approval of Mrs. Tittlemouse's fastidious housekeeping has its source in her own pleasure in keeping her farmhouse neat, and (like Mrs. Tittlemouse) in being the mistress of her domain. [...] Mrs. Tittlemouse's abhorrence of insect pests reflects Potter's own, but the artist in Potter preserves their beauty in the illustrations [...] she does not censor their antennae or their groping limbs. [...] Potter thought girls would like the tale best, and would experience {{the same sort of}} reaction to insect pests she did [...] to wit, complete horror and disgust.|$|E
