60|$|The {{nature and}} {{relations}} of plants which are fertilised {{by the wind}} have been admirably discussed by Delpino and Hermann Muller; and I have already made some remarks {{on the structure of}} their flowers in contrast with those of <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species.</b> (10/42. Delpino 'Ult. Osservazioni sulla Dicogamia' part 2 fasc. 1 1870 and 'Studi sopra un Lignaggio anemofilo' etc. 1871. Hermann Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. pages 412, 442. Both these authors remark that plants must have been anemophilous before they were entomophilous. Hermann Muller further discusses in a very interesting manner the steps by which entomophilous flowers became nectariferous and gradually acquired their present structure through successive beneficial changes.) There is good {{reason to believe that the}} first plants which appeared on this earth were cryptogamic; and judging from what now occurs, the male fertilising element must either have possessed the power of spontaneous movement through the water or over damp surfaces, or have been carried by currents of water to the female organs. That some of the most ancient plants, such as ferns, possessed true sexual organs there can hardly be a doubt; and this shows, as Hildebrand remarks, at how early a period the sexes were separated. (10/43. 'Die Geschlechter-Vertheilung' 1867 pages 84-90.) As soon as plants became phanerogamic and grew on the dry ground, if they were ever to intercross, it would be indispensable that the male fertilising element should be transported by some means through the air; and the wind is the simplest means of transport. There must also have been a period when winged insects did not exist, and plants would not then have been rendered entomophilous. Even at a somewhat later period the more specialised orders of the Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, which are now chiefly concerned with the transport of pollen, did not exist. Therefore the earliest terrestrial plants known to us, namely, the Coniferae and Cycadiae, no doubt were anemophilous, like the existing species of these same groups. A vestige of this early state of things is likewise shown by some other groups of plants which are anemophilous, as these on the whole stand lower in the scale than <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dioecious plants, however fertilised, {{have a great}} {{advantage}} over other plants in their cross-fertilisation being assured. But this advantage is gained {{in the case of}} anemophilous species {{at the expense of the}} production of an enormous superfluity of pollen, with some risk to them and to <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> of their fertilisation occasionally failing. Half the individuals, moreover, namely, the males, produce no seed, and this might possibly be a disadvantage. Delpino remarks that dioecious plants cannot spread so easily as monoecious and hermaphrodite species, for a single individual which happened to reach some new site could not propagate its kind; but it may be doubted whether this is a serious evil. Monoecious plants can hardly fail to be to a large extent dioecious in function, owing to the lightness of their pollen and to the wind blowing laterally, with the great additional advantage of occasionally or often producing some self-fertilised seeds. When they are also dichogamous, they are necessarily dioecious in function. Lastly, hermaphrodite plants can generally produce at least some self-fertilised seeds, and they are at the same time capable, through the various means specified in this chapter, of cross-fertilisation. When their structure absolutely prevents self-fertilisation, they are in the same relative position to one another as monoecious and dioecious plants, with what may be an advantage, namely, that every flower is capable of yielding seeds.|$|E
6000|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{quantity and}} lightness of the pollen of anemophilous plants {{are no doubt}} both necessary, as their pollen has generally to be carried to the stigmas of other and often distant flowers; for, as we shall soon see, most anemophilous plants have their sexes separated. The fertilisation of these plants is generally aided by the stigmas being of large size or plumose; {{and in the case}} of the Coniferae, by the naked ovules secreting a drop of fluid, as shown by Delpino. Although the number of anemophilous species is small, as the author just quoted remarks, the number of individuals is large in comparison with that of <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species.</b> This holds good especially in cold and temperate regions, where insects are not so numerous as under a warmer climate, and where consequently entomophilous plants are less favourably situated. We see this in our forests of Coniferae and other trees, such as oaks, beeches, birches, ashes, etc.; and in the Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, which clothe our meadows and swamps; all these trees and plants being fertilised by the wind. As a large quantity of pollen is wasted by anemophilous plants, it is surprising that so many vigorous species of this kind abounding with individuals should still exist in any part of the world; for if they had been rendered entomophilous, their pollen would have been transported by the aid of the senses and appetites of insects with incomparably greater safety than by the wind. That such a conversion is possible can hardly be doubted, from the remarks lately made on the existence of intermediate forms; and apparently it has been effected in the group of willows, as we may infer from the nature of their nearest allies.

40|$|The Pampa {{grassland}} of Argentina {{is one of}} {{the most}} highly threatened biomes in the world. A hig hproportion of the original grassland cover has been transformed into land for agriculture or degraded. In the southern part of the region, fragmented semi-natural grasslands over exposed rock still persist and connectivity between them is assumed to be crucial for maintaining viable populations. We quantiﬁed overall connectivity of grassland patches in a sector of the Southern Pampa region, and investigated the degree to which landscape connectivity explains <b>entomophilous</b> plant <b>species</b> assemblages in a subset of patches. We characterized each of the 301 patches in the landscape by their degree of intra-patch and inter-patch connectivity based on graph theory,and considering threshold dispersal distances from 100 to 1000 m. We surveyed <b>entomophilous</b> plant <b>species</b> in 39 grassland patches and classiﬁed the species in three categories (annual herbs, perennial herbs and shrubs) considering their different growth form and longevity. The inﬂuence of connectivity variables on <b>entomophilous</b> plant <b>species</b> assemblages variation was explored using Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Although grassland patches were poorly connected at all threshold distances, some of them were found to be critical for global connectivity. Connectivity signiﬁcantly explained total, annual-biennial and shrub assemblages for all threshold dispersal distances (6 – 13 % of total variation). Variation in annual species assemblages was associated with intra-patch and inter-patch connectivity at short distance (100 m), while variation in shrub species assemblages was explained by intra-patch and inter-patch connectivity for distances between 100 m and 1000 m. This study evidenced the low connectivity of the study system, allowed the identiﬁcation of critical areas for conservation, and provided valuable information to develop management strategies in increasingly human-dominated landscapesJRC.

50|$|Most Rubiaceae are zoophilous. <b>Entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> produce nectar from an epigynous disk at {{the base}} of the corolla tube to attract insects. Ornithophily is rare and is found in red-flowered species of Alberta, Bouvardia, and Burchellia. Anemophylous species are found in the tribes Anthospermeae and Theligoneae and are {{characterized}} by hermaphroditic and/or unisexual flowers that exhibit a set of specialized features, such as striking sexual dimorphism, increased receptive surface of the stigmas and pendulous anthers.|$|E
50|$|Eremophila {{includes}} <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species,</b> {{with flowers}} adapted to attract insects, and ornithophilous species, with flowers that attract birds. Entomophilous flowers have protruding lower lips, which provide a landing area for insects, {{and they are}} often blue, purple, or white. Bird-adapted flowers are red, orange, yellow, or green, and have lobes pointing downwards which discourages insects. Bird pollinated species also tend to have longer stamens, which brush pollen onto and off the bird's head as it feeds. The fruits are eaten by emus, which disperse the seeds in their droppings although the belief that this aids in the germination of the seeds is mistaken.|$|E
50|$|Zoophily {{is a form}} of {{pollination}} whereby pollen {{is transferred}} by animals, usually vertebrates but may include invertebrates, particularly by hummingbirds and other birds, and bats, but also by monkeys, marsupials, lemurs, bears, rabbits, deer, rodents, lizards and other animals. Zoomophilous species, like <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species,</b> frequently evolve mechanisms to make themselves more appealing to the particular type of pollinator, e.g. brightly colored or scented flowers, nectar, and appealing shapes and patterns. These plant animal relationships are often mutually beneficial because of the food source provided in exchange for pollination. Zoophilous species include Arctium, Acaena, and Galium aparinePollination is defined as the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma (Worldnet). There are many vectors for pollination, including abiotic (wind and water), and biotic (animal). There are different benefits and costs associated with any vector type. For instance, using animal pollination is beneficial because the process is more directed and often results in pollination. At the same time it is costly for the plant to produce rewards, such as nectar, to attract animal pollinators. Not producing such rewards is one benefit of using abiotic pollinators, but a cost associated with this approach is that the pollen may be distributed somewhat randomly. In general, pollination by vertebrates occurs when the animal reaches inside the flowers for nectar. While feeding on the nectar, the animal rubs or touches the stamens and is covered in pollen. Some of this pollen will be deposited on the stigma of the next flower it visits, pollinating the flower (Missouri Botanical Garden 2006).|$|E
25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. <b>Entomophilous</b> plant <b>species</b> have frequently evolved mechanisms {{to make themselves}} more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of anemophilous (wind-pollinated) plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{pollination}} biology or breeding systems of <b>entomophilous</b> plant <b>species</b> in salt-marsh habitats. In the present study, the pollination biology of the perennial halophyte Frankenia pauciflora DC. var. gunnii Summerh. (Frankeniaceae) was investigated in a salt marsh near Goolwa, South Australia. The flowering peak of this species occurs in summer and flowers are visited by a diverse array of insects in the Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. An experiment was performed to test for the presence of pollen limitation in the field. Flowers to which outcross pollen was added produced significantly more fruits and significantly more seeds per fruit than did unmanipulated control flowers. Average seed weight per fruit did not differ significantly between control and pollen-addition flowers. In glasshouse experiments,flowers towhich cross-pollenwas added produced significantlymore fruit than didflowers towhich self-pollen was added, suggesting the presence of a facultatively xenogamous breeding system...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine if the pollination vector influences the potential floral emissions of flowering plants. We hypothesized that flowers pollinated by insects would emit significantly higher amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and would present a higher diversity of these compounds than flowers pollinated by wind. The floral emissions of fifteen <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> and eleven anemophilous species were captured by dynamic headspace sampling under field conditions and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. We searched for differences in the emission profiles between anemophilous and entomophilous flowers by considering the effects of phylogeny in our analysis. The floral emissions from the two groups were significantly different. <b>Entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> presented highly diverse emissions in both magnitude of emission rates and richness of compounds depending on the species, but overall, the flowers from <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> had much higher VOC emission rates and VOC richness, both for terpenes and benzenoid compounds, than those from anemophilous species (two orders of magnitude higher emissions). The data thus confirm that the presence of intensely scented flowers with complex scents is strongly related to biotic pollination...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to preliminarily {{identify}} the pollination syndromes of plant species in a fragment of the Caatinga, in the municipality of Serrita, Pernambuco, Brazil. A floristic survey was conducted during March 2014 in a 900 m² area. The morphology and floral attributes of the species were characterized (e. g., color and size of flowers, anthesis, presence of floral resources). The sets of floral parameters identified were used to determine their respective pollination syndromes. Entomophily was the most frequent pollination system, occurring in 76. 12 % of the species, followed by ornithophily (17. 91 %) and chiropterophily (5. 97 %).

40|$|Summary: New Zealand {{flowers are}} {{frequently}} considered unspecialised allowing {{easy access to}} pollen and nectar by {{a wide range of}} visitors. Most conform with a syndrome of insect pollination (entomophily). Pollination of forest flowers by birds has been described for a range of species whose flowers are morphologically ornithophilous. On Kapiti Island and Little Barrier Island, all three species of New Zealand honeyeaters have been described feeding on flowers currently assumed to be entomophilous or where the pollination system is unknown. The persistence and regularity of visits suggests that the birds are obtaining suitable rewards in the form of nectar and could be serving as pollinators.

40|$|The {{work was}} {{supported}} by a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement grant (DEB‐ 9411513), by the Society for Sigma Xi, and by a Hutcheson Memorial Forest grant. According to Bateman's principle, male fitness in <b>entomophilous</b> plant <b>species</b> should be limited by mating opportunity, which is influenced by the size or number of flowers. We determined male-specific fitness consequences of floral phenotype in andromonoecious Solanum carolinense, examined the relationship between male and female reproductive success within plants, and evaluated the distribution of functional gender among plants. A maximum likelihood-based paternity analysis, based on multilocus allozyme phenotypes of parents and offspring from four experimental plots, was used to determine male reproductive success and its relationship to floral phenotype. Male success was enhanced by an increase in the proportion of male flowers produced but not by an increase in total flower number, even though all flowers contain male parts. Larger flower size increased male success in only one plot. Male and female reproductive success were negatively correlated, and plants varied in functional gender from completely female to completely male. This gender specialization may occur because hermaphroditic and male flowers differ in their ability to contribute to male and female success. Although sex allocation theory predicts a positive relationship between the size or number of plant parts and reproductive success, this study indicates that aspects of floral morphology that affect gender specialization should also be considered.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} effects of plant and insect diversity on pollination of wild plant species. As biodiversity is decreasing due to human activities, {{it is important to}} know {{the effects of}} lower species richness on ecosystem functioning. One such ecosystem function is pollination by insects. The main question of the thesis therefore is: Is a high biodiversity important for the pollination of <b>entomophilous</b> wild plant <b>species</b> in agricultural, fragmented landscapes? Both field surveys (descriptive analyses) and experiments (garden and field) were used. In the field surveys, the diversity of flowering plants and their flower visitors were measured with transects of road verges and ditch banks, situated in landscapes differing in agricultural land use. Furthermore, experiments with potted plants of a number of selected species were performed. The effects of land use on plant and insect diversity were analysed, and subsequently the effects of these diversities on flower visitation, insect behaviour, pollination and seed set. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} red/orange flowers in four putatively bird-pollinated species of Macaronesian Lotus, {{with the aim of}} investigating whether this floral trait evolved from a similar trait found in some <b>entomophilous</b> Lotus <b>species,</b> namely the ability to modify flower color to red after anthesis. First, we mapped the ability to modify flower color in this group on a well-resolved and densely sampled phylogenetic tree of the Macaronesian Lotus. Secondly, we determined differences in light reflectance and pigment composition between petals of (1) prechange and postchange flowers in bee-pollinated species and (2) between bee and putatively bird-pollinated species. Post-anthesis flower color change evolved three times within Macaronesian Lotus, and putatively bird-pollinated species evolved within a clade with this ability to change flower color to red after anthesis. The evolutionary transition to red/orange flowers in the putatively bird-pollinated species involved biochemical changes {{similar to those of the}} developmental transition to red postchange flowers. In both cases there are changes in the composition of flavonols and anthocyanidins within the same metabolic pathways, especially in the cyanidin branch of pigment production, but not the activation or inactivation of additional branches of this pathway. Post-anthesis color change in Lotus, from yellow to red, is thought to be an adaptation to reduce bee visits to already pollinated flowers. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that constitutive red coloration for bird-pollination evolved from facultative red flower color change in Lotus. As red post-anthesis coloration is widespread in plants, this may possibly represent a widespread exaptive mechanism for the evolution of bird pollination. © 2013. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the growing}} {{consensus}} on {{the positive effect of}} biodiversity on ecosystem functioning (Balvanera et al. 2006; Cardinale et al. 2012), species richness and loss are among the simplest and most used measures of habitats evaluation. Species diversity in a plant community is assumed to be determined by two sets of factors. The first refers to the “species pool”, i. e. the set of propagules able to reach a site. The second comprises local ecological interactions and select species from the pool that are able to coexist. In this ‘community filter’, both abiotic and biotic factors operate. Among biotic factors facilitation may increase the diversity of a community (Stachowicz, 2001). Such enhancement can be produced through facilitation via shared pollinators among co-flowering <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species.</b> We evaluated the role of flowering synchrony in determining species richness and coverage at the community level in dry meadows (Festuco-Brometea) (Habitat 6210). In particular we tested if 1. there is a non-random flowering pattern at the community level; 2. both the presence and percentage cover of different insect-pollinated species are affected by flowering synchrony. The study was carried out in the Euganei Hills district (NE Italy). 45 plots (2 x 2 m) were randomly placed over dry meadows and data on species richness and percentage cover were collected. Flowering phenology of all <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> was monitored every 10 days during the growing season (April, 1 st to September, 30 th 2013). Flowering was considered started when the first flower opened on an individual plant and terminated when individuals no longer possessed flowers with anthers (Dante et al., 2013). To estimate flowering time overlap at the community level a mean Co-flowering index (V score; Lepš, Šmilauer, 2003) was performed between all possible pairs of monitored species. The significance of flowering overlap pattern was tested using a null model (Gotelli, Graves, 1996). For each plot a Co-flowering index was than computed. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to test for a relationship between the V score and the number (and percentage cover) of insect-pollinated species per plot. Species were classified in six groups according to Müeller’s (1881) classification, which groups nectariferous flowers according to the depth of nectar display. Six classes were recognized as follows: a) pollen flowers, b) flowers with exposed nectar, c) flowers with partly hidden nectar, d) flowers with totally hidden nectar, e) Hymenoptera flowers and f) Lepidoptera flowers. Only rough groups of pollinators are assigned to the first four groups, which differ in length of proboscis, while smaller pollinator range characterizes classes e) and f). A non random flowering pattern has been observed at the community level among <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> (pvalue< 0. 001). In particular, richness and percentage cover of Hymenoptera flowers turned out to be positive related to Coflowering index (p= 0. 001 and p= 0. 02 respectively), while no significant correlations were observed for the other groups of species. In conclusion, our results show that flowering synchrony may {{play an important role in}} controlling and enhancing Hymenoptera pollinated species richness in Euganean dry meadows...|$|E
40|$|Questions: In animal-mediated pollination, pollinators can be {{regarded}} as a limiting resource for which entomophilous plant species might interact to assure pollination, an event pivotal for their reproduction and population maintenance. At community level, spatially aggregated co-flowering species can thus be expected to exhibit suitable suites of traits to avoid competition and ensure pollination. We explored the problem by answering the following questions: (i) are co-flowering species specialized on different guilds of pollinators? (ii) do co-flowering pollinator-sharing species segregate spatially? (iii) do co-flowering pollinator-sharing species that diverge in anther position spatially aggregate more than those that converge in anther position? Study site: Euganean Hills (NE Italy). Methods: Plant composition, flowering phenology and interactions between each entomophilous plant species and pollinating insects were monitored every fifteen days in 40 permanent plots placed in an area of 16 ha. We quantified the degree of flowering synchrony, pollinator-sharing and spatial aggregation between each pair of <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species.</b> We then tested the relationship between the degree of co-flowering, pollinator-sharing and spatial aggregation, and between spatial aggregation and anther position. Results: <b>Entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> converged, at least partially in flowering time, and the phenological synchronization of flowering was significantly associated with the sharing of pollinator guilds. Coflowering pollinator-sharing species segregated spatially. Furthermore, co-flowering pollinatorsharing species that diverged in anther position aggregated more than those that converged in anther position. Conclusions: Reproductive traits that facilitate the coexistence of co-flowering species include specialization on different pollinator guilds and a phenological displacement of the flowering time. Furthermore, in circumstances of increased competition due to phenological synchronization, pollinator sharing and spatial aggregation, the chance of an effective pollination might depend on differences in anther position, resulting in a divergent pollen placement on pollinators’ body. One of the most interesting results we obtained is that the presence of one mechanism does not preclude the operation of others and each plant species can simultaneously exhibit different strategies. Although more studies are needed, our results can provide additional information about plant-plant interactions and add new insights into mechanisms allowing the coexistence of a high number of plant species into local communities...|$|E
40|$|It is {{essential}} to understand the patterns of pollen dispersal in remnant vegetation occupying highly disturbed landscapes {{in order to provide}} sustainable management options and to inform restoration programs. Direct and indirect methods of paternity analysis were used to detect genetic contamination via inter-subspecific pollen dispersal from a planted stand of nonlocal Acacia saligna ssp. saligna (ms) into remnant roadside patches of local A. saligna ssp. lindleyi (ms). Genetic contamination was detected in 25. 5 % (indirect paternity assignment) to 32 % (direct paternity assignment) of ssp. lindleyi progeny and occurred over a distance of 1. 6 km.

Hummingbird visitation was recorded at three ornithophilous and eleven non-ornithophilous species. Flower density was roughly constant during the study period, with the density of non-ornithophilous flowers being {{higher than that of}} ornithophilous ones. Mean values of nectar volume and concentration were similar between ornithophilous and non-ornithophilous species. Eight hummingbird species were observed at PSP: Amazilia fimbriata, Anthracothorax nigricollis, Chlorostilbon lucidus, Eupetomena macroura, Hylocharis chrysura, Florisuga fusca, Thalurania furcata and an unidentified species. Hummingbird visit frequencies to ornithophilous and non-ornithophilous flowers were similar. However, some non-ornithophilous species received a higher number of visits, which seems to be related to their large number of open flowers per plant per day. The number of feedings bouts of hummingbirds increased with the total number of flowers observed per focal plant. All recorded species of hummingbirds visited non-ornithophilous flowers, predominantly melittophilous and generalised <b>entomophilous</b> flowers.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the anthophilous fauna of N. W. Europe is presented, stressing the role plants play for insects. The study is based on some 29, 000 relations between about 2, 600 insect species and 1, 300 plant species (569 genera). The data are derived from our database (“CrypTra”) of biotic relations between Cryptobiota and Tracheophyta, {{that is based on}} published sources. It is suggested that a ratio of 2 to 5 anthophilous insect <b>species</b> per <b>entomophilous</b> plant <b>species</b> is the rule in N. W. Europe, where other types of zoophily are virtually absent. A small minority of the plant species/genera play a disproportionally important role as hosts to flower visitors; many of these so-called cornucopian taxa belong to the commonest entomophilous plants in the region, and occur also in moderately disturbed habitats. There is a significant positive correlation between the commonness of a plant species and the fraction this plant represents of the trophic resources exploited by an insect species. There is, on the other hand, a significant negative correlation between the number of insect species visiting a given plant species, and the number of plant species visited by a given insect species. These two elements together demonstrate that the anthophilous fauna and the entomophilous flora of N. W. Europe as a whole form a loose system, not predominantly characterised by specialisation. In accordance with this, factor analysis suggests that there is no ground to recognise more than three visitor types, viz., the allotropous, hemitropous, and eutropous visitors as defined by Loew. A minority of the plant taxa – essentially the cornucopian ones – can with some difficulty be associated with these three types of visitors, and a very few narrowly specialised plant taxa can be associated with more specific visitor groups. However, the large majority of plants cannot be fitted in any typology. These results have practical implications for the nature management of the anthophilous fauna, in that the important role of the cornucopian floral element is underlined. The fact {{that the majority of the}} cornucopian species are perennial, or even woody, places constraints to agricultural practices intended to foster beneficial anthophilous insects...|$|R

However, the total area covered by grassland is reg- ularly declining in most EU countries.

In this perspective, we studied the links between forage services and biodiversity through the survey of a network of 47 permanent grasslands from Pyrenees, Massif Central, Jura and Vosges. Grasslands were followed during 2 years (2009 - 10) considering the seasonal dynam- ic of forage characteristics and botanical and functional composition.

40|$|Phenological {{relationships}} among <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> for pollination may {{play an important}} role in structuring natural plant communities. The main aim of this work was to test whether in dry grassland communities there is a non-random flowering pattern and if the pattern influences the species richness, and the richness of subordinate and common species. Field sampling was carried out in temperate dry grasslands in NE Italy. Species composition and the flowering phenology were monitored in 45 2 m × 2 m plots randomly placed over dry grasslands. To quantify the degree to which insect-pollinated species overlap in their flowering time we developed a "co-flowering index" (CF-index). The significance of the observed flowering pattern was tested using a null model. A positive correlation was found between the synchronic flowering and the number of subordinate species. Subordinate species showed shorter flowering length than the common species and a mostly specialized pollination system. Our findings suggest that flowering synchrony might be a key characteristic which may contribute to shape dry grassland composition by favouring the long lasting maintenance of rare species populations within the community. The comprehension of such functional relationships between species of different trophic levels is of great importance for the conservation of dry grasslands and the maintenance of the ecosystem services that pollination provides...|$|E
40|$|Pollen {{hydration}} status at dispersal {{depends on}} many parameters {{and on this}} basis two main groups of grains may be distinguished: those with a low water content are usually named orthodox or desiccation-resistant, while those with a higher water content at dispersal are known as recalcitrant or desiccation-sensitive due to their reduced mechanisms to keep water constant. On exposure, the latter lose water and die quickly. Although the end of flower receptivity may occur in different ways, in species possessing recalcitrant pollen it often consists in corolla closure. In addition to data available from current literature, also {{a new set of}} experiments was performed: the viability of pollen of eight <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> having nectar as pollinator reward, desiccation-sensitive pollen and corolla closure at the end of receptivity, irrespective of pollination, was tested from the onset of anthesis until flower closure using a fluorochromatic reaction. Pollen viability fell sharply in all species, albeit at different rates, depending on initial water content, and may be also on types of carbohydrate reserves and inherent enzymes interconverting them. On the basis of experimental data and the literature, the authors speculate on the effects of corolla closure: it avoids dispersal of pollen with reduced viability, it avoids collection of unconsumed nectar while facilitating its reabsorption by the nectary parenchyma and its utilization for other purposes, and it avoids contamination by moulds and bacterial spores that could penetrate the plant via the nectar and nectary parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|For insect-pollinated plant species, {{reproductive}} success and genetic exchange via {{the transfer of}} pollen between flowers depends (i. a.) on the efficiency, abundance and behaviour of floral visitors. These in turn are expected to respond to plant population size and flower density. High floral densities for example usually attract large numbers of pollinators that visit more flowers per plant or patch, which increases pollen deposition at short distances. Thus, population characteristics might serve as indicators for pollen dispersal patterns and help to identify suitable habitat size and quality for conservation measures. To test this hypothesis, we observed floral visitors of a generalist, <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species,</b> Comarum palustre, and compared their abundance and visitation rates in populations of different sizes and flower densities. At the same time, we mimicked pollen flow using fluorescent dye. In the large and dense populations, pollinator abundance and visitation rates were high and dye was dispersed {{to the edges of}} the populations (up to 200 m). In the medium-sized population with high flower density, insect abundance and visitation rates were unexpectedly low and dye dispersal declined very quickly. On the contrary, in the smallest population with scattered flowers, especially bumble bee abundance was similar to the large populations and dye dispersal mirrored this high bumble bee activity. Thus, our results indicate that in smaller habitat fragments, the mere size of a population might be insufficient to suggest pollen flow for a plant species. Instead, the abundance of its major pollinators should be considered. © 2012 Gesellschaft für Ökologie...|$|E
40|$|Mating {{system and}} gene flow are major {{influencing}} factors of species population dynamics and evolution. These factors {{are often not}} characterized in tropical tree species, yet they constitute basic information that must be considered to implement sustainable management practices. In particular, as logging implies a reduction of the density of congeneric mates, the connectivity through pollination between individuals has to be well characterized (selfing versus outcrossing rates, distances between mates). We conducted a genetic-based analysis (using 10 nuclear microsatellites) to determine the mating system and gene flow characteristics of an emblematic timber tree species from lowland rain forests of the Congo Basin, Baillonella toxisperma (Sapotaceae). The species, which is frequently exploited for its wood and {{for a number of}} non-timber forest products, naturally occurs at low densities (ca. 0. 01 – 0. 1  individuals/ha). It is supposedly an <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species</b> whose seeds are probably dispersed by mammals. We have shown that the species presents a mixed-mating system (about 20 – 40 % of selfing depending on analysis method). However, the comparison of inbreeding parameters among cohorts suggests that inbred individuals die between seedling and mature tree stages. The mean pollen dispersal distance was relatively low for such a low-density population species (estimated to be 690 or 777  m depending on analysis method) and, together with a low mean number of pollen donors (NEP =  2. 76), it suggests a pattern of nearest-neighbour mating where allo-pollen could be a limiting factor. However, B. toxisperma presents a relatively weak genetic structure (Sp statistic =  0. 0095) indicative of long gene dispersal distance (σg =  3 – 5  km according to the assumed effective population density). Overall, this would indicate that gene flow occurs mainly by extensive seed dispersal in this species. These results suggest that mammals and local populations involved in the dispersal of the species play a key role by lowering biparental inbreeding effects. Sustainable population management might require assisted regeneration using unrelated planting material. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Globally {{there have}} been a number of {{concerns}} about the development of genetically modified crops many of which relate to the implications of gene flow at various levels. In Europe these concerns have led the European Union (EU) to promote the concept of 'coexistence' to allow the freedom to plant conventional and genetically modified (GM) varieties but to minimise the presence of transgenic material within conventional crops. Should a premium for non-GM varieties emerge on the market, the presence of transgenes would generate a 'negative externality' to conventional growers. The establishment of maximum tolerance level for the adventitious presence of GM material in conventional crops produces a threshold effect in the external costs. The existing literature suggests that apart from the biological characteristics of the plant under consideration (e. g. self-pollination rates, <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species,</b> anemophilous species, etc.), gene flow at the landscape level is affected by the relative size of the source and sink populations and the spatial arrangement of the fields in the landscape. In this paper, we take genetically modified herbicide tolerant oilseed rape (GM HT OSR) as a model crop. Starting from an individual pollen dispersal function, we develop a spatially explicit numerical model in order to assess the effect of the size of the source/sink populations and the degree of spatial aggregation on the extent of gene flow into conventional OSR varieties under two alternative settings. We find that when the transgene presence in conventional produce is detected at the field level, the external cost will increase with the size of the source area and with the level of spatial disaggregation. on the other hand when the transgene presence is averaged among all conventional fields in the landscape (e. g. because of grain mixing before detection), the external cost will only depend on the relative size of the source area. The model could readily be incorporated into an economic evaluation of policies to regulate adoption of GM HT OSR. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Variation in abiotic {{conditions}} along altitudinal gradients may sort {{plant species}} from regional species pools {{according to their}} seed mass. With increasing elevation, seed mass {{is expected to be}} either larger for its advantage during seedling establishment in stressful high-elevation environments ('stress-tolerance' mechanism), or smaller owing to energy constraints. Using a large trait database involving 1355 species from the northeastern verge of the Tibetan Plateau, we found that, overall, these two opposing mechanisms balanced out one another, resulting in non-significant seed mass-elevation relationship across all species after controlling for phylogeny. At the same time, we found that the influence of energy constraints on seed mass was indirect and mediated by the variation in plant height. Moreover, our results revealed a mass-dependent seed mass variation along elevation gradients: with increasing elevation small seeds tended to increase (supporting stress-tolerance mechanism) but large seeds tended to decrease (supporting energy-constraints mechanism). Finally, the seed mass-elevation relationships were significantly different among species with different life forms or different dispersal modes, but statistically similar for anemophilous and <b>entomophilous</b> <b>species.</b> This implies that life-history cycle, resource allocation pattern and availability of dispersals agents, rather than pollination efficiency, can affect the responses of seed mass to elevation. Together our results suggest that a comprehensive perspective is necessary when interpreting geographic distribution of even a single trait. Synthesis With increasing elevation, seed mass may be either larger for its advantage during seedling establishment ('stress-tolerance' force), or smaller owing to energy constraints. Our paper shows some novel and importance results in the seed mass-elevation relationship in a northeastern Tibetan flora. Firstly, these two opposing forces operate simultaneously but overall balance out one another. Secondly, the balance tends to shift toward increased energy-constraints (stress-tolerance) with the increase (decreased) in average seed mass. Thirdly, energy constraints on seed mass is indirect and mediated by the variation in plant height. Finally, plant resource allocation pattern, life-history cycle, and availability of dispersal agents can affect the responses of seed mass to elevation. © 2013 The Authors...|$|E
