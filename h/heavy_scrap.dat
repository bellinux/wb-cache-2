HMS is usually traded as a blend of 1 and 2, either a premium blend (80:20) or lower grade mixes (70:30) and (60:40). Other major <b>heavy</b> <b>scrap</b> grades include Japan’s H2 and A3 from the CIS.|$|E
5000|$|The open hearth {{process is}} a batch process and a batch is called a [...] "heat". The furnace is first {{inspected}} for possible damage. Once it is ready or repaired, it is charged with light scrap, such as sheet metal, shredded vehicles or waste metal. The furnace is heated using burning gas. Once it has melted, <b>heavy</b> <b>scrap,</b> such as building, construction or steel milling scrap is added, together with pig iron from blast furnaces. Once all the steel has melted, slag forming agents, such as limestone, are added. The oxygen in iron oxide and other impurities decarburize the pig iron by burning excess carbon away, forming steel. To increase the oxygen contents of the heat, iron ore {{can be added to}} the heat.|$|E

5000|$|Heavy melting steel (HMS) or <b>heavy</b> melting <b>scrap</b> is a {{designation}} for recyclable {{steel and}} wrought iron. It is broken up into two major categories: HMS 1 and HMS 2, where HMS 1 {{does not contain}} galvanized and blackened steel, whereas HMS 2 does.

50|$|With the {{construction}} of new batteries with 16-inch guns in World War II, almost all previous <b>heavy</b> weapons were <b>scrapped</b> by the end of 1943. The long-range 12-inch batteries were, however, mostly retained in service. During World War II most of these batteries were enclosed in heavy concrete casemates for protection against air attack. Only Fort Saulsbury, Battery Kimble at Fort Travis, Texas, Battery MacKenzie at Fort Sherman, Panama Canal Zone, and Batteries Smith and Hearn in the Philippines were not casemated. Thus Fort Saulsbury is the best-preserved battery of its type in its original state.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Hexavalent {{chromium}} {{is highly}} toxic to most living organisms and a known human carcinogen by the inhalation route of exposure. Therefore, treatment of Cr(VI) contaminated wastewater is essential before their discharge {{to the natural}} water bodies. Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) can be beneficial because a more mobile and more toxic chromium species is converted to a less mobile and less toxic form. Zero-valence-state metals, such as scrap iron, can serve as electron donors for reducing Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The influence of pH on scrap iron capacity to reduce Cr(VI) was investigated in this study. Maximum reduction capacity of scrap iron was observed {{at the beginning of}} the column experiments; the lower the pH, the greater the experiment duration with maximum scrap iron reduction capacity. The experimental results showed that highest maximum reduction capacity of scrap iron was 12. 5 mg Cr(VI) /g scrap iron, at pH 2. 0, and decreased with increasing pH up to 1. 9 mg Cr(VI) /g scrap iron at pH = 7. 3.

5000|$|The {{title and}} album art each have unique stories. Originally, {{the album was}} going to be titled Heavy Flow, but Jimmy Pop {{discovered}} that there was a Moby song of the same name. Guitarist Lupus Thunder and Pop have expressed their distaste for Moby in the past. After <b>scrapping</b> <b>Heavy</b> Flow, Lupus Thunder and Jimmy Pop began trading emails that featured the recurring gag [...] "now that's a hefty fine." [...] The band later realized that Hefty Fine would make a good name for a record. Lupus Thunder, in an interview with News-Times said, [...] "it just clicked in his head and we're like, 'Hefty fine? Hold on a minute.'" [...] Bassist [...] "Evil" [...] Jared Hasselhoff and Lupus Thunder have also gone on the record stating that the name could be a play on words meaning an attractive obese person.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Nicholas Hide (born December 15, 1944, Carshalton, Surrey) is an English born {{abstract}} sculptor. A one-time pupil of Sir Anthony Caro, Hide is {{best known}} for upright, large-scale welded sculptures made of <b>heavy,</b> rusted industrial <b>scrap</b> steel.Peter Hide works in the Modernist assembled sculpture tradition begun by Pablo Picasso and continued by David Smith and Anthony Caro, but with an emphasis on weight and pressure unlike his artistic forebears. Like his mentor Caro, Hide's sculptures forsake the plinth, but against Caro's open weightlessness, Hide reclaims mass and the monolith, connecting his work to inspirational sources in Auguste Rodin and Brâncuși. [...] "I think a lot of sculptors," [...] Hide says, [...] "especially those who were taught by Tony Caro, decided deliberately to move as far away as possible {{so as not to be}} seen as his disciples. The problem is that if you do that you move away from extremely fertile territory.|$|R
5000|$|When teams {{found the}} Tamura Farm in Akhalsopeli, {{they would have}} to unload 150 hay bales off of a truck and stack them into a neat {{arrangement}} on the ground. After this grueling task, teams received their next clue directing them to Gachiani. At the sheep farm, teams had to choose a number between 1 and 100. They would then have to chase after a flock of sheep, each wearing a tag with the numbers 1 to 100 on it, and find the sheep that had a tag matching the number they had chosen. Once they found it, they would carry it out of the pasture and fully shear it to get their next clue. This would direct them to the metallurgical plant in Rustavi, where teams had to carry many <b>heavy</b> pieces of <b>scrap</b> metal into the plant and place them into a marked bin. One team member would then use the plant's crane to pick up and move the bin to a marked [...] "X" [...] on the ground to receive their next clue. Before departing, teams would discover who would be Yielded.|$|R
5000|$|The band's album, Hefty Fine, was {{released}} on September 13, 2005. The title came about after Evil Jared Hasselhoff was fined during work on MTV's [...] "Viva La Bam" [...] (The Scavenger Hunt episode). Jared was fined $10,000, which Jimmy Pop allegedly had to pay (as discussed in the [...] "Un-commentary" [...] of the Viva La Bam DVDs). Jimmy has stated that Jared was arrested after attempting to urinate into a dixie cup that he (Jim) was holding, {{from the top of}} a parking lot. The CD's original title, <b>Heavy</b> Flow, was <b>scrapped</b> when it was noticed that fellow musician Moby had a song with the same name. The first single, [...] "Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo", gained heavy rotation on music video channels. Although the track [...] "No Hard Feelings" [...] had recently broken into the Modern Rock Top 50, their second single [...] "Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss" [...] (which is featured in a Blaupunkt, a BGL Grand Wizard ad) has started radio circulation with a music video airing limitedly on a few music channels. Other songs from the album are part of a campaign by the Bloodhound Gang to change the Pennsylvania state anthem to their appropriately titled [...] "Pennsylvania" [...] (which is often incorrectly believed to be titled [...] "Do You Even Know What a Wawa Is?", from that song's last stanza), as well as [...] "Something Diabolical", featuring HIM's Ville Valo.|$|R
