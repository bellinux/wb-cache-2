Parsons wrote to Crowley that {{although}} Hubbard had [...] "no formal training in Magick he has {{an extraordinary amount of}} experience and understanding in the field.

[...] Middleton arrived in Columbus, Georgia with strong praise from his superiors, and would soon get his efficiency report, in which Brigadier General Benjamin Poore of the 4th Division wrote of him, [...] "The best all-around officer I have yet seen. Unspoiled by his rapid promotion from captain in July to colonel in October; and made good in every grade. He gets better results in a quiet unobtrusive way than any officer I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> Has a wonderful grasp of situations and a fine sense of proportion." ...|$|E

Lu developed a strong admiration for Obama, {{of whom he}} said, [...] "With his quick and incisive mind, Obama is the most intelligent person that I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> (in the political arena)." [...] As legislative director, Lu led a 15-person group and was responsible for overseeing the drafting of all legislation and advising Obama on votes and policy decisions. When weighing difficult votes, Obama had Lu and his other staff members assemble together and argue about the issue in front of him. David Mendell, a Chicago Tribune reporter and Obama biographer, said Lu was among the [...] "moderate voices in this atmosphere of smart young staffers." [...] Lu advised Obama to {{vote in favor of}} the Military Commissions Act of 2006 because he felt it would have been politically wiser to support it, but Obama ultimately voted against it.|$|E

In reality, Michael has been combating heavy debt by working as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. At the office the next day, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) arrives to find Michael unprepared for a presentation due to his moonlighting, and orders Michael to quit his night job or be fired from Dunder Mifflin.

500|$|Gagnon's {{fascination with}} Peru and the Asháninka [...] began after World War II, {{when he heard}} a bishop give a talk about them. He then worked for three years in a shoe factory and {{restaurant}} in New Hampshire to save money to allow him to visit Lima. In 1948, he came to Peru, entered the Franciscan order, and took the name Mariano. Gagnon was ordained a priest in 1957, and spent three years working with those who spoke Cocama, an indigenous language of Peru. He said of the people that he served, [...] "They are the most virtuous people I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> They never lie and have great respect for personal property. Their language is very sharp. There is no word for 'maybe' in Campa." [...] He also observed that they did not chew coca leaves and were not prone to sharing food and drink, which had been a major cause of rampant tuberculosis. There was also a high infant mortality rate. By 1969, he had established two missions and began work on a third.|$|E
500|$|The Smiths {{involved}} themselves {{heavily in}} local affairs.

Agnes, who became informally known as [...] "Mrs Jock", established and ran the Selukwe Women's Institute. Both won the MBE (at different times) for their services to the community.

[...] "They set wonderful examples to live up to." [...] He considered his father [...] "a man of extremely strong principles"—"one of the fairest men I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> and that is the way he brought me up. He always told me that we're entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs."

Rakoto Frah is featured on tracks recorded with Manu Dibango, jazz artists David Lindley and Henry Keiser, Kassav', and Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whom he met while performing in India. As a musician who played by ear, he would join an ongoing performance by listening carefully to determine the key of the song. The American composer and jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman described Rakoto Frah as having [...] "some of the best phrasing of any musician in the world". He was also cited as a key influence by Ian Anderson, the flutist and leader of 1970s British rock group Jethro Tull. In the liner notes for the 1991 compilation A World Out of Time, producers David Lindley and Henry Kaiser expressed their admiration for the artist, stating: [...] "He {{is one of the}} most amazing master musicians and individuals that we <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> His mastery of the sodina is on a level that you could only compare to great, western instrumental masters like John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Billy Pigg or Miles Davis. Rakoto Frah certainly seems to know mysterious things about the phrasing of melodies that nobody else knows." [...] Contemporary Malagasy artists performing in diverse genres ranging from heavy metal and hip hop to jazz and the traditional mangaliba have cited the sodina master as an inspiration and legend in the pantheon of Malagasy cultural figures.|$|E

2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time I met him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E

[...] For example, Fox wrote that Bush was [...] "the cockiest guy I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in my life," [...] and claimed that he was surprised that Bush had ever made it to the White House. [...] Later, in an interview with Larry King, Fox explained that this was a misunderstanding and that what he meant by calling George W. Bush [...] "cocky" [...] was to say he was [...] "confident." [...] Fox also referred to Bush in his autobiography as a [...] "windshield cowboy," [...] due to Bush's apparent fear of a horse Fox offered him to ride.|$|E
2500|$|Branson {{has stated}} {{in a number}} of {{interviews}} that he has been much influenced by non-fiction books.
