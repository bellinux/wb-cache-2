5000|$|At AT&T, Carson was {{involved}} in early radio telephone experiments. In 1915 he invented [...] single-sideband modulation to transmit multiple telephone calls simultaneously on a single electrical circuit, and was responsible for installing the first such system between Pittsburgh and Baltimore. In 1922 he published a mathematical treatment of frequency modulation (FM), which introduced the Carson bandwidth rule. In his 1922 paper, Carson presented a negative opinion of narrowband FM, which occurs when the maximum <b>frequency</b> <b>swing</b> is made narrower than the audio bandwidth. Later, Edwin Armstrong managed to demonstrate that FM can be advantageous if the <b>frequency</b> <b>swing</b> is significantly wider than the audio bandwidth. From 1917 to 1925 Carson analyzed the effects of filters on amplitude modulation via operational calculus, thus allowing telephone system designers to predict crosstalk in multiple calls over {{a single pair of}} wires. He published a series of papers on this subject in the Bell System Technical Journal, culminating in his 1926 book Electrical Circuit Theory and Operational Calculus.|$|E

5000|$|One {{common cause}} is {{feedback}} through the plate power supply circuit. [...] The power supply provides DC current to each tube's plate circuit, so the {{power supply wiring}} (power busses) can be an inadvertent feedback path between stages. The increasing impedance of the filter capacitors at low frequencies can mean that low <b>frequency</b> <b>swings</b> in the current drawn by output stages can cause voltage swings in the power supply voltage which feed back to earlier stages, making the system a subaudio oscillator. This is caused by inadequate power supply filtering or decoupling. The electrolytic capacitors used in equipment of 1960s vintage contained liquid electrolyte, which dried out over decades, decreasing the capacitance and increasing the leakage current, and these are often the cause.|$|R

40|$|Limited {{research}} has been done on exoskeletons to enable faster movements of the lower extremities. An exoskeleton’s mechanism can actually hinder agility by adding weight, inertia and friction to the legs; compensating inertia through control is particularly difficult due to instability issues. The added inertia will reduce the natural frequency of the legs, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking. We present a control method that produces an approximate compensation of an exoskeleton’s inertia. The aim is making the natural frequency of the exoskeleton-assisted leg larger than that of the unaided leg. The method uses admittance control to compensate the weight and friction of the exoskeleton. Inertia compensation is emulated by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. We tested the controller on a statically supported, single-DOF exoskeleton that assists swing movements of the leg. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, {{in the context of a}} computer-based task resembling a race. With zero inertia compensation, the steady-state <b>frequency</b> of leg <b>swing</b> was consistently reduced.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a prototype of cryogenic parametric converter transducer operating at 5 GHz, for the upgrade of the ROG Collaboration resonant G. W. antennas. This device is built {{on the experience of}} the Niobe detector (D. G. Blair et al.), with substantial modifications that should let us achieve better stability and sensitivity. The prototype uses as parametric converter a superconducting coaxial cavity with a 50 micron gap (Q 0 = 5 Ã— 10 8 at 1. 5 K and 100 Î¼W RF power dissipation), and a contacless RF coupling for thermal insulation between the 2 K stage and the ultra cryogenic (100 mK) antenna. The coupler features a constant transmission loss of 0. 2 dB over a range of displacements of 5 mm in x, y and z around the nominal operating position with a separation of 8 mm between the two halves of the coupler. In this way the large, low <b>frequency</b> <b>swings</b> (0. 5 and 17 Hz), of the 2 Tons antenna around its suspension point have no influence on the transducer performance. To test all the components of the transducer and the system performance, a room temperature prototype is installed on the TART (Test Antenna at Room Temperature) facility at the INFN labs. Using critical coupling for the RF cavity input coupler we manage to keep to a minimum the leakage of the drive signal to the first RF amplifier. In this way we avoid degradation of the RF amplifier noise figure (0. 6 dB at room temperature) produced by the RF amplifier saturation Experimental results agree with the full analysis of the room temperature detector performances.

The filter’s center frequency was modulated using a triangular wave having a 5 -Hz modulation frequency fmod {{to obtain a}} pair of vowel-analog waveforms with dynamically varying single-formant transitions. The target signal S contained a single modulation cycle starting either at a phase of - π / 2 (up-down) or π / 2 (down-up), whereas the longer distracter N contained several cycles of the modulating triangular wave starting at a random phase. The level at which the target formant’s modulating phase could be correctly identified was adaptively determined for several distracter levels and several extents of <b>frequency</b> <b>swing</b> (10 - 55 %) {{in a group of}} experienced normal-hearing young and a group of experienced elderly individuals with hearing loss not exceeding one considered moderate. The most important result was that, for the two f 0 differences, all distracter levels, and all <b>frequency</b> <b>swing</b> extents tested, elderly listeners needed about 20 dB larger S/N ratios than the young. Results also indicate that identification thresholds of both the elderly and the young listeners are between 4 and 12 dB higher than similarly determined detection thresholds and that, contrary to detection, identification is not a linear function of distracter level. Since formant transitions represent potent cues for speech intelligibility, the large S/N ratios required by the elderly for correct discrimination of single-formant transition dynamics may at least partially explain the well-documented intelligibility loss of speech in babble noise by the elderly.

40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} of lower-limb {{exoskeleton}} control {{aimed at improving}} the agility of leg-swing motion is presented. In the absence of control, an exoskeleton’s mechanism usually hinders agility by adding mechanical impedance to the legs. The uncompensated inertia of the exoskeleton will reduce the natural <b>frequency</b> of leg <b>swing,</b> probably leading to lower step frequency during walking as well as increased metabolic energy consumption. The proposed controller emulates inertia compensation by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered angular acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. The resulting controller combines two assistive effects: increasing the natural frequency of the lower limbs and performing net work per swing cycle. The controller was tested on a statically mounted exoskeleton that assists knee flexion and extension. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, {{in the context of}} a computer-based task resembling a race.

When an interconnected AC power system is subjected to a large load with rapid change, system frequency may be considerably disturbed and becomes oscillatory. By utilizing the system interconnections as the control channels of HVDC link, the tie-line power modulation of HVDC link through interconnections is applicable for stabilizing the frequency oscillations of AC systems. In the design of power modulation controller, the technique of overlapping decompositions and the eigenvalue assignment are applied to establish the state feedback control scheme.
