[...] In 1897, the Los Angeles Times published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of [...] "X-Ray Prospecting" [...] for gold. [...] Yoakum {{reported that he had}} laid [...] a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the x-ray plate while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. [...] The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to [...] "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, exactly where it lies and in what quantities." [...] Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. [...] In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement (pictured at left) offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke {{for the first time in}} [...] "tongues." [...] He reported: [...] "I was in the heart of Mexico in a church, speaking through an interpreter to the Mexicans and Indians, when suddenly a distinct rush of some might wind came upon me, and when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> it was not English, but a beautiful smooth Castilian language, and for 20 or 30 minutes I held that large audience." ...|$|E

60|$|Euphemia and the boarder {{looked at}} each other. I looked at them. Then <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> in earnest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, there's a blackguard {{creditor}} in {{the tent}} I don't want to see, who'll discover me and nab me as sure as Satan if <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> What's to be done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} it isn't always the man's fault," [...] said Dan darkly. [...] "When I get married I'll be good to my wife, but I mean to be boss. When <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>my</b> word will be law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I shall {{probably}} astonish strangers, {{because they}} have never before {{had the pleasure of}} seeing me. Also, they will marvel at my great learning. Every time <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> Cayke, <b>I</b> am liable to say something important." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to speak, to confess. But he {{prevented}} me, {{the tears}} filling the wrinkles around his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, then, {{stop your}} mouth with that, Ralph," [...] said Peterkin, holding a large oyster to my lips. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and {{swallowed}} it in silence, and really it was remarkably good.|$|E
60|$|His rapid {{rattling}} {{mouth shut}} quite tight suddenly, {{and he looked}} steadily and triumphantly at me, with his head on one side. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and the mere motion seemed to sting him to fresh verbal leaps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! very well," [...] exclaimed Miss Bates, [...] "then I {{need not}} be uneasy. 'Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> shan't <b>I?</b> (looking round with the most good-humoured {{dependence}} on every body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{no longer}} wonder {{that there are}} great lords with their {{beautiful}} ladies, and poor sailors with wives that no one envies! Scarce can <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> but it is known what I wish to say, which is knowledge to make one party great and the other party little! Mass!--Don Christopher, himself, will need all his wit, if he journeyeth as far as Barcelona!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here they are, your honour. They {{are just}} like my own. Loose coats, rough breeches, white {{stockings}} and buckled shoes, and soft hats with wide brims. I thought that you would pass better, like that, {{than in any other}} way; for if you were dressed up as citizens, your tongues might betray you, for somehow they don't speak English as we do; and whenever <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> they discover that I am an Irishman." ...|$|R
60|$|I expect <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> {{and eyes}} pretty wide, for I was never so astonished. A young lady like that keeping the bar! But I didn't want Mrs. Locky {{to know how}} much I was surprised, and so I said nothing about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it was on}} our side, Stemm, {{it was not so}} with my knowledge. I did all I {{could to}} prevent it. I spoke against it {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> I would not have given a shilling for a single vote, though it would have got me the election." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to speak, but Mull {{went on in}} {{oblivion}} of me, {{speaking out}} of the cavern of his hands. [...] "I don't mind telling you, Father, because it's really more defending the poor Duke than giving him away. Didn't you ever hear {{of the time when}} he very nearly lost all the estates?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> {{to reply}} to this tirade, when with a crisp knock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.|$|R

6000|$|... "Wait here!" [...] cried Mr. Marx, in a harsh, unnatural tone. And before <b>I</b> could <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> he had {{vanished}} {{out of sight}} and it seemed as though the black, yawning darkness had swallowed him up.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Haven't I said--I {{appeal to}} the T'other Governor as my witness--haven't I said from the first minute that <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> in this here world-without-end-everlasting chair' (he evidently used that form of words as next in force to an affidavit), 'that I was willing to swear that he done it? Haven't I said, Take me and get me sworn to it? Don't I say so now? You won't deny it, Lawyer Lightwood?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I sat down, {{and opened}} my mouth to tell Anabela what she loved to hear--that she was a trust, monopolizing all the loveliness of earth. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and instead of the usual {{vibrating}} words of love and compliment, there came forth a faint wheeze such as a baby with croup might emit. Not a word--not a syllable--not an intelligible sound. I had caught cold in my laryngeal regions when I took my injudicious bath.|$|E
6000|$|Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. Providence {{had stood}} by me this fur all right, but I {{was hard and}} tight aground now. I see it warn't a bit of use {{to try to go}} ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we can pay our bills an' {{have enough}} left {{to keep the}} stock up, by a week from to-day you shall go 'round to spread the news, an' <b>I</b> won't <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> till you've seen every feller you know." ...|$|R
60|$|Fire, we say, is combustion. It is {{marvelous}} how science proceeds like witchcraft and alchemy, {{by means}} of an abracadabra which has no earthly sense. Pray, what is combustion? You can try and answer scientifically, till you are black in the face. All you can say is that it is that which happens when matter is raised to a certain temperature--and so forth and so forth. You might as well say, a word is that which happens when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and squeeze <b>my</b> larynx and make various tricks with my throat muscles. All these explanations are so senseless. They describe the apparatus, and think they have described the event.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I will, an' then I'll {{feel as if}} I had kinder {{paid for}} runnin' away. If Uncle Dan'l will only let me stay with him again he may whip me every mornin', an' <b>I</b> won't <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to holler." ...|$|R
6000|$|He forgot noon-hunger, and clumped {{through the}} rain to the garage. He saw a girl step from the car. He stopped, {{in the doorway of}} the Old Home, in uneasy shyness. He told himself he didn't [...] "know just what it is about her--she isn't so darn unusually pretty and yet--gee---- Certainly isn't a girl to get fresh with. Let Ben take care of her. Like to talk to her, and yet I'd be afraid if <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> I'd put my foot in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{yesterday}} afternoon," [...] Mr. Waddington continued. [...] "I was selling an oak chest. I {{explained that it}} was not a genuine antique but that it had certainly some claims to antiquity on account of its design. That seemed to me to be a very fair way of putting it. Then I saw a man, who was very keen on buying it, examining the brass handles. He looked up at me. 'Why, the handles are genuine!' he exclaimed. 'They're real old brass, anyway!' Now I knew quite well, Burton, that those handles, though they were extraordinarily near the real thing, were not genuine. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to tell him so, and then, Burton, do you know that I hesitated?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{to return}} to the woman in Reno who opened her door to me in the {{deepening}} twilight. At the first glimpse of her kindly face I took my cue. I became a sweet, innocent, unfortunate lad. I couldn't speak. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and closed it again. Never in my life before had I asked any one for food. My embarrassment was painful, extreme. I was ashamed. I, who looked upon begging as a delightful whimsicality, thumbed myself over into a true son of Mrs. Grundy, burdened with all her bourgeois morality. Only the harsh pangs of the belly-need could compel me to do so degraded and ignoble a thing as beg for food. And into my face I strove to throw all the wan wistfulness of famished and ingenuous youth unused to mendicancy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope it is," [...] growled the Rak. [...] "I want {{to crush}} them, if possible, for I {{have a bad}} disposition. If only <b>I</b> could <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> I'd eat all of you, {{although}} my appetite is poorly this warm weather." ...|$|R
60|$|These {{were the}} two things {{uppermost}} in my mind; and <b>I</b> could <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> upon neither without black ungenerosity. So I did the next worst, and said nothing, nor so much as looked once at my companion, save with the tail of my eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Cheeko's brother kept {{creeping}} nearer and {{nearer to}} the edge of the thorns, looking back at me every once in a while, as if believing I'd be scared out of my wits because he was so venturesome; but <b>I</b> never <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and finally he said with a flirt of his tail: ...|$|R
60|$|A more elastic {{footstep}} entered next; and now <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> for a 'good-morning,' but {{closed it}} again, the salutation unachieved; for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison sotto voce, {{in a series}} of curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced {{over the back of the}} bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed, by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.|$|E
60|$|At {{that time}} I disliked public speaking, {{and had a}} firm {{conviction}} that I should break down every time <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> I believe I had every fault a speaker could have (except talking at random or indulging in rhetoric), when I spoke to the first important audience I ever addressed, on a Friday evening at the Royal Institution, in 1852. Yet, I must confess to having been guilty, malgre moi, of as much public speaking as most of my contemporaries, {{and for the last}} ten years it ceased to be so much of a bugbear to me. I used to pity myself for having to go through this training, but I am now more disposed to compassionate the unfortunate audiences, especially my ever friendly hearers at the Royal Institution, who were the subjects of my oratorical experiments.|$|E
6000|$|That was {{the heyday}} of lecturing, and {{now and then a}} {{literary}} light from the East swam into our skies. I heard and saw Emerson, and I once met Bayard Taylor socially, at the hospitable house where he was a guest after his lecture. Heaven knows how I got through the evening. I do not think <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to address him a word; it was as much as I could do to sit and look at him, while he tranquilly smoked, and chatted with our host, and quaffed the beer which we had very good in the Nest. All the while I did him homage as the first author by calling whom I had met. I longed to tell him how much I liked his poems, which we used to get by heart in those days, and I longed (how much more I longed!) to have him know that: ...|$|E
500|$|During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was {{regarded}} as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, [...] "I am not a role model." [...] Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, [...] "I don't create controversies. They're there long before <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>I</b> just bring them to your attention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho, ho, ho!" [...] laughed the monster. [...] "That's a good un, little Martin! Do I like it? Well, it's {{better than}} being a sailor man in a ship, I can tell 'ee. That were a hard life, with nothing good except perhaps the baccy. I were very fond of baccy once before the sea put out my pipe. Likewise of rum. Many's the time I've been picked up on shore that drunk, Martin, you wouldn't believe it, I were that fond of rum. Sometimes, down here, when I {{remember}} how good it tasted, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> wide and takes down a big gulp of sea water, enough to fill a hogshead; then I comes up and blows it all out again just like a old grampus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no desire}} for {{positions}} which I am too stupid to fill," [...] he said, speaking so rapidly that Lydie could hardly follow him; [...] "but, Mademoiselle, I entreat you {{do not believe that}} my admiration for you is not serious. I know I am quite unworthy to be even your lacquey, though I wouldn't mind being that, since it would bring me sometimes near you. Please, please, don't look at me--I am such a clumsy fool, and I daresay I am putting things all wrong! My mother says," [...] he added, with a pathetic little sigh, [...] "that I shall spoil everything if <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and now <b>I</b> have done it, and you are angry, and I wish to God somebody would come and give me a kick!" ...|$|R
