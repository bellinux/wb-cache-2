5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he coined the term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal's interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern US. As a resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he noticed that he was more energetic and productive during the long <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>summer</b> versus the shorter darker days of the winter.|$|E

5|$|A mid-credits scene teasing X-Men: Days of Future Past was {{attached}} to the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in April 2014. In the scene, which is set during the Vietnam War, Mystique tries to infiltrate a military camp led by William Stryker to recruit fellow mutants Havok, Ink, and Toad. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 director Marc Webb had an existing contract with Fox Searchlight Pictures to direct another film following 500 <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Summer</b> (2009). After The Amazing Spider-Man, Webb's negotiations with Sony Pictures Entertainment stalled because of his commitment to Fox. Fox eventually agreed to allow Webb to direct the sequel of The Amazing Spider-Man, and in exchange, Sony promoted the X-Men film without charge. In addition, three viral websites were launched before the release of the filmTrask-Industries.com in July 2013, TheBentBullet.com in November 2013 and 25Moments.com in April 2014. To further promote the film, Jackman made a guest appearance on the April 28, 2014, episode of WWE Raw. The segment received mixed reactions.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} Lokhvitskaya's death remains unknown. Her health started to {{deteriorate}} {{in the late}} 1890s: she complained of insomnia and violent nightmares, suffered from bouts of severe depression, and later from chronic and ever worsening stenocardia. In 1904 Lokhvitskaya's illness progressed; she was bedridden {{for most of the}} year, tortured by pain and anxiety. In the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>summer</b> 1905, the family moved her to Finland, where her condition improved slightly, but on return she was hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|The first {{offshore}} wells {{drilled in}} the Beaufort used artificial islands as drilling platforms, {{but this was}} a winter drilling system, and was only practical in shallow water. In the mid-1970s, the introduction of a fleet of reinforced drillships extended the drilling season to include the 90 to 120 ice-free <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>summer.</b> This also enabled the industry to drill in the deeper waters of the Beaufort Sea. By the mid-1980s, variations on artificial island and drilling vessel technologies had extended both the drilling season and the depth of water at which the industry could operate. They had also reduced exploration costs.|$|E

25|$|During the Italian {{campaign}} of 1943, 130,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side and, {{by the time}} of the Normandy invasion, Free French forces numbered approximately half a million regulars and more than 100,000 French Forces of the Interior (FFI). The Free French 2nd Armored Division, under General Philippe Leclerc, landed in Normandy, and, in the waning <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>summer</b> 1944, led the drive toward Paris. The FFI in Normandy and the Île-de-France region surrounding Paris began to harass German forces intensively, cutting roads and railways, setting ambushes and fighting conventional battles alongside their allies.|$|E

The year's other dump period {{straddles}} summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months. In the past it was usually considered to include all of August and September, and in some years still may. But in years with many major summer movies, some may open on {{the first or second}} weekend of August to avoid competing with other such movies, such as Guardians of the Galaxy, the first-ever August release by Marvel Studios, which took in $94 million on the first weekend of that month in 2014. It was the most successful August opening weekend, and it became one of the year's top-grossing films.|$|E

500|$|James Bernardoni {{states that}} the film is [...] "one {{of the very few}} romantic comedy-dramas of the New Hollywood era and one that has rightly taken its place among the {{classics}} of that reverted genre", likening the seriocomic meditation on the couple relationship to George Cukor's Adam's Rib (1949), starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Since its release, other romantic comedies have inspired comparison. When Harry Met Sally... (1989), Chasing Amy (1997), 500 <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Summer</b> (2009) and Allen's 2003 film, Anything Else, are among them, while film director Rian Johnson said in an interview for the book, The Film That Changed My Life, that Annie Hall inspired him to become a film director.

500|$|Alex Henderson from AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the highlights from Laundry Service and commented that [...] " [...] successfully combines pop/rock with [...] tango on 'Objection (Tango)'."

[...] The critic compared [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] to Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin's song [...] "Livin' la Vida Loca", and the work of American new wave band The B-52's. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian picked [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] as an example of Shakira's unusual style of production and opined that it [...] "sounds like the B-52's jamming with a wedding reception combo [...]" [...] Matt Cibula from PopMatters complimented Shakira's songwriting and termed the song a [...] "fine rockcraft with drama and a sense of humor." [...] The critic too enjoyed the bridge of the song, saying [...] "the little growly semi-rap break at the end is fun as hell." [...] Lisa Oliver from Yahoo!

500|$|Days after announcing Raimi's departure, {{the studio}} {{announced}} that Webb, whose previous film (500) <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Summer</b> was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot. Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man." [...] Webb felt Spider-Man {{is different from the}} Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and [...] "more like James Bond" [...] because [...] "there's so much material in Spider-Man {{that there are so many}} stories to tell and so many characters." [...] He described the film as [...] "not a remake" [...] explaining that [...] "we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters." ...|$|E
