During the {{production}} of the album, several musicians and producers were recruited including American singer Mikky Ekko and producer Justin Parker. According to Ekko, the production of the album was massive, [...] "Their pace is insane. They had the studios we were working in booked out for three months, on a cycle. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before." [...] "Stay" [...] was written and produced by Parker, Ekko and Elof Loelv. Initially, when they wrote the song, Ekko didn't like it because of its vulnerability; however, collaborators convinced him to listen to [...] "Stay" [...] again. After another listen, he understood that the song is very important to him, [...] "The track had become so special to me as well, and knowing what the track means to me and what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> to her too." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, do {{you think}} so? When I say [...] "The kingdom of God is {{salvation}}," [...] {{do you think}} it is? Have you even any clear notion of what I mean when I say it? Some of you have not, I am afraid; you cannot see at first sight what salvation and the kingdom of God have to do with each other. And why? You think salvation means being saved from hell, and going to heaven, when you die. And so it does: but I trust in God and in God's holy scripture, that it means a great deal more; for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> being unfit for hell, and fit for heaven, before we die. At least, so says the Church Catechism, which teaches every little child to thank his Heavenly Father for having brought him into such a state of salvation in this life, even while he is young. Thanks be to The Spirit of God which taught our fore-fathers to put these precious words into the Church Catechism, to guard us against falling into the very same mistake as the Pharisees of old fell into, when they asked our Lord when the kingdom of God was to come. And, believe me, it is easy enough and common enough to fall into the same mistake.|$|E

[...] In this {{emergency}} she was [...] "led" [...] to charge three hundred dollars for a term of [...] "twelve half-days." [...] She does not say who led her, she only says that the amount greatly troubled her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that the price was suggested from above, [...] "led" [...] being a theological term identical with our commercial phrase [...] "personally conducted." [...] She [...] "shrank from asking it, but was finally led, by a strange providence, to accept this fee." [...] "Providence" [...] is another theological term. Two leds and a providence, taken together, make a pretty strong argument for inspiration. I think that these statistics make it clear that the price was arranged above. This view is constructively supported by the fact, already quoted, that God afterwards approved, [...] "in multitudinous ways," [...] her wisdom in accepting the mentioned fee. [...] "Multitudinous ways"--multitudinous encoring--suggests enthusiasm. Business enthusiasm. And it suggests nearness. God's nearness to his [...] "little one." [...] Nearness, and a watchful personal interest. A warm, palpitating, Standard-Oil interest, so to speak. All this indicates inspiration. We may assume, then, two inspirations: one for the book, the other for the business.|$|E

I explored the Almo legend through interviews, historical documents and books and came to think that the Almo legend {{played a critical role in}} defining a sense of local reality for Almo, Idaho, both in the past and present.

40|$|I {{first read}} about Bell’s {{inequality}} and the “demise of locality ” in a Scientific American {{article in the}} late 1970 s, and I remember being very much impressed with its oddball conclusions regarding the fate of objective reality (what E. Squires has more recently referred to as “the ultimate silliness of the quantum world”). Nowadays I am much less impressed, but I don’t know why; maybe it’s only because I am now more accustomed to quantum mechanics than I was then. Nevertheless, the quantum mechanical violation of Bell’s inequality, which was proven experimentally in the 1980 s, is {{yet another example of}} how God has cooked up a universe that is stranger than anything we could have imagined. If you have experienced problems deriving Bell’s inequality and/or its quantum variant, the following discussion should be of help to you. The only prerequisite is elementary quantum mechanics and an open mind. And although I will share some of my personal thoughts about what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> all <b>means,</b> you’ll have to decide for yourself if there’s anything really profound involved. Bohr v. Einstein You may have read about the friendly but earnest “war ” that Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein waged from the 1920 s on regarding whether nature was deterministic or probabilistic.

5000|$|What, then, {{does the}} intuition that the table might {{have turned out}} to have been made of ice or of {{anything}} else, that it might even have {{turned out not to be}} made of molecules, amount to? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>means</b> simply that there might have been a table looking and feeling just like this one and placed in this very position in the room, which was in fact made of ice, In other words, I (or some conscious being) could have been qualitatively in the same epistemic situation that in fact obtains, I could have the same sensory evidence that I in fact have, about a table which was made of ice. The situation is thus akin to the one which inspired the counterpart theorists; when I speak of the possibility of the table turning out to be made of various things, I am speaking loosely. This table itself could not have had an origin different form the one it in fact had, but in a situation qualitatively identical to this one with respect to all evidence I had in advance, the room could have contained a table made of ice in place of this one. Something like counterpart theory is thus applicable to the situation, but it applies only because we are not interested in what might not be true of a table given certain evidence. It is precisely because it is not true that this table might have been made of ice from the Thames that we must turn here to qualitative descriptions and counterparts. To apply these notions to genuine de re modalities, is from the present standpoint, perverse. (Kripke 1980:142.) ...|$|R

Again working with Island Records, he produced Soul Punk. Originally having a tentative release date of February 2011, it was delayed to October that year. In its place, Stump released Truant Wave as his first extended play (EP) through his own record label Nervous Breakdance Media digitally on February 22, 2011.

40|$|Interval {{estimates}} – {{estimates of}} parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty – {{have long been}} touted as {{a key component of}} statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs) : intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; the parameter values contained within a CI are thought to be more plausible than those outside the interval; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (typically 95 %) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and generally lead to incoherent inferences. For this reason, we recommend against the use of the method of CIs for inference. “You keep using that word. <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> what you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> ” Inigo Montoya, The Princess Bride (1987) The development of statistics over the past century has seen the proliferation of methods designed to make infer-ences from data. Methods vary widely in their philosophical foundations, the questions they are supposed to address, and their frequency of use in practice. One popular and widely-promoted class of methods are interval estimates, which in-clude frequentist confidence intervals, Bayesian credible in-tervals and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals, fiducial intervals, and likelihood intervals. These procedures differ in their philosophical foundation and computation, but infor-mally are all designed to be estimates of a parameter that ac-count for measurement or sampling uncertainty by yielding a range of values for the parameter instead of a single value. Of the many kinds of interval estimates, the most popular is the confidence interval (CI). Confidence intervals are intro-duced in almost all introductory statistics texts; they are rec-ommended or required by the methodological guidelines of many prominent journals (e. g., Psychonomics Society, 2012...|$|R
