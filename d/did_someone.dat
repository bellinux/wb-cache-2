5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only <b>did</b> <b>someone</b> call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E

2500|$|The book Frustrated Witness, {{written by}} former Miami Herald writer Willis Morgan, {{examines}} the Walsh case and cites circumstantial evidence that suggests Jeffrey Dahmer may have killed Adam Walsh. At {{the time of}} Walsh's murder, Dahmer was living a short drive away in Miami Beach and working at a sub shop where he had access to a blue van {{similar to the one}} seen leaving the mall after Walsh's disappearance. A number of witnesses reported seeing a man looking like Dahmer at the mall talking to young boys. When interviewed about Adam in the early 1990s, Dahmer repeatedly denied involvement in the crime, even stating; [...] "I've told you everything—how I killed them, how I cooked them, who I ate. Why wouldn't I tell you if I <b>did</b> <b>someone</b> else?" [...] After this rumor surfaced, John Walsh stated that he had [...] "seen no evidence" [...] linking his son's kidnapping and murder to Dahmer.|$|E
