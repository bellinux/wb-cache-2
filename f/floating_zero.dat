40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{different strategies}} for charging and discharging a battery {{energy storage system}} to maximize economic profit. The work {{is based on the}} Swedish energy market. Three strategies are evaluated, first the output minimizing strategy attempting to minimize the output energy toward the electric grid, second the peak reduction strategy attempting to minimize the maximum power consumption by discharging the BESS during peak hours and charging at night time when prices are low, and third the <b>floating</b> <b>zero</b> strategy trying to keep the output toward the grid at a certain level based on the local consumption profile. Simulations show that in an ordinary household the suggested output minimizing strategy saves 2994 kr yearly for a 12 kWh BESS, 3583 kr for a 24 kWh BESS and 3887 kr for a 48 kWh BESS. The peak reduction strategy saves 2447 kr yearly for a 12 kWh BESS, 2853 kr for a 24 kWh BESS and 2960 kr for a 48 kWh BESS. The <b>floating</b> <b>zero</b> strategy saves 2375 kr yearly for a 12 kWh BESS, 3196 kr for a 24 kWh BESS and 3538 kr for a 48 kWh BESS. Numbers are based on current energy cost and consumption for an ordinary household and result in a pay off time of approximately 25 years or greater, depending on system size...|$|E

50|$|A Japanese <b>Float</b> <b>Zero</b> plane strafed the PT {{boats that}} were {{screening}} the convoy {{on the same}} date, and then strafed the LCT 325 and LCT 327. When the plane came in at low altitude of approximately 500 yards, the LCTs opened fire. The plane dropped a bomb {{at that time and}} then proceeded {{in the direction of the}} APc-25. The APc-25 opened fire with three 20 mm Oerlikon machine guns and two 50 caliber machine guns when the plane came within range at a distance of about 500 yards. The remaining guns were not in position to open fire. The APc-25 fired about five magazines of 20 mm ammunition and about 150 rounds of 50-caliber ammunition. Some of the crew believed that the plane was hit after seeing a short burst of flame. Rev. Paul Redmond, chaplain of the Forth Marine Raiders Battalion found the remains of a Japanese plane the following morning, shot down on the shore in that area near Enogai. However, Commanding Officer John D. Cartano reported that he could not positively state whether the APc-25 had shot down the plane.|$|R

The objective of this program is to investigate and validate the modeling {{of the dynamics of}} an actively controlled flexible, articulating, multibody platform free <b>floating</b> in <b>zero</b> gravity. A rationale and experimental approach for the program are presented. The rationale shows that on-orbit testing, coupled with ground testing and a strong analytical program, is necessary in order to fully understand both how flexibility of the platform affects the pointing problem, as well as how gravity perturbs this structural flexibility causing deviations between 1 -and 0 -gravity behavior. The experimental approach captures the essential physics of multibody platforms, by identifying the appropriate attributes, tests, and performance metrics of the test article, and defines the tests required to successfully validate the analytical framework...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) {{is a power}} {{electronics}} device to protect sensitive load when voltage sag occurs. Commonly, sensitive loads are electronic-based devices which generate harmonics. The magnitude and phase of compensated voltage in DVR depend on grounding system and type of fault. If the system is <b>floating,</b> the <b>zero</b> sequence components do not appear on the load side. Meanwhile, in a neutral grounded system, voltage sag is extremely affected by zero sequence components. A blocking transformer is commonly installed in series with DVR to reduce the effect of zero sequence components. This paper proposes a new DVR control scheme {{that is capable of}} eliminating the blocking transformer and reducing harmonic distortion. The system uses fuzzy polar controller to replace the conventional PI or FL controller that is commonly used. By taking into account the zero sequence components in the controller design, the effects of zero sequence components can be compensated. Simulated results show the effectiveness of the proposed DVR controlle...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of float and critical path {{are central to}} analyzing activity networks in project management. In resource-constrained projects, schedule multiplicity {{makes it difficult to}} calculate float and identify critical activities accurately. In this work, new {{concepts of}} float and critical activity are developed to ascertain critical activities more precisely without reference to activity start and end times in specific schedules. The notions of float, group float, float set, negative <b>float</b> and <b>zero</b> critical activity are introduced, which the project manager can use to deal more effectively with critical activities, duration uncertainty, activity buffering, and resource allocation than the currently available tools in literature. For practical implementation, algorithms are provided and tested to calculate the new measures on the PSPLIB benchmark instances, specifically the J 30, J 60 and J 120 test sets, for the resource constrained project management, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed concepts in helping to identify flexibility in scheduling activities...|$|R
50|$|For example, a numeric {{function}} normally returns a number (int or <b>float),</b> and while <b>zero</b> {{might be a}} valid response; false is not. Similarly, a function that normally returns a string might sometimes return the empty string as a valid response, but return false on failure. This process of type-juggling necessitates care in testing the return value: e.g. in PHP, use === equal and of same type rather than just == equal, after automatic type-conversion. It works only when the original function {{is not meant to}} return a boolean value, and still requires that information about the error be conveyed via other means.|$|R
5000|$|The President of the United States of America, {{authorized}} by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major (Air Corps), {then Captain} John W. Mitchell, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in air actions against the enemy {{while serving as}} a Pilot with the 67th Fighter Squadron and later as Commander of the 339th Fighter Squadron, 347th Fighter Group, 13th Air Force, during the periods 4 October 1942 to 10 November 1942 and from 22 December 1942 to 4 February 1943. On 4 October, Major Mitchell led a flight of eleven P-39 airplanes to Guadalcanal, arriving there on 7 October. On 9 October, he led a flight of P-39 airplanes on two escort missions for SBD airplanes against an enemy naval force 150 miles off Guadalcanal; part of the second mission being accomplished after dark and being extremely hazardous due to the very low ceiling and no landing lights. He destroyed one enemy float bi-plane; others of the flight probably destroyed two others, all returning safely to base. On 23 October, he shot down one enemy Zero while leading a flight of P-39 airplanes on patrol over Guadalcanal, and returning and landing safely after dark in heavy rain. On 7 November, he led a flight of eight P-39's loaded with 500-pound bombs on a dive-bombing mission against an enemy naval force of one cruiser and fourteen destroyers. Intercepted by five enemy float [...] "Zeroes" [...] he destroyed one, and the flight shot down the balance, all returning safely. On 5 January, while with six P-38 airplanes on an escort mission for five B-17 bombers, some twenty-five enemy planes attacked. Outnumbered four-to-one, the fighters destroyed three of the enemy and probable three others, Major Mitchell accounting for one <b>float</b> <b>Zero.</b> On 27 January, he led a flight of six P-38's against a superior force of about thirty [...] "Zeroes" [...] over Guadalcanal and destroyed two of them himself. On 29 January, he took off alone from Henderson Field, Guadalcanal, before daylight in a P-38 to intercept enemy bombers that had been harassing the troops by bombing each night and shot down an enemy type 97 medium bomber making a low-level bombing and strafing run on the field. On 2 February, he led a flight of four P-38's as a bomber escort and shot down one float [...] "Zero" [...] of the three enemy planes {{accounted for by the}} flight. Major Mitchell has destroyed more than five enemy airplanes, having shot down a total of eight confirmed, destroyed an undetermined number on the ground and water during strafing strikes at Rekata Bay and Munda Point, and led numerous other missions in addition to those specifically mentioned, in over 150 hours of combat flying time as Flight Commander.|$|R
40|$|A {{treadmill}} with {{vibration isolation}} and stabilization {{designed for the}} International Space Station (ISS) was evaluated during Shuttle mission STS- 81. Three crew members ran and walked on the device, which <b>floats</b> freely in <b>zero</b> gravity. For {{the majority of the}} more than 2 hours of locomotion studied, the treadmill showed peak to peak linear and angular displacements of less than 2. 5 cm and 2. 5 deg, respectively. Vibration transmitted to the vehicle was within the microgravity allocation limits that are defined for the ISS. Refinements to the treadmill and harness system are discussed. This approach to treadmill design offers the possibility of generating 1 G-like loads on the lower extremities while preserving the microgravity environment of the ISS for structural safety and vibration free experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{mathematical}} modelling and frequency-based analysis for uncoupled roll motions of a floating body in regular waves with the variation of speed. First we compute hydrodynamic coefficients by using strip theory formulation. Considering sinusoidal wave with frequency (ω) varying between 0. 3 to 1. 2 acts on beam to the <b>floating</b> body for <b>zero</b> and non-zero forward speed (U = 0 and 12 m/s) governing equation is obtained. Using the normalization procedure and frequency based analysis; group based equations are formulated for each case. Based on relative importance of the hydrodynamic coefficients, analytical solutions are derived for zero and non-zero forward speed. The sensitivity analysis {{with respect to the}} effect of damping is also investigated. This study could be useful to understand the effect of waves on roll motion due to the variation of speed for various frequencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{maximising}} present value {{is applied to}} the timing of activities in a network. The mathematical form {{of the problem is that}} of maximising a nonlinear function subject to linear constraints and can be solved as a succession of linear programmes. By application of duality principles the problem can be treated as a form of maximum value flow problem in which discounted cash flows are distributed along arcs from pay events to receipt events. The solution is aided by the "equilibrium theorem" of dual linear programming in that in the optimum condition flows occur only along arcs whose corresponding activity has <b>zero</b> <b>float.</b> The flows which occur in the optimally scheduled solution are directly proportional to the marginal cost which would be incurred by lengthening the activity corresponding to the arc along which the flow occurs. Some implications derived from the model are discussed and a number of possible applications are proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} effort entertained herein was to develop, evaluate and fully characterize a multiparticulate floating gastroretentive system for the modified release of zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug. AZT was used as a water-soluble model drug at therapeutic doses. The floating gastroretentive system was obtained via polymer coating of calcium silicate-adsorbed AZT. The proposed system was evaluated in vitro for particle micromorphology, lag time for floating and duration of floating, drug loading capacity, drug release profile, and drug release kinetics. The physicochemical properties of AZT were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. Results from SEM analysis of the AZT-containing floating gastroretentive granules allowed observation of an irregular surface and the apparent absence of pores. Floating of the AZT-containing gastroretentive granules was immediately achieved, that is lag time for <b>floating</b> was virtually <b>zero</b> and duration of floating was higher than 12 h. The drug loading capacity of the floating gastroretentive granules was ca. 81. 09 ± 14. 66 %, and the release system thus obtained exhibited an extended drug release profile. Results from DSC and XRD analyses showed a modification in the AZT solid state, while the FTIR spectroscopy analyses revealed that the chemical structure of AZT remained unchanged upon adsorption to calcium silicate followed by polymeric coating. Hence, the coated granules produced presented gastroretentive, floating, and extended drug release properties. Research Scientist fellowship (FAPESP Ref.

40|$|A {{turbulence}} {{model was}} developed for computing surface velocity coefficient and discharge under steady, uniform flow conditions for rectangular and compound openchannel cross sections. Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, Reynolds stress equations, and kinetic energy and dissipation equations were applied in the model using the finite-volume method with the SIMPLER algorithm. The models show graphical results of the velocity distributions in the longitudinal bed slope direction, secondary velocities, pressure, turbulence kinetic energy, and kinetic energy dissipation rate across the cross section. Also, the surface velocity coefficients were computed at increments of one-eighth of the base width from the vertical walls {{to the center of}} the cross-section, and the submergence depth of the <b>floating</b> object from <b>zero</b> to 30 cm, with a 5 -cm depth increment. Four different sets of Reynolds stress equations (one set by Boussinesq hypothesis and three sets of algebraic stress model) were used to calculate the results. Only one version of the algebraic stress model was successful in predicting the depression of the maximum streamwise velocity below the water surface. The model was calibrated and verified using laboratory data collected at Utah State University. Calculated discharges from the turbulence model had very good agreement with the laboratory data. The surface velocity coefficients from model results were generally lower than the results from the laboratory data, but higher than the values published by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Standard cross-sections of rectangular and compound cross-sections were defined to simulate the model results and model sensitivity to parameter changes. The model results were summarized to show the relationship between surface velocity coefficient and channel characteristics compared with the published values by the USBR. For rectangular cross sections, the coefficients from the model are higher than the published USBR values. But the coefficients from the model and USBR are very close for compound cross sections. The published coefficients by the USBR are a function of only the average water depth. However, the model results show that the coefficients are also related to channel size, surface roughness height, float submergence depth, and lateral location of float object. These factors should be included in the determination of the surface velocity coefficient to improve the discharge estimations from application of the float method...|$|R
