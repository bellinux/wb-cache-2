5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> mostly collapsing in the late 1930s.

5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver {{is used for the}} <b>entire</b> <b>system.</b> The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} in office, Combs was {{appointed}} to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson. He served for three years before resigning and running for governor again in 1971. He lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, his former executive secretary. In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, resulted in the Kentucky Supreme Court declaring the state's <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> of public schools unconstitutional. In response, the Kentucky General Assembly drafted a sweeping education measure known as the Kentucky Education Reform Act in 1991. On December 3, 1991, Combs was caught in a flash flood while driving and was killed.|$|E
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as {{a major step forward}} in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning the safety of the system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.|$|E

5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the <b>entire</b> <b>system.</b> Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the <b>entire</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

However, last coaches are also reserved when the train changes tracks at the terminal stations in the Red, Green and Violet Lines.

As a last resort, GAIA self-destructed {{in order to stop}} HADES. Without GAIA to maintain the terraforming process, the <b>entire</b> <b>system</b> began to break down. As a contingency plan, GAIA created a clone of Dr. Sobeck in the form of Aloy, in the hope that she would find GAIA's message, destroy HADES, and restore GAIA's functions. Aloy learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed her life to ensure the Faro robot swarm would not find GAIA. Aloy manages to obtain the System Override necessary to destroy HADES. Sylens admits that he was the original founder of the Eclipse, originally tempted by HADES' promises of knowledge. With Sylens's help, Aloy surmises that HADES wants to send a signal to reactivate the Faro robots so that they can once again extinguish all life on Earth. Aloy kills Helis and helps fight off waves of corrupted machines, before stabbing HADES with Sylens' lance, ending the war. Aloy then journeys to Dr. Sobeck's old home, where she finds her corpse, and has a moment of mourning for her predecessor. In a post-credits scene, HADES is shown to still be alive, but trapped by Sylens, who intends to interrogate HADES to find out who sent the signal that activated it in the first place.|$|E
