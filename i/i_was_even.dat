25|$|After {{the initial}} dynastic chaos, {{a series of}} longer reigning, better attested kings ruled for about fifty to eighty years. The strongest king of this period, Neferhotep I, ruled for eleven years and {{maintained}} effective control of Upper Egypt, Nubia, and the Delta, with the possible exceptions of Xois and Avaris. Neferhotep <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> recognized as the suzerain of the ruler of Byblos, indicating that the Thirteenth Dynasty was able to retain much {{of the power of}} the Twelfth Dynasty, at least up to his reign. At some point during the 13th dynasty, Xois and Avaris began governing themselves, the rulers of Xois being the Fourteenth Dynasty, and the Asiatic rulers of Avaris being the Hyksos of the Fifteenth Dynasty. According to Manetho, this latter revolt occurred during the reign of Neferhotep's successor, Sobekhotep IV, though there is no archaeological evidence. Sobekhotep IV was succeeded by the short reign of Sobekhotep V, who was followed by Wahibre Ibiau, then Merneferre Ai. Wahibre Ibiau ruled ten years, and Merneferre Ai ruled for twenty three years, the longest of any Thirteenth Dynasty king, but neither of these two kings left as many attestations as either Neferhotep or Sobekhotep IV. Despite this, they both seem to have held at least parts of lower Egypt. After Merneferre Ai, however, no king left his name on any object found outside the south. This begins the final portion of the thirteenth dynasty, when southern kings continue to reign over Upper Egypt, but when the unity of Egypt fully disintegrated, the Middle Kingdom gave way to the Second Intermediate Period.|$|E
500|$|When Songz began {{recording}} for Ready; {{the purpose}} of the album was to crossover and increase his exposure on radio. The album's lead single, [...] "I Need a Girl" [...] was released to connect to mainstream radio. Songz said that [...] " [...] was a very radio-geared record which would do great and play on radio heavily during whatever time. It wasn't a record I expected to last forever, or one <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> excited about singing, but it was a record I knew would do well." [...] Speaking of the following singles, Songz thought that [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] would be a [...] "career-defining record, and I knew 'Say Aah' would be a monster club record." ...|$|E

[...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes.

500|$|... "Don't Forget" [...] is a midtempo glam rock ballad sung with {{vulnerable}} and breathy vocals in a falsetto tone. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{the song is}} set in common time with a metronome of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the note of C4 to the note of E5. The song includes a [...] "rocking" [...] instrumental and a heavy guitar break. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the track to songs by Green Day. Lyrically, [...] "Don't Forget" [...] is about one of Lovato's old love interests who left her {{just as she was}} falling in love with him. The theme is demonstrated in lyrical lines such as, [...] "Did you forget that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> alive? Did you forget everything we ever had?" ...|$|E

[...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E

I mean, that album for her was incredible — 'Beautiful', 'Can’t Hold Us Down', all of that — that’s the stuff that I love," [...] she said. [...] "That was an album, that was complete on my record. I have 'Rise', 'Survivors', 'Revival', 'Kill Em With Kindness'. My stuff is full on, it's an album, it's a piece, it's something that I'm proud of." [...] In an interview with People, Demi Lovato said that her sixth studio album Tell Me You Love Me was inspired by Stripped. She said, [...] "I grew up listening to Christina Aguilera.

2500|$|GameSpy's Christian Nutt {{scored the}} game 4 out of 5, finding it fell {{just short of}} being a classic; [...] "the biggest and most obvious problem with the game has to be its story.

[...] He concluded [...] "There's {{no question in my}} mind that Dark Cloud 2 is one of the most solid RPG adventures for the PS2; but what I am sure of is that it doesn't quite live up to its potential. If Level-5 had worked out all of the kinks, it'd be one of my favorite games for the PS2. Sadly, it's not. While it has my grudging respect, there are many games that I prefer, thanks to DC2's idiosyncrasies." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Convention, Stevenson, as {{governor}} of the host state, was assigned to give the welcoming address to the delegates. His speech was so stirring and witty that it helped stampede his nomination, {{in spite of his}} continued protests that he was not a presidential candidate. In his welcoming speech he poked fun at the 1952 Republican National Convention, which had been held in Chicago in the same coliseum two weeks earlier. Stevenson described the achievements of the Democratic Party under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, but noted [...] "our Republican friends have said it was all a miserable failure. For almost a week pompous phrases marched over this landscape in search of an idea, and the only idea that they found was that the two great decades of progress...were the misbegotten spawn of bungling, of corruption, of socialism, of mismanagement, of waste and worse...after listening to this everlasting procession of epithets about our [...] misdeeds <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> surprised the next morning when the mail was delivered on time.
