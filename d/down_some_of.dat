5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning {{of the dangers of}} adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
5|$|Sandor Clegane tracks <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Brotherhood Without Banners men and brutally kills them, {{searching for}} their leader. He then comes across Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, who are {{preparing}} to hang the men responsible for {{the attack on the}} village. Sandor bargains with Beric, who allows him to personally hang two of the men. Beric and Thoros try to recruit Sandor into the Brotherhood, explaining that they intend to head north to fight the White Walkers and need his strength.|$|E
5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the LM's {{systems to}} conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day {{stay on the}} lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, {{the third and final}} moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E

5|$|As {{late as the}} mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was {{strictly}} off-limits to outsiders. Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with its narrow winding streets lined with inns, noodle shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri {{has become one of}} Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today. The former soldiers had settled <b>down,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local Thais. The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains Yunnanese. Among their local-born descendants, some have adopted a Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry. As of 2007, General Lue Ye-tien, aged 90 and Tuan's former right-hand man, {{is the leader of the}} group, after taking over the leadership on Tuan's death in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention {{as a serious}} threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|Since 2003, Slovenian {{authorities}} {{have attempted to}} rectify this discrimination by introducing a two day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community. The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the stereotypes that caused tension. The Roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding treatment of minorities. The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the stereotypes that caused tension. It also helped to build trust between the Roma community and police. Tensions still exist between the two groups, especially concerning police who have not participated in this programme, however they have been greatly reduced.|$|E
25|$|These strikes were qualitatively {{different}} from those waged over union recognition in the 1930s: employers {{did not try to}} hire strikebreakers to replace their employees, while the unions kept a tight lid on picketers to maintain order and decorum even as they completely shut <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the largest enterprises in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Through the process, the yolk {{becomes a}} dark green to grey color, with a creamy {{consistency}} and strong flavor due to the hydrogen sulfide and ammonia present, while the white becomes a dark brown, translucent jelly with a salty flavor. The transforming agent in the century egg is an alkaline salt, which gradually raises the pH of the egg to around 9–12, during the curing process. This chemical process breaks <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the complex, flavorless proteins and fats, which produces a variety of smaller flavorful compounds.|$|E
25|$|The union, {{like most}} other United States {{construction}} unions, had remained nearly all-white {{for most of its}} history. That began to change in the early 1960s, as the American civil rights movement began to challenge employment discrimination in the north, then picked up steam in the 1970s as the federal government began using the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to knock <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the barriers to African-American workers' entry into the industry. Some local unions of the Iron Workers fought integration and affirmative action tenaciously, but usually unsuccessfully.|$|E

All delegations are expected to be converted by the end of 2010.

The band worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album's release in order to keep costs <b>down.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger's harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase.

25|$|The {{population}} of students {{continued to rise}} in succeeding years, reaching to 7,849 in 1928 from the initial 67 when the university was established in 1908. The need became apparent for UP to create more buildings and academic units, {{which would have been}} hampered by its small location in the heart of Manila. In 1939, the Board of Regents acquired a 493-hectare land in the Diliman District of the newly established Quezon City. Construction began on the area on the same year. The development of the area was then stalled by World War II, with invading Japanese troops occupying some of the buildings built. By 1942, the university was forced to close <b>down</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its colleges, with only the Colleges of Medicine, Engineering, and Pharmacy maintaining their operations.|$|E
25|$|Searching through old videos, {{the team}} learned that Ernie {{had a son}} who'd changed his name from Lionel Dell to Mitchell Douglas. The CSIs assumed {{that he could be}} the killer. However, they soon learned that Ernie’s son despised his father, and that Ernie seemed to love his adopted {{children}} more. Upon learning of his fostering of children, the CSIs learned from a video tape that Ernie had at least thirteen foster kids, any one of which could be the Miniature Killer. The CSIs managed to slowly narrow down the list after tracking numerous of the Dell foster children <b>down,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> whom had died over the years. After epithelials were discovered on a fingerprint of one of the miniature dolls made by the Miniature Killer, the CSI team learned that the killer was female, narrowing down the list of children further.|$|E
