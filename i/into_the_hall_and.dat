5|$|Sigmund asks Odin why {{he would}} expect Eric {{more than any other}} king, to which Odin {{responds}} that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and that he, himself, is the sixth.|$|E
5|$|When Newark, New Jersey, {{hosted the}} 21st National Sängerfest, held on 1–4 July 1906 in Olympic Park, 25,000 {{people showed up}} to hear the music, many {{arriving}} on chartered trains. Only a few thousand {{were able to get}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>and</b> 2,000 were standing. Five thousand singers from more than a hundred sängerbunds representing forty cities from New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware competed for a $20,000 prize offered by Kaiser Wilhelm II.

5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E

5|$|Nine former Flames {{have been}} elected to the Hall of Fame, four of whom earned their {{credentials}} primarily in Calgary. Lanny McDonald was the first Flame player inducted, gaining election in 1992. McDonald recorded 215 goals in 492 games over seven-and-a-half seasons for the Flames, including a team record 66 goals in 1982–83. He was joined in 2000 by a fellow member of the 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, Joe Mullen. Mullen spent five seasons with the Flames, recording 388 points and capturing two Lady Byng Trophies. Grant Fuhr, elected in 2003, became the third former Flames player to enter the Hall.

In 2007, Al MacInnis became the fourth former Flame inducted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> <b>and</b> the third to earn his Hall of Fame credentials primarily as a Flame.

5|$|The credits appear over a {{flashback}} to a Christmas dinner {{where all the}} Scoobies are present, having a typical lighthearted conversation as Joyce and Buffy discuss a pie that drops on the floor. The scene snaps back to Buffy in the living room, shaking Joyce and screaming at her. She calls for an ambulance and attempts CPR, accidentally snapping a rib in the process, but to no avail. Buffy calls Giles. The paramedics arrive and work on Joyce and she revives, the paramedics declare it a miracle in the ambulance, and Joyce, Buffy, and Dawn rejoice in the hospital. The scene snaps back {{to the living room}} where the paramedics continue to work on Joyce until they stop and tell Buffy that Joyce is dead. They leave, and Buffy goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> vomits. Giles arrives and Buffy tells him not to move the body, shocking herself by using that word.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E
25|$|When the {{conventions}} of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views {{in a speech to}} the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.|$|E

Orr was the eighth player to have the three-year period waived, the next two being Mario Lemieux (1997) and Wayne Gretzky (1999), after which the Hall decided that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under [...] "certain humanitarian circumstances".|$|E

2500|$|Hobbled by {{injuries}} {{and with his}} skills eroded, Clapper originally retired {{before the start of}} the 1946–47 season, but returned to play in November 1946 to replace the injured Jack Crawford in the Bruins' lineup. [...] He played only sporadically thereafter, and retired for good on February 12, 1947. Leading the Bruins to a 10-1 victory over the New York Rangers in his final game (in which Bill Cowley broke the league career scoring record), the Bruins further announced that day that his number #5 sweater would be retired, and the Hockey Hall of Fame immediately inducted him as an Honoured Member. [...] Clapper was the only active player ever to be inducted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> <b>and</b> at the time the only living Member inducted.|$|E
2500|$|Furness altered an {{existing}} stone house, turning its {{first and second}} floors <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> upper hall of the new house, and shooting out rooms in multiple directions. This {{was one of his}} most exuberant and freewheeling suburban houses, featuring a stone water tower with Juliet balconies, his trademark [...] "upside-down" [...] brick chimneys, roofs with jerkin head gables, dormers topped with gabled, hipped, shed (and even one tall, pyramidical) roofs, a great bay window thrusting out {{at the top of the}} stairs, and a Japanese tea room appended to the wrap-around porch. Architectural historian James F. O'Gorman described the exterior as [...] "a plastic chorus of towers, bays, sheds, gables, and chimneys." [...] The upper floors were clad in wood shingles, varying between shakes and fish-scales.|$|E

2500|$|In the Half-Blood Prince, Grawp {{is moved}} to the mountains, where he is {{apparently}} progressing much better. He also attends Dumbledore’s funeral with Hagrid, much more civil and calm than before, and dressed formally. He also appears to understand emotions, {{at least to some}} extent, as he pats Hagrid’s head to comfort him. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Grawp, Hagrid, and Fang go into hiding after Hagrid throws a [...] "Support Harry Potter" [...] party and it is implied that Grawp helped them all escape. He is the only giant fighting against the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, probably in an attempt to protect Hagrid, as he frequently calls his name while fighting the Death Eaters. Grawp participates in the victory celebration over Voldemort’s defeat (albeit from a window, since he is too big to fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall),</b> <b>and</b> the Hogwarts students show their appreciation by tossing food into his laughing mouth.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, Graner's {{wife and}} mother of their two {{children}} filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner {{had come to her}} house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit her face with her arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had [...] "yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> tried to throw me down the steps." [...] Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, [...] "I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead." [...] Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted.|$|E
2500|$|During the Qing dynasty, a {{man named}} Wang Yuanwai living in Beipinggao village (about [...] east of Chenjiagou), was {{threatened}} with death by a gang of highwaymen with bladed weapons, unless he surrendered his valuables. He sent for assistance from Chen Suole (see the lineage tree above), who was away according to his sons Chen Shenru and Chen Xunru – despite their being only around fifteen and sixteen years old, the boys volunteered their own help instead. They convinced the messenger to tell Wang Yuanwai to give the bandits liquor, discussed a plan and that night, traveled to the Wang residence in Beipinggao, where they jumped over the fence of the rear garden and there found Wang Yuanwai. He {{told them that the}} highwaymen, numbering around twenty, were drunken in his guest hall. While peeping in, Shenru pushed Xunru <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>and</b> extinguished several candles by throwing a bunch of peas at them. Xunru leapt onto beam and taunted, the panicked bandits who had seemingly started fighting each other, saying, [...] "So you still will not hand over your weapons and surrender? Gods number one and two are here." [...] Some tried to escape the frenzy, but were attacked by Shenru, who was still at the door.|$|E
