5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south.</b> The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south</b> is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined around Worsley from {{as long ago}} as 1376, {{originally}} in bell pits. The coal seams in the area tend to be fairly thin, slanting downwards <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south,</b> and so deeper mining became necessary during the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} exists {{among the}} river otters. Males are, on average, 5% larger than females. In Idaho, juvenile, yearling, and adult males averaged 8, 11, and 17% heavier, respectively, than females {{of the same}} age. A clinical reduction in size may exist <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south</b> along the Pacific coast, but not from east to west.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} geographical {{factors that influence}} the climate of Argentina are latitude, elevation, and distance from the sea. With Argentina extending from 22oS to 55oS, {{there are differences in}} the amount of incoming solar radiation and the amount of daylight received in each season, which affects temperature. Thus, temperatures decrease <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south</b> due to the differences in latitudes.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south</b> and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E

I-295 encircles Providence while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million.|$|E

Spanish missionaries laid the groundwork for the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Petén from 1596 onwards, but no further Spanish entry of central Petén took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of Mérida in Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Japan is {{predominantly}} temperate, but varies greatly <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south.</b> Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.|$|E

Should there be the threat of landfall, warnings or watches would be issued for those sections of coast. It is highly unlikely that any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north due to the stronger influence of the California Current.|$|E
