In the present work we investigated the iodine content in various starting infant formulae, follow-on formulae, special formulae and various other samples intended for preparation of baby food. We compared the values obtained with the <b>declared</b> <b>values</b> where possible, and with data {{found in the literature}} with the purpose of examining improvements made during last decade. Radiochemical neutron activation analysis was employed to determine the content of iodine in the selected samples. This method is based on ignition of the irradiated sample in an oxygen atmosphere, followed by absorption of iodine in a reducing acid solution containing 1 M H 2 SO 4 and 10 % Na 2 SO 3. Extraction of iodine was achieved with chloroform via the classical redox reaction with 10 % NaNO 3 and 2. 5 M H 2 SO 4. The chemical yield of the procedure for each sample aliquot was determined spectrophotometrically. The values of iodine obtained in eighteen different infant foemulae, with the exception of two, showed insufficient agreement with the <b>declared</b> <b>values</b> and there is still a great need for stricter quality control of infant formulae. The median iodine content of eighteen infant foemulae was 136 ug l- 1, implying that newborns would reach the newest recommended daily requirements for iodine when they have consumed approximately 0. 5 l of prepared infant formula...|$|R

This laboratory has previously reported the simultaneous determination of eight water-soluble vitamin standards that is, B 1, B 2, B 6, B 12, C, niacin, niacinamide and folic acid. The proposed isocratic HPLC method, employing 3 channels of detection, adequately separated all eight vitamins in less than 20 minutes. This study reports another phase of the project whereby the method was employed {{for the analysis of}} pharmaceutical preparations. Different extraction procedures were first evaluated, namely acid, acid plus enzyme and alkaline hydrolysis methods, using vitamin standards, individual vitamin tablets and multivitamin preparations. The amounts obtained from the analysis were compared with the <b>declared</b> <b>values.</b> Recovery studies were also carried out.

Further trials on folic acid showed that the problem could be resolved by omitting the filtration step in the final extract after acid hydrolysis and diluting with 0. 01 N sodium hydroxide before processing for chromatography.
