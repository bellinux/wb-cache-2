5|$|The Federal Highway Administration {{approved}} the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. As with the Ellendale area, DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 along its present alignment from south of Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Interchanges are planned near Piney Grove Road and Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; near Speedway Road, Alms House Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street {{on the southern}} edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18 and DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Highway's intersection with DE 18 and DE 404 has the highest crash rate and the highest level of traffic congestion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>area,</b> so that intersection will be replaced with an interchange first. US 113 will be expanded to six lanes throughout the corridor, and right-in/right-out access to adjoining businesses would be maintained, with efforts {{to reduce the number of}} contact points.|$|E

25|$|The Battlefield Boundary is {{restricted}} to the immediate flow of battle after {{one side or the}} other has moved to initiate combat. For example, if a unit left its encampments intending to attack the enemy, it is appropriate to include the encampments and the accompanying approach routes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Area</b> as the initial position of the attacking force. The route of the previous day's march to reach those encampments, however, would not be included.|$|E
30|$|From the Table  1, {{it can be}} {{put forth}} that the CaI 1 values range from − 4.4 to 0.3 {{with a mean of}} − 1.1 and CaI 2 values vary from − 0.56 to 0.27 with a mean of − 0.25. From these values, it can be {{interpreted}} that most of the samples (95  %) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>area</b> fall into negative zones. They indicate that the exchange of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + of the water with Na and K in its host environment is prevalent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>area.</b> <b>The</b> result suggests that cation exchangeable can also be one of the mechanisms responsible for the chemical composition of <b>the</b> groundwaters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R

25|$|A study {{examining}} {{birds in}} northwestern Colombia for blood parasites found the Muscovy duck {{to be more}} frequently infected with Haemoproteus and malaria (Plasmodium) parasites than chickens, domestic pigeons, domestic turkeys and in fact almost all wild bird species studied also. It was noted that {{in other parts of}} the world, chickens were more susceptible to such infections than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>area,</b> but it may well be that Muscovy ducks are generally more often infected with such parasites (which might not cause pronounced disease though, and are harmless to humans).|$|E
25|$|In a 1996 biotic {{assessment}} of upper Searsville Lake {{and the lower}} floodplain of Corte Madera Creek, Stanford biologists wrote that the native species likely included coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), sculpin, California roach (Hesperoleucas symmetricus), hitch (Lavinia exilcauda), speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus), and perhaps three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidontus), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). They noted that the only native species observed with any regularity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>area</b> are Sacramento sucker and rainbow trout, and attributed the now depauperate native fish fauna to dislocation of hydrologic connectivity due to the dam, transformation of the habitat above the dam from lotic to lentic, {{and the fact that}} Searsville Reservoir harbors many non-native species of centrarchid fishes (sunfish, black bass, and crappie) which prey on virtually all historically native fishes. They noted that federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii) occur in the lotic portions of Corte Madera Creek below the dam but not above, likely due to depredation by non-native fish and American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus).|$|E

500|$|Nuthatches are monogamous, {{and a pair}} {{occupies}} a breeding territory in which it spends the winter as well. Territory sizes range from [...] in Europe {{to an average of}} [...] in the sub-optimal conifer forests of Siberia. The male sings to defend his territory and attract a mate. Both sexes have a courtship display with a floating, quivering flight, and the male will also make circular flights with a spread tail and raised head. He will also feed the female while courting her. Despite the lifelong pairing, genetic research in Germany showed that at least 10% of the young <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>area</b> were fathered by another male, usually from an adjacent territory.|$|E

Of 11 resident females, 7 were still alive {{at the end of the}} study period, 2 disappeared after losing their territories to rivals, and 2 died. The initial loss of two resident males and subsequent take over of their home ranges by new males caused social instability for two years. Of 4 resident males, 1 was still alive and 3 were displaced by rivals. Five litters of cubs were killed by infanticide, 2 litters died because they were too young to fend for themselves when their mothers died.

Most of the farmers (69. 09 %) applied TSP below the recommended dose while 81. 82 % of the farmers applied MoP over the recommended dose. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> also revealed a positive and significant relationship between adoption and the variables like education, experience and extension contact.

2500|$|In early 1988, the Working Group for California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP) {{made several}} {{statements}} regarding their forecasts for the [...] northern San Andreas Fault segment, the [...] San Francisco Peninsula segment, and a [...] {{portion of that}} segment which {{was referred to as}} the southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment.

Following each event, the State office of Emergency Services issued (for the first time in Bay Area history) short term advisories for a possible large earthquake, which meant there was [...] "a slightly increased likelihood of an M6.5 event on the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault". The advisories following the two Lake Elsman events were issued in part because of the statements made by WGCEP and because they were two of the three largest shocks to occur along the 1906 earthquake's rupture zone since 1914.|$|E
