40|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} debates today is whether pollution-intensive industries from rich countries relocate to poor countries with weaker environmental standards, turning them into pollution havens. Empirical studies to date show little {{evidence to support the}} pollution haven hypothesis, but suffer potentially from omitted variable bias, specification, and measurement errors. The authors estimate the strength of pollution-haven behavior by examining the location choices of equity joint venture (EJV) projects in China. They derive a location choice model from a theoretical framework that incorporates the firm's production and abatement decision, agglomeration, and factor abundance. The authors estimate conditional logit and nested logit models using new data sets containing information on a sample of EJV projects, effective <b>environmental</b> <b>levies</b> on water pollution, and estimates of Chinese pollution-intensity for 3 -digit ISIC (International Standard Industrial Classification) industries. Results from 2, 886 manufacturing joint venture projects from 1993 - 96 show that EJVs from all source countries go into provinces with high concentrations of foreign investment, relatively abundant stocks of skilled workers, concentrations of potential local suppliers, special incentives, and less state ownership. Environmental stringency does affect location choice, but not as expected. Low <b>environmental</b> <b>levies</b> are a significant attraction only for joint ventures in highly-polluting industries with partners from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan (China). In contrast, joint ventures with partners from OECD sources are not attracted by low <b>environmental</b> <b>levies,</b> regardless of the pollution intensity of the industry. The authors discuss the likely role of technological differences in explaining these results.

However, policy makers often find such Pigou taxes difficult to implement because of political resistance due to possibly adverse affects on equity. For this reason {{it is important to}} assess the distributional aspects of <b>environmental</b> <b>levies.</b> This article estimates properties of the demand for transportation in parametric and non-parametric analyses of Consumer Expenditure Surveys for the United States, 2000, and finds patterns in the resulting set of Engel curves. Private transportation using air flights and new automobiles have Engel elasticities above unity while public transportation via mass transit has Engel elasticity below unity. The findings can be interpreted in an important way since they show that a differentiated scheme of environmental taxes on transportation may function progressively. A Pigou scheme with larger taxes on modes of transportation that pollute more appears to coincide with larger levies on luxury modes preferred by richer households.

While new research emphasizes the potentially significant distortions created by environmental taxes and appears to undermine the so-called "double dividend" theory, it also suggests that virtually any environmental policy, including regulations, taxes, and tradable permits, can compound existing distortions in the tax system. Currently, direct environmental taxes, such as per-unit charges on emissions, are only in limited use; however, indirect <b>environmental</b> <b>levies,</b> including taxes on fuels, vehicles, beverage containers, and fertilizers, are growing in importance across the OECD nations.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} setting of optimal fiscal policy in a second-best world with {{environmental}} externalities. The optimal second-best pollution tax is shown to lie below the first-best Pigovian tax, particularly if substitution between labor and polluting intermediate inputs is easy, the labor supply curve is more elastic, and preexisting taxes are large. The optimal level of public abatement {{is derived from the}} modified Samuelson rule and is larger if society cares more for the environment, public funds are inexpensive, and public abatement is relatively productive. The analysis also shows that the Samuelson rule should be revised if allowance is made for nonseparabilities in preferences.

It is likely that the more vulnerable members of the community will be at risk during heat waves in the future from both health and financial perspectives. The trend towards fully air conditioned larger homes has already seen very large peaks in electricity demand during past heat waves. Electricity prices have increased substantially in recent years and will increase further due to greater peak demand and <b>environmental</b> <b>levies.</b> To manage the risks to dwelling occupants during heat waves, research has been carried out to determine methods of promoting adaptive behaviours through residential design.

40|$|This audit finds {{deficiencies}} in the Department of Environment and Primary Industries’ management of the <b>Environmental</b> Contribution <b>Levy.</b> Overview Since 2004 – 05, Victorians have been paying for the costs of sustainable water-related initiatives through their water bills. This {{has been in the}} form of the <b>Environmental</b> Contribution <b>Levy</b> (ECL), which is linked to the revenue of water businesses. By 2015 – 16 it is expected that almost 1 billion will have been collected through the ECL.

While DEPI’s administration of individual ECL projects has generally been sound, there are {{deficiencies in}} the department’s management of the levy. In particular, there have been weaknesses in the processes for selecting and prioritising proposed projects across the three tranches of the levy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. On the one hand it aims at {{extending}} King-Fullerton methodology to a larger scope of liabilities and primarily, in the empirical section of the paper, to statutory charges associated to labour costs, basically employers' contributions to social security. Thus it proposes substituting MESC or Marginal Effective Statutory Charge, for King-Fullerton METR, and enlarging the p-statistics to requirements in terms of labour cost coverage, then reinterpreting it in terms of marginal value added. A further extension to <b>environmental</b> <b>levies</b> as well as a generalisation to any market failure inefficiency loss are also presented. On the other hand the paper intends to emphasize the key role of factor supply elasticities or relative mobility and market rigidities in determining the impact of the - or part of the - MESC statistics on the location decision of an MNE, a Multinational Enterprise. Indeed, in a setting where no rigidities are at work on the market for the immobile factor, like labour, levies on the compensation of that factor don't matter for MNE decision. Unlike that, in a setting where such rigidities are present, they do matter since they refrain the possibility to pass the burden of the tax on the holder of the rather immobile factor. The ultimate goal of the paper is, through the topics mentioned above, to cope with issues especially relevant for interjurisdictional behaviour of multinational entreprises without the framework of a nex Federation like the European Union...|$|R

40|$|Sustainomics is to {{transform}} ongoing activities and planning of future developments more sustainable; balancing its key elements society, {{economy and the}} environment. Sri Lanka introduced environmental taxes by the <b>Environmental</b> Conservation <b>Levy</b> Act No. 26 of 2008 as another strategy to reach the sustainable development. A cess on polythene and plastic raw materials has been imposed previous to the said Act. The present study evaluates {{the effectiveness of the}} cess as a lesson for future taxation. When it was assumed that there were no other taxes imposed on importation of polythene and plastic raw materials, there was no a significant direct impact of the cess on the amount of polythene plastic raw materials imported into the country during the period from January 2008 to March 2009. The percentage of polythene and plastic waste amount recycled was 4. 27 % in 2008 and it was 3. 05 % in 2007 compared to the total importation in respective years. The study recommends introducing a tax to be imposed on polythene bags which is a tax to the consumer as it has been successful in some other countries. Another area studied was on the life cycle of mobile phones within Sri Lanka imported from 2006 to 2010. There is a rapid growth in use of mobile phones in Sri Lanka. The estimated stock of waste mobile phones generated in 2011 is 598 MT. The estimated value of the expected stock of recoverable metals from waste mobile phones in 2011 is Rs. 1094. 695 million. Expected Gold stock has the highest value of Rs. 811 million. Calculated amount of waste mobile phones that would be generated in year 2012 is 284 MT and 342 MT in 2013, if the lifespan of a mobile phone is 5 years. Therefore the study recommends carrying out a feasibility study considering environmental, technical, economic as well as social factors to establish a material recovery plant in Sri Lanka.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{international}} trade in hazardous waste products {{when there is an}} international oligopoly market for waste, and both waste-importing and waste-exporting countries act strategically to utilize national environmental policies to attach rents arising from trade in waste. The authors model a multiple-stage game where waste is generated in an industrialized country as a byproduct of production, and potentially is exported to some less-developed countries, if not abated locally, or imposed on local residents at a cost of an environmental tax. In the market for waste, an oligopolistic supply is assumed. The demand for waste is perfectly competitive, with waste-processing firms guided by marginal disposal costs and <b>environmental</b> taxes <b>levied</b> by foreign countries. With each country playing Nash, the analysis finds domestic and foreign taxes to be distorted from the Pigouvian taxes {{in such a way that}} the domestic (waste-exporter) tax rate is set below, and the foreign tax rate is set above, the Pigouvian taxes.

40|$|We {{describe}} three {{challenges for}} biodiversity planning, which arise {{from a study}} in Papua New Guinea, but apply equally to biodiversity planning in general. These are 1) {{the best use of}} available data for providing biodiversity surrogate information, 2) the integration of representativeness and persistence goals into the area prioritization process, and 3) implications for the implementation of a conservation plan over time. Each of these problems is linked to the effective use of complementarity. Further, we find that a probabilistic framework for calculating persistence-based complementarity values over time can contribute to resolving each challenge. Probabilities allow for the exploration of a range of possible complementarity values over different planning scenarios, and provide a way to evaluate biodiversity surrogates. The integration of representativeness and persistence goals, via estimated probabilities of persistence, facilitates the crediting of partial protection provided by sympathetic management. For the selection of priority areas and land use allocation, partial protection may be a "given" or implied by an allocated land use. Such an integration also allows the incorporation of vulnerability/threat information at the level of attributes or areas, incorporating persistence values that may depend on reserve design. As an example of the use of persistence probabilities, we derive an alternative proposed priority area set for PNG. This is based on 1) a goal of 0. 99 probability of persistence of all biodiversity surrogate attributes used in the study, 2) an assumption of a 0. 10 probability of persistence {{in the absence of any}} form of formal protection, and 3) a 0. 90 probability of persistence for surrogate attributes in proposed priority areas, assuming formal protection is afforded to them. The calculus of persistence also leads to a proposed system of <b>environmental</b> <b>levies</b> based on biodiversity complementarity values. The assigned levy for an area may change to reflect its changing complementarity value in light of changes to protection status of other areas. We also propose a number of complementarity-based options for a carbon credits framework. These address required principles of additionality and collateral benefits from biodiversity protection. A related biodiversity credits scheme, also based on complementarity, encourages investments in those areas that make greatest ongoing contributions to regional biodiversity representation and persistence. All these new methods point to a new ·systematic conservation planning" that is not focused only on selecting sets of areas but utilizes complementarity values and changes in probabilities of persistence for a range of decision making processes. The cornerstone of biodiversity planning, complementarity, no longer reflects only relative amounts of biodiversity but also relative probabilities of persistence...|$|R
