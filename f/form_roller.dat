5000|$|Indirect {{dampening}} systems (or integrated dampening systems) {{feed the}} water directly {{into one of}} the ink form rollers (ink rollers that touch the offset plate) via a water <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> in contact with it. These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the offset plate passing through the inking system and not directly to the offset plate as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} offset plate. A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{indication}} {{of the quality of}} a printing press is the number of distribution and form rollers. The greater the number of distribution rollers, the more accurate the control of ink uniformity. It is difficult to ink large solid areas on a plate with only one ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> With three (generally the maximum), it is relatively easy to maintain consistent ink coverage of almost any image area on the plate. Business forms presses, which print very little coverage, usually only have one or two ink form rollers. Because of this, they cannot print large solid or screen images. Smaller, less sophisticated presses also have the same problem, however, many of the newer presses today are being equipped with larger, better inking systems to meet the growing print demands of the consumer.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} use CBN {{grinding}} wheels technologically and economically successful, their correct use preparation is of decisive importance. Systematic investigations when truing ceramic bonded CBN grinding wheels with a diamond <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> should show {{the influence of}} the process setting parameters and the contour inclination of the abrasive coating on the grinding result. Analogous considerations made it possible to carry out the tests using a single grinding wheel with a straight profile. In doing so, a loading of the abrasive coating was produced in axial direction by special grinding kinematics. The influence of the inclination angle on the coherence of the abrasive coating becomes clear particulary for the wear behaviour. A reason for this is the loading of the abrasive coating by an axial force component. What is more, {{the influence of the}} speed ratio on the performance of CBN grinding wheels was examined with a high-speed device for diamond form rollers...|$|E
40|$|Splined Mandrel Flow Forming (SMFF) is an {{effective}} method for fabricating a variety of internally-ribbed cylindrical parts. The process is, however, prone to premature failure of the splined mandrels and this {{is thought to be}} related to the magnitude of the forming forces exerted by the <b>forming</b> <b>rollers</b> on the mandrel splines. In this thesis an experimentation-based approach is used to investigate the effects of critical process parameters; namely, Inter-roller offset of the X 1 -X 2 <b>forming</b> <b>rollers,</b> Oa, roller inclination angle, roller nose radius, r 0, <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> feed rate and mandrel rotational speed, on forming forces exerted on an AISI 1020 steel work piece as it is flow formed over a splined mandrel.

40|$|AbstractPerformance of {{grinding}} operation {{is influenced by}} a variety of factors amongst which dressing process is the most important. Through the dressing process, the grinding wheel topography is produced. This affects, in turn, directly the grinding forces, workpiece surface quality and grinding wheel wear. This research aims to develop appropriate dressing strategies for small abrasive wheels in internal cylindrical grinding. For this purpose, three different dressing rollers, including an electroplated, a vitrified bond <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> and a cup-dresser, with four different grinding wheels, two CBN and two corundum wheels, were experimented. The studies on the ground surface roughness values and grinding forces prove the validity of the Schmitt-diagram in internal cylindrical {{grinding operation}}s. When up-dressing, a finer workpiece surface was achieved as compared to the case of down-dressing. This is associated with higher grinding forces which are caused by the finer grinding wheel surface. Further investigation was carried out on the wear rate of CBN grinding wheels. However, no measurable wear was seen up to a specific material removal volume of 9700 mm 3 /mm...|$|E
40|$|Driography is a planographic {{printing}} process. A driographic printing plate differs from a conventional offset lithographic plate in that water {{is not required}} to keep the non-image area clean of ink during printing. Water, or fountain solution, is not required during printing because a silicone rubber coating which repels ink is used for the non-image area of a driographic plate. The first driographic plate was introduced in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s by the 3 M Company. The plate was a positive working printing plate and has since been discontinued. Driography has since been researched by a number of companies but only one is presently marketing a driographic plate. The Toray Company, a Japanese based firm, is producing a negative working driographic printing plate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research Toray 2 ̆ 7 s negative working driographic printing plate. It is hypothesized that as ink tack decreases, toning in the non-image area will increase. In this experiment, ink tack was monitored at the point of impression using a thermocouple device. The thermocouple was used to measure ink temperature on an inking <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> Temperature/tack curves were developed and used to convert ink temperatures to tack readings. The actual experiment was performed on a duplicator offset printing press. A second technique using ink tack-reducer to alter ink tack was performed as an alternative test to support the initial method results. During the course of the study a number of variables could have altered the test results. These variables were monitored and kept constant during testing. The variable which affected test results most dramatically was the oil content in the ink. It was concluded that the amount of oil content in an ink had more influence on the degree of toning than ink tack did as originally hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|Talc is {{extensively}} {{used in a}} {{wide variety}} of cosmetic products, particularly in powder products. Talc keeps the skin feeling smooth and dry. Talc in the pharmaceutical industry is used as a glidant and lubricant. Glidants such as talc improve flow properties of powder by decreasing interparticulate friction, by decreasing van der Waals forces and electrostatic charges, by changing particle size distribution, and by decreasing the effect of humidity on surfaces of host particles by forming a mechanical barrier. The loosely bound lattice layers slide over each other and <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> structures which explains its lubrication characteristics. Talc has less deleterious effect compared to magnesium stearate on tablet in vitro properties. Talcs from different size grades were evaluated for their use in direct compression tablet formulations. Lubricant efficiencies of talcs were measured using ejection force values. The Supra grade of the Cyprus Industrial Mineral company talc was found to be most efficient of the grades tested as lubricant and also gave tablets of more acceptable in vitro properties than tablets lubricated with magnesium stearate only. Additionally talcs in substantial percentages were evaluated for their potential as a direct compression matrix material. With commonly used excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose and lactose, the formulations were self lubricating and the tablets ejected easily. Tablets with very low friability, high crushing strength, rapid dissolution rates, good weight uniformity, content uniformity and potency of drugs were obtained. At similar compression forces, tablet hardness with the 300 grade of Alabama, Altac, and Beaverwhite talcs were significantly greater than corresponding 400 and 500 grades. An optimum direct compression tablet formulation of a conventional theophylline tablet was achieved using the technique of response surface methodology and successive quadratic programming (SQP). The response surfaces were obtained from a second order uniform precision hexagonal design. The tablet formulation was optimized for mean in vitro dissolution time using friability, hardness, ejection force and disintegration time as constraints within the experimental region by the SQP algorithm. The response surface model was validated by preparing and evaluating the predicted formulation. The characteristics of the tablet formulation were analyzed by principal component analysis. Sensitivity analysis of optimal solution was performed for each constraint, while all remaining constraints were held constant. The robustness of the response surface model was evaluated by simulation for error in the compression force values due to its inherent variation. Although pharmaceutical scientists have previously reported optimization studies, the approach used in this thesis has significant advantages and have not apparently been previously used or the optimization of pharmaceutical formulation. A completely novel use for talc as a major matrix component in direct compression tablet formulation, has been proposed and examined. A robust and efficient response surface experimental design and mathematical optimization technique has been evaluated for application to the pharmaceutical sciences. The computer search method has the disadvantage of frequently giving a plural solution for suitable formulations. With the classical Lagrangian method, it can become difficult to solve the resultant set of simultaneous equations especially for nonlinear problems. The SQP method is more efficient and robust compared to previously published optimization techniques including SUMT (Successive Unconstrained Minimization Technique). The SQP method can also be used to obtain solution to the problems solved by the previously mentioned optimization methods...|$|E

50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution roller and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating rollers (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R

In the present paper, the characteristic of corner cracks in the mandrel teeth (made of S 7 tool steel) of a spinning process has been investigated. The rotational speed of the mandrel is about 300 rpm during spinning process and the sheet metal (i. e. AISI 1020) is in contact with mandrel teeth to get the mandrel shape at the end of process. During this process, the mandrel teeth eventually break away. Fractography analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) clearly confirm “fatigue” as being the main reason for the failure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{by using}} a {{practical}} 3 D FE model, one power spinning process of parts with transverse inner rib has been simulated. The stress and strain fields have been obtained and the features of metal flow in plastic deformation zone have been discussed thoroughly. Then, the main forming defects and their origins have been explored based {{on the study of}} the metal flow, shown as follows; (1) during the non-rib process, the main forming defect is the wall fracture in finished deformation zone. The origin of this forming defect is the excessive metal flow in thickness direction ahead of the <b>forming</b> <b>roller.</b> (2) in the rib-forming process, the main forming defect is the undesired inner rib. The origin of this forming defect is the excessive metal flow in hoop direction during the former non-rib process. (3) the features of the metal flow during flange part process are almost the same as those in the non-rib process. The achievements of this study can thoroughly reveal the deformation mechanism and provide an important basis for the optimization of the process parameters and the precise control of the power spinning process of parts with transverse inner rib...|$|R
