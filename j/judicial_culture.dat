40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{research}} {{examines the}} criminal intellectual property (IP) judicial reforms of Taiwan under the U. S. Special 301 framework. These reforms targeted the sole intermediate appellate court specializing in IP, the Intellectual Property Court (IPC). Following {{twenty years of}} judicial reforms trying to raise criminal punishment against IP infringers, Taiwan finally established the IPC in 2008 and transferred jurisdiction over appellate criminal IP cases to it. Due in part to these twenty years of reforms, the United States lifted its long-term Special 301 oversight from Taiwan in 2009, and named Taiwan as a successful model of fighting IP piracy. In spite of U. S. efforts, Taiwan's judiciary continued to follow existing sentencing patterns. This resistance to change appears {{to be due to}} the creation of a <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> surrounding the sentencing of criminal IP defendants and gradually increasing judicial independence in general. Because the institutional context within which judges sentence criminal IP defendants remained largely unchanged after the reforms, the reforms had little impact. Long-term conflicts between the reforms resulting from U. S. pressure and the local context of judicial practice were the reality behind what the United States claimed was a successful model of IP law reform to reduce piracy in Taiwan. The termination of the U. S. oversight in 2009 provides an opportunity to explore this so-called successful model. This research answers the following questions with respect to the conflicts: What is the U. S. Special 301 framework which shaped Taiwan's judicial reforms toward a punishment regime for IP protection? What are the contexts of Taiwan's judicial independence and <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> that protected and reinforced judges' existing sentencing patterns? How, and why, did the judiciary resist the pressure of judicial reforms toward a harsher punishment regime for IP infringement? This research outlines the legal framework within which the United States imposed pressure on Taiwan to reform its IP laws, evolution of Taiwan's IP laws during the period of intense U. S. pressure, and analysis of statistical data and individual cases with respect to judges' sentencing patterns before and after the establishment of the IPC. Based on these analyses, this research finds: (1) the rise of judicial independence following Taiwan's democratization blunted the impact of judicial reforms in the IP criminal sanctions area; (2) the long-term development of a local <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> reinforced the sentencing patterns favoring lenient sentences in the area of criminal IP law; and (3) in spite of the 2008 judicial reforms aiming to raise criminal punishment for IP protection there is no evidence to support the idea that judges changed their existing sentencing patterns and became harsher. In light of these findings, it appears that Taiwan cannot be held up as an example of success for the U. S. anti-piracy policy based on harsher criminal sanctions. In Taiwan, domestic judges' lenient sentences for IP infringements were unchanged by the judicial reforms under the U. S. Special 301 framework because growing judicial independence weakened the impact of the judicial reforms and within the judiciary local <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> reinforced the existing sentencing patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent to}} which judges in the American federal system and in England and Wales respond to sanctions, in their codes of civil procedure, for {{non-compliance}} with those rules, varies according to which of two ‘philosophies of justice’ are prevalent in the <b>judicial</b> <b>culture.</b> Taking {{as a starting point}} the application of the ‘ultimate’ sanction, that of exclusion from the trial itself, in the two jurisdictions, the article first draws out the features of the two philosophies, finding them surprisingly similar in both jurisdictions.

40|$|No {{matter what}} the profession, any charge that a fellow {{professional}} is guilty of malpractice is a prima facie invitation to other professionals to retreat to a guild mentality, denying that the infraction took place. The impetus to cover up is not primarily due to friendship toward the accused but rather to a general perception that disclosure would lead to public disrespect of the profession as a whole. Many judges may feel that their own standing in the community could be undermined by disclosures that other judges invent or misstate facts. The issue here is not which judges have integrity, but rather that the <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> itself apparently has little room for countenancing disclosure of misbehavior that could undermine {{public confidence in the}} judiciary...|$|E

There have been several outcomes : magistrates' identities are being overhauled, the legitimacy of the judiciary has become even more difficult to establish, and the balance of power among the different legal professions has shifted.

40|$|This Article {{discusses}} supreme {{and constitutional}} courts’ internal organizational cultures, that is, {{the way in}} which justices organize their work and establish informal decision-making norms. Courts of last resort are often presented as exemplary deliberative institutions. The conference meeting, which convenes judges in quiet seclusion to debate, has been glorified as the most significant step in a court’s decision-making process. Based in part on qualitative empirical research, I argue, however, that French, American, and European Justices may not deliberate in the full sense that deliberative democrats have theorized. The Article distinguishes two types of high court deliberations, which I call the “ex ante” and the “ex post” models. In the first model, prevalent in the French and European courts, judges draft and deliberate the court’s merits opinion before the case is orally argued and scheduled for the conference meeting. In other words, cases are decided before being decided. The second model is typical of Anglo-American supreme courts, in particular the United States Supreme Court; in this model, justices do most of the deliberative work after the case has been orally argued and a vote on the merits has taken place at the conference. In other words, cases are decided after being decided. Despite different <b>judicial</b> <b>cultures,</b> one common theme is that in both ex ante and ex post courts, judges tend to decide cases through a succession of multiple small group interactions involving non-judicial personnel rather than a single prolonged face-to-face deliberation. The upshot of the Article is the formulation of a dual-influence hypothesis: a court’s style of judicial opinions may form deliberations as much as deliberations shape opinions...|$|R

This system provides these newly recruited judges with access to frequently asked questions (FAQ) through a natural language interface. The impact and limits of the implementation of Iuriservice in the larger context of the court system will also be considered.

40|$|French {{sentencing}} {{is characterized}} by broad judicial discretion and an ethos of individualized justice focused on rehabilitation. The aims are to prevent recidivism, and so protect the interests of society, while reintegrating the offender. By contrast, the political Right, characterized by the recent Sarkozy regime, favors deterrence through harsher penalties, minimum prison sentences, increased incarceration, and preventive detention of offenders considered dangerous. The sentencing process can be understood only within the broader context of inquisitorially rooted criminal procedure. The central part played by the prosecutor (including in case disposition through alternative sanctions) and her role in recommending sentences that the court almost invariably endorses, together with the unitary nature of the judicial profession, {{means that there is}} remarkable consistency in penalties imposed. The contrainte pénale, based on a reconsideration of the range of available penalties put forward by the Consensus Commission and legislated in 2014, is unlikely to have great impact without investment in the probation service and a change in the <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> that still favors simple sentencing options, including imprisonment, compared with alternatives now in place...|$|E
40|$|Is {{it true that}} non-practicing {{entities}} (NPEs) {{are primarily}} a U. S. phenomenon? Over time, several definitions of NPEs have been presented. They range from research institutions that hold patent portfolios for their inventions but do not develop and commercialize any products, to IP asset management firms whose exclusive business is asserting patent claims to collect significant fees from companies operating in certain industries. The latter are {{also referred to as}} “patent trolls” and {{have been the subject of}} significant debate as to their role in the innovative process in different fields. NPEs are a relatively new phenomenon. Studies have shown that their activity has only become prominent in the United States during the last decade. And these studies have suggested that NPEs are not nearly as active in other countries, namely European countries. Nevertheless, no prior research has attempted to quantify the extent of the international NPE problem nor find possible explanations for the difference. This article investigates whether NPEs are indeed less active in Europe. Interestingly, the findings indicate that NPEs are present in Europe, but their operations there are minimal compared to their operations in the United States. This Article discusses possible explanations for this finding, including a comparative analysis of key differences between European and U. S. industries, remedy systems, and <b>judicial</b> <b>cultures.</b> This Article demonstrates that NPE activity in Europe is more depressed than in the United States because the affected industries– electronics, machinery and computer equipment, software and communication–are smaller in Europe than on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. It also shows that NPEs operate in Europe despite the presence of certain features of local legal systems—such as fee-shifting— that advocates of patent reform have recommended for adoption to control NPE activity in the United States. Consequently, this Article questions the supposed effects of those proposed reforms. Finally, this Article cautions against reforming the current U. S. patent system to make it more similar to European ones, as the European industries targeted by NPEs are less prosperous than their U. S. equivalents. The impact of these proposed reforms on the activities of practicing entities has not yet been adequately questioned. Even the question of whether NPE activity is in fact harming innovation has not been conclusively answered. Thus, much more investigation is necessary in this field before it would be wise to reform the patent system...|$|R

The authors find evidence that prosecution outcomes across different judicial systems are consistent and relatively predictable and consequently argue {{that the concept of}} a “judicial opportunity structure” is useful for developing scholars’ understanding of social movement trajectories. The authors also find that these differential judicial opportunities cannot adequately account for the tactical choices made by activists with respect to the staging of covert or overt direct action; rather, explanations of tactical choice are better accounted for by movement ideas, cultures, and traditions...|$|R

40|$|For all its proponents' {{claims of}} its {{necessity}} {{as a means}} of constraining judges, originalism is remarkably unpopular outside the United States. Recommended responses to judicial activism in other countries more typically take the form of minimalism or textualism. This Article considers why. I focus particular attention on the political and constitutional histories of Canada and Australia, nations that, like the United States, have well-established traditions of judicial enforcement of a written constitution, and that share with the United States a common-law adjudicative norm, but whose judicial cultures less readily assimilate judicial restraint to constitutional historicism. I offer six hypotheses as to the influences that sensitize our popular and <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> to such historicism: the canonizing influence of time; the revolutionary character of American sovereignty; the rights revolution of the Warren and Burger Courts; the politicization of the judicial nomination process in the United States; the accommodation of an assimilative, as against a pluralist, ethos; and a relatively evangelical religious culture. These six hypotheses suggest, among other things, that originalist argument in the United States is a form of ethical argument, and that the domestic debate over originalism should be understood in ethical terms...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discovers that}} {{a form of}} caseflow {{management}} was practised by Official Referees in England more than 70 years before the Woolf reforms. It also describes an innovative concept of judicial sponsorship of settlement at an early interlocutory stage. For its time it was revolutionary. Such process created a distinct subordinate <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> which promoted economy and expedition {{in the management of}} complex technical cases. This culture was facilitated by the referees' subordinate function as officers of the High Court and the type of casework undertaken. The essential elements of my theory of rudimentary micro caseflow management emerge from a study of the methods used by Sir Francis Newbolt K. C. These are analysed and discussed by way of a literature review, qualitative and quantitative analysis. I conclude that this form of rudimentary caseflow management and judicial settlement process made the court more efficient. This process, identified as Newbolt's "Scheme," is traced from its inception through the judicial activities of Newbolt and other referees who followed this approach whether actively or passively. Having traced the origin and reasons for such officers this study considers the senior and subordinate judicial figures involved, their influence and encouragement as to the employment of innovative interlocutory techniques. Contemporaneous records including reports and correspondence are analysed in considering these innovations. The analysis is supported by the results of a quantitative study of Judicial Statistics between 1919 and 1970 and other contemporaneous judicial records including the referees' notebooks and judicial time records known as Minute Books. A number of conclusions are drawn which suggest a correlation between such techniques and levels of efficiency providing an interesting comparison for those interested in wider questions of civil justice reform...|$|E
40|$|In this Article, I {{will discuss}} {{domestic}} and international law {{as they relate to}} judicial independence, and how their interrelationship impacts judicial independence in both arenas. I will also note current challenges to judicial independence, on both practical and theoretical levels, and suggest some appropriate solutions. Section I reviews the three phases of judicial independence, using England as a case study. Section II considers fundamental concepts surrounding judicial independence: models, principles, and constitutionalism. It is important to review these normative concepts {{in order to create a}} common language of judicial independence. Section III explores challenges to judicial independence, both past and present. Section IV analyzes the response to these challenges: the creation of a <b>culture</b> of <b>judicial</b> independence. Section V evaluates the different components that have been, and that continue to be, critical to the <b>culture</b> of <b>judicial</b> independence. <b>Cultures</b> of <b>judicial</b> independence are built on both the {{domestic and international}} fronts, and in their more advanced stages consist of a combination of national and international law and jurisprudence.

40|$|This thesis explores recent Scottish penal culture {{through the}} biographical {{narrative}} accounts of retired judges. Insights from {{the sociology of}} punishment are used to develop a more fully cultural approach to the judiciary and to sentencing practice. This entails {{a view of the}} judiciary as a complex institution whose practices reflect tension and compromise, and which recognises judges as bearers of penal culture through their sentencing practices. The aims of the research are twofold: to provide insight into the changing conditions of judging in Scotland and into the judicial role in criminal justice. Narrative research methods were used to interview retired judges and gain contextual accounts of judicial life and practice. This approach focuses on subjectivity and on individual responses to experiences and constraints. Reflecting the judicial role in punishment, an interpretive position based on the hermeneutics of faith and suspicion is used to evaluate and interpret these narrative accounts. This conceptual and methodological framework is used to explore aspects of <b>judicial</b> occupational <b>culture</b> including training and early experiences, the status of criminal work, judicial conduct, collegiality, the influence of criminological research on sentencing practice, and the relevance of the ‘master narrative’ - judicial independence - to sentencing. It is also used to explore the frameworks of meaning and vocabularies of motive which judges bring to penal practice. What emerges from these judicial narratives is firstly the entanglement of individual life histories and organisational imperatives. Secondly, a picture emerges of a judicial habitus that includes complex motivations, some openness to new approaches, and capacity for reflecting on the conditions which structure and constrain criminal justice practice. This suggests the reflexive judge may be an important vector of penal change and there are implications for judicial training, penal reform and for the dissemination of criminological and criminal justice research...|$|R
40|$|Forensic {{examination}} {{plays an}} important role in China's judicial system, especially in the fact-finding process of both civil and criminal proceedings. Since 2005, this system has experienced gradual, yet significant changes. This paper seeks to examine the major themes of these changes in the context of the continued conceptual reformulation and structural realignment of civil and criminal procedures and the ongoing effort to codify evidence law with transforming impact on China's <b>judicial</b> system and <b>culture.</b> Emphasis is given to the transition of the forensic examination system from an officially (both administrative and judicial) administered fact-finding mechanism with powerful impact on the courts' truth-seeking activities to, at least partially, an expert witness system with significant participation and control by the parties' to judicial proceedings. A convergence of influence from both the continental inquisitorial tradition and the common law adversarial structure appears to have strongly informed the process and direction of the Chinese forensic examination reform. This paper attempts to explain the reasons for this convergence of influence, identify the trend and direction of this development, and provide observations and suggestions for further improvement of the forensic examination system in several key aspects with particular reference to the legal principles and judicial practices under the Federal Rules of Evidence of the United States...|$|R

Fourteenth-century France witnessed the re-emergence of an old political crime: lese majesty. Embraced by the Parlement of Paris more than by kings, it re-emerged at a time ofdynastic change and continual warfare. The lese majesty ofthe fourteenth century extended beyond simple treason or rebellion to encompass multiple offenses, including armed robbery and manslaughter. An examination of lese majesty in the context of late- medieval France finds that it reflected contemporary political and judicial theories, joining ideas of sovereignty and criminality by way of the common good and justice. These connections were largely the product ofthe Parlement ofParis negotiating its own interpretation o f and adherence to the performance o f sovereign justice. The dissertation, which examines the use of lese majesty by the Parlement of Paris during the reign of Philip VI Valois (r. 1328 - 1350), explores the relationships between the high judicial court, the king, other jurisdictions, and disputants; as well as the relationships between theories of crime, law, and sovereignty. Prosecuting lese majesty was an expression of a <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> that prized the ideals of justice and due process. Concentrating on those cases of lese majesty tried before Parlement, using the criminal and civil registers of Parlement housed in the Archives Nationales in Paris, the research engages with lese majesty as a category of crime utilized in the daily practice of trials and judgments. Through better understanding lese majesty, we gain a clearer picture of how sovereignty was conceptualized, articulated, and enacted at a transitional moment in French history...|$|E
40|$|Dissenting opinions, {{separate}} {{opinions and}} declarations are a familiar {{aspect of the}} international jurisprudential landscape. Despite this, in comparison to domestic judicial systems, there has been comparatively little by way of attempts to rationalise the institutional and systemic implications of this practice. While there is widespread agreement {{that the impact of}} additional opinions lies in their effect upon the authority of the court or tribunal and its decisions (‘institutional judicial authority’), the nature of that impact is open to greater contestation. How should additional opinions be viewed? An unnecessary and counterproductive distraction or an important mechanism of accountability for the exercise of judicial power? By conceiving additional opinions as the expression of individual judicial authority, this thesis examines the interplay between individual judicial authority and institutional judicial authority within two paradigms of international justice. The first – comprising the ICJ and PCIJ – represents the traditional paradigm of international justice wherein the culture of expressing individual judicial authority in international law was born. The second paradigm is international criminal justice as pursued by two institutions in particular, the ICTY and the ICC. By comparing these two paradigms, and the nature and purposes of judicial authority therein, this thesis considers how individual judges through their additional opinions have contributed to the evolving international <b>judicial</b> <b>culture,</b> and how that practice affects {{the manner in which the}} institutions in question advance the project of international justice. Drawing upon Mirjan Damaška’s work demonstrating how procedural choices and practices have implications upon authority, and the relationship between procedure and the purposes for which authority is claimed, this thesis demonstrates that not only is the expression of individual judicial authority consistent with institutional authority but it is constitutive of it. The final section of the thesis turns to consider a form of judicial expression – defined as judicial dissent – that places institutional and individual authority in conflict with one another. Despite the negative implications of judicial dissent upon judicial authority (both institutional and individual) and judicial collegiality, the final section considers whether such practice can play a legitimate systemic function...|$|E
40|$|Defense date: 28 / 09 / 2009 Examining Board: Profs. Ulf Bernitz (External Co-Supervisor, University of Stockholm), Gráinne de Burca (Supervisor, former EUI and Fordham University), Bruno De Witte (EUI), Walter van Gerven (University of Leuven) Author {{was awarded}} the European Public Law Group's special {{distinction}} 2010 for her PhD thesis. Through the judge-made requirements developed in its case-law, the Court of Justice has laid down obligations on national courts to provide effective judicial protection for individuals that seek to enforce Community law claims. This thesis will study the Europeanisation of national remedies and procedures that comes about in this process. I will {{carry out the analysis}} in two stages. In the first stage, I will look from a European perspective at the principle of effective judicial protection, which I will view as a Trojan horse containing the judge-made requirements, and establish what is understood by effective judicial protection. I will seek to identify more precise obligations incumbent on national courts in relation to different remedies and procedural rules. Moreover, I will seek to establish the rationale of the Court's intervention into national procedural autonomy. In particular, I will consider if the rationale is a concern to protect individual rights or whether the language of 'rights' is rather used as a legitimizing pretext for enhancing the general effectiveness of Community law and for harmonising remedies and procedures. In a second stage, the thesis will empirically study the Europeanisation of remedies and procedures at the domestic level, by looking at the Swedish judiciary's reaction to those judge-made requirements. It is only by looking at what happens when the Trojan horse unfolds in the national legal system that one can understand its role and whether the principle, in practice, achieves the intended rationales, or whether its complexity in fact hampers effective judicial protection. It will emerge that, in the Swedish context, there is a gap between European theory and national practice. In this respect, the study will highlight the role of the national legal and <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> in ensuring the effectiveness of Community law. Conclusions will be drawn from the empirical study on whether the Trojan horse really does serve as a functional and effective tool to achieve Europeanisation of remedies and procedures and the Court's intended rationales. I will call for clarifications, coherence and better 'judicial governance' of this complicated area of law...|$|E
25|$|Austronesian {{languages}} {{have been}} spoken in the Philippines {{for thousands of}} years. According to a 2014 study by Mark Donohue of the Australian National University and Tim Denham of Monash University, there is no linguistic evidence for an orderly north-to-south dispersal of the Austronesian languages from Taiwan through the Philippines and into Island Southeast Asia (ISEA). Many adopted words from Sanskrit were incorporated during the strong wave of Indian (Hindu-Buddhist) cultural influence starting from the 5th century BC, in common with its Southeast Asian neighbours. Starting {{in the second half}} of the 16th century, Spanish was the official language of the country for the more than three centuries that the islands were governed through Mexico City on behalf of the Spanish Empire. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Spanish was the preferred language among Ilustrados and educated Filipinos in general. Significant agreements exist, however, on the extent Spanish use beyond that. It has been argued that the Philippines were less hispanized than Canaries and America, with Spanish only being adopted by the ruling class involved in civil and <b>judicial</b> administration and <b>culture.</b> Spanish was the language of only approximately ten percent of the Philippine population when Spanish rule ended in 1898. As a lingua franca or creole language of Filipinos, major languages of the country like Chavacano, Cebuano, Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Bicolano, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano assimilated many different words and expressions from Castilian Spanish.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the problematic status and functioning of memory {{in a variety}} of contemporary contexts such as <b>judicial</b> cases, popular <b>culture,</b> television, memorials and museums. In doing this it develops an account of the culture of postmemory, originally defined by Marianne Hirsch as the experience of descendents of survivors of trauma, particularly second generation Holocaust survivors, who inherit that trauma from their family forbears. From Hirsch, postmemory can be understood as the possibility of remembering an event that one has not actually experienced. This thesis extends Hirschs notion of postmemory to account for a wider range of contemporary memory practices. These occur beyond family relationships to manifest in institutional and discursive sites such as the archive, the museum, the narrative and the tourist attraction. This thesis argues that it is in these sites that memory can be seen to be breaking away from its referential function. Instead of recollection, memory becomes the performance of slippage and the undoing of reference in which the fictive and the historical merge. The thesis plays out the ensuing crisis in recollection in scenes and actions of a theatre of the postmemorial  one characterised less by the familiar linear narratives of memory as by multiple and contradictory narratives formed through the operations of chance, reflexivity and ambivalence working within the contemporary cultural sphere. Performing Postmemories re-imagines the performances of contemporary memory culture and examines its master texts...|$|R
40|$|What is the {{continuing}} significance of Cohen v. California, the 1971 U. S. Supreme Court decision holding that “Fuck the Draft” {{is a message}} protected by the First Amendment? Using Cohen as an exemplar, this article offers a new theory about how to understand the law and judicial opinions. The theory begins in {{a recognition of the}} “law” as resting upon mystery and uncertainty, a mystery that is also the source of the law’s enchantment. It is this enchantment that we depend upon for the law to be authoritative rather than authoritarian and reducible to the political and thus to power. In simple terms, the mystery of the law—its being beyond us in this way—constitutes its legitimate authority over us. The law that discloses itself to us does so through the openings that language provides. For our <b>culture,</b> <b>judicial</b> opinions are its primary way of doing this. Having introduced the theory, the article applies it, exploring whether it is possible to bring to the surface the tracings of a “great” judicial performance, using “great” in the sense of revealing an opening through which the law discloses itself. This section describes a reading of Cohen that aims to discover whether through the performance of the opinion, its author has uncovered something that is “of the essence” of our community. The article finally raises questions about what it would mean to legal education and law practice if judicial opinions were evaluated without destroying the law’s mystery. What would it mean if we thought of judges as preservers of this mystery? What would it mean if readers of opinions started thinking in terms of their own experience of the opinion rather than as critics of it? And what would it mean if lawyers saw their task as related to “truth”...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{settlement}} class actions {{have become increasingly}} popular in mass tort litigation, having been used successfully in cases such as the Dalkon Shield litigation, the Bjork-Shiley heart valve litigation, and the orthopedic bone screw litigation. Although the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Amchem has engendered some confusion over the continued viability of mass tort settlement class actions, it appears that such settlements remain a dominant approach to resolving mass tort lawsuits. With increasing frequency, plaintiffs and defendants come to court holding hands, and courts must launch their own vigorous inquiries into {{the merits of the}} parties 2 ̆ 7 proffered settlement. In the world of mass tort litigation, at least, we have sneaked away from the traditional U. S. adversarial model of justice, and towards the inquisitorial model common in the civil law countries of continental Europe and, to a lesser extent, Latin America. We have turned toward inquisitorial justice not by design, but by necessity and ad hoc innovation. In {{what appears to be a}} moment of significance in the episodic evolution of the adjudicatory process, some judges have turned to devices that, despite short-term resistance, may gain widespread acceptance with time. Using a comparative perspective, this article examines two salutary trends in modem mass tort litigation: the use of court-appointed scientific experts and the use of settlement class actions with a vigorous inquiry into the merits of the settlement. Part I looks at court-appointed scientific experts, noting the growing use of such experts in mass tort cases, despite most judges 2 ̆ 7 reluctance to use such experts. Part II addresses settlement class actions, which offer an appealing path out of the morass of inefficient and inconsistent mass tort litigation, but which raise troubling fairness issues, and thus should be permitted only if the court vigorously inquires into the merits of the settlement. Part III examines the similarities between these judicial devices and the inquisitorial justice model, then considers the barriers of <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> and structure that hinder U. S. judges from making regular and effective use of such inquisitorial tools. Although court-appointed experts and well-scrutinized settlement class actions can help courts reach just and efficient mass tort resolutions, their inquisitorial nature renders widespread and effective adoption in this country unlikely in the short term. Nevertheless, these recent trends in mass tort litigation may hint at an evolution toward greater use of inquisitorial tools within the context of the U. S. adversary system. Thus, while Part IV considers the possibility of legislative solutions to mass torts, it concludes with skepticism regarding the prospect of congressional intervention in this arena, and with hope that courts may adapt to make more effective use of less familiar approaches...|$|E
40|$|Australian {{family law}} {{judicial}} officers rarely {{take the opportunity}} to meet with children who are the subject of proceedings, {{despite the fact that the}} outcome of these proceedings will affect many important aspects of a child’s life. This appears to be at odds with the court’s obligation to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration and the child’s right to participate pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. While it appears that the practice of judicial meetings with children is not encouraged in Australia, internationally there is growing support. Several countries have implemented guidelines or taken other steps to actively encourage greater use of the practice. In some countries, judicial meetings are carried out frequently, uncontroversially and successfully. Delegates at the 5 th World Congress on Family Law and Children’s Rights in 2009 passed a resolution in support of judges considering whether to meet with a child in every case before them. This thesis looks at the benefits that can be gained, both for children and for decisionmaking, by judges meeting with children. These benefits are viewed within the wider context of how the right of children to express their views is exercised in family law matters and the literature on how children feel about their current level of participation in court proceedings. In determining what is in the best interests of a child, judges may be aided by a practice that enables them to learn more about a child’s needs and interests than via other recognised methods of hearing children’s views. The thesis explores the reasons why there are only a handful of cases in which Australian judges have met with children and discusses the main criticisms of the practice. The author conducted a unique empirical study to discover the views and experiences of the Australian family law judiciary about meeting with children. Utilising both qualitative and quantitative methods, the study involved in-depth interviews with four Family Court judges and a survey of all family law judicial officers in Australia. The results of the study make an original contribution to the field of judicial attitudes to children’s participation in family law. It was discovered that some problems discussed in the literature, such as due process and confidentiality, may be more perceived than real as judges were able to suggest ways to overcome them. The study found that many judges see strong benefits in meeting with children, but that they may be unable to overcome two lingering concerns. Judges perceive that they lack the skills and training to meet with children, and they are troubled by the prospect that judicial meetings may subject children to parental pressure or manipulation. The thesis makes recommendations to ensure greater certainty in the practice of judicial meetings with children. These include the implementation of Australian guidelines on when and how judicial meetings should be conducted. With recent child-focused changes to family law and practice, such as the Less Adversarial Trial procedure, and growing international discussion, it is anticipated that <b>judicial</b> <b>culture</b> may slowly change. With time, judges may consider the potential benefits of meeting with a child in every case that comes before them. It is argued that it is imperative they do so in order to give effect to the internationally recognised rights of children and the fundamental obligation of the family law courts to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} restrictive {{attitude towards}} {{claim for compensation}} about non-pecuniary harms in both cause law and legislation become weaker even if the theoretically and practically reason behind the old exception-construction remain. This reason can best {{be explained by the}} thesis about incommensurability when it comes to compensate for some losses that money cannot compensate. To explain why the exception-construction is problemized in recent days I think two circumstances has played an important role (1) the materialisation of human rights {{as a consequence of the}} incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Sweden since 1995 and (2) the right to crime victim compensation and the establishing of victimology in the legal and academic field. In practice there is of course a co-operation between these two factors and there is also some kind of hybrids like the legal interest of for example discrimination. This tendency is in my opinion therefore a practical and concrete example of law and justice in the risk society where almost every person is a potential victim of crimes and discrimination or other violations. In the risk society, given Ulrich Beck’s definition, it is characteristic that these phenomenons in our society rub out the boarders between law and politics in the manifestation of reflexive subpolitics about flexibility. The possibility to obtain redress with this compensation function as a mean to support the judicial systems official goal that is to satisfied the citizens needs and at the same time secure the confidence and the legitimacy for the judicial system through the factors (1) legal security and (2) the legal rights of the individual. At the same time these compensations bring on inherent risks because of its unclear function and the incommensurability between injury and compensation that risks fall upon both the victims and the lawyer’s profession. So when human rights now is both a goal and a mean for democracy and violations of the citizens bring about a right to compensation this illustrate a paradox. The judicial system cannot handle this type of injury that has it is ground in public law without challenge traditional principles and the legal professionalism. This tendency is also interesting in a comparative perspective given the premise that the jurisprudence movement known as Scandinavian Legal Realism has had an influence on the Swedish <b>judicial</b> <b>culture.</b> This follows from two circumstances: (1) Given the Scandinavian Legal Realism it is impossible to set up a legal claim from a violation of justice or somebody’s rights and (2) even if it would be possible, it is impossible to imagine the basis of calculation of these compensation because there is no way for informal norms from the society to influence the formal legal norms and the application of the law (only the opposite) given the Scandinavian Legal Realism. The last circumstance is relevant because the compensation of non-pecuniary harms consist of incommensurability and the only way to calculate these compensation, so it make it serves as rectification or redress for the victim, is in reflection and influence of the informal norms or the “common sense of justice”. My topic presupposes that the legal field is influenced by the theory in jurisprudence and can we therefore talk about an idealistic tendency or “critical legal realist” movement that maybe illustrates in these compensations. In a more concrete perspective these compensations bring to the fore methodological question in social science of how we can get empirically knowledge about norms in our society...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the second in a series for a CEPS project {{entitled}} “The British Question and the Search for a Fresh European Narrative”. It is pegged on an ambitious exercise by the British government to review all the competences of the European Union {{on the basis of}} evidence submitted by independent stakeholders. In all, 32 sectoral policy reviews are being produced over the period 2013 - 2015, as input into public information and debate leading up to a referendum on whether the UK should remain in, or secede from, the EU, planned for 2017. This second set of reviews covers a broad range of EU policies (for the single market for goods, external trade, transport policy, environment, climate change, research, asylum, non-EU immigration, civil <b>judicial</b> cooperation, tourism, <b>culture</b> and sport). The findings confirm what emerged from the first set of reviews, namely that {{there is little or no}} case for repatriation of EU competences at the level they are defined in the treaties. This does not exclude that at a more detailed level there can be individual actions or laws that might be done better or not at all. However, that is the task of all the institutions to work at on a regular basis, and hardly a rationale for secession. For the UK in particular the EU has shown considerable flexibility in agreeing to special arrangements, such as in the case of the policies here reviewed of asylum, non-EU immigration and civil judicial cooperation. In other areas reviewed here, such as the single market for goods, external trade, transport, environment, climate change and research, there is a good fit between the EU’s policies and UK priorities, with the EU perceived by stakeholders as an ‘amplifier’ of British interests...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an exploration into {{rural and urban}} police officers' perceptions and experiences of their work in Northland, New Zealand. Although international research has already investigated police officers' rural and urban experiences, {{there is a lack}} of similar literature in New Zealand. The only studies conducted within the New Zealand Police (NZP) have resulted in contradictory data, creating a debate about whether there is a difference in policing rural and urban areas. A study by Winfree and Taylor (2004) into whether the perceptions of NZP staff differed in rural, small town or metropolitan areas found little difference between either the NZP personnel themselves, or their perceptions of policing. This contrasts with research by Jaeger (2002) and Goddard and Jaeger (2005), who explored not only policing but also the strategies utilised within the roles. Goddard and Jaeger proposed that there are significant differences between officers in rural and urban areas. The current research attempts to resolve this debate, exploring both rural and urban perspectives through the use of Grounded Theory. Interviews with 16 police officers based in the Northland District were conducted to capture the essence of their experiences. Seven key categories emerged: community, job role, management, safety, the <b>judicial</b> system, police <b>culture,</b> and family and personal life. These were placed under the core category of 'Boundaries'. It emerged that rural officers found it difficult to implement boundaries due to their isolation and need for a working relationship with the community. Urban officers, however, described how the implementation of boundaries enabled them to work effectively in their environment. Consequently, this research found that there is a difference in the rural and urban policing experience, supporting the findings of Goddard and Jaeger (2005). It is hoped that the individual themes and overall findings from this research will stimulate further investigation into the experience of policing. While it only explored one New Zealand Police District, the information contributes to a deeper understanding of police perspectives and experiences...|$|R

Exploring the Idea of a Reproducible Democracy in the Theory of Robert A. Dahl). Acta Wexionensia 185 / 2009, ISSN: 1404 - 4307, ISBN: 978 - 91 - 7636 - 677 - 6. With {{a summary}} in English.   Everybody loves democracy. The {{problem is that}} while {{everybody}} calls himself democratic, the ideal form of democracy {{is hard to come}} by in the real world. But if we believe in democracy and believe that it is the best form of government, I argue that we should try to design a theory of democracy that is realisable – and reproducible. This thesis, then, focuses primarily on the question whether we find support in democratic theory for an idea of a self-reproducing democracy. It proceeds by means of an investigation of Robert A. Dahl’s theory of democracy. He {{is one of the most}} well-known and highly regarded theorists in the field of democratic research, whose work covers both normative and empirical analysis. When analysing the reproducible democracy, I argue that it is essential to study both normative values and empirical assumptions: the values that count as intrinsic to democracy, the assumptions that are made about man, and the institutions that are needed for the realisable and reproducible democracy. In modern social science man is often pushed into the background. This is also the case in theories of democracy, even though man (the individual) is the one who has the right to vote, the one who has the autonomy to decide – the one who has to act democratically in order to preserve democracy. The study yields the following findings. First, in Dahl’s theory political equality and autonomy come out as intrinsic values. Second, the assumptions made about man show that even if he seems to be ignored, he is always present. When Dahl construes his theory, he does it with full attention to man’s qualities, interests, manners of acting and reacting, and adaptability to the values of democracy. Third, the institutions needed to realise and reproduce democracy go further than the institutions of polyarchy. They need support from the <b>judicial</b> system, political <b>culture,</b> education and the market. Fourth, when it comes down to making democracy work and reproducing democracy, Dahl puts the full responsibility on man as he is not willing to allow too rigid constitutional mechanisms. Fifth, even though Dahl puts the emphasis on the empirical situation of the real world, he does not alter his normative ideals in order to make the theory more adaptive. For him, political equality and autonomy are imperative demands, too important to alter. And the only way to get full procedural democracy is to trust the democratic man. ...|$|R
