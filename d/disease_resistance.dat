5|$|In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} new varieties suitable for {{growing in the}} north of the country. They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal <b>disease</b> <b>resistance.</b> Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus. 'Ben Lomond' {{was the first of the}} 'Ben' varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as 'Ben Alder' and 'Ben Tirran'. The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to gall mite, and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, <b>disease</b> <b>resistance,</b> machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{diversity}} of a harvested plant {{can be the}} result of genetic differences: a crop may have genes conferring early maturity or <b>disease</b> <b>resistance</b> Such traits collectively determine a crop's overall characteristics and their future potential. Diversity within a crop includes genetically-influenced attributes such as seed size, branching pattern, height, flower color, fruiting time, and flavor. Crops can also vary in less obvious characteristics such as their response to heat, cold, a drought, or their ability to resist specific diseases and pests.|$|E

It was a seedling produced in 1955 from pollinating 'Macoun' from 'Purdue 54-12' {{for the sake of}} acquiring Malus floribunda <b>disease</b> <b>resistances.</b> It was first released to the public in 1978.|$|R
5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor. It {{has been speculated}} that ProAtPEP1 is processed by CONSTITUTIVE <b>DISEASE</b> <b>RESISTANCE</b> 1, an apoplastic aspartic protease. The precursors to HypSys are processed into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant <b>disease</b> <b>resistance,</b> failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and <b>disease</b> <b>resistance.</b> Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Ecologically {{motivated}} {{research into}} genetic modification is underway. There are ongoing schemes that aim to foster <b>disease</b> <b>resistance</b> in trees {{such as the}} American chestnut (see Chestnut blight) and the English elm (see Dutch elm disease) {{for the purpose of}} their reintroduction to the wild. Specific diseases have reduced the populations of these emblematic species {{to the extent that they}} are mostly lost in the wild. Genetic modification is being pursued concurrently with traditional breeding techniques in an attempt to endow these species with <b>disease</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{pure line}} (genotypically identical) plant {{varieties}} often {{only have one}} or a few major genes for <b>disease</b> <b>resistance,</b> and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line's resistance, multiline varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several phenotypically similar pure lines which each have different genes for <b>disease</b> <b>resistance.</b> By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years, in internationally context, was proved that {{long-term}} chemotherapy could have negative impact, increasing the <b>resistance</b> of bee <b>diseases</b> to the medication with consequences from economic {{points of view}} especially {{on the quality of}} beekeeping products. In this context, the strategy of bee diseases control was reanalyzed, the researches being reoriented through finding the alternative and non-polluted solutions, which could be integrated in an efficient system of bee diseases control, depending on breed, climate, and maintaining systems. Thus, one of the research directions is the ameliorative selection of bees for natural <b>diseases</b> <b>resistance</b> combined with other desired morpho-productive and behavioral characteristics, in this way a series of specific tests being already established. The hygienic behaviour is the primary way to defend against some bee diseases, especially to American foulbrood (Rothenbuhler, 1964) and chalk brood (Gilliam, 1983). The honeybees with high hygienic behavior detect, uncap and remove the infested brood more rapidly than others, before the disease to be spread. The preliminary researches carried out in the breeding apiaries of the Beekeeping Research and Development Institute (Bucharest) aimed to establish the natural <b>diseases</b> <b>resistance</b> degree of local bee populations (A. m. carpathica), by applying specific tests to identify the bee colonies with high hygienic behaviour...|$|R

25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{producers}} using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity.

25|$|In general, most oncologists rely on {{combinations}} of drugs for the initial, induction phase of chemotherapy. Such combination chemotherapy usually offers {{the benefits of}} early remission and a lower risk of <b>disease</b> <b>resistance.</b> Consolidation and maintenance treatments are intended to prevent disease recurrence. Consolidation treatment often entails a repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification chemotherapy with additional drugs. By contrast, maintenance treatment involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase.|$|E
25|$|Domestication {{of plants}} has, {{over the centuries}} {{increased}} yield, improved <b>disease</b> <b>resistance</b> and drought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants.

Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.|$|E

For each product class, recent examples are described to illustrate the potential for breeding new crops with improved traits. Finally, we touch upon the future applications of these methods, such as cisgenic potato genotypes in which specific combinations of Phytophthora infestans resistance genes have been stacked for use in durable cultivation, or the creation of new <b>disease</b> <b>resistances</b> by knocking out or removing S-genes using genome-editing techniques...|$|R
