5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue <b>flashing</b> lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red <b>flashing</b> lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with <b>flashing</b> lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with <b>flashing</b> lights on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the <b>flashing</b> television.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} <b>flashing</b> effect. These include <b>flashing</b> a light bulb or LED, <b>flashing</b> or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without <b>flashing,</b> which is required in some provinces.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flash</b> {{storage memory}} devices are Nand and NOR types which {{are widely used}} in data storage {{application}} in computers and solid states drives. <b>Flash</b> are nonvolatile and electrically erased and reprogrammed. A <b>flash</b> memory controller (or <b>flash</b> controller) manages the data stored on <b>flash</b> memory and communicates with a computer or electronic device. When the system or device needs to read data from or write data to the <b>flash</b> storage, it will communicate with the <b>flash</b> controller. <b>Flash</b> controller is used to control programming and erasing operation of <b>flash</b> memory storage. FPGA builds reconfigurable environment for <b>flash</b> memory controller which helps in generation of exact timing specifications of <b>flash</b> chip.

50|$|Automatic <b>flash</b> {{bracketing}} (sometimes {{abbreviated to}} FBR for <b>Flash</b> Bracketing or FEB for <b>Flash</b> Exposure Bracketing) is typically performed by altering the <b>flash</b> output of a connected dedicated <b>flash</b> accordingly. Using non-dedicated studio <b>flashes,</b> for example on the PC socket, <b>flash</b> bracketing {{can be carried}} out by altering the aperture, however, this will also affect ambient light and the depth of field.|$|R
5|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of the viewers had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who did not get sent to hospital by ambulance reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found that most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe that the <b>flashing</b> lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as <b>flashing</b> lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|Some fireflies of {{the genus}} Photuris mimic the <b>flashing</b> of female Photinus species to attract males of that species, which are then {{captured}} and devoured. The colors of emitted light vary from dull blue (Orfelia fultoni, Mycetophilidae) to the familiar greens and the rare reds (Phrixothrix tiemanni, Phengodidae).|$|E

5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} the Jockey Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or <b>flashing</b> lights, to provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed {{on the basis of a}} lack of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E
5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include <b>flashing</b> lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released.

5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. <b>Flashing</b> headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, <b>flashing,</b> gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
5|$|NY5 heads {{southeast}} {{from the}} village of Caledonia, paralleling the former right-of-way of an Erie–Lackawanna Railroad branch line that connected the villages of Caledonia and Avon as it heads through spacious fields containing little more than farmland. At a rural intersection controlled by single-head <b>flashing</b> traffic signals west of Avon, NY5 meets US20 for the second time. The routes embark on a second concurrency, merging onto the right-of-way of NY5 as they cross the Genesee River and enter both the town and village of Avon.|$|E
5000|$|Another is the {{built-in}} dual-position <b>flash.</b> With an initial actuation of the <b>flash</b> button, the <b>flash</b> pops up to a bounce-flash position, giving a more diffuse <b>flash</b> that is preferred by some photographers, especially for portrait photos.

In 1955, NOMA manufactured <b>flashing</b> lights. In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy Lights were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} {{luminescent}} organs {{on either side of}} the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic <b>flashing.</b> No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|The active visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{in the form of}} <b>flashing</b> lights. These flash in order {{to attract the attention of}} other road users as the ambulance approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped ambulance in a dangerous position on the road. Common colours for ambulance warning beacons are blue, red, amber, and white (clear). However the colours may vary by country and sometimes by operator.|$|E
