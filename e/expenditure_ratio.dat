40|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} is {{an important}} policy objective in developed welfare states. This paper analyzes the effect of social transfer policies on poverty. A vast literature claims that high social effort goes along with low poverty levels across countries. This paper systematically analyzes this claim. We employ several social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratios</b> (as a proxy for social effort) and correct {{for the impact of}} the tax system and for private social arrangements, using OECD methodology. Also, we control for demographic and macro-economic differences across countries. We performed several tests with the most recent data (LIS, OECD, and SOCX) for the period 1985 - 2005. Our results are less clear-cut than earlier findings. We still find quite a strong negative relationship between the level of public social expenditure and poverty among 28 OECD countries. However, for non-EU 15 countries this relationship is stronger than for the EU 15. The results alter considerably if private social expenditures are included as well. For non-EU 15 countries in our sample, we do not find evidence for a negative correlation between the level of total social spending and the incidence of poverty. In contrast, for the group of EU 15 countries private social arrangements do matter as far as poverty alleviation is concerned. Demographic and macro-economic (control) variables are important as well. We developed and employed multiple linear regression models to control for these complex interrelationships. Our results point at one direction: gross social spending is the driving force as far as differences in poverty levels across countries are concerned, although the ageing of the population and unemployment rates have some explanatory power, both for non-EU 15 countries and for EU 15 countries. Our analyses captures another effect as well. It is essential to control for the impact of taxes on the social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratios</b> used. By doing so, the linkage between social effort and poverty levels across countries becomes insignificant. In {{view of the fact that}} with these corrections on expenditure statistics, we have a much better – although still not perfect - measure of what governments really devote to social spending, the familiar claim that higher social expenditure goes along with lower poverty levels does not hold across the 28 examined countries examined. We believe that our comparison of the impact of several social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratios</b> on poverty levels has emphasized that taking into account both the public/private-mix and the impact of the tax system on social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratios</b> really matters for comparative welfare state research and for policy makers who want to reduce poverty. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{stabilising}} in {{the years}} after 1995, the Austrian social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratio</b> went up again, albeit slightly, in 1999. As reported by the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) used by the EU, Austria spent ATS 781 billion (€ 56. 8 million) on social security in 1999, which translated into a growth of 4. 9 percent over the previous year, whereas nominal GDP rose by just 3. 5 percent. In terms of GDP, the social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratio,</b> at 28. 9 percent, thus was 0. 4 percentage points higher than in 1998. Almost half of the social expenditure (47. 6 percent) was spent on old age and survivors' pensions; 26. 2 percent went to health spending, whereas expenditure on families, at 10. 4 percent, was the third-largest segment in social expenditure. Another 8. 8 percent was paid out as invalidity pensions to people below the age of 60. The remaining 5. 5 percent were expenditures on active and passive labour market policies, rounded off by 1. 6 percent in other expenditures. In comparison with the previous year an above-average growth was found for expenditure on families (7. 7 percent), health (6. 4 percent) and invalidity (6. 1 percent). The increase was even more substantial for the "other expenditures" item (20. 3 percent). These include social assistance paid by the states, benefits in kind rendered at local government level, housing assistance and other benefits to prevent marginalisation. The growth shown by old-age and survivors pensions and unemployment was less pronounced than the overall rise in expenditure on social security. In a European comparison, the Austrian social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1998 (social expenditure for 1999 reported in line with the ESSPROS system is not yet available for the EU), is 0. 8 percentage points above the EU- 15 average of 27. 7 percent. In Sweden, France, Denmark and Germany, the ratio was higher than in Austria. Broken down by function groups, deviations from the EU average were found for old age and survivors' pensions and in children and family benefits.

40|$|Social {{security}} expenditure totalled ATS 745 {{billion in}} 1998, the 2. 8 percent growth of nominal expenditure being 0. 7 percent below nominal GDP growth. The social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratio,</b> i. e., {{the share of}} social expenditure in GDP, stood at 28. 5 percent in 1998, thus continuing its downward trend for the fourth consecutive year. The trend is expected to remain unchanged in 1999, as the cyclical upswing results in employment growth and a reduction of unemployment. At the same time, the budget consolidation measures (austerity budgets) are reinforcing this development. Measured by its social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratio,</b> Austria ranks seventh in Europe. The ratios are higher in the Nordic countries as well as France and Germany. With a social <b>expenditure</b> <b>ratio</b> of 28. 7 percent, Austria was 0. 5 percentage point below the EU average in 1997. However, the structure of social security spending in Austria differs greatly from the European average. Expenditure for old-age pensions and survivor benefits is 3. 3 percentage points above the EU average and family benefits exceed {{the average of the}} fifteen member states by 1. 9 percentage points. The way Austrian social security is financed also differs from the EU average: contributions by public and private employers are 1 percentage point below the average, while employee contributions to social security are 3. 6 percentage points above the EU average; the share of tax money flowing into social security exceeds the average by 1. 6 percentage points. Old-age benefits (38. 2 percent for old-age pensions and 10. 3 percent for survivor benefits) account for the largest share of social benefits, followed by health care expenditure (25. 8 percent) and family benefits (10. 2 percent). Invalidity benefits are the fourth largest expenditure item (8. 6 percent), while unemployment benefits account for no more than 5. 6 percent of all social benefit payments. The shares of old-age pensions and invalidity benefits increased between 1997 and 1998. Spending rose most strongly (+ 10. 8 percent) in the field of invalidity benefits (including early retirement for reasons of partial invalidity) as well as early retirement after long-term insurance coverage (+ 4. 9 percent) and unemployment benefits (+ 4. 1 percent). Changes in legislation resulted in a steep decline of spending for parental leave (– 21. 5 percent) and child-birth benefits (– 75. 4 percent), although family benefit expenditure as a whole increased by 1. 6 percent.

The author matches data on <b>expenditures</b> and pupil-teacher <b>ratios</b> from Mexico in the 1980 s with individual earnings in 2007 / 2008 and find that the returns to education among individuals that went to poorly funded schools are lower than among those that went to better funded ones. He determines that within-state changes in educational <b>expenditures</b> and pupil-teacher <b>ratios</b> predict changes in the returns to education. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the theoretical properties of demand for capital maintenance services. To this end, we consider two investment problems incorporating maintenance services and we analyse their steady state equilibria. At first, we shwo that if no variable capital utilization rate is allowed, investment and maintenance expenditures have the same qualitative properties, and so cannot be regarded as gross substitutes. If a variable rate of capital utilization is allowed, the occurence of substitution Vs complementarity features and the comparative statics properties depend on the sensitivity of the postulated capital depreciation function with respect to both the rate of capital utilization and the maintenance <b>expenditures</b> <b>ratio.</b> We prove that the case where the elasticity with respect to maintenance expenditures is lower, gives much better shaped demand functions and fits definitely better the recent real business cycles studies.
