5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its <b>dendrites.</b> Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in <b>dendrites</b> as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in <b>dendrites</b> whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and <b>dendrites.</b> <b>Dendrites</b> are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the <b>dendrites</b> or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The <b>dendrites</b> branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the <b>dendrites</b> of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The <b>dendrites</b> are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{extensive}} {{applications in the}} automotive and aerospace industries of Al– 7 Si–Mg casting alloys, an understanding of their <b>dendrite</b> microstructural formation in three dimensions is of great importance {{in order to control}} the desirable microstructure, so as to modify the performance of castings. For this reason, a three-dimensional cellular automaton model (3 -D CA) allowing for the prediction of <b>dendrite</b> growth of ternary alloys is presented. The growth kinetics of the solid/liquid (S/L) interface is calculated based on the solutal equilibrium approach. This proposed model introduces a modified decentered octahedron algorithm for neighborhood tracking, in order to eliminate the effects of mesh dependency on <b>dendrite</b> growth. The thermodynamic and kinetic data needed in the simulations are obtained through coupling with the Pandat software package in combination with thermodynamic/kinetic/equilibrium phase diagram calculation databases. The solute interactions between alloying elements are considered in the model. The model was first used to simulate the Al– 7 Si <b>dendrite,</b> followed by a validation using theoretical predictions. The influence of Mg content on the <b>dendrite</b> growth dynamics and <b>dendrite</b> morphologies was investigated. Also, the model was applied to Al– 7 Si– 0. 5 Mg <b>dendrite</b> simulation both with and without a consideration of solute interactions between the Si and Mg alloying elements and the effects on <b>dendrite</b> growth process was analyzed using the simulation results. This model was finally used in order to simulate the <b>dendrite</b> growth in different crystallographic orientations in an Al– 7 Si– 0. 36 Mg ternary alloy during polycrystalline solidification, resulting in a predicted secondary <b>dendrite</b> arm spacing (SDAS) and <b>dendrite</b> volume fraction data that show a reasonable agreement with experimental results. The single <b>dendrite</b> and polycrystalline growth simulations effectively demonstrate the capability of this model in predicting the three-dimensional <b>dendrite</b> microstructure of ternary alloys...|$|R
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the <b>dendrites</b> of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical <b>dendrites</b> and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E

These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell <b>dendrites</b> take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell <b>dendrites.</b> The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E

Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} <b>dendrites</b> and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they {{commonly}} extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|E

Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, <b>dendrites,</b> and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure.
