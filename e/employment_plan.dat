5000|$|One major {{shortcoming}} in {{the efforts}} to wrest control of Ramadi from the insurgency was {{the failure of the}} Iraqi Police to effectively combat the insurgency. As part of the Tribal Engagement Strategy, Ready First developed and implemented a plan to quickly recruit, train, and employ Iraqi Policemen on the streets of Ramadi. COL MacFarland, and LTC James Lechner, Deputy Brigade Commander, successfully developed an Iraqi Police recruiting, training, and <b>employment</b> <b>plan</b> that was implemented by HHC, 2-152 Infantry (Mech), an Army National Guard unit that lived in Iraqi Police Stations and Combat Outposts conducting daily patrols and clearing operations with their counterparts. HHC, 2-152 Infantry, also known in Ramadi as [...] "the 152nd", or the Police Transition Team (PTT) Company would provide the Iraqi Police in Ramadi with the leadership and oversight that proved crucial in re-establishing a police presence in Ramadi to ensure insurgent forces did not return to neighborhoods that had been secured. Consequently, the success of the Iraqi Police program in Ramadi convinced the Ramadi populace that their government could effectively provide for their security needs, a critical element of defeating the insurgency. The 152nd PTT Company's Iraqi Police efforts began in October 2006 and would continue through the departure of Ready First and into the tenure of 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division until the 152nd departed in October 2007. The 152nd was responsible for recruiting, training, and conducting patrols with hundreds of Iraqi Police, and opened several new Iraqi Police stations in the city of Ramadi.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between demographic characteristics, perceptions of the academic climate, and the <b>employment</b> continuation <b>plans</b> of tenured and tenure-track faculty of color in CORE accredited rehabilitation counselor education (RCE) programs. Furthermore, this study aims to identify which factors best predict the <b>employment</b> continuation <b>plans</b> for this population. Participants were administered The Faculty Retention Questionnaire (FRQ) to examine these relationships. The sample in this study consisted of 63 tenured and tenure-track faculty of color employed by CORE accredited RCE programs. Due to {{the small sample size}} and the violation of the assumption of normality, bootstrapping techniques were used to resample the data. A univariate general linear model (GLM) was conducted to determine if the demographic characteristics (self-reported race, ethnicity, gender, country of origin, and tenure status) could predict the <b>employment</b> continuation <b>plans</b> of tenured and tenure-track faculty of color in CORE accredited RCE programs. Results of the GLM indicted that demographic characteristics were non-significant predictors. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to determine if the regression scores for the perception of academic climate components (role as researcher, tenure/promotion opportunities, workplace conditions, social climate, faculty/student relationships, role clarity, inter-role conflict, and person/role conflict) could predict the <b>employment</b> continuation <b>plans</b> of faculty of color in CORE accredited RCE programs. Results of the multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the linear combination of regression scores predicted 28. 5 % {{of the variance in the}} <b>employment</b> continuation <b>plans.</b> Inter-role conflict was the only statistically significant predictor. Consequently, understanding how perceptions of the academic climate by faculty of color affect their <b>employment</b> continuation <b>plans</b> will add to existing body of literature pertaining to retention of faculty of color in counselor education. Additionally, the results of this study may assist in the development and implementation of retention strategies and policies that are supportive of faculty of color...|$|R
