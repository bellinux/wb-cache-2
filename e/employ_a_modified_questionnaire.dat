40|$|This study {{analyzes}} why managers accrue and disclose environmental liability, {{which involves}} managers’ discretions. Using {{the framework of}} the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991), this research hypothesizes that a manager’s intention to accrue and disclose environmental liability is influenced by: (1) attitudes (2) subjective norms, and (3) perceived behavioral control of the manager towards accruing and disclosing such information. The data was collected through <b>a</b> survey, <b>employing</b> <b>a</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>modified</b> from Weidman (2002). Responses from 50 corporate managers in Lampung Province were analyzed using structural equation model software package SmartPLS. This study finds that a manager’s attitude towards environmental liability is positively associated with his/her decision to accrue and disclose environmental liability. However, {{there is no evidence that}} subjective norms and behavioral control are associated with such a decision. An additional test using attitude as a moderating variable provides evidence that both subjective norms and perceived control behavior are positively associated with the attitude towards environmental liability...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Osteoporosis is a {{major health}} concern, however massive {{screening}} on low bone mineral density (BMD) using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is not recommended in a clinical practice. The aim of our study was to develop <b>a</b> <b>modified</b> <b>questionnaire</b> based on risk factors for osteoporosis that will be applicable in population of women as a prescreening tool aimed to predicit an increased risk for low BMD. [...] - Study participants and methods: Our study included 1000 women aged 45 years or more without previous diagnosis of osteoporosis or treatment that affects bone metabolism, who underwent bone density measurements of the hip and the lumbar spine using DXA machine. Data on risk factors for osteoporosis were collected by completing the questionnaire and those risk factors that best predicted required T-score ≤ - 2, 5 at the femoral neck were selected for inclusion into the <b>modified</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) {{analysis was used to}} identify the specific cut-point value of risk factors that would identify women at increased risk for low BMD. [...] - Results: <b>A</b> <b>modified</b> <b>questionnaire</b> using simple scoring system was developed based on 4 variables: age > 65 years, duration of postmenopausal period > 14 years, weight ≤ 73 kg and height ≤ 160 cm. Cut –off value of > 6 points (out of 9 possible) showed the best ability (sensitivity, specificity) in prediction of a T-score ≤ - 2, 5 at the femoral neck. The <b>modified</b> <b>questionnaire</b> showed the similar performance in prediction of low BMD compared to other clinical risk tools (OST, ORAI, ABONE). However, due to its higher specificity and somewhat lower sensitivity, <b>modified</b> <b>questionnaire</b> showed better performance in discrimination of women in whom BMD testing is unnecessary. <b>A</b> <b>modified</b> <b>questionnaire</b> showed better performance in prediction of low BMD in women > 65 years compared to women aged 45 - 64 years mostly due to the high-scored criterion “age > 65 years”. [...] - Conclusion: Applying of <b>modified</b> <b>questionnaire</b> in clinical practice using a simple scoring system based on clinical risk factors for osteoporosis may contribute to cost-effective screening program that would be acceptable to the public health system. Further investigation is needed to determine scoring system based on risk factors for osteoporosis aimed for better selection for BMD testing among women aged 45 - 64 years...|$|R
