40|$|The {{presence}} and abundance of calbindin in rat pancreatic <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> {{was assessed by}} immunohistochemistry of either whole islets or purified B and non-B <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> {{as well as by}} Western blotting of extracts derived from whole islets and purified B and non-B <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunohistochemistry of pancreatic sections indicated a higher calbindin content in non-B cells, located at the periphery of the islets, than in the centrally located insulin-producing B cells. Comparable results were obtained in purified <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> Likewise, scanning densitometry of the Western blots indicated that, relative to cell volume, the single calbindin band (Mr 27 kDa) was 5 - 7 times higher in non-B than in B cells. In the splenic lobe of chick pancreas, however, the opposite situation prevailed. Thus, insulin-producing cells clustered in small roundish islets were more intensely labelled after exposure to anti-calbindin serum than non-B <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> located in large and irregularly shaped islets. Nevertheless, even in the chick pancreas, non-B <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> contained an appreciable amount of calbindin. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Abnormalities in {{lipoprotein}} metabolism {{are common}} in diabetes. It is unknown whether variations in form or concentration of lipoproteins influence the function of pancreatic beta cells. This study investigates whether low density lipoproteins (LDL) exhibit specific interactions with <b>islet</b> beta <b>cells.</b> Radioactively labeled LDL (125 I-LDL) and fluorescently labeled LDL (DiI-LDL) were used as tracers. Rat <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> express high affinity LDL binding sites (K(d) = 9 nM), which are also recognized by very low density lipoproteins and which are down-regulated by LDL. Binding of LDL appears restricted to the beta cells, as it was not detected on <b>islet</b> endocrine non-beta <b>cells.</b> At 37 C, LDL is taken up and lysosomally degraded by <b>islet</b> beta <b>cells</b> but not by <b>islet</b> non-beta <b>cells.</b> Human <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> were also found to present LDL binding, uptake, and degradation. Compared with rat <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> human <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit 10 -fold less binding sites (2. 10 (7) vs. 2. 10 (8) per 10 (3) cells) with a 2 -fold lower K(d) value (5 nM) and an equal sensitivity to LDL-induced down-regulation. In conclusion, human and rat <b>islet</b> beta <b>cells</b> express LDL receptors that can internalize the lipoprotein. This pathway should be examined for its potential role in (dys) regulating pancreatic beta cell functions. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In cultured {{neonatal}} <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> glucose (16. 7 mM) and K+ (50 mM) increased cytosolic free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i). The increments in [Ca 2 +]i {{induced by}} either glucose or K+ {{were similar to}} those obtained in cultured adult <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> but only half of that recorded in freshly isolated adult <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> These data indicate that, in neonatal <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> the reduced insulin release in response to glucose is associated with a diminished increase in [Ca 2 +]i. This reduced insulin response may not solely be due to an impaired regulation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels as previously suggested. It may also result from some alteration in the process of Ca 2 + inflow through voltage-sensitive Ca 2 + channels. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

25|$|Even during digestion, in general, one or {{two hours}} {{following}} a meal, insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous, but oscillates with a period of 3–6minutes, changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 pmol/l to less than 100 pmol/l. This is thought to avoid downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells, and to assist the liver in extracting insulin from the blood. This oscillation {{is important to consider}} when administering insulin-stimulating medication, since it is the oscillating blood concentration of insulin release, which should, ideally, be achieved, not a constant high concentration. This may be achieved by delivering insulin rhythmically to the portal vein or by <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation to the liver.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} islet {{transplantation}} is not new. [...] Investigators {{as early as}} the English surgeon Charles Pybus (1882–1975) attempted to graft pancreatic tissue to cure diabetes. Most, however, credit the recent era of islet transplantation research to Paul Lacy's studies dating back more than three decades. In 1967, Lacy's group described a novel collagenase-based method (later modified by Dr. Camillo Ricordi, then working with Dr. Lacy) to isolate islets, paving the way for future in vitro and in vivo islet experiments. Subsequent studies showed that transplanted islets could reverse diabetes in both rodents and non-human primates. In a summary of the 1977 Workshop on Pancreatic <b>Islet</b> <b>Cell</b> Transplantation in Diabetes, Lacy commented on the feasibility of “islet cell transplantation as a therapeutic approach [...] the possible prevention of the complications of diabetes in man”. Improvements in isolation techniques and immunosuppressive regimens ushered in the first human islet transplantation clinical trials in the mid-1980s. The first successful trial of human islet allotransplantation resulting in long-term reversal of diabetes was performed at the University of Pittsburgh in 1990. Yet despite continued procedural improvements, only about 10% of islet recipients in the late 1990s achieved euglycemia (normal blood glucose). In 2000, Dr. James Shapiro and colleagues published a report describing seven consecutive patients who achieved euglycemia following islet transplantation using a steroid-free protocol and large numbers of donor islets, since referred to as the Edmonton protocol. This protocol has been adapted by islet transplant centers around the world and has greatly increased islet transplant success.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to compare normal and tumoral {{pancreatic}} <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> in terms of both the activity of selected cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes participating to nutrient catabolism and the intrinsic properties of FAD-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. The activity of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase was higher in tumoral (RINm 5 F) than normal <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> The opposite was seen for glutamate decarboxylase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, 2 -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and FAD-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (m-GDH). These findings are consistent with the high rates of glycolysis and protein synthesis seen in tumoral <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> compared with normal <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> which favour mitochondrial oxidative events associated with the catabolism of D-glucose and amino acids. The intrinsic catalytic properties of m-GDH were comparable, albeit not identical,in normal and tumoral <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> Since a deficiency of m-GDH in pancreatic islets may represent a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, it is proposed that RINm 5 F cells may readily yield sufficient islet m-GDH for purification and further gene cloning.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of gene delivery systems {{that result in}} efficient transfection of the pancreatic beta-cells may generate an important tool {{for the study of}} IDDM and may also represent one critical step toward a clinical application of gene transfer for the prevention or early treatment of the disease. Using the reporter gene vectors pCAT and pCMV beta-gal, we have investigated the efficiency of transfection mediated by calcium phosphate precipitation, the monocationic liposome Lipofectin, the polycationic liposome Lipofectamine, and adenovirus-polylysine (AdpL) DNA complexes in human, mouse, rat, and fetal porcine <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> In all species studied, calcium phosphate-mediated transfection resulted in lower chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activities than the other methods. Intact human, mouse, and rat islets were poorly transfected by Lipofectin, Lipofectamine, and AdpL. When dispersed by trypsin treatment, however, human, mouse, rat, and fetal pig islect cells were efficiently transfected by Lipofectamine. Moreover, transfection of dispersed human and mouse <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> using AdpL, also resulted in high CAT activities. The percentage of cells staining positively for beta-galactosidase after transfection with Lipofectamine was 49 % for mouse, 56 % for rat, and 57 % for dispersed human <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> Transfection of human <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> using AdpL, however, yielded 70 % beta-gal-positive cells. Fluorescence-activated <b>cell</b> sorting-purified rat <b>islet</b> alpha- and beta-cells were transfected with similar efficiency using Lipofectamine. CAT expression in human <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> transfected with either Lipofectamine or AdpL reached a peak value after 5 - 7 days, followed by a gradual decline.

40|$|The {{selective}} {{destruction of}} the pancreatic <b>islet</b> beta <b>cells</b> in type 1 diabetes mellitus {{is thought to be}} mediated by a cellular autoimmune process, possibly triggered by virus infection in genetically susceptible individuals. Because of the potentially important role of cell-cell adhesion in the immune response, we investigated whether cytokine products of mononuclear cells, or virus infection, induced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) on human endocrine <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> By flow cytofluorimetry, control <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> did not express detectable ICAM- 1. However, after a 72 -hr exposure of islets to interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (each at 250 units/ml), ICAM- 1 was induced on greater than 85 % of <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> IFN-gamma was 50 % more potent than TNF-alpha; together, their effects were additive. Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein expression, detected on control <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> was also stimulated by IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha. In contrast, infection with reovirus type 3 did not induce ICAM- 1 on <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> although it stimulated the expression of class I MHC proteins. By double-label indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, ICAM- 1 expression was identified on both beta (insulin-secreting) and delta (somatostatin-secreting) <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> Monoclonal antibody to ICAM- 1 precipitated protein of Mr 97, 000 from [35 S]methionine-labeled islets exposed to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but not from control islets.

40|$|Dexamethasone {{negatively}} regulates {{insulin gene}} expression in HIT- 15 cells. In vivo, however, {{an excess of}} glucocorticoids results {{in an increase in}} insulin biosynthesis and peripheral hyperinsulinemia. To resolve this contradiction, we have studied the effects of dexamethasone in primary rat <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> We show here that dexamethasone decreases insulin mRNA levels in single <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> as in HIT- 15 cells, but does not affect these levels in reaggregated <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> and increases them in intact islets of Langerhans. Because cAMP is an important regulator of insulin gene expression and intracellular cAMP content may be decreased in single beta cells, we investigated whether cAMP could prevent the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on insulin mRNA levels. In the presence of cAMP analogues, the inhibitory action of dexamethasone was not only prevented, but insulin mRNA increased to levels comparable to those observed when cAMP analogues were used alone. We conclude that the insulin gene is negatively regulated by dexamethasone in single <b>islet</b> <b>cells,</b> but that other factors such as cAMP prevent this effect when the native environment of <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> is preserved.
