500|$|During an {{interview}} with V, Cyrus and producer Pharrell Williams revealed that they considered servicing [...] "#GetItRight" [...] as the lead single from the record, though [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] was ultimately chosen. [...] "#GetItRight" [...] is a pop-funk song; it was written and produced by Pharrell Williams. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, the track is written in the key of F major with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club noted the incorporation of [...] "whistling choruses and whimsical sing-alongs", while Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly recognized {{the use of a}} [...] "scratchy funk guitar"; he further stated that the lyrics [...] "Would you believe I'm dancing in the mirror? / I feel like I got no panties on / <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could feel ya / Now hurry, hang up that damn phone!'" [...] address the desire of an [...] "absent lover". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that its production was similar to that of [...] "Starships" [...] by Nicki Minaj.|$|E
2500|$|For {{books that}} Geisel wrote and others illustrated, {{he used the}} pen name [...] "Theo LeSieg", {{starting}} with <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Had Duck Feet published in 1965. [...] "LeSieg" [...] is [...] "Geisel" [...] spelled backward. Geisel also published one book under the name Rosetta Stone, 1975's Because a Little Bug Went Ka-Choo!!, a collaboration with Michael K. Frith. [...] Frith and Geisel chose the name in honor of Geisel's second wife Audrey, whose maiden name was Stone.|$|E
2500|$|Hesiod {{knew from}} the {{traditional}} poetry, such as the Iliad, and the heirloom bronze artifacts that abounded in Greek society, that before the use of iron to make tools and weapons, bronze had been the preferred material and iron was not smelted at all. He did not continue the manufacturing metaphor, but mixed his metaphors, switching over to {{the market value of}} each metal. Iron was cheaper than bronze, so {{there must have been a}} golden and a silver age. He portrays a sequence of metallic ages, but it is a degradation rather than a progression. Each age has less of a moral value than the preceding. Of his own age he says: [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> were not any part of the fifth generation of men, but had died before it came, or had been born afterward." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was getting}} {{harder and harder}} to enunciate my {{proposition}} to make a sojourn at the inn. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had spoken sooner. It is so much easier to do things promptly.|$|R
60|$|How <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{might have}} {{accompanied}} them. It {{seemed to me}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not fail to impress upon the intelligent red men of Barsoom the wicked deception that a cruel and senseless superstition had foisted upon them.|$|R
60|$|It {{was rather}} a decent compliment, and it taught me {{just how much}} I might rely on the loyalty of my new friend. I {{was glad to have}} him with us, for he knew the country and was evidently a fearless warrior. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might have {{recruited}} a battalion like him.|$|R
2500|$|By then, Aderca's own {{literature}} was being assessed from an antisemitic standpoint in traditionalist circles. Const. I. Emilian, studying Romania's modernist scene with an ultra-nationalist bias, dismissed all of Aderca's texts as [...] "neurotic". The theme {{was taken up}} by Ovidiu Papadima in Sfarmă-Piatră, ridiculing Lovinescu as the unlikely patron of [...] "revolutionary ideas" [...] and of [...] "the Jews" [...] Aderca, Camil Baltazar, Benjamin Fondane, Ilarie Voronca, this being [...] "the illusion of a literary movement". Papadima campaigned for Aderca and H. Bonciu to be arrested during the 1937 scandal, referred to them only under their original Jewish names, called them [...] "swine" [...] and [...] "traders in hogwash", and suggested that erotic {{literature was}} [...] "that Jewish business". Dismissing the antisemitic lobby as [...] "hooligans", Aderca reportedly snapped: [...] "Five minutes, you understand? For five minutes, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> too were a hooligan, that I could experience {{what it means to}} be the Master!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Kemper {{gained some}} Internet fame in August 2007 {{for her part}} in [...] "Blowjob Girl", a humor video on the sketch comedy site Derrick Comedy. The video, which was {{circulated}} on the popular site CollegeHumor, was a two-minute close-up of Kemper offering to perform oral sex on her boyfriend, but startling him by promising to bite and smash his genitals, which she seems to believe is arousing. Kemper said of the video in an April 2010 interview with The A.V. Club: [...] "I really don't like that video, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hadn't done it, even though I know that it's a joke. I hate that it got sort of big, because I don't think that it's that funny and I don't want {{that to be the}} epitome of my work. It's just one video in a sea of many, but it has made me conscious of not wanting to do a video like that again." [...] Kemper has also contributed an article to CollegeHumor entitled [...] "Regarding Our Decision Never to See Me Again." [...] She also had a minor role in the 2009 film Mystery Team. Kemper starred in the fake iPhone commercial on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in January 2007, six months before the first iPhone was released. Kemper appeared in the Sofia Coppola comedy-drama Somewhere in 2010. She appeared in Bridesmaids in 2011. On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Kemper would be voicing a character in an episode of the animated sitcom American Dad!.|$|E

60|$|I {{began to}} {{contemplate}} the scenery. How wonderful were that sheet of flame, and the ripples which ran up and down its height. How awesome its billowy crest. It would be warm lying in yonder red gulf below with the dead Rassen, but oh! <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shared his bed and had finished with these agonies.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> were armed. Sterndale's fierce face {{turned to a}} dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with clenched hands towards my companion. Then he stopped, and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{might have}} found a point closer to the two men from which to have heard their conversation; but {{it was out of}} the {{question}} now to attempt to cross the river, and so I lay quietly watching them, who would have given so much to have known how close I lay to them, and how easily they might have overcome and killed me with their superior force.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you wish}} it, yes. I know that I must refuse him. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had told him}} so at once, as then {{there would have been}} an end of it." ...|$|E

60|$|April 22.--Let me try and {{set down}} as {{accurately}} as I can my extraordinary experience of yesterday. I {{started in the}} afternoon, and {{made my way to}} the Blue John Gap. <b>I</b> confess <b>that</b> my misgivings returned as I gazed into its depths, and <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had brought a companion to share my exploration. Finally, with a return of resolution, I lit my candle, pushed my way through the briars, and descended into the rocky shaft.|$|R
60|$|Thereon all {{the company}} and the {{soldiers}} and servants who were gathered about the door began to shout and acclaim me, till <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could vanish away as the holy Tanofir was said to be able to do. Since this was impossible I rushed at Bes who leapt from the table like a monkey and, still waving the heads and talking, slipped from the hall, I know not how, followed by the loud laughter of the guests.|$|R

6000|$|... "None--none about him. The tide {{took his}} body away, no doubt, after the Kaffir had gone. I {{remember}} him well now. He {{was a fine}} young man, and it comes into my mind <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> said good-bye to him above those old ruins, <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a son like that.

6000|$|... "But he {{prevents}} me from touching it. What {{they give}} me only comes by a sort of favour from the lawyer. <b>I</b> almost <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had compromised." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I think so. He always scolded me. He did {{not like}} me. I {{used to think that}} I would go away and leave him. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never come to Llanfeare. I do;--I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{fortunate}} chance, that if {{you were}} to have the bad luck to be made prisoner, you should fall into my hands of all men. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could let you go, but you know--" ...|$|E

60|$|Presently I saw the ten battleships {{that had}} been ordered to hold the shaft of Omean. They were {{returning}} at full speed, firing their stern batteries almost continuously. There could be but one explanation. They were being pursued by another hostile fleet. Well, the situation could be no worse. The expedition already was doomed. No man that had embarked upon it would return across that dreary ice cap. How <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might face Zat Arrras with my longsword for just an instant before I died! It was he who had caused our failure.|$|R
