5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E
5|$|The first Zephyr (9900) was {{completed}} by the Budd Company on April 9, 1934, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447kW), 8-201-A model Winton engine. Like the <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> that soon displaced the steam locomotive on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric traction motors connected to the axles in the train's front truck.|$|E

5|$|When {{the order}} was placed, {{it was the first}} Norwegian {{electric}} locomotive with the mechanical components built in Germany. At the same time, NSB ordered five six-axle <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> from Thyssen-Henschel (Mark Di 4), almost the same as the Danish Mark ME 1500. The Di 4/ME 1500 have many similarities to its electric counterpart El 17. The two were planned to have the same rectifiers and motors, but due to weight restrictions the El 17 received the same type as Class 120.|$|E
5|$|A MaK-built DB Class 240 {{locomotive}} was test-run in Norway during 1990. On 23 November 1992, NSB's board {{decided to}} order ten similar units. The order was later expanded with another two units because NSB {{was offered a}} lower price than originally stipulated. The Di6 would have motors from Siemens, who had bought MaK, and would be optimized for Norwegian conditions and standards. The contract was worth NOK380 million, or NOK32 million per unit. At the same time, NSB also made an order for 20 smaller <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> from MaK, the Di8. Between the two new classes, they were to replace all the Di3s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new {{locomotive}} type to replace its aging fleet of Di 3 <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives,</b> which {{made up the}} back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as freight and passenger trains on the Nordland Line, {{and to a lesser}} extent on the Røros Line. In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five Di4 from Henschel. Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued, as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, two ALCO RS-3 1,500 h.p. <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> were purchased. With the {{phasing out}} of the steam power, by 1970 Jamaica's {{railways}} had fourteen <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> and only one steam locomotive was still in operation. Between 1972 and 1976, an additional 18 ALCO RS-8's, manufactured by MLW in Canada, were purchased in three batches of six locomotives.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the Whyte {{notation}} of wheel {{arrangement was}} also {{often used for}} the classification of electric and <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> with side-rod coupled driving wheels. Under the UIC classification, popular in Europe, this wheel arrangement is written as C if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears, or Co if they are independently driven, the latter usually being electric and <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, the Royal Commission on Railways created {{following}} Aickin's tenure {{rejected the}} report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with English Electric to specify DF <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives.</b> They were later {{found to be}} unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 DG locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, DA class <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> were ordered from General Motors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} VGN {{management}} {{realized that the}} company's devotion to coal as its energy source (for steam locomotives and the power plant at Narrows for the electrification system) was becoming overshadowed by the economies of <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> and a scarcity of parts for the older steam locomotives. Between 1954 and 1957 a total of 66 <b>diesel-electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> were purchased, including 25 Fairbanks-Morse H-24-66 Train Masters, and 40 H-16-44 smaller road switchers, two with steam generators to haul passenger trains.
