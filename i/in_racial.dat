Kelly, Bryant, and Drake were white; Lowe was African-American.|$|E

25|$|Topeka has {{struggled}} with the burden of racial discrimination even after Brown.

25|$|Such {{views were}} extreme, but more {{mainstream}} Nordic theory was institutionalised. Hans F. K. Günther, {{who joined the}} Nazi Party in 1932, was praised as a pioneer <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> thinking, a shining light of Nordic theory. Most official Nazi comments on the Nordic Race were based on Günther's works, and Alfred Rosenberg presented Günther with a medal {{for his work in}} anthropology.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 {{he headed}} the Monckton Commission that {{concluded}} that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland could not be maintained except by force or through massive changes <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> legislation.

25|$|Due to {{worsening}} PAP-UMNO relations, Singapore's {{status in}} Malaysia became increasingly tense {{as time went}} on. Singapore retained its autonomy, but differences <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> policy concerning issues of racial discrimination affected Singapore. The UMNO backed Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia, which gave the government of Malaysia power to enforce special social and economic privileges for the Bumiputra, which were ethnically and religiously defined.|$|E
25|$|In May 2004, {{while still}} {{a member of}} the judiciary, Judge Mukasey {{delivered}} a speech (which he converted into a Wall Street Journal opinion piece) that defended the USA PATRIOT Act; the piece also expressed doubt that the FBI engaged <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> profiling of Arabs and criticized the American Library Association for condemning the Patriot Act but not taking a position on librarians imprisoned in Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Some upper-class women, {{typified by}} Lila Meade Valentine of Richmond, {{promoted}} numerous Progressive reforms, including kindergartens, teacher education, visiting nurses programs, and vocational education for both races. Middle-class white women were especially {{active in the}} Prohibition movement. The woman suffrage movement became entangled <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> issues—whites were reluctant to allow black women the vote—and was unable to broaden its base beyond middle-class whites. Virginia women got the vote in 1920, {{the result of a}} national constitutional amendment.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{study showed}} that among churchgoers, those who go to {{segregated}} or primarily white churches {{are more likely to}} exhibit racist behaviors or to have prejudiced ideas about African Americans. Those who attend integrated churches are about equal <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> attitudes to those who do not attend church at all, but those who attend racially segregated churches {{are more likely to be}} both covertly and overtly racist than either group. It is difficult to posit whether this intolerance is caused by attending a segregated church, or if those who hold prejudiced views are more likely to seek out a segregated church.|$|E

25|$|Gordimer's early {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> {{and economic}} inequality in South Africa was shaped {{in part by}} her parents. Her father's experience as a refugee in tsarist Russia helped form Gordimer's political identity, but he was neither an activist nor particularly sympathetic toward the experiences of black people under apartheid. Conversely, Gordimer saw activism by her mother, whose concern about the poverty and discrimination faced by black people in South Africa ostensibly led her to found a crèche for black children. Gordimer also witnessed government repression first-hand as a teenager; the police raided her family home, confiscating letters and diaries from a servant's room.|$|E
25|$|The {{postwar period}} after the Great War {{was marked by}} social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to {{integrate}} veterans into the economy. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including police strikes in London among the Metropolitan Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the UK, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919 they were subject to attack by whites <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in Cardiff, Newport and Barry, {{and there had been}} incidents in Glasgow, South Shields, London, Hull and Salford. Similarly, racial riots of whites against blacks took place across the United States in numerous industrial cities, so that a black leader termed the period of time Red Summer. In that first postwar year, there were also riots in Caribbean and South African cities.|$|E

500|$|After World War II ended, Philadelphia had {{a serious}} housing shortage. Around half of the city's housing had {{been built in the}} 19th century, and many units lacked proper {{sanitary}} facilities, were overcrowded, and in poor condition. Competition for housing, as African Americans (many had come to the city in the Great Migration from the South) and Puerto Ricans moved into new neighborhoods, resulted <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> tension.

500|$|An issue {{regarding}} the third Gingles precondition remains unresolved. In Gingles, the Supreme Court split {{as to whether}} plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race, such as party affiliation. A plurality of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress's intent to make Section 2 a [...] "results" [...] test, but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results <b>in</b> <b>racial</b> discrimination. Since Gingles, lower courts have split on the issue.|$|E
