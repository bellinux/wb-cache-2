50|$|A {{mixture of}} CrO3, HBF4, and {{sulfonic}} acids {{in conjunction with}} a cathode treatment give tin-plated steel. Tin(I) fluoroborate/fluoroboric acid mixtures and organic reagents are used as the electrolyte in the cathode treatment of the tin plating process. Similar processes of electrodeposition and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>stripping</b> are used to obtain specific metal alloys.|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} {{electrolysis}} with a mercury cathode, microgram quantities ofcopper, lead, cadmium, zinc, iron, cobalt, and nickel can {{be separated from}} at least 0. 51 V [vanadium solutions. Quantitative recovery of all these traces of metals except cadmium from the mercury by distillation is satisfactory, and their subsequent estimation by either polarographie or spectrophotometrie methods is adequate. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>stripping</b> of dilute amalgams at controlled potentials hows that the electrodeposited metals could not only be separated into the two major groups of pas-sive (Fe, Co, and Ni) and nonpassive (Cu, Pb, Cd, and Cu) metals, but that separations within the nonpsssive group are also possible...|$|E
