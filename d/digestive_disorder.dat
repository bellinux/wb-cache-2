The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the association between exon 3 polymorphisms of NLRP 3 and the susceptibility to <b>digestive</b> <b>disorders</b> in rabbits. In total, five coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) were identified; all of which are synonymous. Among them, c. 456 C> and c. 594 G> were further genotyped for association analysis based on case-control design (n = 162 vs n = 102). Meanwhile, growing rabbits were experimentally induced to <b>digestive</b> <b>disorders</b> by feeding a fiber-deficient diet, subsequently they were subjected to mRNA expression analysis. Association analysis revealed that haplotype H 1 (the two cSNPs: GT) played a potential protective role against <b>digestive</b> <b>disorders</b> (p< 0. 001). The expression of NLRP 3 in the group H 1 HX 1 (H 1 HX 1 is composed of H 1 H 1, H 1 H 3 and H 1 H 4) was the lowest among four groups which were classified by different types of diplotypes.

5000|$|He failed an {{audition}} for the BBC because he kept {{time with his}} foot. At a time when gramophones were very much luxury items he made two records for the Regal Zonophone label in 1933. His career took off when he switched to making 78s for the Beltona label (1935-1940). Most of the Beltona recordings were solo, but he experimented with small bands. This boosted sales. He appeared in a promo film shown in cinemas. While the image showed his fingers moving in a blur, Jimmy was disappointed to hear the sound track playing a slow air. He was prevented from joining the RAF by a <b>digestive</b> <b>disorder,</b> and spent the war years in the Fire Service.

In 1999, Caldecott relocated to Calgary, Alberta, where he eventually became clinical director of the Wild Rose College of Natural Healing.

5000|$|In 1979, Jaak Panksepp {{proposed}} {{a connection between}} autism and opiates, noting that injections of minute quantities of opiates in young laboratory animals induce symptoms similar to those observed among autistic children. Opiate theory hypothesizes that autism {{is caused by a}} <b>digestive</b> <b>disorder</b> present from birth which causes gluten (present in wheat-derived foods) and casein (present in dairy products) to be converted to the opioid peptides gliadorphin (aka gluteomorphin) and casomorphin. [...] According to the theory, exposure to these opiate compounds in young children interferes with normal neurological development by dulling sensory input. Lacking sufficient sensory input, the developing brain attempts to artificially generate the auditory, vestibular, visual, and tactile input on its own. This attempt at generating input manifests itself as behaviors common to autism, such as grunting or screaming (auditory), spinning or rocking back and forth (vestibular), preoccupation with spinning objects or waving of the fingers in front of the eyes (visual), and hand flapping or self-injury (tactile).|$|E
50|$|This {{story was}} {{originally}} {{not part of}} the sketches either and appeared in another collection of stories first in 1874. Here, the narrator comes back to his home estate to find a beautiful servant named Lukeria in a horrible state. After falling from a porch she succumbs to an unknown <b>digestive</b> <b>disorder</b> (not explicitly stated, but implied) that reduces her to an unmoving, skeletal figure. She spends her time in the shed in the summer and near the house in the winter, moved about by the house servants who remain. The narrator is shaken by her disturbing ability to accept her fate, regardless of how terrible it may be. She is completely unable to move and finds her days accented only by the occasional sounds of new birds in the shed, smells, or a rabbit that may occasionally come in to visit her. She eventually dies in peace, completely aware that the day was coming because she saw it in her dreams. This story is slightly different from the others because of the inclusion of the “unreal” found in Lukeria’s dream states. The narrator is heartbroken by her condition, but is surprised to find her happy with life in spite of her state. Suggestions have been made that she is so happy because in her inability to move she is also unable to sin.|$|E
