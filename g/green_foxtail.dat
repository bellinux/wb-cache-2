5000|$|Foxtail millet ( [...] ; botanic name Setaria italica, synonym Panicum italicum L.) is {{an annual}} grass grown for human food. It is the second-most widely planted species of millet, {{and the most}} {{important}} in East Asia. It has the longest history of cultivation among the millets, having been grown in India since antiquity. According to recent research, it was first domesticated in China around 6,000 BC. Other names for the species include dwarf setaria, foxtail bristle-grass, giant setaria, <b>green</b> <b>foxtail,</b> Italian millet, German millet, and Hungarian millet.|$|E
50|$|Setaria viridis is {{a species}} of grass known by many common names, {{including}} <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> green bristlegrass, and wild foxtail millet. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of Setaria italica. It is native to Eurasia, but it is known on most continents as an introduced species and {{is closely related to}} Setaria faberi, a noxious weed. It is a hardy grass which grows in many types of urban, cultivated, and disturbed habitat, including vacant lots, sidewalks, railroads, lawns, and at the margins of fields. It is the wild antecedent of the crop foxtail millet.|$|E
50|$|Tan spot {{is found}} {{primarily}} on wheat, {{but is also}} found to infect other cereals and grasses including triticale, barley, and rye, but are less frequently affected.Other grass species effected by the pathogen include Siberian wheat grass, sand bluestem, meadow brome, sheep fescue, June grass, little bluestem, <b>green</b> <b>foxtail,</b> needle and thread, and tall wheatgrass.While these are not necessarily agriculture crop hosts such as wheat, the pathogen is able to form and survive on many grass hosts, which can eventually venture into wheat fields. Other important grass susceptible hosts include smooth brome {{which can be found}} in pastures, as well as quack grass that is found in the environment and considered a weed in many agricultural crops. Lesions typically appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and initially are tan to brown specks. Eventually, the tan to brown specks expand to larger irregular, oval, lens-shaped, ellipse, tan blotches with a yellow ring around them. The yellow ring {{is often referred to as}} a halo, yellow discoloration as chlorosis, and browning/death of leaf tissue as necrosis. The development of a dark brown to black spot in the center the lesion is characteristic of the disease. If warmer temperatures and moist conditions persist, spores known as conidia will move up plant as secondary inoculum and can also infect head/spikes. Symptoms on the head are indistinct, but can cause brownish glumes, and grains can have a reddish appearance similar to the pathogen Fusarium.|$|E
40|$|The foxtails are {{cosmopolitan}} {{weeds and}} among the most troublesome in agriculture. High seed production and seed dormancy are important attributes contributing {{to the success of}} the foxtails as weeds. The amount and sources of germination variability among giant foxtail seed were evaluated. Seed from a single genetic line of giant foxtail was grown under field, greenhouse and growth chamber conditions. Germination assays were conducted at abscission and following stratification and seed dissection. Most giant foxtail seed were shed dormant. As the seed rain progressed, mean germination percentage and variability in the germination requirements among samples increased. Changes in seed dormancy were associated with biological and environmental parameters. Within an individual panicle, seed that developed later were more likely to germinate than those that developed earlier. Seed from panicles that developed relatively later on a plant were also more likely to germinate than seed from panicles that developed earlier. Seed grown in the field were less dormant than those grown in the greenhouse which were in turn less dormant than those from growth chamber conditions. It is possible that each seed has an individual germination requirement. Seed from giant, <b>green</b> and yellow <b>foxtail</b> panicles were collected throughout the reproductive period. A higher number of seed was found than has been generally reported. Although seed number per panicle, panicle length and seed density (seed number per unit panicle length) varied among foxtail species, panicles and sites, some consistent relationships were found. The relationship between seed number and panicle length also varied among foxtail species, panicles and sites. The giant foxtail germination process was divided into three axis specific embryo growth states. Photographic evidence of each germination state is shown for both caryopses and seed. The germination state after eight to twelve days under germination conditions is believed to reveal the potential for germination possessed by the seed prior to germination...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyJ. A. DilleThe {{availability}} of ALS-inhibitor herbicide-resistant grain sorghum hybrids {{will provide an}} opportunity to control grass weeds post-emergence with the ALS-inhibiting herbicide nicosulfuron (Zest[superscript]TM). More information on impact of grass weeds on sorghum yield are needed to optimize the application of nicosulfuron. The research objectives were to evaluate the impact of time of grass weed removal on grain sorghum yield when grown in different crop row spacing and seeding rates and to determine the critical duration of grass weed competition. Field studies were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at the KSU Agricultural Research Center at Hays, KS and the KSU Department of Agronomy Research Farm near Manhattan, KS. Four main treatments were grain sorghum row spacing of 25 and 76 cm at Hays or 20 and 76 cm at Manhattan, and two seeding rates of 125, 000 and 150, 000 seed ha⁻¹. Within each main plot, seven treatments were established including: weed-free all season using pre-emergence herbicides, weed-free all season by hand, weedy for 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after crop emergence in 2014 or weedy for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after crop emergence in 2015, and weedy all season. The main grass weeds were giant, <b>green,</b> and yellow <b>foxtail</b> species, large crabgrass, and barnyardgrass. Grass weed biomass increased through the season at both locations in 2014 and in Manhattan in 2015. Hays 2014 grain sorghum aboveground stem and leaf biomass across row spacing and seeding rates decreased as weed removal time was delayed through the growing season. Grain sorghum yield decreased with increasing duration of grass weed competition in both years in Manhattan and in 2014 at Hays. Yield loss reached 5 % at 2. 3 to 25 weeks after sorghum emergence in narrow row spacing and 3. 3 to 6. 3 weeks after sorghum emergence in wide row spacing, depending on location, demonstrating that removing grass weed competition during these time frames will prevent more than 5 % loss in grain sorghum yields...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitive}} {{effects of}} maize plants on weed growth, seed production, and seed dormancy were investigated. Weed seed dormancy was studied using ultrafreezing and electron microscope techniques. The importance of weed seed dormancy in weed control was discussed;Plants of four weed species, Setaria luteschens (Weigel) Hubb., Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv., Polygonum pensylvanicum L., and Abutilon theophrasti Medic., were grown free from competition with maize. Height of Pennsylvania smartweed and velvetleaf plants increased for plants {{in competition with}} maize plants; other plant growth parameters decreased. Plant growth and seed production for <b>green</b> and yellow <b>foxtail</b> decreased for plants that were in competition with maize plants. Reduction in weed seed production was over 90 % {{for each of the}} four weed species when grown with maize competition;Maize competition also affected the dormancy of Polygonum pensylvanicum L. weed seeds. Although all seeds were dormant when harvested, 4 % of the seeds from plants with maize competition and 35 % of the seeds from plants without maize competition germinated after 15 weeks of prechilling; germinations were 94 % and 92 % respectively after 30 weeks of prechilling. When viewed with a scanning electron electron microscope, seed coats of seeds from plants with maize competition appeared well-channeled; but, seed coats from plants without maize competition were compact. Dormancy of seeds from plants growing without maize competition may result from an impermeable seed coat;The embryo epidermis was investigated using a transmission electron microscope. More lipid bodies and intercellular junctions occurred in the embryo epidermis of seeds (not prechilled or imbibed) from plants with maize competition. Dormancy of seeds from maize competition may result from embryo immaturity;Weed seed dormancy was also investigated using ultrafreezing. Echinochloa crus-gali (L.) Beauv. seeds were ultrafrozen in liquid nitrogen (- 196 C) for 5 minutes and thawed for 1 hour. Germination increased from 60 % for not ultrafrozen seeds to 99 % for seeds ultrafrozen 10 times. Seed coats were viewed with scanning electron, transmission electron, and light microscopes. No cracks or structural changes were apparent in seeds ultrafrozen 10 times. Also, water imbibition was the same. Ultrafreezing probably did not increase seed coat permeability to water;A transmission electron microscope was used to investigate the secretory epithelium of unimbibed seed that had been ultrafrozen 0, 4 or 10 times. Lipid bodies were dissociated by ultrafreezing. Lipid bodies reformed after water imbibition; but, protein bodies were digested faster in the secretory epithelium of ultrafrozen seeds...|$|R
40|$|Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} domesticated cereal crops in Eurasia, but {{identifying}} foxtail millets, especially in charred grains, and differentiating it from its wild ancestor, <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria viridis), in the archaeobotanical remains, is still problematic. Phytolithic analysis provides a meaningful method for identifying this important crop. In this paper, the silicon structure patterns in the glumes, lemmas, and paleas from inflorescence bracts in 16 modern plants of foxtail millet and <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> from China and Europe are examined using light microscopy with phase-contrast and a microscopic interferometer. Our research shows that the silicon structure of Omega III from upper lemmas and paleas in foxtail millet and <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> can be correspondingly divided into two groups.

The V 3 barnyardgrass (5 cm tall), V 4 <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (6 cm), V 4 morningglory (11 cm) and V 5 velvetleaf (8 cm) were flamed using propane rates of 0, 12, 31, 48, 69 and 87 kg/ha. The responses of the barnyardgrass, <b>green</b> <b>foxtail,</b> velvetleaf, and morningglory to propane flaming were described by logistic models. The percentage of weed control in terms of visual injury rating and dry matter (DM) reduction increased with increasing propane rates. In general, grasses were more tolerant to flaming than the broadleaf species when based on visual ratings. About 90 % control of barnyardgrass was achieved with 55 kg/ha compared to 26 kg/ha for velvetleaf and morningglory. In contrast to visual ratings, the dose response curves based on DM showed that comparatively higher propane dose was needed to obtain 90 % DM reduction in morningglory than the other species. For example, propane rate of 41 kg/ha was required to get 90 % DM reduction in morningglory 14 days after treatment compared to 36, 20 and 24 kg/ha for barnyardgrass, <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> and velvetleaf, respectively.

40|$|Although {{the origin}} and {{domestication}} process of foxtail millet (Setaria italica subsp. italica (L.) P. Beauv.) has been studied by several groups, the issue is still ambiguous. It is essential {{to resolve this issue}} by studying a large number of accessions with sufficient markers covering the entire genome. Genetic structures were analyzed by transposon display (TD) using 425 accessions of foxtail millet and 12 of the wild ancestor <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria italica subsp. viridis (L.) P.

A neighbor-joining dendrogram based on TD grouped the foxtail millet accessions into eight major clusters, each of which consisted of accessions collected from adjacent geographical areas. Eleven out of 12 <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> accessions were grouped separately from the clusters of foxtail millet.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the molecular bases for resistance to several classes of herbicides that bind tubulins in <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria viridis L. Beauv.). We identified two α- and two β-tubulin genes in <b>green</b> <b>foxtail.</b> Sequence comparison between resistant and sensitive plants revealed two mutations, a leucine-to-phenylalanine change at position 136 and a threonine-to-isoleucine change at position 239, in the gene encoding α 2 -tubulin. Association of mutation at position 239 with herbicide resistance was demonstrated using near-isogenic lines derived from interspecific pairings between <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> and foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.

Comparison of three-dimensional α-tubulin models for organisms with contrasted sensitivity to tubulin-binding herbicides enabled us to propose that residue 253 and the vicinity of the side chain of residue 251 are critical determinants for the differences in herbicide sensitivity observed between organisms, and that positions 16, 24, 136, 239, 252, and 268 are involved in modulating sensitivity to these herbicides...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), one of {{the most}} ancient domesticated crops, is {{becoming}} a model system for studying biofuel crops and comparative genomics in the grasses. However, knowledge on the level of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) is very limited in this crop and its wild ancestor, <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria viridis (L.) P. Beauv.). Such information would help us to understand the domestication process of cultivated species and will allow further research in these species, including association mapping and identification of agricultural significant genes involved in domestication. Results In this study, we surveyed DNA sequence for nine loci across 50 accessions of cultivated foxtail millet and 34 of its wild progenitor. We found a low level of genetic diversity in wild <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (θ = 0. 0059), θ means Watterson's estimator of θ. Despite of a 55 % loss of its wild diversity, foxtail millet still harbored a considerable level of diversity (θ = 0. 0027) when compared to rice and sorghum (θ = 0. 0024 and 0. 0034, respectively). The level of LD in the domesticated foxtail millet extends to 1 kb, while it decayed rapidly to a negligible level within 150 bp in wild <b>green</b> <b>foxtail.</b> Using coalescent simulation, we estimated the bottleneck severity at k = 0. 6095 when ρ/θ = 1. These results indicated that the domestication bottleneck of foxtail millet was more severe than that of maize but slightly less pronounced than that of rice. Conclusions The results in this study establish a general framework for the domestication history of foxtail millet. The low level of genetic diversity and the increased level of LD in foxtail millet are mainly caused by a population bottleneck, although gene flow from foxtail millet to <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> is another factor that may have shaped the pattern of genetic diversity of these two related gene pools. The knowledge provided in this study will benefit future population based studies in foxtail millet. </p...|$|E

Leaf wax was extracted and quantified. The spread of 1 μl droplets of distilled water, primisulfuron solution (without surfactant), primisulfuron solution with a nonionic surfactant and with an organosilicone surfactant was determined on the adaxial leaf surfaces {{of each of the}} weed species. The activity of primisulfuron without or with surfactants was assessed 3 weeks after treatment in terms of percent injury and plant fresh weight. Greenhouse studies were also conducted to investigate the bioherbicidal activity of Alternaria helianthi (Hansf.) Tubaki 2 ̆ 6 Nishih. on multiple-seeded cocklebur as affected by various surfactants. ^ The number of stomata per unit area on abaxial surface was more than on adaxial leaf surface of barnyardgrass, common lambsquarters and velvetleaf, whereas, common purslane and <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> had more stomata on adaxial surface than abaxial. Common lambsquarters had the highest wax content per unit of leaf area (274. 5 μg cm- 2) and velvetleaf had the lowest (7. 4 μg cm- 2). Wax content of common purslane was 153. 4 μg cm- 2. The mean values of the wax content per unit of leaf area in barnyardgrass and <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> were 35. 91 μg cm- 2 and 19. 14 μg cm- 2, respectively. Surfactants increased primisulfuron activity on common lambsquarters, common purslane, velvetleaf, and <b>green</b> <b>foxtail.</b> In general, organosilicone surfactant reduced the contact angle with increased spread area of the primisulfuron droplets more than the nonionic surfactant treatments and resulted in enhanced activity of primisulfuron.

40|$|Predicting weed {{emergence}} {{is useful}} for planning weed management programs. Unfortunately, our ability to anticipate initial emergence and subsequent levels of emergence from simple field observations or weather reports is often inadequate to achieve optimal control.

40|$|The {{germination}} and {{emergence of}} a seedling, or seedling recruitment remains an essential process {{in the establishment of}} a plant. This establishment can be limited by the availability of microsites within the soil profile, or the availability of seed within a given area. Three field experiments were initiated in Saskatchewan, Canada to examine the relative effect of seed and microsite limitations on weed seedling recruitment. The first experiment examined the effect of landscape position as well as nitrogen (N) rate and tillage system (zero tillage vs. conventional tillage) on weed seedling recruitment from an indigenous weed population. Survey results indicated habitat differentiation of the weed population with wild oat and cleavers preferentially recruiting in the lower landscape positions, Russian thistle and Kochia in the upper landscape positions, while <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> recruited in high levels on all landscape positions. This suggested that different weed species have different microsite requirements for weed seedling recruitment across contrasting landscape positions. The second field experiment examined the effect of landscape position and moisture availability on weed seedling recruitment from an artificial hand-seeded weed seedbank. This experiment indicated that seed limitation remained a very important factor, but even when irrigated, total seedling recruitment did not reach maximum recruitment, indicating water was not the only limiting resource for weed seedling recruitment. Microsite limitations were greatest on the upper slope position for all species with <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> having the greatest overall recruitment of the species across all landscapes and moisture regimes. The third experiment examined the effect of tillage system and density on weed seedling recruitment of wild oat, <b>green</b> <b>foxtail,</b> and wild mustard. Again, weed seedling recruitment remained a function of both microsite and seed limitations as absolute recruitment values increased for each density examined in this experiment. The agronomic significance of microsite limitation was negligible as high weed population numbers occurred for the highest weed seeding densities. Overall, microsite limitations remained negligible in these experiments for arable agriculture with the main influence on weed seedling recruitment most often being seed limitation in the natural seedbank...|$|E

In producer fields, kochia (Kochia scoparia L. Schrad.) and wild buckwheat, (Polygonum convolvulus L.) were also investigated. Seed shatter was assessed using shatter trays collected once a week during crop ripening stage, as well as at two crop harvest stages (swathing, direct-combining). In the small-plot experiments, seed shatter differed among weed species, but was similar between field pea and wheat at maturity: ca. 30 % for wild oat, 5 % for cleavers, < 2 % for wild mustard, and < 1 % for <b>green</b> <b>foxtail.</b> Similar results were observed in producer fields: 22 - 30 % for wild oat, and generally < 10 % for the other species. Seed shatter of weeds in canola at swathing, including that of wild oat, was uniformly low (< 5 %). Overall, seed shatter of wild oat occurred sooner and at greater levels during the growing season compared with the other weeds. Viability of both shattered and plant-retained seeds was relatively high for all species. Low seed shatter of <b>green</b> <b>foxtail,</b> wild mustard, cleavers, wild buckwheat, and kochia indicates that there is potential for these species to be controlled by HWSC practices.

Two species of Setaria, domesticated foxtail millet (S. italica) and its wild ancestor <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (S. viridis) are becoming widely adopted as models for functional genomics studies in the Panicoid grasses. In this study, the genomic regions controlling germination and early seedling drought tolerance in Setaria were identified using 190 F 7 lines derived from a cross between Yugu 1, a S. italica cultivar developed in China, and a wild S. viridis genotype collected from Uzbekistan. Quantitative trait loci were identified which contribute {{to a number of}} traits including promptness index, radical root length, coleoptile length and lateral root number at germinating stage and seedling survival rate was characterized by the ability of desiccated seedlings to revive after rehydration.

40|$|Synthèse des {{connaissances}} actuelles sur la botanique et les origines du millet Setaria italica. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) Beauv.) {{is widely}} grown {{as a minor}} cereal across Eurasia. Primitive kinds, belonging to race moharia are cultivated in southeastern Europe, parts of the Near East, and particularly in Afghanistan. They resemble with S. italica subsp. viridis (L.) Thellung (<b>green</b> <b>foxtail)</b> in respect to inflorescence morphology, and hybrids between wild and cultivated kinds are fully fertile. Derivatives from such natural hybridization {{gave rise to the}} robust weed of Eurasia and temperate North American commonly known as giant <b>green</b> <b>foxtail.</b> The highly modified race maxima is an important cereal in Central Asia and the Far East. Foxtail millets have been grown in Europe since the third millennium B. C. and in China since the fifth millennium B. C. It seems unlikely that the crop was domesticated in China and introduced into Europe. No other Far Eastern crop reached Europe during prehistoric times. Similarly, the cereal could not have been introduced from Europe into China as a domesticated crop. Wild foxtail millet occurs across Eurasia, is commonly harvested as a cereal, and could have been taken into cultivation at several places. In Europe, this cereal is found, in an archaeological context, in association with Near Eastern crops. de Wet J. M. J., Oestry-Stidd L. L., Cubero J. I.

For each “year-weed” combination, dose-response curves were applied to estimate the dose of foramsulfuron required to obtain 90 % and 95 % weed control (ED 90 and ED 95). Foramsulfuron phytotoxicity on maize and crop yield were assessed. Foramsulfuron at 1 / 3 of the recommended dose (20. 3 g a. i. /ha) provided 95 % efficacy against redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.), wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.) were satisfactorily controlled (95 % weed efficacy) with ED 95 ranged from 20 to 50 g/ha of foramsulfuron (about from 1 / 3 to 5 / 6 of the recommended dose) depending on growth stage. The recommended dose was effective against pale smartweed (Polygonum lapathifolium L.) at 2 - 4 true leaves (12 - 14 BBCH scale), but this dose did not kill plants larger than 2 - 4 true leaves. The ranking among weed species based on their susceptibility to foramsulfuron was: redroot pigweed = <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> = wild mustard = black nightshade > velvetleaf = common lambsquarters = barnyardgrass > pale smartweed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Previous {{research}} has indicated several soil-applied herbicides are more effective by exposure to emerging shoots than from root uptake. Studies were conducted in the greenhouse and growth chamber to investigate effects of herbicide placement in soil on toxicity to emerging seedlings. In these studies, an inch of treated soil was placed above the seed, below the seed, or both {{above and below the}} seed. The seed was placed {{in the middle of a}} 1 -inch layer of untreated soil. Each soil layer was brought to field capacity separately and the entire container was covered with a plastic bag. The use of this plastic bag avoided the need for irrigation and subsequent herbicide movement. By this method, numerous herbicides were active on oats (Avena sativa) primarily through shoot exposure, with root exposure having little or no effect on foliage growth. These herbicides included EPTC (ethyl N, N-dipropylthiocarbamate), dichlobenil (2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile), trifluralin (α, α, α-trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl-p-toluidine), nitralin (2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl- 4 -[methylsulphonyl] aniline), propachlor (2 -chloro-N-iso-propylacetanilide), DCPA (dimethyl 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorotereph-thalate), and CDEC (2 -chloroallyl diethyl dithiocarbamate). Sindone (isomers of 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4, 6 -diisopropylindanyl ethyl ketone) was more effective on sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) and annual rye-grass (Lolium multiflorum) through shoot exposure than root exposure. Some herbicides are more effective on oats through root exposure. These included bromacil (5 -bromo- 3 -sec-butyl- 6 -methyluracil), R 11913,¹ Nia 11092 (1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -(3 -[N-tert-butylcarbamyloxy] phenyl) urea), pyrazon (5 -amino- 4 -chloro- 2 -phenyl- 3 [2 H]-pyridazinone), diuron (3 -[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 1 -dimethylurea), and atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropyl-amino-s-triazine). Dicamba (2 -methoxy- 3, 6 -dichlorobenzoic acid) and 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) were more effective on cucumber through root exposure than through shoot exposure. Some herbicides appear to be taken up differently by different plant species. R 11913 was more effective through shoot exposure on sugar beets and more effective through root exposure on oats. Atrazine proved more effective on oats through root exposure; however, with <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria viridis) and annual ryegrass, shoot exposure was more important when an untreated buffer layer was present between the seed and the treated zone. The possibility existed that a reduction in transpiration, caused by the plastic bag could affect the mode of uptake. In studies without the use of the plastic bag, atrazine was still more effective on oats through root exposure and more effective on <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> through shoot exposure. Irrigation in this study was accomplished through straws extended into each layer to minimize herbicide movement. We noticed that <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> produced secondary roots as early as five days after planting or two days after emergence. This indicated that these newly-formed secondary roots, as well as the emerging shoot, could absorb atrazine placed in the shoot region. When the buffer layer was removed and atrazine-treated soil was placed adjacent to the seed, placement immediately below the seed showed the greatest toxicity to both oats and <b>green</b> <b>foxtail.</b> This indicates the variation in sensitivity of plants by exposure to different parts of the seedling. Studies were conducted on varying placement positions of the herbicide as well as concentrations. From these studies, proximity to the seed was a major factor in increasing toxicity to oat seedlings by atrazine and EPTC, and to annual ryegrass seedlings by diuron. Atrazine was also more effective to <b>green</b> <b>foxtail</b> and annual ryegrass seedlings with increased proximity to the seed. A narrow concentrated layer was more effective than a wider dilute layer with diuron, atrazine, and EPTC when placed either above or below the seed. With atrazine and diuron, placement of the dilute wider layer completely around the seed was just as effective as the concentrated layer adjacent to the seed. With EPTC, a concentrated layer adjacent to the seed was more effective than a dilute layer completely around the seed. The effects of a constant temperature regime (24 C) was compared with a temperature regime with a low night temperature (27 C/ 13 C) in relation to uptake of EPTC, expressed by toxic action on oats. The temperature regime with a low night temperature caused a slight increase in toxicity to oats through shoot exposure, as well as through root exposure. However, the increase in uptake of EPTC through root exposure was considerably greater than through shoot exposure. ¹No chemical name available, an experimental herbicide of Stauffer Chemical Company...|$|E
