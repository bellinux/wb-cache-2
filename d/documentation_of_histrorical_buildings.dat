40|$|This study aims {{to gain an}} {{understanding}} on how researchers leave their mark on archaeological records and to discuss what this have meant {{for the production of}} archaeological knowledge. This was done by studying archival records from two archaeological excavations of boat graves in Valsgärde, which was held in 1936 and 1950. Starting with the relation between creator/researcher and records made the idea was to contribute with a study of the relationship between records and creator. The theories being used for analyzing this was intersectionality combined with Donna Haraways situated knowledges, where created interacting categories in the material was analyzed in relation to each researcher. Both researchers material where further discussed whis this in mind. The main method used was qualitative content analysis, wich were also combined with a quantitative method of the number of records created with the same content. Through these methods interacting categoriers was found in the archaeological documentation. The created interacting categories in one material consisted <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> archaeological remains in situ, <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> single finds and <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> archaeological stratigraphy. Further three interacting categories <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> after excavation, <b>of</b> weapons and single finds was found in the same material. In comparision, the other records consisted of interacting categories <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> archaeological remains in situ, <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> the contex of the findings and <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> archaeological stratigraphy. This showed how the reseachers in the studied records have left their marks on the archaeological <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> each boat grave. The researches had desicive impact on the produced knowledge that was based on their findings, since the records that were created were created were influenced by each researcher.
