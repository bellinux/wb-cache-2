60|$|After he {{has served}} his five years' apprenticeship, the Coolie has two courses before him. Either he can re-indenture himself to an employer, for not more than twelve months, which as a rule he does; or he can seek {{employment}} where he likes. At {{the end of a}} continuous residence of ten years in all, and at any period after that, he is entitled to a free passage back to Hindostan; or he may exchange his right to a free passage for a Government grant of ten acres of land. He has meanwhile, if he has been thrifty, grown rich. His wife walks about, at least on high-days, bedizened with jewels: nay, you may see her, even on work-days, hoeing in the cane-piece with heavy silver bangles hanging down over her little brown feet: and what wealth she does not carry on her arms, ankles, neck, and nostril, her husband has in the savings' bank. The ship Arima, as an instance,: took back 320 Coolies last year, of whom seven died on the voyage. These people carried with them 65,585 dollars; and one man, Heerah, handed over 6000 dollars for transmission through the Treasury, and was known to have about him 4000 more. This man, originally allotted to an estate, had, after serving out his <b>industrial</b> <b>contract,</b> resided in the neighbouring village of Savannah Grande as a shopkeeper and money-lender for the last ten years. Most of this money, doubtless, had been squeezed out of other Coolies by means not unknown to Europeans, as well as to Hindoos: but it must have been there to be squeezed out. And the new 'feeding ordinance' will, it is to be hoped, pare the claws of Hindoo and Chinese usurers.|$|E

In 1896 they created a company called <b>Industrial</b> <b>Contract</b> Corporation (Limited) with directors James Jackson (Chairman), Newton, Bailey and Burbidge. Mendel and André maintained control of the business by retaining founders' shares that gave them powers to override directors and shareholders. This new business became involved with the purchase and sale of a store in Clapham, London called Grice and Son. The purchase price was about £17,000 and the sale price £48,000. It transpired that the directors selling the business and those buying were the same individuals, {{but this was not}} declared on the prospectus nor was the profit they made from the deal. A dispute with the shareholder led to the prospects of a winding-up procedure in public court. This was avoided with a compromise agreed between the parties but Alfred Newton, who had just been elected Lord Mayor of London, asked for the case be re-opened so that the whole matter could be given a public hearing. [...] During the case, evidence was given that Mendel had written to several of the influential newspapers of the period, asking for favourable reviews of the flotation, and these letters were followed up with financial inducements.|$|E

The Shuttle Radar Lab is a combination of several radars: an L-band (1. 2 GHz) and a C-band (5. 3 GHz) multipolarization SAR known as SIR-C (Shuttle Imaging Radar); and an X-band (9. 6 GHz) vertically polarized SAR which will be operated synchronously over the same target areas to deliver calibrated multifrequency and multipolarization SAR data at multiple incidence angles from space. A joint German/Italian project office at DARA (German Space Agency) is responsible for the management of the X-SAR project. The space hardware has been developed and manufactured under <b>industrial</b> <b>contract</b> by Dornier and Alenia Spazio. Besides supporting all the technical and scientific tasks, DLR, in cooperation with ASI (Agencia Spaziale Italiano) is responsible for mission operation, calibration, and high precision SAR processing. In addition, DLR developed an airborne X-band SAR to support the experimenters with campaigns to prepare for the missions. The main advantage of adding a shorter wavelength (3 cm) radar to the SIR-C radars is the X-band radar's weaker penetration into vegetation and soil and its high sensitivity to surface roughness and associated phenomena. The performance of each of the three radars is comparable with respect to radiometric and geometric resolution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{financing}} patterns of R&D (research and experimental development) in Germany. Primarily it reflects the experiences of West Germany and the method of our analysis is based on expert interviews, of which most were carried out in December 1992. A twofold approach was followed. (1) Firstly, the structural framework of the German R&D system, and its financing, is described with a particular emphasis on the policy profiles of the DFG (German Research Society) and the BMFT (Federal Ministry of Research and Technology). Additionally, we also covered the latest trends in the financing of academic research. (2) Secondly, we aimed at three German success models for the financing of R&D. These are: - The Verbund-Research (Collaborative Research) of the BMFT: Within this scheme academic and industrial research partners are linked and the BMFT only partially finances those clusters (the threshold of financing for the BMFT is 50 Prozent). - The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (FhG/Fraunhofer Society) : The FhG, a non-university research network, has a mixed funding base, consisting of three components - public basic funding, public contract funding and private (<b>industrial)</b> <b>contract</b> funding. - The implementation of foundations: The two major German foundations, the Volkswagen Foundation (VW-Stiftung) and the Environment Foundation (Umwelt-Stiftung), originated from the privatization of public industrial ownership. The German foundations {{play a key role}} for the financing of R&D and developed, through a special policy profile, a division of labor with the public institutions (like the DFG and BMFT). ...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is divided}} in five sections. The first one {{concerns}} a bibliographical {{study of the}} actual iron loss measurement devices. A critical study of their own reliability has been developed to show the obvious incompatibility between the measured and real values met in rotating electrical machines. In the second section, we have used the measurement device realised in Marseilles for the characterisation of two kinds of electric alloys; one is French made and the other Japanese made. This work was under an <b>industrial</b> <b>contract</b> {{with a group of}} French motorists. How do they behave under rotating field conditions ? Is it possible to model the evolution of the power loss with respect to the different parameters ? All these questions lead us to achieve an experimental study. The third section deals with the principle of a new iron loss measurement method which tries {{to take into account the}} real working conditions of electrical machines. The geometry of the samples, the air gap field space distribution, the signal generated by the current source which feeds the machine, etc, are influential parameters for the iron loss. That needs a global approach of this problem. So, we have tried to design a new measurement device. The next section shows how to use the new acquisition system described in the previous section to represent the magnetic reluctance from an equivalent schema. Finally, the last section deals with an inverse problem used in other topics to solve the problem of the anisotropy which has never been treated in a satisfactory way. AIX-MARSEILLE 3 -BU Sc.

However, Si exhibits some important limitations regarding its voltage blocking capability, operation temperature and switching frequency. In this sense, Gallium Nitride (GaN) -based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) devices have the potential to make this change possible. The unique combination of the high-breakdown field, the high-channel electron mobility of the two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG), and high-temperature of operation has attracted enormous interest from social, academia and industry and in this context this PhD dissertation has been made. This thesis has focused on improving the device performance through the advanced design, fabrication and characterization of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, primarily grown on Si templates. The first milestone of this PhD dissertation has been the establishment of a know-how on GaN HEMT technology from several points of view: the device design, the device modeling, the process fabrication and the advanced characterization primarily using devices fabricated at Centre de Recherche sur l'Hétéro-Epitaxie (CRHEA-CNRS) (France) in the framework of a collaborative project. In this project, the main workhorse of this dissertation was the explorative analysis performed on the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs by innovative electrical and physical characterization methods. A relevant objective of this thesis was also to merge the nanotechnology approach with the conventional characterization techniques at the device scale to understand the device performance. A number of physical characterization techniques have been imaginatively used during this PhD determine the main physical parameters of our devices such as the morphology, the composition, the threading dislocations density, the nanoscale conductive pattern and others. The conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) tool have been widely described and used to understand the conduction mechanisms through the AlGaN/GaN Ohmic contact by performing simultaneously topography and electrical conductivity measurements. As it occurs with the most of the electronic switches, the gate stack is maybe the critical part of the device in terms of performance and longtime reliability. For this reason, how the AlGaN/GaN HEMT gate contact affects the overall HEMT behaviour by means of advanced characterization and modeling has been intensively investigated. It is worth mentioning that the high-temperature characterization is also a cornerstone of this PhD. It has been reported the elevated temperature impact on the forward and the reverse leakage currents for analogous Schottky gate HEMTs grown on different substrates: Si, sapphire and free-standing GaN (FS-GaN). The HEMT' forward-current temperature coefficients (T^a) as well as the thermal activation energies have been determined in the range of 25 - 300 ºC. Besides, the impact of the elevated temperature on the Ohmic and gate contacts has also been investigated. The main results of the gold-free AlGaN/GaN HEMTs high-voltage devices fabricated with a 4 inch Si CMOS compatible technology at the clean room of the CNM in the framework of the <b>industrial</b> <b>contract</b> with ON semiconductor were presented.
