25|$|It {{is thought}} {{that as a result}} of {{inflammation}} of the facial nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the stylomastoid foramen), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with <b>facial</b> <b>palsy</b> for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy per se. Possible causes include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves (sarcoidosis, brucellosis, etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the facial nerve. Babies can be born with <b>facial</b> <b>palsy.</b> In a few cases, bilateral <b>facial</b> <b>palsy</b> has been associated with acute HIV infection.|$|E

40|$|<b>Facial</b> nerve <b>palsy,</b> a {{very rare}} {{complication}} of Kawasaki syndrome, {{has been reported in}} only 25 patents. None of the 25 previous reported cases with this complication was treated with IVIG. We treated a 24 -month-old boy with bilateral coronary artery aneurysms due to Kawasaki syndrome. In our patient, whom we treated with Aspirin and IVIG, duration of disease was 7 - 9 days. He developed marked unilateral peripheral <b>facial</b> nerve <b>palsy</b> on day 3 of illness. This treatment led to complete resolution of <b>facial</b> nerve <b>palsy</b> within 48 hours. Review of pervious cases demonstrates that children with Kawasaki–associated <b>facial</b> nerve <b>palsy</b> have more than twice the risk for coronary artery aneurysm (52 % vs 25 %) as that of children without <b>facial</b> nerve <b>palsy.</b> Unexplained <b>facial</b> nerve <b>palsy</b> in young children with a prolonged febrile illness should provoke consideration of Kawasaki syndrome and Echocardiography to exclude coronary artery aneurysms.

25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} clinically based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as EM, <b>facial</b> <b>palsy,</b> or arthritis), or {{a history of}} possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as serological blood tests. The EM rash {{is not always a}} bull's eye, i.e., it can be solid red. When making a diagnosis of Lyme disease, health care providers should consider other diseases that may cause similar illnesses. Not all individuals infected with Lyme disease develop the characteristic bull's-eye rash, and many may not recall a tick bite.|$|E
25|$|Cephalic tetanus is {{the rarest}} {{form of the}} disease (0.9–3% of cases) and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head. It usually occurs after trauma to the head area, {{including}} skull fracture, laceration, eye injury, dental extraction, and otitis media, {{but it has been}} observed from injuries {{to other parts of the}} body. Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, <b>facial</b> <b>palsy,</b> or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected. Cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease. Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation and may not suspect tetanus as the illness. Treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection. Cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal, with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 15–30% case fatality rate.|$|E
500|$|Lesions of {{the facial}} nerve (VII) may {{manifest}} as <b>facial</b> <b>palsy.</b> This is where a person is unable to move the muscles on one or both sides of their face. A very common and generally temporary <b>facial</b> <b>palsy</b> is known as Bell's palsy. [...] Bell's Palsy is the result of an idiopathic (unknown), unilateral lower motor neuron lesion {{of the facial}} nerve and is characterized by an inability to move the ipsilateral muscles of facial expression, including elevation of the eyebrow and furrowing of the forehead. [...] Patients with Bell's palsy often have a drooping mouth on the affected side and often have trouble chewing because the buccinator muscle is affected.|$|E

2500|$|Facial Synkinesis is {{a common}} sequela to Idiopathic Facial Nerve Paralysis, also called Bell’s Palsy or <b>Facial</b> <b>Palsy.</b> Bell’s Palsy, which is thought to occur due to a viral {{reactivation}} which can lead (through unknown mechanisms) to diffuse axon demyelination and degeneration of the seventh cranial nerve, results in a hemifacial paralysis due to non-functionality of the nerve. As the nerve attempts to recover, nerve miswiring results (see Mechanism of Action below). In patients with severe facial nerve paralysis, facial synkinesis will inevitably develop.|$|E

2500|$|Mime {{therapy was}} {{introduced}} in the Netherlands in 1980. It was initially designed to treat <b>facial</b> <b>palsy</b> by improving symmetry of the face both at rest and during movement. It was then later observed that people who had post-facial palsy synkinesis also benefited from this therapy. It wasn’t until 2003 that Beurskens and Heymans were able to experimentally conclude that mime therapy was indeed a good treatment choice for synkinesis. Furthermore, later studies by Beurskens et al. have shown that benefits obtained from mime therapy are stable one year after therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Botox (botulinum toxin) {{is a new}} and {{versatile}} tool {{for the treatment of}} synkinesis. Initially used for reducing hyperkinesis after <b>facial</b> <b>palsy,</b> Botox was later attempted on patients with post-facial palsy synkinesis to reduce unwanted movements. The effects of Botox have shown to be remarkable, with synkinetic symptoms disappearing within 2 or 3 days. The most common treatment targets are the orbicularis oculi, depressor anguli oris (DAO), mentalis, platysma and the contralateral depressor labii inferioris muscles. Due to the short span of Botox effects though, patients must come back to the doctor for re-injection approximately every 3 months. More notable is that in a majority of patients, various synkinetic movements completely disappeared after 2-3 sessions of trimonthly Botox injections.|$|E
2500|$|Various acute {{neurological}} problems, termed neuroborreliosis, {{appear in}} 10–15% of untreated people. These include <b>facial</b> <b>palsy,</b> {{which is the}} loss of muscle tone on one or both sides of the face, as well as meningitis, which involves severe headaches, neck stiffness, and sensitivity to light. Inflammation of the spinal cord's nerve roots can cause shooting pains that may interfere with sleep, as well as abnormal skin sensations. Mild encephalitis may lead to memory loss, sleep disturbances, or mood changes. In addition, some case reports have described altered mental status as the only symptom seen in a few cases of early neuroborreliosis. [...] The disease may adversely impact the heart's electrical conduction system and can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as atrioventricular block.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} otitis externa, MOE requires oral or intravenous antibiotics for cure. Pseudomonas is {{the most}} common offending pathogen. [...] Diabetes control is also an essential part of treatment. [...] When MOE goes unrecognized and untreated, the infection continues to smolder and over weeks or months can spread deeper into the head and involve the bones of the skull base, constituting skull base osteomyelitis (SBO). Multiple cranial nerve palsies can result, including the facial nerve (causing <b>facial</b> <b>palsy),</b> the recurrent laryngeal nerve (causing vocal cord paralysis) , and the cochlear nerve (causing deafness). The infecting organism is almost always pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it can instead be fungal (aspergillus or mucor). MOE and SBO are not amenable to surgery, but exploratory surgery may facilitate the culture of unusual organism(s) that are not responding to empirically used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (ciprofloxacin being the drug of choice). [...] The usual surgical finding is diffuse cellulitis without localized abscess formation. [...] SBO can extend into the petrous apex of the temporal bone or more inferiorly into {{the opposite side of the}} skull base.|$|E
