40|$|Stroke is a {{cardiovascular}} disease {{that results in}} the abnormal blood supply to the brain either by the lack thereof (i. e., ischemia), or hemorrhage, both causing a rapidly developing loss of brain function. It affects millions of people worldwide, resulting in long-term disability and death. This work {{is an effort to}} reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with stroke through the implementation of shape memory materials in the design of medical devices used in its treatment and prevention. Shape memory materials have the ability to recover predetermined deformation upon exposure to stimuli such as heat. These volume changing capabilities make them excellent candidate materials for stroke interventions. Such interventions require the accessing of blood vessels in the brain, which over the past fifty years has shifted from a direct surgical approach, to less invasive endovascular procedures. The majority of this work is devoted to developing an endovascular thrombectomy device for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. This device evolves from a SMP-based device into a hybrid device made of a combination of SMP foam and nitinol. The respective increase in success rate of thrombus removal in a bench-top model was from 67 % to 100 %. This hybrid device is then tested in a porcine model, in which it is able to restore blood flow in an artery occluded with a thrombus nearly 3 times its working length. In addition to being utilized as a component of the hybrid thrombectomy device, SMP foam is being investigated as an embolic aneurysm filler for the prevention of hemorrhagic stroke because of its flow arresting properties. The rest of this dissertation deals with the characterization of such properties through the implementation of porous media theory. A system is constructed for the measurement of the porous media properties of SMP foam as well as coils mimicking the geometry of <b>embolic</b> <b>coils,</b> which are the state-of-the-art treatment of aneurysms. Results show that SMP foams impose a higher resistance to fluid flow compared to mock <b>embolic</b> <b>coils,</b> suggesting that aneurysms treated with SMP foams will have flow conditions more favorable for blood stasis than those treated with <b>embolic</b> <b>coils...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Histologic {{findings}} in 71 elastase-induced rabbit aneurysms embolized with platinum coils were retrospectively reviewed.

We present the histologic findings and offer potential explanations for these observations. These findings may be relevant in understanding mechanisms of aneurysm healing after coil embolization. Since the development of the Guglielmi detachable coil(Boston Scientific, Natick,Mass), platinum coil emboliza-tion has become widely accepted as a valuable alternative to open surgery for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.

40|$|There {{has been}} a surge of {{interest}} in endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) strategies for advanced COPD. Valve <b>implants,</b> <b>coil</b> <b>implants,</b> biological LVR (BioLVR), bronchial thermal vapour ablation, and airway stents are used to induce lung deflation with {{the ultimate goal of}} improving respiratory mechanics and chronic dyspnea. Patients presenting with severe air trapping (e. g., inspiratory capacity/total lung capacity (TLC) 225 % predicted) and thoracic hyperinflation (TLC > 150 % predicted) have the greatest potential to derive benefit from ELVR procedures. Pre-LVRS or ELVR assessment should ideally include cardiological evaluation, high resolution CT scan, ventilation and perfusion scintigraphy, full pulmonary function tests, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. ELVR procedures are currently available in selected Canadian research centers as part of ethically approved clinical trials. If a decision is made to offer an ELVR procedure, one-way valves are the first option in the presence of complete lobar exclusion and no significant collateral ventilation.

40|$|In this paper, by {{analyzing}} the effects of two different kinds of implant-abutment connection interfaces under the same working condition on the mechanical and fatigue performances of the <b>implant</b> <b>system</b> {{as well as on}} the surrounding bones, we intend to study such effects on the reliability of the implants and provide a theoretical basis for the design and clinical application of dental <b>implant</b> <b>systems.</b> For the purpose, we adopt a 3 -D modeling method to establish the model, and use FEA (finite element analysis) to carry out static mechanic and fatigue analysis on the <b>implant</b> <b>system</b> and its surrounding bones; then we make the two <b>implant</b> <b>systems,</b> and carry out fatigue tests on a dynamic fatigue testing machine to verify the FEA results.

All groups had prosthetic revisions and complications according to the CIP-scale. The majority of the patients in the endosseous implant groups were subject to minor complications. The CIP-score of the Transmandibular Implant group is significantly higher than the scores of the other groups, because of the high number of lost posts.

40|$|Introduction: Precise {{fit between}} implant {{components}} {{is an important}} factor for successful implant treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine microleakage of Biohorizons, Implantium and Swiss Plus <b>implant</b> <b>systems.</b> Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 5 implant fixtures from 3 <b>implant</b> <b>systems</b> were subjected to dye penetration test. One µL of 0. 1 % Toluidine blue solution was injected into implant fixtures using an electronic pipette. The corresponding abutments were subsequently screwed onto the implants with a torque of 30 N. Implant‒abutment complexes were placed in 2 mL of distilled water. The amount of leakage of Toluidine blue (TB) was measured by a spectrophotometer at 630 nm at 1 -, 3 -, 6 -, 24 -, 48 -, 72 -, 96 -, 144 -, 192 - and 240 -hour intervals after incubation. Calibration curve and a linear equation were obtained by Excel software. Data were analyzed with SPSS 11. 5 using ANOVA (α = 0. 05). Results: In the three <b>implant</b> <b>systems</b> evaluated microleakage was only statistically significant at hours 1 (p value = 0. 01), 3 (p value = 0. 011) and 6 (p value = 0. 000).

40|$|Aims—To {{present the}} short and {{intermediate}} term results of coil occlusion of persistent ductus arteriosus {{and the results of}} radiographic measurements of spring <b>coils</b> <b>implanted</b> to treat patent ducts.  Patients— 22 children underwent coil occlusion. Their ages ranged from 2  years 9  months to 12  years 10  months (mean (SD) age, 6. 5  (3. 6) years). The duct diameter ranged from 1. 0  to 3. 5  mm at the narrowest point (mean 2. 6  (0. 7) mm). In 11  of the children regular <b>coils</b> were <b>implanted</b> using the non-attached system, while in the other 11  the detachable coil embolisation system was used.  Results— 12 children (55 %) had no significant residual leaks immediately after procedures involving a single coil delivery. The remaining 10  (45 %) had residual leaks immediately after the procedure, although no patient with a large duct showed residual leakage 18  months after the procedure. Radiographic measurement of the coils showed that all <b>implanted</b> <b>coils</b> retracted to 65 - 85 % of their original size immediately after occlusion.

Axial and oblique loads of 100 were applied to all models. Results: While the pattern of stress distribution was similar for both loading situations, oblique loading resulted in higher intensity and greater distribution of stress than axial loading in both cortical bone and abutment-implant interface. Stress distribution at peri-implant bone was almost identical with similar magnitudes for all six models. In both <b>implant</b> <b>systems,</b> platform switching models demonstrated lower maximum von Mises stress in cortical bone than conventional models.
