5|$|On {{a normal}} afternoon, Marge wants Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie {{to go for}} a walk. They agree when faced with the threat of having to talk to each other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British {{entrepreneur}} Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help <b>him</b> <b>be</b> loved by all.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen <b>him</b> <b>be</b> deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E

5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by <b>him)</b> <b>be</b> treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E
5|$|Megan {{receives}} backlash from Kate for {{not following}} procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes that Joe found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was getting too close to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave <b>him</b> <b>be.</b> Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E
5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder {{is written}} from the {{viewpoints}} of main character Chihaya Kisakinomiya and secondary character Kaoruko Nanahara. Futari no Elder begins {{about two years}} after Mizuho's graduation. The main protagonist Chihaya Mikado was truant at his school because of harassment {{in the school and}} of a distrust in men. His mother cannot bear to watch <b>him</b> <b>be</b> in trouble, so she makes him transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, her old school. He dresses as a girl and introduces himself as Chihaya Kisakinomiya. Chihaya meets another protagonist Kaoruko Nanahara, who once rescued him from a playboy, and he begins to live in the dormitory building. He becomes the focus of public attention due to his attractive face and figure, and due to high grades at studies.|$|E

Lotterer twice went onto the track and improved his first lap time by 0.116 seconds to 1:55.114, while Fässler {{was unable to find}} a rhythm, and could not improve on his co-driver's fastest time, restricting them to qualifying fourth. Duval and di Grassi took fifth place with the latter stating that the team was not happy with the No. 8 car's setup, and that overnight work had to be undertaken. Davidson and Buemi held fifth place until di Grassi and Duval's lap times demoted them to sixth. Conway and Sarrazin secured seventh with the latter saying that he was held up by slower cars on his two timed laps. Albuquerque and Rast filled the grid's fourth row by qualifying eighth ahead of the No. 4 Team ByKolles car.|$|E
5|$|Thompson auditioned in 2006 for {{the role}} of Cameron McIntyre in the long-standing British soap opera Coronation Street. The part would have had <b>him</b> <b>be</b> {{on-screen}} friends with Chesney Brown, played by Sam Aston, who Thompson already knew from the Carol Godby Theatre Workshop. Producers for Coronation Street, however, were so impressed by Thompson that they asked him to audition for a different role. His try-out was successful and he was given a six-month contract, along with the option to extend it for up to a year. He was cast as Ryan Connor, a boy who moves to Weatherfield—the fictional Greater Manchester setting of Coronation Street—with his mother, Michelle (played by actress and former Hear'Say band member Kym Marsh), and her brothers, Liam (Rob James-Collier) and Paul (Sean Gallagher). The Bolton News reported that Thompson would spend between one and two days in front of the camera, and that he would be given an on-set tutor to help complete his school work.|$|E
5|$|In 1173 HenryII betrothed his {{youngest}} son, Prince John, to {{the daughter of}} Count Humbert, an influential lord in Provence. John had no land, {{but as part of}} the arrangement Henry promised him the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau. HenryII's eldest son, also called Henry, had been crowned King of England alongside his father but had no land of his own and was angered by the situation. His discontent grew and Henry the Young King demanded some of the land promised to <b>him</b> <b>be</b> handed over, claiming to have the support of the English barons and his father-in-law, King LouisVII of France. While the king was at Limoges he was informed of a conspiracy involving his wife and sons to overthrow him. Choosing to keep his eldest son by his side, HenryII set off north to Normandy, ensuring along the way that his castles in Aquitaine were prepared for war. En route they stayed at Chinon; under the cover of darkness Henry the Young King escaped and set off to Paris to join the court of LouisVII. Two of Henry the Young King's brothers, Richard and Geoffrey, joined him in rebellion along with the barons of France and some in England. War followed, lasting until 1174, and Chinon, Loudun, and Châtellerault were key to HenryII's defence.|$|E

Gaara fights Deidara to protect the village, but is defeated. The members of the Akatsuki then kidnap him and extract Shukaku from his body. Gaara dies in the process, his body being recovered by Naruto and Kakashi Hatake. Chiyo sacrifices her own life to revive Gaara after coming to acknowledge Naruto and Sakura Haruno's resolve. Sometime later, he goes to the Five Kage Summit, where the Akatsuki's leader Tobi, breaks into the meeting and announces the Fourth Great Ninja War to capture the last two Tailed-Beasts. Gaara later joins the new Shinobi Alliance as its field commander to protect Naruto and Killer Bee, using Naruto's philosophy of love and the Akatsuki's philosophy of hatred to unite the army when it nearly imploded from internal conflict. On {{the second day of the}} war, Gaara encounters his reanimated father. Rasa reveals the truth to Gaara that his uncle's final action was his doing and that the truth that Gaara's mother always loved him, moving Gaara to tears after learning his mother's will is the force behind his sand. Rasa recognizes his son has surpassed him and entrusts Sunagakure to him after being defeated. Gaara later defeats and seals the revived Second Mizukage and joins the rest of the five Kage to fight the Madara Uchiha who was reanimated by Kabuto, nearly getting killed as a result. Later healed by Tsunade, Gaara departs with the other Kage to site of their side's battle with Tobi. Before watching <b>him</b> <b>be</b> absorbed by the Gedo Statue again, Gaara manages to make his peace with Shukaku while thanking the tailed beast for ensuring that he would meet Naruto.
