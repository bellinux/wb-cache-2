25|$|Issues {{of gender}} {{equality}} in education {{have been the}} subject of much debate during the past decades and have become a prominent topic of debate in all countries. In Nigeria, there are large disparities between the education that boys and girls receive. Many girls do not have access to adequate education past a certain age. Currently, the female adult literacy rate (ages 15 and above) for the country was 59.4% in comparison to the male adult literacy rate of 74.4%. It is differences in education that have led to this gap in literacy. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria the gender gap in literacy rates at the rural level between boys and girls was 18.3 percent in favour of the boys overall. However, in the age group 6–9 years (primary school ages) it was only 3.9 percent in favour of boys. This indicates that there is a <b>gender</b> <b>dimension</b> to educational attainment and development in Nigeria. According to the Examination Council of Nigeria (1994) there are still other problems, such as high drop-out rates of females students, poor performance, reluctance on the part of females students to enroll in science-based courses and poor classroom participation Across various geo-political delineations in Nigeria, a greater percentage of school-age girls are needlessly out-of-school, compared with the ratio applicable to boys of same age grouping.|$|E

40|$|Several EU policy {{papers have}} called for an {{improved}} dialogue between security policymakers, social science researchers and science and technology researchers working on security (Pullinger, 2006). To increase the understanding of <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> in security, the traditional technological response can be complemented by socio-political knowledge. Gender inequities in the socio-economic and political spheres can be analysed by such a comprehensive socio-political and technological approach. In the field of geo-spatial security research, Hyndman (2004) proposes to bridge a gap between gender studies and geographical analysis of security. In this paper, a workshop is used to illustrate both the potential and the difficulties of such a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach. The workshop aim was to define a geographical and spatial analysis of <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> in security. This paper discusses the <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> in geo-spatial analysis, {{as well as the}} pros and cons of an interdisciplinary approach. Integrating the overall complexity of <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> as a spatial component in security monitoring is a promising challenge, but is still to be achieved by the technological community.

40|$|Our {{topic and}} our {{approach}} The {{purpose of this}} chapter is to construct a framework for understanding the <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> of post-conflict reconstruction (PCR), in order to strengthen assessments, project design, and policy-formulation – all {{with the aim of}} achieving the overarching goals of sustainable peace, participation and prosperity. Based on our experiences working with and reviewing projects in post-conflict settings, this chapter suggests <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> that may strengthen programmes, promote gender equality, and enhance returns on PCR investments. It is predicated on the conviction that building and maintaining peace and prosperity requires attention to gender roles and relations in the post-conflict arena. To illustrate the <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions,</b> we use examples from the World Bank and other donors, including a sample of the Bank’s large post-conflict reconstruction development loans and its small post-conflict fund (PCF) grants. While many of these examples confirm our concern that policy-makers have been slow to employ gender analysis and focus, some cases illustrate the kind of gender-sensitive approaches that we advocate...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} report on <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> of agricultural and rural employment. There's no debate {{about the importance of}} women for rural economic growth and poverty reduction. They fill many crucial roles, as farmers, wage labourers and small-scale entrepreneurs, as well as caretakers of children and the elderly. Rural women have the potential to lift their households and communities out of poverty. But they are hampered by persistent gender inequities that limit their access to decent work, which they need as a vehicle for economic empowerment, social advancement and political participation. Policymakers and researchers seeking to respond to this situation are hindered by gaps in data and analysis. Recognition of this need led our three agencies to organize a technical workshop on the <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> of rural employment, held 31 March to 2 April 2009. It sought answers to important but rarely addressed questions: What do we know exactly about the <b>gender</b> <b>dimensions</b> of agricultural and non-farm rural employment? What are the gaps in data and research? Are there examples of good practices {{that could be used to}} address gender inequalities through national policies?

50|$|In 1995 in the Human Development Report {{commissioned}} by the United Nations Development Program set-out to create two new measurement indices for measuring development. Their aim was {{to add to the}} Human Development Index by way of including a <b>gender</b> <b>dimension</b> in the measure. They were created in order to rival the traditional income-focused measures of development such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Gross National Product (GNP). Mahbub ul Haq, the first director of the Human Development Report Office, established several principles for the newly emerging measure including provisions {{that it had to be}} simple, had to be represented as a single number, had to be easily calculated, had to yield numbers that were internationally comparable, had to use numbers available on a yearly basis and had to use numbers that were easily interpretable. The resulting measures that were created were the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM). The GEM, the more specialized of the two, is focused on indicating the relative empowerment of women in a given country.|$|E
5000|$|The need to {{integrate}} gender into SSR processes was recognised {{at the international}} level in 2008 by then-United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report on SSR, where he stated that: [...] "...the integration of a gender perspective in security sector reform is inherent to an inclusive and socially responsive approach to security. Gender-sensitive security sector reform", he went on, [...] "is key to developing security sector institutions that are non-discriminatory, representative of the population and capable of effectively responding to the specific security needs of diverse groups." [...] Since the release of this report, the number of SSR programmes incorporating a <b>gender</b> <b>dimension</b> has increased dramatically, as has the amount of academic literature available and the number of specialists working in the area. Gender dimensions are often included in SSR processes as part of a country's commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) (UNSCR 1325), which calls for wider female participation in all aspects of post-conflict reconstruction and for more consideration of the specific needs of women and girls. For example, Liberia's National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 makes provisions for strengthening the capacity of the SSR desk at the Ministry for Gender and Development.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} a rise of [...] "Islamism" [...] in Muslim {{northern}} Sudan since 1971, and particularly its <b>gender</b> <b>dimension,</b> is meaningful. [...] According to Sondra Hale, {{there are a variety}} of goals and strategies that this rise of Islam includes. These are: to manipulate religious ideology toward a more [...] "authentic" [...] culture, to represent, reiterate, or reinforce the centrality of women within that [...] "authentic" [...] culture, to create a new trend in the gender division of labor or to stem recent changes within that labor system, and to purge from an [...] "authentic" [...] women's culture particular non-Islamic customs that [...] "weaken the morals" [...] of women. [...] In 1989 there was a consolidation of Islamist power that changed the [...] "formal and informal national and local debates" [...] about gender, law, and labor. [...] The government of Sudan wanted to appear more modern and propagandized women's education and work participation. [...] Before this, there was more direct involvement of the Sudanese government by the mosque of Islam. Since 1989, Islam is still very influential but the Sudanese government has made attempts of modernization. According to Afshar however, her studies indicate that it is the ideologies of male supremacy rather than any specific religion that affects women's lives more directly.|$|E

The topic of gender is generally missing from MPA management analyses. A mixed-methods qualitative approach was used. Results indicate that women played a significant role in MPA site selection and management, especially the enforcement of MPA policies and livelihood generation. Further implications for MPA management are that 1) changing gender roles and responsibilities has social equity outcomes, 2) action by gender-progressive individuals enabled women's empowerment, 3) local context can override gender-mainstreaming policies, and 4) a lack of gender considerations in MPA management can undermine long-term success...|$|R

50|$|Recommendation 142Experts {{recognised}} that girls, including adolescent girls, {{and young}} women are often excluded from, or ‘squeezed into,’ interventions which are focussed on adult women, on boys and young men, or on children in a gender-neutral way. Experts concluded that an emphasis on prevention work specifically tailored to the needs, experiences and aspirations of girls,adolescent girls {{and young women}} is urgently needed; acknowledging {{the complexities of the}} current landscape that they are required to negotiate. Experts made the following recommendations to States, women’s and civil society organisations, international and regional institutions, public and private sectors, as appropriate:Develop, implement and monitor tailored prevention activity with adolescent girls and young women that takes an empowerment, not protection, approach, and explicitly address their needs and rights, informed by the voices of adolescent girls and young women themselves. The onus is often placed on girls and young women to avoid / stop violence from happening to them rather than on developing widespread and embedded activities which challenge the social norms that permeate their lives. Prevention programmes should therefore address what is happening around young people (e.g. social pressures, media messaging and so forth) rather than purely on helping young women to ‘manage’ their adolescence (and the risks of violence this is assumed to entail) more effectively.Support all adolescents and young people {{to understand the nature of}} consent and coercion, and the impact of social and environmental factors on individual ability to truly provide consent (e.g. with key messages such as ‘your yes is only as good as your ability to say no’). The issue of consent, and especially sexual consent, is complex and is widely misunderstood among many adults. Yet adolescent girls and young women are often expected to be able to negotiate this difficult terrain which is focussed exclusively on the nature of a ‘no’ rather than the expectation that what is required is a strong, enthusiastic ‘yes’. This in turn reinforces notions of female passivity (the object of pursuit) and male aggressor (the pursuer). Such activities would have relevance to a number of areas from teen relationships to forced marriage.Ensure a <b>gender</b> <b>dimension</b> is incorporated into multi-sectoral legislative, policy and programmatic development to prevent (and respond to) violence against children, taking into account the specific needs, vulnerabilities and voices of girls of all ages.|$|E
