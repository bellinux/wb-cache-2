We report here the identification of several proteins whose secretion into the culture supernatant of S. typhimurium is dependent on the function of the inv-encoded translocation apparatus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the genes encoding two of these secreted proteins, SipB and SipC, indicated that they are homologous to the Shigella sp. <b>invasins</b> IpaB and IpaC, respectively. An additional gene was identified, sicA, which encodes a protein homologous to IpgC, a Shigella protein that serves as a molecular chaperone for the <b>invasins</b> IpaB and IpaC. Nonpolar mutations in sicA, sipB, and sipC rendered S. typhimurium unable to enter cultured epithelial cells, indicating that these genes are required for bacterial internalization.

For most species, including the etiological agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis, infection requires active host-cell invasion dependent on formation of a tight junction – the organising interface between parasite and host cell during entry. Formation of this structure is not, however, shared across all Apicomplexa or indeed all parasite lifecycle stages. Here, using an in silico integrative genomic search and endogenous gene-tagging strategy, we sought to characterise proteins that function specifically during junction-dependent invasion, a class of proteins we term <b>invasins</b> to distinguish them from adhesins that function in species specific host-cell recognition.

Integrin binding has been localized to the extracellular region of <b>invasin</b> (Inv 497) comprised by the COOH-terminal 497 residues. In order to gain insight into host cell entry by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, we solved the 2. 3 Šcrystal structure of Inv 497.

Induction of iNOS in response to Salmonella infection has been demonstrated, but the bacterial effector molecules that regulate expression of the enzyme have not been identified. In the study reported here, an analysis of Salmonella-dependent iNOS expression in macrophages was carried out. Wild-type Salmonella strains increased the levels of both iNOS protein and mRNA in murine macrophage cell lines in an invasion-independent fashion.

In keeping with this idea, a mutant strain deficient in SopE 2, a recently described homolog of SopE, was found to be impaired in the induction of iNOS expression.

Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome: Listeria monocytogenes can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called listeriolysin O and phospholipase C.|$|R
40|$|Mucormycosis is a {{life-threatening}} infection caused by Mucorales fungi. Here we sequence 30 fungal genomes, and perform transcriptomics with three representative Rhizopus and Mucor strains and with human airway epithelial cells during fungal invasion, to reveal key host and fungal determinants contributing to pathogenesis. Analysis {{of the host}} transcriptional response to Mucorales reveals platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB) signaling {{as part of a}} core response to divergent pathogenic fungi; inhibition of PDGFRB reduces Mucorales-induced damage to host cells. The unique presence of CotH <b>invasins</b> in all invasive Mucorales, and the correlation between CotH gene copy number and clinical prevalence, are consistent with an important role for these proteins in mucormycosis pathogenesis. Our work provides insight into the evolution of this medically and economically important group of fungi, and identifies several molecular pathways that might be exploited as potential therapeutic targets. 27447865 PMC 496184...|$|R
