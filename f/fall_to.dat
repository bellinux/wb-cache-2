5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

His envoys, however, were obstructed by George Palaiologos and never reached Melissenos. Constantinople fell to the Komnenian forces, and on 8 April 1081, Melissenos too entered the imperial capital. True to his word, Alexios I raised him to Caesar and gave him authority over Thessalonica, as well as allotting the city's revenues to his income. At the same time, however, Alexios raised his brother Isaac Komnenos to the newly created dignity of sebastokrator, which he placed above that of Caesar, bypassing Melissenos.|$|E

Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus.

This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> the base of the plant.|$|E
