5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the station {{is at the bottom}} of the station approach, a ramp off the bridge that carries Fishergate over the railway. The ticket office exists within the small concourse. This concourse gives direct access, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> to the intercity platforms 3 and 4. There are footbridges on either side of this ramp to all other platforms. The eastern footbridge ends at an alternative {{entrance to the}} station on Butler Street, giving closer access to Preston city centre and the station car park. There also exists a subway which provides step-free access to all eight platforms in use at the station and with platform 7, at the south end of which is another entrance serving the station car park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. The match began with Angle and Cena locking up, leading to Angle taking Cena {{down with a}} {{headlock}} takeover. Cena countered many attacks by Angle {{and was able to}} reverse the ankle lock. Cena attempted an FU but Angle delivered an Angle Slam. Eric Bischoff came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> and cheered for Angle, who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena. Cena rolled out of the move, grabbed the championship belt, which Bischoff had brought with him, and hit Angle with it. The referee saw this and called for the bell. As a result, Cena was disqualified for hitting Angle with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, Angle attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on Angle.|$|E
25|$|The ramp {{entrance}} {{is known as}} one of the most highly regarded traditions among band members, as well as extremely physically demanding. The ramp entrance starts typically around 19:45 on the countdown clock. There is a trailer video shown on the scoreboard prior to the band emerging from the ramp tunnel. At the end of this video, a Diamond Ohio appears on the screen. This is the cue for the percussion section to start <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp.</b>|$|E

Upon arrival at the stadium, it was alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham's stage crew {{out of the way as}} the band entered the stadium via a backstage ramp. Tension had been simmering between Graham's staff and Led Zeppelin's security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> near {{the end of the}} concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to heavy}} seas and {{the fog of}} battle, Lomell’s landing craft arrived thirty-five minutes late, away from its mark, and lost any element of surprise. Those who made it <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> or over the side had to swim inland about 20 feet. As Lomell was {{bringing}} in a box of rope and a hand-projector rocket, he {{was wounded in the}} side by a machine-gun bullet, but reached shore without pausing. First Sergeant Lomell {{reached the top of the}} cliff through the use of two ladders, and along with eleven other men from his landing craft, moved off of the edge of the cliff.|$|E
500|$|Sharma {{was raised}} in Bangalore. She was educated at the Army School there, and {{received}} a degree in arts from Mount Carmel College. She originally intended {{to pursue a career}} in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress. After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career. She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa. In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection. Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio. Sharma later said, [...] "I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> and smile and they used to say, ‘give us a blank look.’ It was really difficult, not to smile". Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles. Her first role was of an extra in the comedy drama Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006).|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Dyson {{created a}} {{realisation}} of the optical illusions {{depicted in the}} lithographs of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task {{after a year of}} work, creating a water sculpture in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of <b>the</b> next <b>ramp.</b> <b>The</b> creation titled Wrong Garden, was displayed at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003. The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath <b>the</b> transparent glass <b>ramps</b> to a slit at the top from which the bulk of <b>the</b> water cascades <b>down.</b> This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> in a thin layer.|$|R
25|$|Large {{circular}} ramps {{on either}} side of <b>the</b> stage led <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> basement, which was designed for the building of sets.

2500|$|During the {{introduction}} and verse of [...] "Buckeye Battle Cry", the drum major enters the stadium running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> then struts through {{the band and}} comes {{to the front of}} the ranks where they execute a back bend, forming their body into the shape of an O. After a dramatic pause, the drum major’s plume touches the turf while the band starts to play two choruses of the Buckeye Battle Cry while marching toward the South Stands. The drum major reaches the end zone and tosses the baton through the goal post as the band finishes the downfield march. The opposing team's fight song is played as a salute to their university returning the band to midfield before completing the pregame performance which typically includes the highly acclaimed Script Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{extremely}} {{young or}} physically challenged players may use {{both hands to}} swing the ball forward from in between their legs. This kind of style has the bowler start close to the foul line, and is called the [...] "Granny style" [...] (after its similarity to the [...] "granny shot" [...] in amateur basketball) or the [...] "Pee-Wee method". In recent years, the new two-handed [...] "shovel" [...] style hook release is gaining more popularity, as it generates more revolutions and speed to knock down pins. Another method for novice bowlers is the [...] "bounce pass" [...] technique which is performed by thrusting the ball from your chest with two hands towards the pins. This technique is easily picked up by weaker players but is seldom used because it is frowned upon by the bowling community {{because of the potential}} to damage the lanes and/or ball. Some middle aged bowlers use the ramp in which a bowler will use two hands and push the ball <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> onto the lane.|$|E
