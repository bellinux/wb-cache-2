40|$|The {{invention}} {{refers to}} a mechanical combustion-engine-driven fluid pump (10) comprising an input shaft (20) which is directly driven by the combustion engine (12), a pumping unit (18) with a pump rotor (19), and a clutch (16) between the input shaft and the pump rotor, the clutch comprises an input clutch body (24) and an output clutch body (22) and transfers {{the rotation of the}} input clutch body to the output clutch body in the engaged clutch state.

50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To disengage the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the <b>engaged</b> <b>position.</b> Thus, <b>engaging</b> the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to disengage the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes to disengage the safety.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} oil flow through a multi plate clutch for a hydro-mechanical {{variable}} transmission under actual operating conditions. The analysis {{focuses on the}} numerical approach for the accurate prediction of the transient behavior of the lubrication in the gear region: the trade-off between prediction capabilities of the numerical model and computational effort is addressed. The numerical simulation includes the full 3 D geometry of the clutch and the VOF multi-phase approach {{is used to calculate}} the oil distribution in the clutch region under different relative rotating velocities. Furthermore, the lubrication of the friction disks is calculated for different clutch actuation conditions, i. e. not-engaged and <b>engaged</b> <b>positions.</b> The influence of different geometrical features of the clutch lubricating circuit on the oil distribution is also determined. The results show the areas where poor lubrication occurs and extend the experiments where measurements are difficult to carry out.

50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights {{in the body of the}} drive unit. When the starter motor begins turning and the drive unit is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the <b>engaged</b> <b>position.</b> Only once the drive unit is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven drive unit to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|R

40|$|Mechanically {{activated}} transducer {{channels in}} cochlear outer hair cells (OHC's) transduce sound encoded mechanical signals into electrical signals. Entry of extracellular Ca 2 + through these channels modulates transduction by reducing their open probability, a phenomenon called adaptation [1]. Analysis {{of the mechanical}} and electrical characteristics of the transducer channels in OHC's {{has shown that the}} transducer channel's open probability can be adequately described by a differentially activating two-state model [2]. Also a direct relationship was demonstrated between the gating spring stiffness (K-s) and the accuracy (sigma(min) = 2 kT/[K-s D] = 5. 4 nm, where D is the distance between the <b>engaging</b> <b>positions</b> of the closed and open conformational state) with which hair bundle position can be detected as a result of intrinsic channel stochastics. In combination with an assumed Ca 2 +-dependent gating spring stiffness [e. g. 3], we predict {{on the basis of the}} two-state model that at endolymphatic Ca 2 + concentrations (similar to 20 mu M) an improved accuracy (alpha(min) similar to 3 nm) can be attained at the equilibrium position of the hair bundle...|$|R
40|$|Untangling {{the various}} {{approaches}} to language teaching and their history, Gerdi Quist maps recent thinking in language studies at university. Using an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, drawn from educational philosophy, cultural studies, intercultural studies and language pedagogy, the author discusses the many tensions and currents in contemporary language teaching. The author puts forward an alternative pedagogy, {{that of a}} cultuurtekst-perspective, which engages learners at complex linguistic and cultural levels. In discussing the case study in which this approach is tested, the author develops her argument for embracing various critical perspectives through the personal engagement of students. From the start the author acknowledges her own <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> as a language teacher in a liberal humanistic educational environment. She adopts a self -critical perspective through which her engagement with adverse student reaction leads to deepening insights both for the author and her students {{as part of the}} non-linear process of learning.

Recent publications included a book chapter and journal articles on language pedagogy and intercultural communication. (DOI: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} an introduction and context {{for this section}} of Against the Day, which analyzes the ongoing protests in Russia. The mainstream interpretations of Russian events create a stereotypical picture formed by liberal narratives as a struggle with an authoritarian regime waged by a rising urban middle class. The goal of the essays here is to challenge this view and demonstrate a different and radical perspective on the process. This introduction stresses several points important for understanding the protests: the prolonged effects of privatization and neoliberal “shock therapy,” the manipulative and managerial approach to politics in the ruling elites, and the highly specific and heterogeneous constitution of the emergent subject of struggle. It also gives further insight into the global meaning of the Russian protests {{as the result of}} an “overdetermination” of electoral procedures under the conditions of the regime of managed democracy and as an expression of the limits of any “really existing democracy” in the age of biopolitical governmentality. This introduction also highlights the <b>engaged</b> <b>positions</b> of the authors, who have been active participants in the protest movement...|$|R
50|$|To {{overcome}} these defenses, the Communist commander Xu Xiangqian developed {{a strategy of}} <b>engaging</b> <b>positions</b> {{on the outskirts of}} Taiyuan before besieging the city itself. The first hostilities in the Taiyuan Campaign occurred on October 5, 1948. By November 13 the Communists succeeded in taking the area around the eastern side of Taiyuan. The Nationalists suffered serious setbacks when entire divisions defected or surrendered. In one case, a Nationalist division led by Dai Bingnan pretended to surrender, but then arrested the Communist officers who entered Dai's camp to accept. Yan Xishan mistakenly believed the leader of the arrested group, Jin Fu, was the high-ranking Communist leader Hu Yaobang (who the Nationalists believed was active in the region). Yen airlifted the captured group to Chiang Kai-shek, who executed them after they failed to produce important information. Dai himself was rewarded with a large amount of gold for his actions, but was not allowed to be airlifted out of Taiyuan. After the city fell he was captured, tried in a well-propagandized show trial and publicly executed.|$|R

40|$|In our {{paper we}} {{address the issue of}} the {{relations}} between knowledge and the sensitive dimension by taking into account and comparing the contribution to the production of a chair deployed by two craftsmen working within the Italian design furniture industry sector. Relying on an ethnographic account of their work, {{we have been able to}} describe in detail the way in which the interaction among the bodies of the two craftsmen and those of the artifacts they contribute to develop takes place and gives way to innovation. By taking into account the role of bodies and the sensitive dimension we outline a contribution to Actor-Network Theory and its theory of knowledge. Indeed, in this article we propose a model of working knowledge in order to account for corporal interaction on the workplace. In our model there are two axes to describe the interactions among bodies. In the first one interaction moves from detail to the whole. In the second, interaction moves from an <b>engaged</b> <b>position</b> to a disengaged one. In so doing, we are able to draw a space of corporal knowledge.
