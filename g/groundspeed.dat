40|$|Global {{positioning}} system and time-depth recorders were deployed in combination {{to investigate the}} foraging behaviour of common murres Uria aalge breeding at Stora Karlsö Island, Baltic Sea, during the chick-rearing period. In the pre-breeding period the main prey species of murres, sprat Sprattus sprattus, is targeted by commercial fisheries, likely reducing prey availability during the breeding season. Foraging trips typically consisted of a short flight followed by a period sitting on the sea surface (0. 39 ± 0. 48 h), followed by several (5. 3 ± 3. 8) diving bouts interspersed by flights and water surface activity. Following the final diving bout, murres returned directly to the colony. Overnight foraging trips lasted longer than daytime trips, and that result corresponded with greater diving activity and reduced dive depths around dawn and dusk, likely times of high prey accessibility. High outward flight <b>groundspeeds</b> (20. 0 ± 2. 8 m s- 1) were aided by tailwinds, and lower inward flight <b>groundspeeds</b> (15. 1 ± 2. 5 m s- 1) were impeded by headwinds. Flights following the wind direction may reflect a strategy to reduce crosswind drift. Foraging intensity was lower than reported by most other studies of murres, suggesting more abundant or aggregated prey...|$|R
50|$|Reverted rubber {{aquaplaning}} frequently follows {{an encounter}} with dynamic aquaplaning, during which time the pilot may have the brakes locked {{in an attempt to}} slow the aircraft. Eventually the aircraft slows enough to where the tires make contact with the runway surface and the aircraft begins to skid. The remedy for this type of aquaplane is for the pilot to release the brakes and allow the wheels to spin up and apply moderate braking. Reverted rubber aquaplaning is insidious in that the pilot may not know when it begins, and it can persist to very slow <b>groundspeeds</b> (20 knots or less).|$|R

However, few studies have described the phenology of these movements, such as magnitudes, directions, and speeds, for more than one migration season and at regional scales. In this study, we characterize density, direction, and speed of nocturnally migrating birds using data from 13 weather surveillance radars in the autumns of 2010 and 2011 in the northeastern USA. After screening radar data to remove precipitation, we applied a recently developed algorithm for characterizing velocity profiles with previously developed methods to document bird migration. Many hourly radar scans contained windborne “contamination,” and these scans also exhibited generally low overall reflectivities. Hourly scans dominated by birds showed nightly and seasonal patterns that differed markedly from those of low reflectivity scans. Bird migration occurred during many nights, but a smaller number of nights with large movements of birds defined regional nocturnal migration. Densities varied by date, time, and location but peaked {{in the second and third}} deciles of night during the autumn period when the most birds were migrating. Migration track (the direction to which birds moved) shifted within nights from south-southwesterly to southwesterly during the seasonal migration peaks; this shift was not consistent with a similar shift in wind direction. Migration speeds varied within nights, although not closely with wind speed. Airspeeds increased during the night; <b>groundspeeds</b> were highest between the second and third deciles of night, when the greatest density of birds was migrating. Airspeeds and <b>groundspeeds</b> increased during the fall season, although <b>groundspeeds</b> fluctuated considerably with prevailing winds. Significant positive correlations characterized relationships among bird densities at southern coastal radar stations and northern inland radar stations. The quantitative descriptions of broadscale nocturnal migration patterns presented here will be essential for biological and conservation applications. These descriptions help to define migration phenology in time and space, fill knowledge gaps in avian annual cycles, and are useful for monitoring long-term population trends of migrants. Furthermore, these descriptions will aid in assessing potential risks to migrants, particularly from structures with which birds collide and artificial lighting that disorients migrants...|$|R

40|$|Most Arctic-breeding waders {{wintering}} in West Africa {{cover the}} first 4000 km of their northward journey in spring {{by a single}} flight to western Europe. We examined {{the extent to which}} waders economize their flight behaviour during departure by comparing climb rates and forward flight speeds with predictions based on flight mechanic theory and the relevant morphological measurements made of birds collected on the site. With an optical range finder, we followed 98 wader flocks on their departure from Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania. We also measured wind speed and direction at different altitudes by tracking helium-filled balloons and thus were able to deduce airspeeds from <b>groundspeeds</b> of the departing flocks. Of the nine species examined, six showed the predicted negative relationship between climb rate and airspeed, although only one was statistically significant. By normalizing the data, we found a statistically significant negative correlation across all species. Although 17 % of the observed climb rates were greater than the predicted theoretical maximum, the average observed climb rate was lower than the predicted optimum and the average observed airspeed was higher. The absolute deviations of climb rates from theory may have been because of the existence of pockets of rising and sinking air at the boundary of desert and ocean. That the absolute deviations in average climb rate and airspeed followed the predicted negative relationship is in accordance with the current theory of flight mechanics. ...|$|R

An infield vehicle {{was developed to}} automatically convey the machine vision system across the crop canopy. This paper presents {{an evaluation of the}} devised system under a range of operational and field conditions. On average, the vision system's internode length detection rate ranged from 12 measurements per 100 plants for compact plants when the sun was directly overhead with respect to the camera, to 64 measurements per 100 plants for vigorous plants when the sunlight was perpendicular to the camera view angle. Imaging at night time using 850 nm near infrared illumination resulted in internode length detection rates not significantly different from the most reliable daylight conditions. Both across-row and along-row operations of the system were evaluated, with the system yielding internode length measurements for <b>groundspeeds</b> up to 0. 20 m/s for along-row operation. Visual occlusion of the main stem nodes by foliage and variations in natural lighting conditions were observed to be the principal reasons for internode lengths not being successfully detected for every plant.

This is only possible when the aircraft is flown at the pivotal altitude corresponding to the current <b>groundspeed.</b> If the aircraft is flying in wind, the <b>groundspeed</b> will vary throughout the maneuver and thus the pivotal altitude will change also.
