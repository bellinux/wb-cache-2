5|$|An early type of axe {{known as}} a palstave <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> on Crompton Moor, {{providing}} evidence of Bronze Age human activity. It is believed that the area was inhabited by Ancient Britons, and that the Brigantes gave the River Beal its name. An ancient track, perhaps of Roman origin, crosses the modern Buckstones Road leading to Castleshaw Roman fort in neighbouring Saddleworth.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Stone Age, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon {{activity}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> locally. In the Middle Ages, Sale was a rural township, linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, whose {{fields and}} meadows {{were used for}} crop and cattle farming. By the 17th century, Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing garthweb, the woven material from which horses' saddle girths were made.|$|E
5|$|Far {{from being}} extinct, {{in recent years}} the Carménère grape <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> to be {{thriving}} in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers almost inadvertently preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years, due largely to its similarity to Merlot.|$|E
50|$|The village exists {{since the}} 12th century. In the village lands <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> traces of a pre-historic settlement. Votive tablets with the Thracian horseman, silver coins {{and other objects}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|R
25|$|No {{skeletal}} remains of Paleoindians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Kentucky, and while many Paleoindian clovis <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered,</b> there's scant {{evidence that the}} Paleoindians at Big Bone Lick State Park in Kentucky hunted Mastodons.|$|R

5|$|In captivity studies, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that most}} of the hybrids do not follow Haldane's Rule, but {{sometimes}} hybrid females die before they reach sexual maturity, thereby supporting the case for the American black duck being a distinct species.|$|E
5|$|Rammed earth: The archaeological {{evidence}} {{of the use of}} rammed earth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Neolithic archaeological sites of the Yangshao and Longshan cultures along the Yellow River in China, dating back to 5000 BC. By 2000 BC, rammed-earth architectural techniques were commonly used for walls and foundations in China.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forms of}} art {{recognised}} on the Altiplano are petrographs and petroglyphs in various locations on the Altiplano, mainly {{at the rock}} shelters of the Bogotá savanna. El Abra, Piedras del Tunjo and Tequendama are among the oldest sites where rock art <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> The Herrera Period, commonly defined from 800 BC to 800 AD, was {{the age of the}} first ceramics. The oldest Herrera pottery <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Tocarema and dates to 800 BC. Herrera art is also represented by the archaeoastronomical site, called El Infiernito by the Spanish. On a field outside Villa de Leyva, menhirs in the shape of aligned phalluses were erected. This site, the oldest remaining of constructed art, dated at 500 BC, formed an important place for religious rituals and festivities where great quantities of the alcoholic drink chicha was consumed. The evidence for festivities at this site are from a later date, already in the Muisca Period.|$|E
50|$|Also in the Northern and {{southern}} Sri Lanka, coins having a bull {{on one side}} and an elephant on the other side <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> In India coins with a bull {{on one side and}} a lion on the other side <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} complex system, many {{security}} problems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> and fixed since Java was first released. Some of these (like the Calendar serialization security bug) persisted {{for many years}} with nobody being aware. Others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in use by malware in the wild.|$|R

5|$|After {{its last}} {{performance}} at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> Tillett and Spencer, who discovered the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of Thespis between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use new music {{for all but the}} surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well. No version has become predominant in recent productions.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{metropolitan}} borough of the City of Salford was a 20th-century creation, {{the area has}} a long history of human activity, extending back to the Stone Age. Neolithic flint arrow-heads and tools, and evidence of Bronze Age activity <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in Salford. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Bury passes through the city; a hoard of over 550bronze Roman coins dating between 259AD and 278AD was discovered in Boothstown; and a Romano-British bog body, Worsley Man, was discovered in the Chat Moss peat bog.|$|E
5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} {{very similar to the}} blue wildebeest <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> Dating back to around 3000 BC, it was found in Hierakonopolis (Nekhen), which used to be the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at that time. This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bracken is {{very common}} in upland areas, Beech Fern in woods and other shaded {{locations}} and Scaly Male Fern in wooded or open areas. Wilsons Filmy-fern is a common upland variety in the Highlands, along with the Tunbridge Filmy-fern, Alpine Lady-fern and the rarer stunted form Newman’s Lady-fern (A. distentifolium var. flexile) which is endemic to Scotland. The Killarney Fern, once found on Arran {{was thought to be}} extinct in Scotland, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> on Skye in its gametophyte form.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the Cherokee and Creek {{had begun to}} compete for the same {{resources}} and fought a battle at nearby Slaughter Gap. The Creek lost, ceding the Blood Mountain area to the Cherokee, who considered it a holy place. Archaeological evidence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> that tends to back the story of the battle, but the date of the battle and its participants are still disputed.|$|E

5|$|Evidence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> of a Roman road {{passing through}} the area, on the ancient route between Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). Following the Anglo-Saxon {{invasion}} of England, Atherton, which is built on and around seven brooks, {{became part of the}} manor of Warrington until the Norman conquest, when it became a township or vill in the ancient parish of Leigh. Since 1974 the town {{has been part of the}} Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the Metropolitan County of Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> that they have similar values around 700nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300nm. Here, the 18km (k {{was found to be}} around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not {{visible to the naked}} eye, and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Eccles grew {{up around}} the 13th century Parish Church of St Mary. Evidence of pre-historic human {{settlement}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> locally but the area was predominantly agricultural until the Industrial Revolution, when a textile industry {{was established in the}} town. The arrival of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the world's first passenger railway, led to the town's expansion along the route of the track linking those two cities.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, a {{candidate}} for a Roman fort was identified by aerial photography at Easter Galcantray, south west of Cawdor. The site was excavated between 1984 and 1988 and several features were identified which are supportive of this classification. Roman pottery similar to that found at Inchtuthill Roman fort <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered.</b> If confirmed, {{it would be one}} of the most northerly known Roman forts in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|In the Milky Way it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that the}} large {{majority}} of the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
