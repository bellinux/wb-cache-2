40|$|Erythromycin {{ophthalmic}} ointment (E. Fougera & Co., Melville, N. Y.) and erythromycin <b>gluceptate</b> standards prepared in ointment base were stored {{at room temperature}} and heated at temperatures up to 45 degrees C {{for as long as}} 6 h before being assayed for bioactivity.

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{features of}} erythromycin estolate essential for hepatotoxicity were studied {{in a patient}} with proved erythromycin estolate toxicity. The only two variables in commercial erythromycin preparations are the chemical nature of the moiety substituted at the 2 ' position and the base. By challenges with different 2 ' substitutions and bases, we determined that the essential hepatotoxic property of erythromycin estolate in this patient was the propionyl ester linkage at the 2 ' position and that cross-sensitivity with erythromycin estolate did not occur with plain erythromycin, erythromycin stearate, erythromycin <b>gluceptate,</b> or erythromycin ethylsuccinate. We were unable to directly implicate an immunologic mechanism for erythromycin estolate hepatotoxicity, since neither tissue deposits of immunoglobulins nor lymphoblasti...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{patients}} with Campylobacter fetus bacteremia, {{six of them}} with serious underlying diseases, were seen in a two-year period. Besides fever, which was observed in all cases, the most frequent clinical manifestation was lower extremity phlebitis and cellulitis (four patients). In one of these patients, it had the peculiar aspect of bilateral pretibial cellulitis. One patient had vertebral osteomyelitis, a complication, to our knowledge, not yet described. Two patients, both with advanced underlying diseases, died. The five patients who completed a two- to three-week course of erythromycin <b>gluceptate,</b> all had initial clinical improvement. However, one patient suffered a relapse {{at the end of}} treatment, and progression of vertebral osteomyelitis while on erythromycin therapy was observed in another patient. These clinical and bacteriologic failures occurred despite the in vitro sensitivity to erythromycin of the two strains. This suggests that erythromycin might not be adequate therapy for C fetus septicemia...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of 21 years 39 {{patients}} with gastrinoma were surgically treated. Thirty-three patients had total gastrectomy with two postoperative deaths, and 6 patients had a lesser procedure. The postoperative fasting gastrin levels remained elevated and did not always indicate the extent of tumor involvement. Further mobilization of tumor gastrin by provocative infusion of calcium <b>gluceptate,</b> 15 mg/kg of body weight, should be carried out routinely. A hepatic angiogram should be considered when the gastrin levels exceed 1, 000 picograms per ml. Chemotherapy consisting of Tubercidin, Streptozotocin and 5 -Fluorouracil was given to 5 patients with extensive gastrinoma. All patients felt better and gained from three to 35 pounds in weight. Since 60 % of the patients died or have definite evidence of tumor activity {{it is assumed that}} the tumor growth was not inhibited and that it is malignant. Approximately 40 % of the patients seem to do well despite modest elevations in gastrin levels suggesting that the retained tumor could be considered benign...|$|E
40|$|Background Erythromycin is {{available}} as the free base, ethylsuccinate, estolate, stearate, <b>gluceptate,</b> and lactobionate derivatives. When given orally erythromycin and its derivatives except the estolate are inactivated {{to some extent}} by the gastric acid and poor absorption may result. Objectives To establish whether delayed release erythromycin tablets meet the bioequivalent requirement for the market Methods Spectrophotometric {{analysis was used to}} determine the dissolution percentage of the tablets in vitro. High performance liquid chroma-tography and IBM/XT microcomputer was used to determine the biovailability and pharmacokinetic parameters in vivo. Results Dissolution percentage in thirty minutes reached 28. 9 % and in sixty minutes erythromycin was completely released. The parameters of the delayed release tablets were Tlag 2. 3 hr,Tmax. 4. 5 hr, and Cmax 2. 123 g/ml Ka 0. 38048 hr- 1 T 1. 8 hr, V*C/F 49. 721 AUC 12. 9155. The relative biovailability of erythromycin delayed release tablet to erythromycin capsules was 105. 31 % Conclusion The content, appearance, and dissolution biovailability of delayed release erythromycin tablets conforms to the United States pharma-copoeia standards. The tablets should be stored in a cool and dry place in airtight containers and the shelf life is temporarily assigned two years. African Health Sciences 2001; 1 (2) : 90 - 9...|$|E
40|$|ERYTHROMYCIN is {{not usually}} looked upon as being a useful {{antibiotic}} in infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli, which are commonly found, by in-vitro tests, to be relatively resistant to its action. Notwithstanding this, some trials have been made of its clinical efficacy in infections with Gram-negative organisms, and it has several times been shown that clinical advantage can be taken of the increased activity of erythromycin in alkaline solution {{for the treatment of}} urinary-tract infection (Zinner et al., 1971). In view of this, we undertook a reappraisal of the activity of erythromycin against enterobacteria, particularly in conditions resembling those likely to occur in the urinary tract. In the course of these studies we encountered unexpected variety in the effect of the drug on different strains of Escherichia coli, which we now report. MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains of E. coli originally derived from urinary-tract infections were used throughout. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin (Ilotycin <b>gluceptate,</b> Eli Lilly & Co.) were determined by a standard doubling-dilution technique in nutrient broth at pH 7. 5. Because the high concentration of bacteria found in infected urine may play an important part in determining the response to antibacterial therapy (O’Grady and Pennington, 1967), titrations against one strain of E. coli (Fr) were repeated with inocula ranging from 102 to 108 per ml. The effect of the drug was also examined in a system that simulates in some important respects conditions in the urinary bladder. In this system, 30 -ml samples of fully grown or near-fully grown broth cultures, resembling those found in infected bladder urine, were constantly diluted at 1 ml per min. with fresh broth (simulating ureteric-urine flow) while being held in the light path of a “ Spekker ” photometer (O’Grady and Pennington, 1966). Frequent readings were taken, and the results were expressed as the reciprocal of the opacity produced by the culture in excess of the value for uninoculated nutrient broth. In this method the reciprocal of the opacity of a completely inactivated organism will plot against time as a predictable straight line (O’Grady and Pennington, 1967) ...|$|E
