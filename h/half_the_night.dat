500|$|In autumn 1871, Cope began {{prospecting}} {{farther west}} to the fossil fields of Kansas. Leidy and Marsh {{had been to the}} region earlier, and Cope employed one of Marsh's guides, Benjamin Mudge, who was in want of a job. Cope's companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions. Cope would suffer from a [...] "severe attack of nightmare" [...] in which [...] "every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night... sometimes he would lose <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> in this exhausting slumber." [...] Nevertheless, Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset, sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds. The severe desert conditions and Cope's habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him, and in 1872, he broke down from exhaustion. Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879.|$|E
500|$|Despite the Australians' {{domination}} of the local teams, the English public showed unprecedented levels {{of interest in the}} cricket. Record gate takings were registered at most venues, even when rain affected the [...] matches, and the record attendance for a Test match in England was broken twice, in the Second Test at Lord's and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil. As a result, Australia made £82,671 from the tour, resulting in a profit of £54,172. The popularity of the team meant that they were inundated with invitations for social appointments with government officials and members of the royal family, and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements, with 103 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days. As a result, Johnson was flooded with phone calls and letters, which he had to attend to by himself, as he was the only administrator among the touring party. Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson's tireless work would cause health problems because he [...] "worked like a slave day and night" [...] and that [...] "it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through". The journalist Andy Flanagan said that Johnson was [...] "'on the ball' every minute of the waking day, and it would be safe to say <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> too." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The First Time", Kurt and Blaine {{discuss whether}} or not to have sex. When Blaine goes to Dalton to invite the Warblers to see him in West Side Story, he is pursued by a new warbler Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin). Sebastian convinces Kurt and Blaine to go with him to a local gay bar—he {{supplies}} the fake IDs—and spends <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> dancing with Blaine. When they leave, a drunk and aroused Blaine urges Kurt to have sex with him {{in the back seat of}} the car. Kurt refuses, and Blaine walks home. He later tells Kurt that he was just nervous about the possibility of their first time, and that he cares nothing for Sebastian. They kiss onstage in the empty auditorium, and Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine's house for the night, where they have sex together for the first time. In the episode [...] "Michael", New Directions and the Warblers compete for the right to perform Michael Jackson's music at Regionals by singing his song [...] "Bad". Sebastian, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to steal Blaine from Kurt, throws a slushie laced with rock salt at Kurt, but Blaine jumps in front of Kurt and is badly injured by it; the cornea in his right eye is deeply scratched and requires surgery. Neither group ultimately uses Jackson's music at Regionals, and New Directions wins the competition. Later, Kurt succeeds in becoming a finalist for NYADA, as does Rachel.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during <b>the</b> last <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> and return {{to one of their}} nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> During <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|R
60|$|Caroline allowed two whole days to {{pass before}} she would allow herself {{to think of}} what had taken place. She read through <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights,</b> so as to secure sleep for herself when she lay down. But on the third morning she opened her desk in her own room, and sat down and wrote to Adela Gauntlet.|$|R
25|$|Normally, {{the highest}} {{cortisol}} secretion happens in <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> with peak cortisol production {{occurring in the}} early morning. Following this, cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during <b>the</b> ﬁrst <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Cortisol awakening response is independent of this circadian variation in HPA axis activity; it is superimposed upon the daily rhythm of HPA axis activity; {{and it seems to}} be linked specifically to the event of awakening.|$|R
2500|$|In {{his role}} as an army commander, Rosecrans {{became one of the}} most popular generals in the Union Army. He was known to his men as [...] "Old Rosy", not only because of his last name (the source for that {{nickname}} at West Point), but because of his large red nose, which was described as [...] "intensified Roman". As a devout Catholic, he carried a crucifix on his watch chain and a rosary in his pocket, and he delighted in keeping his staff up <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> debating religious doctrine. He could swing swiftly from bristling anger to good-natured amusement, which endeared him to his men.|$|E

60|$|One {{haunting}} fear {{kept him}} sleepless <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> and sick {{even in his}} dreams, {{and it was that}} the Mormon whose sealed wife she was might come, surely would come, some night. Shefford could bear it. But what would that visit do to Fay Larkin? Shefford instinctively feared the awakening in the girl of womanhood, of deeper insight, of a spiritual realization of what she was, of a physical dawn.|$|R

40|$|The {{levels of}} the mRNAs for light-inducible, nuclear-coded {{chloroplast}} proteins vary rhythmically in pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants either grown in a dark-light cycle or under constant light conditions. This has been observed for the early light-inducible protein, the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein, and the small subunit of the ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase. The mRNA levels are high in the morning, exhibit a minimum in <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> and increase again during <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> amplitude of fluctuation is between 5 - and 10 -fold. A similar change in the mRNA abundance was found for four nuclear encoded heat-shock proteins of 18, 24, 26, and 30 kilodaltons. The ability of plants to transcribe heat-shock genes upon heat-shock for 2 hours varies through the day. The maxima for induction are found in <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> and <b>the</b> morning. The minima are reached during the afternoon. The degree of fluctuation is between 3 - and 5 -fold. The levels of mRNAs for cytosolic {{as well as for}} plastid heat-shock proteins oscillate in parallel...|$|R

2500|$|Thus, Seder {{participants}} {{recall the}} slavery that reigned during <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> by eating matzo (the [...] "poor person's bread"), maror (bitter herbs which symbolize {{the bitterness of}} slavery), and charoset (a sweet paste representing the mortar which the Jewish slaves used to cement bricks). Recalling the freedom of <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> they eat <b>the</b> matzo (the [...] "bread of freedom" [...] {{as well as the}} [...] "bread of affliction") and 'afikoman', and drink the four cups of wine, in a reclining position, and dip vegetables into salt water (the dipping being a sign of royalty and freedom).|$|R

6000|$|It was a {{cardinal}} rule with Lilian never {{to send out}} any article that was not up to her standard. She bore {{the loss of her}} failures, and sometimes stayed up <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> to fill an order on time. [...] "Prompt and perfect" [...] was her motto.|$|R
60|$|But Cyrus' acquirement of the {{chunk of}} hair {{was his last}} triumph.

50|$|Patients with PLMD will {{complain}} of {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} (EDS), falling asleep during the day, trouble falling asleep at night, and difficulty staying asleep throughout <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> Patients also display involuntary limb movements that occur at periodic intervals anywhere from 20-40 seconds apart. They often only last <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> during non-REM sleep stages. Movements do not occur during REM because of muscle atonia.|$|R
