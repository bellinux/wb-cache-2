6000|$|This is, {{with a few}} {{remarkable}} limitations, a free country. No law exists {{which says}} to publishers, [...] "Thou shalt not publish on commission." [...] No law confines the vagaries of amateur romance. Hence the market is choked, and the circulating libraries are overwhelmed with rubbish, and good books, as the Americans of the West say, [...] "get no show." [...] The debauched novel reader, to whom every story is a story, and one no better nor worse than another, may not heed it, but the judicious grieve, and the artist in fiction returns a smaller income tax. Then the very revenue suffers with the general decline of letters. It may, of course, be urged that all artists are amateurs before they secure a paying public. The amateur novelist may {{be compared to the}} young dramatic author who gives his piece at a matinee, and who, once in a hundred times, finds a manager to approve it. May not publishing en amateur be the only way of reaching the public? To this question the answer is, No! The risk of publishing a novel by a new author is nothing like so great as the risk of producing a play with an unknown name to it. Publishers exist for the purpose of bringing out books that will pay, and they generally pounce on a <b>good</b> <b>manuscript</b> in fiction, whether the writer be known or unknown. It is much more easy to predict whether a novel will pay or not than to prophecy about a drama. Thus the most obscure author (in spite of the difficulties faced by [...] "Jane Eyre" [...] and [...] "Vanity Fair") may rely on it, that if his MS. is not accepted, it is not worth accepting. He should not, if he has decently sound reasons for self-confidence, be disheartened by two or three refusals. One man's taste might be averse to [...] "John Inglesant," [...] another's might turn against Ouida, a third might fail to see the merit of [...] "Vice Versa." [...] But if half a dozen experts taste and reject a manuscript, it is almost certain to be hopeless. Then the author should take the advice once offered by Mr. Walter Besant. [...] "Never publish at your own expense." [...] If you do, you stamp yourself as an amateur; you add to the crowd of futilities that choke the market; and, if you have it in you to write a novel which shall be a good piece, you are handicapping yourself by placing a bad novel on your record. People sin out of thoughtlessness, as well as depravity, and we would not say that every amateur novelist is, ex officio, infamous, nefarious, and felonious. He or she may be only rather vain, conceited, and unreflecting.|$|E

Rook's title may derive from the fact that this tune, and the song in 6/8 time, Nae Good Luck, use the same passamezzo moderno ground bass.

2500|$|On 10 March 1949 Roger Lancelyn Green dined with Lewis at Magdalen College. After {{the meal}} Lewis read two {{chapters}} {{from his new}} children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said that {{he thought it was}} <b>good.</b> The <b>manuscript</b> of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May. When on 16 October 1950 Geoffrey Bles in London published the first edition, three new [...] "chronicles", Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy, had also been completed.|$|R
40|$|Typing {{instructions}} for the proceedings In the interest of obtaining a uniform layout for the proceedings, authors are kindly requested to observe the following guidelines: General Layout The original typescript of {{the full text of}} each contribution will go directly to the photographic reproduction service without any editing, and should therefore be in its final form (ie. in <b>good</b> presentation). <b>Manuscripts</b> must be printed on a printer (e. g., laser printer) having 300 d. p. i, or better, resolution. Lower quality printers, such as dot matrix printers are not acceptable since the manuscript will not reproduce legibly. The text should be typed inside of a frame size: 17 x 25 cm. The margins for the two paper sizes are shown below...|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the two pieces dedicated to Lady Nevell, the compositions were evidently neither created specifically for the book, nor for the dedicatee, but are representative of some of Byrd's work of the ten to fifteen previous years. The tenth pavan is dedicated to the Catholic John, Lord Petre, while the sixth was for Kinborough Good, daughter of Dr James <b>Good.</b> The <b>manuscript</b> is notable for the lack of any liturgical works, and the pieces may reflect the musical tastes of Elizabeth Nevill herself. Dance music is represented mainly by the ten magnificent but somewhat sombre pavans and their galliards, and there are none of Byrd's more lively corantos and voltas found in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, and only one of the almans.|$|R
5000|$|Bible scholar David Fuller in his book, Which Bible?, writes: [...] John William Burgon [...].in 1860, while {{temporary}} chaplain of the English congregation at Rome, ... made {{a personal}} examination of Codex B (Vaticanus), and in 1862 he inspected the treasures of St. Catherine's Convent on Mt. Sinai. Later he made several tours of European libraries, examining and collating New Testament manuscripts wherever he went…Of all {{the critics of}} the nineteenth century Burgon alone was consistently Christian in his vindication of the Divine inspiration and providential preservation of the text of Holy Scripture… Burgon regarded the good state of preservation of B (Codex Vaticanus) and ALEPH (Codex Sinaiticus) in spite of their exceptional age as proof not of their goodness but of their badness. If they had been <b>good</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> they would have been read to pieces long ago. We suspect that these two manuscripts are indebted for their preservation, solely to their ascertained evil character; which has occasioned that the one eventually found its way, four centuries ago, to a forgotten shelf in the Vatican Library; while the other, after exercising the ingenuity of several generations of critical Correctors, eventually (viz. in A.D.1844) got deposited in the wastepaper basket of the Convent at the foot of Mount Sinai. [...] Had B (Vaticanus) and ALEPH (Sinaiticus) been copies of average purity, they must long since have shared the inevitable fate of books which are freely used and highly prized; namely, they would have fallen into decadence and disappeared from sight. Thus the fact that B and ALEPH are so old is a point against them, not something in their favour. It shows that the Church rejected them and did not read them. Otherwise they would have worn out and disappeared through much reading.|$|R

And this sensational account of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, by a schoolmate of a niece of the Governor of Kentucky, isn't such a bad idea. It happened {{so long ago that}} most people have forgotten it. Now, here's a poem three pages long called 'The Tyrant's Foot,' by Lorella Lascelles. I've pawed around a <b>good</b> deal over <b>manuscripts,</b> but I never saw her name on a rejection slip." ...|$|R

Walker was buried in Stratford Church, where a Latin epitaph {{on the wall of the}} Lady Chapel commemorates him. He had a <b>good</b> collection of <b>manuscripts,</b> many of which had belonged to Sir William le Neve. Some of these he gave to the College of Arms in 1673, others he bequeathed to it and yet others to the Office of Garter.|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "Arts of the Contact Zone," [...] Pratt {{describes}} a manuscript from 1613 penned by Andean man named Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. The manuscript {{was a letter}} written to King Phillip III of Spain and was titled The First New Chronicle and <b>Good</b> Government. The <b>manuscript</b> details Spanish conquest in South America. Pratt cites the manuscript {{as an example of}} autoethnography. She writes, “Guaman Poma’s New Chronicle is an instance of what I have proposed to call an authethnographic text, by which I mean a text in which people undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made of them” (35). The New Chronicle ends with a revisionist account of the Spanish conquest. Pratt uses the manuscript as an example of an oppressed person or group resisting hegemony, and she connects the practice of authoethnography, critique and resistance to the creation of contact zones.|$|R
50|$|References to the surname {{are found}} on a Bronze plaque i.e. Tamra-pat, which dates back to {{eleventh}} century. There is an akin surname called ‘Ghalasasi’, however it belongs to persons of Vatsa Gotra.Thus {{it is evident that}} the surname has been derived from their profession. In a brass scroll of Bagewadi of 12th century, Ghaisas have been attributed with several surnames which means it belonged to various families and professions. The surname at that time was used in respect for extraordinary proficiency in Vedanta, Nyaya (Judicial matters), Tarka (Logic), Astrology, Literature (Grammar),etc.Ghaisas were also <b>good</b> at writing <b>manuscripts</b> and reports, including those on stones (shila-lekhs). This job ran through the generations in Ghaisas and a reference to that effect can be seen on a tamra-pat (bronze plaque) of the Year 1060, belonging to the King Mamruni of Shilahara Kingdom found at Diveagar in Konkan. This plaque is first of its kind and is written in Prakrut Marathi.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his spare}} time, Drury wrote the novel which would become 1959's Advise and Consent. Drury later wrote a {{memorandum}} for his archives at the Hoover Institution {{in which he}} gives a full account of how the book came to be written and published. Baker {{was one of the}} first people to read the manuscript and describes his initial reluctance and then reaction: What lies I would be compelled to tell poor Allen ... The box weighed slightly less than a ton. The manuscript inside was typed not very well on long, legal-size paper. I took it home, ate, fixed a drink, sat down and with a heavy heart reached into the box for a fistful of <b>manuscript.</b> <b>Good</b> Lord! You couldn't put the thing down! I read half the book that night and finished it next day. My wife finished close behind, and the sight of her suppressing a tear at one point confirmed my hunch.|$|R
