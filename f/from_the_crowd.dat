5|$|A {{controversial}} fumble recovery by Sewanee {{may have}} saved the game. Auburn quarterback Reynolds Tichenor {{said it was a}} gift; the referee awarded Sewanee the ball, but he insisted Auburn recovered it. A double pass play to Warbler Wilson got the ensuing Sewanee touchdown. Bart Sims made the extra point to edge Auburn. Neither team managed to score in the second half. The delay <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> gathering on the field ran the game into darkness.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, General Henry Abbot {{arrived at}} President Street with a {{battalion}} of 99 to 114 engineers. As the group advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where {{they were to be}} quartered, they were met by a crowd of 500. Jeers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> turned to missiles until one soldier, Private Corcoran, was struck in the head and wounded. Abbot gave orders that his men were to halt and fix bayonets, at which point the crowd scattered.|$|E
5|$|As the Royal Rumble match began, it was {{revealed}} that Scott Steiner was the first participant and his former rival Samu had drawn the number two position. Early in the match, Diesel tied a WWF record by throwing out seven consecutive wrestlers. He was ultimately eliminated by a group of wrestlers, while his partner Shawn Michaels kept aloof. Although Diesel wrestled as a heel at the time, his performance earned him applause <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook and Edrich fell early, leaving England at 39/2. This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The English had the better of the late afternoon period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes.|$|E

In a scuffle which broke {{out in front of}} the building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 8:00pm, Colonel Peters ordered three {{companies}} of 120 {{men of the}} 6th to move as commanded by the governor and General Herbert to Camden Station. As they exited, they were assaulted by stones <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> believing those of the 6th Regiment were armed only with blank cartridges. The troops returned fire, with live ammunition as they were equipped, and the frightened crowd retreated west across Fayette Street Bridge.|$|E
5|$|As a {{free agent}} {{following}} the season, Iginla chose to go to Boston and signed a one-year, $6million contract with the Bruins. He required nine games before scoring his first goal as a Bruin, {{as part of a}} 2–1 win over the San Jose Sharks, but later settled in on Boston's first line with Milan Lucic and David Krejčí. He made his first return to Calgary on December 10, 2013, where the fans greeted him with a long standing ovation prior to the game as the Flames played a video tribute. Following the contest, a 2–1 Bruins victory, Iginla was named the game's third star and took two laps around the rink to more cheers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> He recorded his 600th career assist in a 3–1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on February 4, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Following {{another good}} all-round {{performance}} against Hampshire, top-scoring {{in the first}} innings and taking 5/25 in the second, Miller went into the First Test (at Trent Bridge) in fine form. On the first morning, Miller bowled Hutton and Compton {{on his way to}} 3/38, helping Australia dismiss England cheaply and seize the initiative. Miller scored a duck, but Australia took a 344-run lead on the first innings. In the second innings, he resumed his battle with Hutton and Compton, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The next day, he bowled Hutton for 74 and then bounced Compton, causing him to fall onto his stumps for 184. Australia won by eight wickets, Miller ending with 4/125 for the second innings and 7/163 for the match.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Test at The Oval, Bradman {{walked out to}} bat in Australia's first innings. He {{received}} a standing ovation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, {{it would have been}} 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes, a claim Bradman denied {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

Michigan celebrated the re-dedication of Michigan Stadium with a special flyover by a World War II era B-25 bomber from the nearby Yankee Air Museum in Ypsilanti Township, and then another flyover {{immediately}} following the national anthem by two A-10 aircraft. Brock Mealer—the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer—led the team onto the field by walking to the banner and touching it, which sparked a standing ovation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Elliot Mealer had only recently regained the ability to walk following injuries in a car crash.|$|E

He later appeared in backstage segments throughout the evening. The following day, {{it was reported that}} Hardy had signed a new contract with TNA. Hardy would make his next appearance for the company on the March 8 episode of Impact!, saving D'Angelo Dinero, Abyss and Hulk Hogan from A.J. Styles, Ric Flair and Desmond Wolfe. The following week, Hardy defeated then TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles in a non-title match.|$|E
5|$|The 1966–67 season proved {{frustrating}} for United, despite {{the introduction of}} another club great {{in the form of}} Eddie Gray. Leeds finished fourth, five points behind champions Manchester United, and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals after defeat to Chelsea. They made progress in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, beating DWS (Netherlands), Valencia, Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the final, where they were beaten 2–0 on aggregate by Yugoslavian outfit Dinamo Zagreb. At {{the end of the season}} he was named as the Footballer of the Year, succeeding his brother who had won it the previous year. During the award ceremony he told a number of amusing stories and won a standing ovation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> this started him on a successful sideline as an after-dinner speaker.|$|E

5|$|The departures of Núñez and Louis van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou with Madrid, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Llorenç Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.|$|E
5|$|The march {{ended in}} a picket {{in front of the}} Banovina building, where the JNA had its {{headquarters}} in Split at the time. The protesters demanded an end to the JNA-imposed blockade of the village of Kijevo. Scuffles broke {{out in front of the}} building, and a JNA soldier was killed by a gunshot reportedly fired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Four organisers of the protest were arrested a month later by the JNA, tried in a military court and convicted. They were released months later in a prisoner exchange. The protest caused the JNA to withdraw a portion of military equipment previously based in Split to more secure locations and increase its combat readiness there. The blockade of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations days after the protest.|$|E
