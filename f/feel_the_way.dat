5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E

I {{hope and pray that}} I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out.

500|$|Seamus Blackley {{designed}} the game's physics system, {{which is a}} modified version of the one he wrote for Looking Glass's flight simulator Flight Unlimited. At the time, Church described it as [...] "far more sophisticated than what you would normally use for an indoor game". The system governs, among other things, weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity. The game's most complex physics model is that of the player character. Church explained that the character's head [...] "tilts forward when you start to run, and jerks back a bit when you stop", and that, after an impact against a surface or object, its [...] "head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit, with proportion to [...] mass and velocity of the objects involved". On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games, Blackley later said, [...] "If games don't obey physics, we somehow feel that something isn't right", and that [...] "the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesn't notice the physics, but only notices that things <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they should".|$|E

500|$|Don't Look Now {{has been}} much admired by and an {{influence}} on subsequent filmmakers. [...] Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated {{that it is a}} film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We Need to Talk about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|E
500|$|The game used {{an updated}} version of the company's Jade engine, {{designed}} for Beyond Good & Evil. When the team saw the capacities of the Jade engine, they decided to use it for The Sands of Time. For The Sands of Time, the team made improvements to the engine by adding additional walking and running animations, enabling smoother character movement. They also made custom animations for the character. The engine made editing and fine-tuning the game very easy due to its easy-to-use tools. Using this as a base, they were able to focus on rapid integration of new elements into the game, and were also able to do quick testing and adjustments. The team developed [...] "substance" [...] and [...] "glow" [...] systems, which respectively enabled natural movements of cloth and gave the lightning effects a [...] "magical" [...] <b>feel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>way</b> the engine was structured, with all assets in a single accessible folder, proved problematic when alterations needed to be made or new features added, as the team size meant too many people were accessing the engine and were causing data to be overwritten, files to be corrupted, and the whole system to crash. They attempted to solve the problem using a [...] "data monkey" [...] solution which would allow for simultaneous access, but it came late in development and they did not risk making such a radical change to the system. Instead, they set up a file server to manage check-in times, which could allow for management of access and prioritisation of critical work.|$|E
500|$|Todd survives {{and hides}} at Llanfair, where he befriends two children, C. J. and Sarah Roberts. He is arrested when he jealously confronts new couple Rebecca and Powell. His prison van gets into an {{accident}} with another vehicle, and he rescues Marty, C. J. and Jessica (Erin Torpey) from the car. This {{results in an}} early parole for Todd, but he continues to seek counseling. He is later accused of rape by several women. Marty reluctantly provides him with an alibi {{for one of the}} attacks. A deranged Powell, believing Todd is in his head, is later revealed as the serial rapist and kidnaps Rebecca. When Todd confronts him, making it so that Rebecca can escape, he kidnaps Todd and makes Todd <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Marty felt when they raped her. Todd proceeds to overpower Powell. After Powell is caught and arrested, Todd apologizes to Marty for all the pain he caused her, recognizing that he [...] "was a monster." [...] He begins falling in love with Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) after meeting her in a bar. In December 1994, Peter Manning dies and Todd learns he is adopted. Conman David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) discovers Todd's biological parents, Victor Lord and Irene Manning. With help from Todd's scheming biological sister, Tina, David claims to be the lost Lord heir, but Todd's true parentage is ultimately revealed, leaving Todd $27.8 million richer. He purchases a tabloid paper from Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser) and relaunches it as The Sun, a direct rival to his new-found family's newspaper The Banner. In 1995, Blair tricks Todd into marriage by faking a pregnancy. She later learns that she really is pregnant, but, after being mugged, she miscarries. Todd discovers she initially lied about her pregnancy and has the marriage annulled. When Blair becomes pregnant again, they remarry in November 1995. Although they are happy, Blair dislikes Todd's consistent concern for Marty. He goes to Ireland to give Marty a flight back to Llanview. Her friend, Patrick Thornhart (Thorsten Kaye), is being hunted by Irish terrorists. Todd poses as Patrick, is shot, and presumed dead. Blair blames Marty. Todd returns to Llanview in 1996, to find Blair in bed with Patrick. His sister, Victoria [...] "Viki" [...] Lord (Erika Slezak), introduces him to his daughter, Starr (Kristen Alderson). Todd eventually resumes his life with Blair. They have many difficulties in their marriage, and Starr being diagnosed with aplastic anemia strains the marriage further.|$|E

2500|$|... "With You" [...] is a [...] "folksy" [...] R song. According to {{the music}} sheet {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "With You" [...] utilizes styles of urban and contemporary R music and has a moderate tempo of 86 beats per minute. It is written in a key of E♭ major while Brown's vocals range from E♭4 to B♭5 The song follows a basic sequence of E♭5-E♭maj7-A♭7-B♭ as its chord progression. It consists of a slow stuttering beat and an acoustic guitar arrangement that has garnered comparisons to that present in Stargate's other produced song, Beyoncé's [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2006). Kelefa Sanneh of New York Times said the song could be a cover of [...] "Irreplaceable", while Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the two songs [...] "kissing cousins". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that the song [...] "openly mimics [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] {{right down to the}} acoustic guitar riff." [...] Lyrically, [...] "With You" [...] is written about teenage love, presented in the lyrics [...] "And now I know I can’t be the only one/ I bet there’s hearts all over the world tonight / With the love in their life who <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I feel when I’m with you." ...|$|E

[...] The sixth track on the mixtape is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Free Man in Paris" [...] which, serving {{as a tribute to}} Mitchell, was renamed [...] "White Girl in Paris". The mixtape's seventh track and second single from the tape [...] "Andre" [...] was also written by JoJo while {{production}} was handled by Mr. Franks. In discussion of the track, JoJo says [...] "Andre" [...] isn't necessarily a direct tribute to Outkast's André 3000; rather, the 37-year-old rapper/singer provided inspiration for the song. [...] "I absolutely admire André and both of the guys from Outkast — their incredible artistry and creativity," [...] she explains. [...] "The man that André is, I think that's super-sexy — someone who is themselves, who isn't confined and just expresses themselves. He has such a great style. I was inspired by that, for sure."

Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I {{looked him in the}} face and said, [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." [...] I prayed with Red. [...] He went out, and the last song he sang was [...] "Peace in the Valley." [...] He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I do tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away). [...] According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, [...] "I'm awful tired now, Hank. [...] I've got to go to bed."
