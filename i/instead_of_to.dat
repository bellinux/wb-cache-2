5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was {{due in part to the}} fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> William Shatner.|$|E

George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto {{and asked if he}} should pay tribute directly to him, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa on behalf of his elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E

The police encounter Martin and find the stolen purse before promptly arresting him. Harry's sweetheart visits Martin's mother and the police take Harry to his apartment. Harry bids his mother and his sweetheart goodbye, an inter-title car states that Harry does not want his mother to know he has gone away on a journey <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> jail.|$|E
5|$|The {{senses of}} Psittacosaurus can be {{inferred}} from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E
5|$|Ælfric {{was the son}} of an earl of Kent {{and became}} a monk of Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was very likely Abbot of Abingdon before {{becoming}} Abbot of St Albans Abbey around 975, although some historians do not believe that he held the office of Abbot at Abingdon. Although the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, or History of the Church of Abingdon, names Ælfric as abbot, the abbatial lists do not record him as such. Indirect corroboration of his being abbot at Abingdon is a grant of land to Ælfric personally (<b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> the office he held) while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from Abingdon. This land was to revert to Abingdon after Ælfric's death.|$|E

25|$|Under the 1928 Copyright Act, courts did not grant {{any damage}} claims by private persons for {{copyright}} infringement. The payment of fines to citizens <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> {{the state was}} seen as contrary to communist doctrine. When damages were granted, {{they were to be}} paid to the state. Furthermore, the courts limited damage claims in copyright infringement cases to the sums defined by the existing standard schedules of remuneration issued by the government. If no schedule existed, no damages were awarded at all, even if the works were confirmed to be copyrighted.|$|E
25|$|When I-15 was {{eventually}} built around Levan and Nephi in the 1980s, {{it did not}} follow the originally planned alignment, but was farther west in the Levan area, and crossed old US-91 between the two communities, bypassing Nephi to the east <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> the west. Since only one interchange was constructed south of Nephi, all of old US-91 remained a state highway there, and {{the north end of}} SR-28 and south end of SR-41 were in the same place. This was changed in 2006, when SR-28 was extended north to absorb all of SR-41.|$|E

25|$|The TUG flap (also the TMG flap) {{consists}} of the gracilis muscle and a transversely-oriented island of skin and fat on the superior inner thigh. Sacrifice of the gracilis muscle does not result in functional impairment. The TUG flap is nourished by the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery with two venae comitantes, which come from the profunda femoris vessels. The vessels are routinely anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> the thoraco-dorsal vessels in the axilla, because the blood vessels of the TUG flap are relatively short.|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, the {{ventricular}} septum of {{the heart}} is incomplete and the pulmonary artery {{is equipped with a}} sphincter muscle. This allows a second possible route of blood flow. Instead of blood flowing through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, the sphincter may be contracted to divert this blood flow through the incomplete ventricular septum into the left ventricle and out through the aorta. This means the blood flows from the capillaries to the heart and back to the capillaries <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> the lungs. This process is useful to ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals in the regulation of their body temperature.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{four new}} bills were {{introduced}} in the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, one of which made provisions to have revenue derived from activities in Nevis paid directly to the treasury in Saint Kitts <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> the treasury in Nevis. Another bill, The Financial Services Committee Act, contained provisions that all investments in Saint Kitts and Nevis would require approval by an investment committee in Saint Kitts. This was controversial, because ever since 1983 the Nevis Island Administration had approved all investments for Nevis, {{on the basis that}} the constitution vests legislative authority for industries, trades and businesses and economic development in Nevis to the Nevis Island Administration.|$|E

Justin gives Paige some money to get on her way, but by now he wants an escape from his own life. He persuades Paige to take him with her. They leave together, and the play ends just as Rudi's gangsters are trying to force their way through the door to a surprised Derek and Dee.|$|E
25|$|The Army's Signal Corps Aviation School {{relocated}} the Curtiss airplane {{group from}} its original location at College Park, Maryland, to North Island during November to December 1912 <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> Augusta, Georgia, as it had the previous winter. The Wright group, organized as the 1st Provisional Aero Squadron, came to North Island after mobilizing in Texas in March. The Army flyers established a tent camp {{at the north end}} of North Island, and for about a year, the Signal Corps Aviation School rented airplanes and hangars constructed for the Curtiss school. None of the buildings from this early period, constructed on the north end of the island, still exist. Existing historic and architecturally significant buildings reflect the use and development of Rockwell Field from 1918 to 1935.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine–Fatimid treaty {{weakened}} Nasr's {{strategic position}} and {{forced him to}} improve relations with the Fatimids. As early as 1030, Nasr sought Fatimid approval of his rule and dispatched an envoy carrying {{a large amount of}} war booty from Azaz to Caliph az-Zahir. In turn, the caliph accepted Nasr's authority in Aleppo, {{at least for the time}} being. However, there is no indication that Nasr paid the Fatimids tribute. Nasr's envoy remained in Cairo for several years and likely did not return to Aleppo until after the accession of Caliph al-Mustansir. Zakkar speculates this indicated discord between Aleppo and Cairo due to Nasr's continued tribute to Byzantium <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>to</b> the Fatimids or Fatimid reservations at Nasr's request for the governorship of Hims.|$|E
