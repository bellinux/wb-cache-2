5|$|By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist {{position}} {{had developed}} into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrinewhich, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting <b>Islamism</b> in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims {{from around the world}} to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza {{became a}} member of the Arab Executive Committee and in 1930 was {{appointed}} by rival nationalist Haj Amin al-Husseini (now the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) as the General Administrator of the Waqf (Islamic religious trust) under the Supreme Muslim Council. In 1931, he convinced his city's MCA to change its name to the Patriotic Arab Association. Unlike other Arab politicians at the time, Darwaza supported a combination of pan-Arabism, <b>Islamism,</b> and dedication to the Palestinian nationalist ideal.|$|E
5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical <b>Islamism</b> as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E
5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was {{planned to be}} a new Arab kingdom, and not just Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and <b>Islamism.</b> The majority of Syrians continued to see themselves as Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E
5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , comments in The Shadows in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of <b>Islamism</b> is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E
5|$|The sky bears overt metaphorical {{significance}} {{and is the}} centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, {{a symbol of the}} Near East. Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents Christendom's victory over the <b>Islamism</b> of the Ottomans. Eschatological meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the Book of Daniel, is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, Daniel 7 predicts {{the rise and fall of}} four kingdoms before the Second Coming; these were thought to be Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as an event of cosmic significance. The battle also marked a progression toward the end of the world – an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the papacy. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh. It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.|$|E
25|$|Nawaz defines <b>Islamism</b> as {{a desire}} to impose any given {{interpretation}} of Islam over society. He notes that <b>Islamism,</b> like Communism before it, comes in different shades: organisations like the Muslim Brotherhood {{who want to work}} within democratic set up to further their agenda; groups like Hizb ut Tahrir which are revolutionary in nature and seek power through military coups; militant groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS who engage in direct violence. He also differentiates <b>Islamism</b> from conservative Islam, with the former having political ambitions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Islamism</b> is {{a concept}} whose meaning has been debated in both public and {{academic}} contexts.|$|E
25|$|French philosopher Alexandre del Valle {{compared}} <b>Islamism</b> with fascism and {{communism in}} his Red-green-brown alliance theory.|$|E
25|$|Concerns and {{contemporary}} {{issues facing the}} Australian Muslim community include rates of unemployment, the rights of women, concerns over <b>Islamism</b> and Islamic radicalism, among others.|$|E
25|$|Several {{terrorist}} attacks and attempted {{attacks in the}} UK from 2004 to 2007—particularly the London July 7, 2005 ("7/7") bombings that killed over 50 civilians—raised government/media/public concern about <b>Islamism</b> there.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, as the {{authority}} of the nascent Young Turk government splintered, Abdul Hamid II briefly regained his sultanate with a populist appeal to <b>Islamism.</b> 30,000 Armenians perished in the subsequent Adana Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Modernism {{differs from}} secularism {{in that it}} insists on the {{importance}} of religious faith in public life, and from Salafism or <b>Islamism</b> in that it embraces contemporary European institutions, social processes, and values.|$|E
25|$|Post-revolutionary Tunisia {{also had}} its share of {{instability}} due to the violence in Libya as it witnessed an unprecedented rise in radical <b>Islamism</b> with increased militant activity and weapons' smuggling through the border.|$|E
25|$|The {{sociologist}} Saïd Amir Arjomand {{has argued}} since 1984 that <b>Islamism</b> and fascism share essential features, an argument he made {{at some length}} in his 1989 book The Turban for the Crown; The Islamic revolution in Iran.|$|E
25|$|Hamid Dabashi is {{also the}} author of {{numerous}} articles and public speeches, ranging in their subject matters from <b>Islamism,</b> feminism, globalised empire and ideologies and strategies of resistance, to visual and performing arts in a global context.|$|E
25|$|The minister's {{ban on the}} niqāb {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by many Islamists {{as an indication of}} his hostility to Islamic fundamentalism. Baha Eddin has been outspoken in his opposition to <b>Islamism,</b> at conferences and in statements published by the media.|$|E
25|$|Since {{coming to}} power, President Sadat had started {{encouraging}} {{the growth of}} <b>Islamism</b> in the country as means to fight communist groups and solidify his own power. During the term of office of Sadat's predecessor, Gamal Abdul Nasser, Islamic {{groups such as the}} Muslim Brotherhood had been suppressed.|$|E
25|$|Bhutto {{regarded}} {{herself as}} an ardent supporter of women's rights, and took a hard stance against militant <b>Islamism.</b> Although she had to compromise with Pakistan's powerful Islamist lobby, she favoured a secular government for the country. Under Bhutto's leadership, the PPP was officially secular, as were the governments which she led.|$|E
25|$|King Faisal of Saudi Arabia {{sought to}} counter the {{influences}} of Marxism–Leninism and Arab nationalism in the region by promoting <b>Islamism</b> as an alternative. He called {{for the establishment of}} the Muslim World League, visiting several Muslim countries to advocate the idea. He also engaged in a propaganda and media war with Egypt's pan-Arabist president, Gamal Abdel Nasser.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della sera asked Foucault {{to write}} a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to Tehran in Iran, days after the Black Friday massacre. Documenting the developing Iranian Revolution, he met with opposition leaders such as Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and Mehdi Bazargan, and discovered the popular support for <b>Islamism.</b> Returning to France, {{he was one of}} the journalists who visited the Ayatollah Khomeini, before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault's response was that <b>Islamism</b> was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility. In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied Zen Buddhism under Omori Sogen at the Seionji temple in Uenohara.|$|E
25|$|The Indonesian {{government}} {{has worked with}} other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant <b>Islamism</b> and Al-Qaeda. The deadliest bombing killed 202 people (including 164 international tourists) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002. The attacks, and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries, severely damaged Indonesia's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects.|$|E
25|$|Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West is a 2005 {{documentary}} {{film about the}} threat of radical Islam to Western civilization. The film makes use of extensive Arab television footage depicting Islamic radicals preaching hate speech and seeking to incite global jihad. It also draws parallels between World War II's Nazi movement and <b>Islamism</b> and the West's response to those threats.|$|E
25|$|In a later {{repetition}} of these developments, the pan-Islamic sentiments embodied by the Muslim Brotherhood {{and other religious}} movements, would similarly provoke conflict with Palestinian nationalism. About 90% of Palestinians are Sunni Muslims, and while never absent from the rhetoric and thinking of the secularist PLO factions, Islamic political doctrines, or <b>Islamism,</b> didn't become {{a large part of}} the Palestinian movement until the 1980s rise of Hamas.|$|E
25|$|Quilliam is a London-based left-of-center {{think tank}} founded in 2008, {{that focuses on}} counter-extremism, {{specifically}} against <b>Islamism,</b> which it argues represents a desire to impose a given interpretation of Islam on society. Founded as The Quilliam Foundation, it lobbies government and public institutions for more nuanced policies regarding Islam and {{on the need for}} greater democracy in the Muslim world whilst empowering moderate Muslim voices.|$|E
25|$|The loss led Maududi to {{withdraw}} from political activism in 1971 and return to scholarship. In 1972 he resigned as JI's Ameer (leader) for reasons of health. However it was shortly thereafter that <b>Islamism</b> gathered steam in Pakistan {{in the form of}} the Nizam-i-Mustafa (Order of the Prophet) movement, an alliance of conservative political groups united against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto which the JI gave shape to and which bolstered its standing.|$|E
25|$|Taha Hussein and Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed {{were among}} the most {{influential}} 20th-century Egyptian intellectuals. Hussein was opposed to <b>Islamism</b> and one of his major contributions to the liberal movement was an examination of how Egyptian liberalism and Islam could be reconciled. He believed in freedom and equality and that Egypt should be developed as a modern, enlightened society in line with the ideas of the French Revolution and the Industrial Age.|$|E
25|$|Pope Shenouda III had {{arguments}} with then President Anwar Sadat over both the Camp David Accords {{and what he}} said was the president's deficient response to growing <b>Islamism.</b> After a series of protests that led president Sadat to depose Pope Shenouda III, he was exiled by Sadat and sent to the Nitrian Desert, to return three years after Sadat's assassination following an amnesty by Sadat's successor Hosni Mubarak.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, and with the rise of radical <b>Islamism,</b> Ethiopia again turned to the Western powers for alliance and assistance. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with US forces based out of the Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) established in Djibouti, in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Ethiopia allowed the US to station military advisors at Camp Hurso.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of the English Defence League has resulted in demonstrations in English cities with large Muslim populations. The EDL is a far-right, anti-Muslim street protest movement which opposes what it considers to be a spread of <b>Islamism,</b> Sharia law and Islamic extremism in the United Kingdom. The EDL {{has been described by}} The Jewish Chronicle as Islamophobic. The group has faced confrontations with various groups, including supporters of Unite Against Fascism (UAF) and Anonymous.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East, {{liberalism}} led to constitutional periods, {{like the}} Ottoman First and Second Constitutional Era and the Persian constitutional period, but {{declined in the}} late 1930s due the growth and opposition of <b>islamism</b> and Pan-Arab nationalism. However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas. Prominent liberals during the period were Taha Hussein, Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, Tawfiq al-Hakim, Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri, Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri and Muhammad Mandur.|$|E
25|$|In the Western European {{country of}} Belgium, Muslims made up about 5 to 7% {{of the total}} {{population}} as of 2015. Although legally anyone is free to change their religion, there is a social taboo on apostatising from Islam. Moroccan-Belgian stand-up comedian Sam Touzani is a rare example an outspoken ex-Muslim; he was condemned by several fatwas and has received hundreds of death threats online, but persists in his criticism of <b>Islamism.</b>|$|E
25|$|After his turnaround, Nawaz co-founded Quilliam {{with former}} Islamists, {{including}} Ed Husain. He wrote an autobiography, , {{which was published}} in 2012. Since then, he has become a prominent critic of <b>Islamism</b> in the United Kingdom. He is a regular op-ed contributor, debater and public commenter. He presented his views on radicalisation in front of US Senate Committee and UK Home Affairs Committee in their respective inquiries on the roots of radical extremism.|$|E
25|$|The party {{wants to}} improve {{conditions}} {{for the elderly and}} disabled, and stricter punishments for crimes such as rape, violence, sexual abuse, reckless driving, and cruelty to animals. It supports grants for specific research into terrorism, <b>Islamism,</b> and cold-war history, as well as increased defense spending. It also wants to maintain the Danish monarchy and the current Danish constitution, and to abolish the blasphemy clause and 'hate speech' clause in the Danish criminal code.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people in}} Muslim-majority {{countries}} also see Islam manifested politically as <b>Islamism.</b> Political Islam is powerful in some Muslim-majority countries. Islamic parties in Turkey, Pakistan and Algeria have taken {{power at the}} provincial level. Some in these movements call themselves Islamists, which also sometimes describes more militant Islamic groups. The relationships between these groups (in democratic countries there is usually at least one Islamic party) and their views of democracy are complex.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the first}} of several Islamic {{movements}} – including secularism, <b>Islamism</b> and Salafism – that emerged {{in the middle of the}} 19th century in reaction to the rapid changes of the time, especially the perceived onslaught of Western Civilization and colonialism on the Muslim world. Founders include Muhammad Abduh, a Sheikh of Al-Azhar University for a brief period before his death in 1905, Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani, and Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935).|$|E
