60|$|The first intimation given of the {{eccentricity}} of the testator was, I think, in {{the spring}} of 1854. He was at that time in possession of a considerable property, heavily mortgaged to one friend, and a wife of some attraction, on whose affections another friend held an encumbering lien. One day it was found that he had secretly dug, or caused to be dug, a <b>deep</b> <b>trap</b> before the front-door of his dwelling, into which a few friends, {{in the course of the}} evening, casually and familiarly dropped. This circumstance, slight in itself, seemed to point to the existence of a certain humor in the man, which might eventually get into literature, although his wife's lover--a man of quick discernment, whose leg was broken by the fall--took other views. It was some weeks later, that, while dining with certain other friends of his wife, he excused himself from the table to quietly re-appear at the front-window with a three-quarter inch hydraulic pipe, and a stream of water projected at the assembled company. An attempt was made to take public cognizance of this; but a majority of the citizens of Red Dog, who were not at dinner, decided that a man had a right to choose his own methods of diverting his company. Nevertheless, there were some hints of his insanity; his wife recalled other acts clearly attributable to dementia; the crippled lover argued from his own experience that the integrity of her limbs could only be secured by leaving her husband's house; and the mortgagee, fearing a further damage to his property, foreclosed.

50|$|For a doubly doped {{lithium niobate}} (LiNbO3) crystal there exists an optimum oxidation/reduction state for desired performance. This optimum {{depends on the}} doping levels of shallow and deep traps {{as well as the}} {{annealing}} conditions for the crystal samples. This optimum state generally occurs when 95 - 98% of the deep traps are filled. In a strongly oxidized sample holograms cannot be easily recorded and the diffraction efficiency is very low. This is because the shallow trap is completely empty and the <b>deep</b> <b>trap</b> is also almost devoid of electrons. In a highly reduced sample on the other hand, the deep traps are completely filled and the shallow traps are also partially filled. This results in very good sensitivity (fast recording) and high diffraction efficiency due to the availability of electrons in the shallow traps. However, during readout, all the deep traps get filled quickly and the resulting holograms reside in the shallow traps where they are totally erased by further readout. Hence after extensive readout the diffraction efficiency drops to zero and the hologram stored cannot be fixed.|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} in [13], {{at least two}} mechanisms with very different time constants take place in neutralizing the positive charge stored at the SiO 2 /SWCNT interface. The IDSt curves can be explained considering both the shallow and the <b>deep</b> <b>traps</b> {{at or near the}} SiO 2 /SWCNT interface. Charges stored in the shallow traps have a higher probability of escape by thermal field emission, while charges stored in the <b>deep</b> <b>traps</b> require larger gate electric field to de-trap. Hence, the <b>deep</b> <b>traps</b> effectively help maintain the long-term separation of the two current levels. In addition to the contribution from shallow traps, the rapid change that takes place during the first hour after write (or erase) pulse can be partially due to charges attracted from the surrounding air at the SiO 2 /SWCNT interface, which neutralize the stored charge. For the latter reason, low pressure favours current stability as can be seen by comparing the IDSt curves at 760 Torr and 3 × 10 − 4 Torr [13, 23]. This suggests that for better device performance exposure to air has to be avoided. In addition, low temperature further improves retention by increasing the ON/OFF current separation.|$|R
40|$|Several {{technologies}} for energy saving and storage rely on ion exchange between electrodes and electrolytes. In amorphous electrode materials, a detailed knowledge of Li-ion intercalation is hampered by limited {{information about the}} structure and transport properties of the materials. Amorphous tungsten oxide is the most studied electrochromic material and suffers from ion trapping-induced degradation of charge capacity and optical modulation span upon extensive electrochemical cycling. In this paper, we investigate trapping and detrapping processes in connection with performance degradation and specifically use real-time electro-optical monitoring to identify different trap energy ranges pertinent to the ion-intercalated system. Evidence of three kinds of traps that degrade electrochromic tungsten oxide during ion intercalation is presented: (i) shallow traps that erode the colored state, (ii) <b>deep</b> <b>traps</b> that lower the bleached-state transmittance, and (iii) irreversible traps. Importantly, Li-ion detrapping from shallow and <b>deep</b> <b>traps</b> takes place by different processes: continuous Li-ion extraction is possible from shallow traps, whereas a certain release time must be exceeded for detrapping from <b>deep</b> <b>traps.</b> Our notions for ion trapping and detrapping, presented here, {{may serve as a}} starting point for discussing ion intercalation in various amorphous materials of interest for energy-related applications...|$|R
