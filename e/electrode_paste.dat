The results also indicated that the coal tar pitches shrunk approximately 12 % if exposed to temperatures above the baking isotherm temperature up to 1300 °C, while the anthracites calcined at 1400 °C expanded 0. 6 – 1. 0 % in the same temperature range.

Applications of {{chromium}} {{vary widely}} (refractories, chemicals and metallurgical); however, the greatest benefit of chromium {{is its ability}} to improve the corrosion resistance, strength and hardness of steel. South Africa possesses approximately 75 % of the viable global chromite reserves and, as a result, dominates the ferrochrome market with production in excess of 5 million mega tonnes per year - making it an industry of extreme importance to the South African economy Submerged arc ferroalloy production furnaces mainly use Soderberg electrodes - self–baking continuous electrodes that are produced in situ during furnace operation. Electrode breakings may affect a furnace {{in a number of ways}} depending on the nature and location of the break. Low furnace power input, abnormal charging and tapping conditions, as well as loss of production are among the more common negative implications associated with electrode breaks. The successful operation of Soderberg electrodes is dependent on two main factors: high quality <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> and effective electrode management procedures. This study focused on <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> quality. The raw materials utilised in the production of Soderberg <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> consists of calcined anthracite mixed with a tar pitch binder. In this study the focus was on the development of an experimental procedure to measure the dimensional changes of <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> raw materials as a function of temperature by means of thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Three uncalcined anthracite (Zululand chips, Zululand duff, and Tendele duff) and two tar pitch samples (low and high softening point pitches, i. e. LSP and HSP) were obtained from a local paste producer. Electrode graphite samples were also obtained from a local pre–baked electrode supplier. The experimental procedure for both the anthracite and tar pitches consisted of two phases: sample preparation and TMA measurements. During the sample preparation procedure for the tar pitches, the two tar pitches were heat treated in order to prevent softening in the TMA (preventing possibly damage the instrument), where after pellets were pressed for TMA measurement. The anthracite samples were calcined at 1200, 1300 and 1400 °C in the anthracite sample preparation phase. TMA sample pellets of calcined and uncalcined anthracite were pressed using only water as a binder. TMA was performed on pellets produced from the heat–treated tar pitch samples, uncalcined and calcined anthracite samples, as well as core drilled pellets of the pre–baked electrode graphite. The dimensional changes of these pellets were measured, as a function of temperature, through three consecutive heating (room temperature to 1300 °C) and cooling (1300 °C to approximately 100 °C) cycles under a N 2 atmosphere. A significant shrinkage (> 12 %) for both the LSP and HSP tar pitches occurred during the first TMA heating cycle. During the second and third heating cycles of the LSP and HSP tar pitches, dimensional changes were approximately 2 %. This indicates that substantial structural reordering of the carbonaceous binder takes place during the first heating cycle. TMA results obtained for all three the calcined anthracite samples investigated indicated thermal dimensional changes of less than 1 %. The anthracite samples calcined at the highest experimental calcination temperature (1400 °C) prior to TMA analysis had the smallest dimensional changes. This confirmed that higher calcination temperatures result in a higher level of structural ordering and dimensional stability. Considering the combined calcined anthracite and tar pitches TMA results, the importance of the initial baking of a Soderberg electrode at temperatures exceeding the baking isotherm temperature (475 °C) becomes apparent - the dimensional behaviour of the tar pitch binder and the calcined anthracite differ dramatically, making the newly–formed electrode very susceptible to breakage. Once structural reordering of the pitch had taken place, thermal dimensional behaviours of the materials are much more similar, significantly reducing the risk of thermal shock–induced electrode breakages. In contrast to the relatively small dimensional changes measured for the calcined anthracite samples, the shrinkages measured for the uncalcined samples during the first TMA heating/cooling cycle were substantial (6 – 8 %). This indicates the importance of the anthracite calcination process, before the <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> is formulated. Improperly calcined anthracite present in <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> would result in additional dimensional shrinkage that would have to be accommodated in the baking of a new electrode section. Considering the large shrinkage of the tar pitch that already takes place, it is unlikely that a strong enough electrode would be formed if this occurs. From the results, it also became apparent that the anthracite with the highest fixed carbon and lowest ash contents exhibited the smallest shrinkage during in situ TMA calcination. High fixed carbon, low ash type anthracites are therefore less prone to dimensional instabilities in Soderberg electrodes, as a result of poor calcination. The dimensional changes observed in the calcined anthracites were very similar to those observed for the electrode graphite samples. The expansions/shrinkages observed in the graphite samples were mostly less than 0. 5 %, whereas the expansions/shrinkages observed in the various calcined anthracites were approximately 0. 6 to 0. 9 %. The difference in the magnitude of the dimensional behaviour between the calcined anthracites and the graphite can be attributed to the fact that the graphite had already undergone maximum structural ordering (having been pre–baked at 3000 °C).

Visual inspection, as well as optical microscopy and SEM, were utilized to examine the samples after heat treatment. During compatibility experiments, dissolution of refractory matrix due to solubility of oxide refractory binder phases in silicomanganese slags was observed, as well as disintegration of refractory particles due to gas formation at slag-refractory interface, or expansion as a result of phase transformations in refractory material. Direct reduction of manganese oxide from slags and iron oxide present in refractories by carbon and silicon carbide was also observed. Establishment of partial slag-metal equilibriums between iron oxide and silicon metal originally present in slag was observed, as well as formation of silicon carbide at the slag-refractory interfaces. The latter may serve to protect the refractory from wear caused by slags. Based on observations of extensive interaction between silicomanganese slag sample I and ramming paste at 1600 °C, the ramming paste investigated cannot be recommended for usage during tap block repair in an industrial silicomanganese furnace. Incipient <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> disintegration by slags and silicon carbide tap block slag interaction were observed after compatibility tests at 1464 °C, calling for further investigations of these refractory materials. Tap hole clay and carbon tap block showed minimal signs of interaction with process materials at 1464 °C. Refractory porosity seemed to have a larger effect on refractory wear than refractory ash content. Contrary to industrial observations, silicomanganese slag sample I was more corrosive towards the ramming paste and <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> investigated than silicomanganese slag sample II...|$|E
40|$|Good {{operation}} of Soderberg electrodes {{is dependent upon}} high quality <b>electrode</b> <b>paste</b> coupled with better electrode management procedures. Without having a good electrode operation, {{it is not possible}} to obtain the best outcome from the furnace. In other words that is a good way to say how important the proper electrode operation is. Good electrode performance depends on the slipping rate and current levels, which decides the shape of the baking curve at the level of just below the contact clamps. Negative curvature of baking zone in the central part is considered dangerous because shrinkage takes place outwardly creating abnormal stresses in the electrode. Soft breakages occur when the baking zone comes below the clamps and the casing cannot take the current. This paper deals with various factors affecting baking characteristics leading to soft breakages and also presents case studies in a closed 48 MVA furnace with smelting for charge chrome. In case studies in a closed furnace, it has happened that the energy for baking at the low current operation before breakage has been lower than the actual slipping has demanded. At low current there should not be problem, but a problem can occur when the current for some period is raised above the current carrying ca-pacity of the casing. So data for electrode operation in actual period was studied and presented in this paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{reduction}} of amaranth {{has been studied}} at carbon <b>paste</b> <b>electrode</b> in sulphuric acid media using cyclic voltammetric technique. The adsorption of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) on a carbon <b>paste</b> <b>electrode</b> was investigated. The results showed that CTAB exhibited two types of adsorptive behavior at a carbon <b>paste</b> <b>electrode</b> at different concentration ranges: monomer adsorption at concentrations below 10 µL and monolayer adsorption at concentrations higher than 40 µL CTAB. In the monomer adsorption range, the adsorption of CTAB could effectively reduce the charge transfer resistance and increase the charge transfer rate. However, the surface properties of the carbon <b>paste</b> <b>electrode</b> hardly changed. On {{the formation of a}} CTAB monolayer, the structure of the electrode interface changed significantly and the electrode/solution interface. The same mechanism has been proposed for SDS...|$|R
40|$|Amino {{derivatives}} of polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are well-known chemical carcinogens which should be carefully monitored in our environment. They are amenable to anodic oxida- tion on suitable solid or <b>paste</b> <b>electrodes.</b> This fact was exploited for voltammetric determina- tion of 4 -aminobiphenyl on unmodified carbon <b>paste</b> <b>electrode</b> and carbon <b>paste</b> <b>electrodes</b> modified by montmorillonite and sepiolite. The optimum pH of BR buffer for measurement on unmodified carbon <b>paste</b> <b>electrode</b> is pH 2, pH 10 for CPE-SEP and pH 11 for CPE-MMT. It was possible to increase sensitivity of the determination using adsorptive stripping voltam- metry on modified electrodes. The optimum time for accumulation of 4 -aminobiphenyl is 5 minutes. The limits of quantification {{of the order of}} 10 − 6 mol dm− 3 were obtained for each electrode. After accumulation, the limits of quantification decreased to the 10 − 7 mol dm− 3. The newly developed method was tested for the determination of 4 -aminobiphenyl in model sam- ples of drinking and river water, reaching limits of quantification of the order of 10 − 7 mol dm− 3...|$|R
