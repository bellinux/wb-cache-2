5|$|Between 1929 and 1932, John Munn {{purchased}} the mansion, dismantled it, and shipped the structure brick-by-brick to Princeton, New Jersey, {{where it was}} restored. Following Munn's death in 1956, Colross was purchased by Dr. Geoffrey W. Rake.

5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a Sunday school. This {{was also used}} as a <b>day</b> <b>school</b> from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The <b>day</b> <b>school</b> accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the <b>day</b> <b>school</b> for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of £4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any <b>day</b> <b>school</b> uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E

On the other hand, Modern Orthodox <b>day</b> <b>schools</b> are usually coeducational and stress the secular component of the curriculum, precisely because many parents wish to have their children educated at a high enough level {{to be admitted to}} the finest colleges and universities in order to train for a profession.|$|R
