Although Shang Tsung <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> reference to the rivalry between Scorpion and Sub-Zero early in the film, their relationship is not explored and both are slaves under the sorcerer's command. He is killed in combat by Liu Kang when he is impaled and frozen. In the animated film , the elder Sub-Zero was once again featured alongside Scorpion as servants to Shang Tsung and their feud was explained by Raiden through flashbacks, although interpreted differently {{from that of the}} games.|$|E
25|$|APL {{has been}} both criticized and praised for its choice of a unique, {{non-standard}} character set. Some who learn it become ardent adherents, suggesting {{that there is some}} weight behind Iverson's idea that the notation used <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices and even display monitors that could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the IBM Selectric print mechanism used with a special APL type element. One of the early APL line terminals (line-mode operation only, not full screen) was the Texas Instruments TI Model 745 (circa 1977) with the full APL character set which featured half and full duplex telecommunications modes, for interacting with an APL time-sharing service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job, called an RJE.|$|E

As a consequence of this, the popularity of Porygon and its derivates among the fans of the series has suffered.

The writers had established a groundwork for story arcs, character biographies and genealogical character links before filming of the seasons began, {{but many of the}} intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. While Ronald D.

500|$|... "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, describing it as [...] "gleefully grim". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode represented the series coming into its own, noting that [...] "Millennium, after weeks of hinting at possibilities without delivering much of anything, has finally started to give a real sense that yes, {{there is a lot}} of bad news happening, and it really <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> twisted kind of sense". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that it shared similar themes with the direction the series would take in its second season. Gibron described the episode as [...] "spooky and somewhat surreal", adding that [...] "the entire installment [...] crackles with possibilities". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] four stars out of five, describing it as being [...] "surprising, intriguing, moody and pretentious". Shearman compared the episode thematically to Mann's earlier script for [...] "The Judge", and noted that while the story [...] "doesn't make for an especially comprehensible yarn, it does produce an episode that is genuinely uneasy viewing".|$|E

2500|$|... "Letter on 'Humanism'" [...] {{is often}} seen as a direct {{response}} to Sartre's 1945 lecture [...] "Existentialism is a Humanism". Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in [...] "Letter on 'Humanism,'" [...] Heidegger asserts that [...] "Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one." [...] Heidegger's largest issue with Sartre's existential humanism is that, while it <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> humanistic 'move' in privileging existence over essence, [...] "the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement." [...] From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics {{to a place where}} the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible: only from this point can we restore (that is, re-give [...] ) any possible meaning to the word [...] "humanism".|$|E

2500|$|In statistics, a null {{hypothesis}} {{is a statement}} that one seeks to nullify with evidence to the contrary. [...] Most commonly it is a statement that the phenomenon being studied produces no effect or makes no difference. An example of a {{null hypothesis}} is the statement [...] "This diet {{has no effect on}} people's weight." [...] Usually, an experimenter frames a null hypothesis with the intent of rejecting it: that is, intending to run an experiment which produces data that shows that the phenomenon under study <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference. In some cases there is a specific alternative hypothesis that is opposed to the null hypothesis, in other cases the alternative hypothesis is not explicitly stated, or is simply [...] "the null hypothesis is false" [...] – in either event, this is a binary judgment, but the interpretation differs and is a matter of significant dispute in statistics.|$|E
2500|$|A {{distinct}} use of {{the term}} sound from its use in physics is that in physiology and psychology, where the term refers to the subject of perception by the brain. The field of psychoacoustics is dedicated to such studies. Historically the word [...] "sound" [...] referred exclusively to an effect in the mind. Webster's 1947 dictionary defined sound as: [...] "that which is heard; the effect which is produced by the vibration of a body affecting the ear." [...] This meant (at least in 1947) the correct response to the question: [...] "if a tree falls in the forest with no one to hear it fall, does it make a sound?" [...] was [...] "no". However, owing to contemporary usage, definitions of sound as a physical effect are prevalent in most dictionaries. Consequently, the answer to the same question (see above) is now [...] "yes, a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it fall <b>does</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sound".|$|E
