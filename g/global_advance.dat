Roughly speaking, according to it a scientific model is approximately true if it captures accurately {{the strengths of the}} causes present in any given situation. Against much of the literature, I argue that any satisfactory account of verisimilitude must inevitably restrict its judgments to context-specific models rather than general theories. We may still endorse – and only need – a relativized notion of scientific progress, understood now not as <b>global</b> <b>advance</b> but rather as the mastering of particular problems.

40|$|The {{confident}} expectation {{among the}} socialsciences {{late in the}} last quarter of the 20 thcentury was that Islam would wither away as the <b>global</b> <b>advance</b> of westernization brought secularization and modernization in its wake. Not only has Islam failed to follow the trajectory pursued by variants of Christianity, namely depoliticization and confinement to the private sphere; it has, in contrast, forcefully re-asserted its public presence in the world. This re-assertion is often presented in terms of geopolitical or cultural challenges to the integrity and dominance of the western enterprise. The mobilizations in the name of Islam also present an epistemological challenge for the naturalized order of western hegemony. In other words, the invocation of Islam tests the power/knowledge complex that underpins th...|$|E
40|$|This article surveys {{rumors and}} 2 ̆ 2 {{contemporary}} legends 2 ̆ 2 {{concerned with the}} contamination or adulteration of various commodities. The article compares common Euro-American folktales like the 2 ̆ 2 Kentucky Fried Rat 2 ̆ 2 or stories concerned with the explosive effects of Pop Rocks with southern African rumors about will-sapping sugar and cannibalistic tinned meat. The global prevalence of such rumors suggests that they represent a shared reaction to the advance of modern capitalism, namely, a popular critique of commodity fetishism, {{of the loss of}} social knowledge about the production of commodities. However, such a critique is mostly mischievous or at most subversive. The global prevalence of commodity rumors may suggest that capitalisms alienation is evenly balanced by its desirability, even in those societies most marginalized by its <b>global</b> <b>advance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mixing {{produced}} in convective flows is investigated comparing three different experiments {{performed by the}} authors using brine and fresh water as the two mixing fluids. The initial instabilities are generated by gravitational acceleration and as the flow becomes non-linear the role of local turbulence is examined in experiments of Rayleigh-Taylor driven front occurring across initially sharp density interfaces. The <b>global</b> <b>advance</b> of the fronts is compared with other laboratory experiments and numerical simulations and Mixing Eficiencies are compared and evaluated {{for a number of}} different situations with different initial conditions. Using a viscoelastic gel and a plate with holes in experiments similar to those reported by Linden and Redondo (1991), Gonzalez-Nieto (2004) the initial instabilities are randomized into a set of plumes in a way in which the initial conditions (viscosity of gel) are seen to modify the overall mixing efficiency.

40|$|A double {{logistic}} function {{has been used}} to describe global inventory mapping and monitoring studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) yearly evolution for the 1981 to 2003 period, in order to estimate land surface phenology parameter. A principal component analysis on the resulting time series indicates that the first components explain 36, 53 and 37 % of the variance for the start, end and length of growing season, respectively, and shows generally good spatial homogeneity. Mann–Kendall trend tests have been carried out, and trends were estimated by linear regression. Maps of these trends show a <b>global</b> <b>advance</b> in spring dates of 0. 38 days per year, a global delay in autumn dates of 0. 45 days per year and a global increase of 0. 8 days per year in the growing seasons validated by comparison with previous works.

40|$|Mixing {{generated}} by gravitational acceleration {{and the role}} of local turbulence measured through multifractal methods is examined in numerical experiments of Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov driven front occurring at density interfaces. The <b>global</b> <b>advance</b> of the fronts is compared with laboratory experiments and Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are calculated in both large eddy simulation (LES) and kinematic simulation KS models. In this experimental method, the mixing processes are {{generated by}} the evolution of a discrete set of forced turbulent plumes. We describe the corresponding qualitative results and the quantitative conclusions based on measures of the density field and of the height of the fluid layers. We present an experimental analysis to characterize the partial mixing process. The conclusions of this analysis are related to the mixing efficiency and the height of the final mixed layer as functions of the Atwood number, which ranges from 9. 8 × 10 - 3 to 1. 34 × 10 - 1 Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Turbulence affects {{molecular}} mixing {{in a large}} {{variety of}} physical processes both in the environment, in astrophysics and in industrial situations. In some events {{it is interesting to}} enhance the transport of mass, heat, humidity and pollutants, while sometimes it is interesting to reduce mixing. Here we analyse some turbulent descriptors which reflect the mixing processes in the compressible induced instabilities that take place in shocks, such as Richtmyer-Meshkov and Rayleigh-Taylor (RM and RT). We present results related to both instabilities and discuss their spatial and temporal variability during the advance of a mixing front, and also their relationships with other scaling arguments. Two types of experiments were used in this study: Mixing generated by gravitational acceleration in low Atwood number incompressible experiments using fluids; and the full compressible shocktube experiments using interfaces between different density gases. The role of local turbulence has mostly relied on advanced visualization measurements through multifractal methods. Comparisons with numerical experiments of shock driven fronts occurring at density interfaces are also relevant. The <b>global</b> <b>advance</b> of the fronts is also measured and fractal descriptors are calculated in both Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Kinematic Simulation KS models.

40|$|Existing {{research}} in urban studies has not measured or visualized the urban structural {{relations of the}} world’s largest <b>global</b> <b>advanced</b> producer service firms through social network analysis (SNA). The work of Taylor (2001, 2004) and numerous co-authors has explored the urban office locations of the world’s largest <b>global</b> <b>advanced</b> producer service firms through a – now widely questioned and rejected (see Smith, 2013) – world city interlocking network model (INM). In contrast, Alderson and Beckfield (2004, 2007, 2011) have pioneered the use of SNA (and the use of UCINET software) in world cities research. However, they have concentrated on the urban structural relations of multinational corporations and their subsidiaries. Our paper advances the study of intercity relations through undertaking the first SNA of the urban office locations of the world’s largest <b>global</b> <b>advanced</b> producer service firms. We undertake a measurement of three world city regional – North America, Europe, Pacific – datasets. Treating the pair-wise relations between world cities as symmetric (in-directed graphs) we define as connected those cities which host common firms offices (headquarters or branch). Measures of local and global centrality are then computed {{in order to identify}} hub-cities and to classify them according to their degree of centrality...|$|R

Since these instruments cannot take measurements through clouds, in cloud-covered regions or areas with suspect data quality, the prior days value is retained until a valid data reading is obtained. This visualization designates an area as covered by snow when the instrument takes a valid measurement showing greater than ~ 50 % snow coverage in that area. This area is assumed to be snow covered until the instrument takes a valid measurement showing less than 40 % snow coverage in that same area.
