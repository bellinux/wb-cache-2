25|$|Extinction is the {{technical}} term to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, {{resulting in the}} decrease of that behavior. The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction. Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of shaping procedures.|$|E

It may also be desirable to create documents that one could consider {{to be on the same}} level but have slightly different details e.g. for the same procedure performed with different equipment or at a different location.|$|E

50|$|Pawson & Tilley (1997) <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> {{followed}} {{in the implementation of}} realist evaluation techniques in programme evaluation and emphasise that once hypotheses have been generated and data collected, the outcomes of the programme are explored, focusing on the groups that the programme benefitted {{and those who did not}} benefit. Effectiveness of a programme is thus not dependent on the outcomes alone (cause-effect), rather there is a consideration of the theoretical mechanisms that are applied, and the socio-historical context in which the programmes were implemented. Thus, the final explanation of a programme considers context-mechanism-outcome.|$|E

They produced a table of suggested injection sites and doses for ten orders of arthropods. The researchers propose the name targeted hyperkalosis to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> of injecting a large dose of K+ to the thoracic ganglia. Advantages of this approach are that KCl is cheap, safe, doesn't need special storage, and preserves specimens for most research use cases except those that look at the neural culture itself. That said, the method is hard to use for small insects like Drosophila sp.|$|E

50|$|Luria's {{original}} method, {{released in}} 1966, was revised by Christensen in 1975 to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> more in-depth. This revision made possible a version that combined the {{qualitative and quantitative}} aspects of the procedures. In 1977 Charles Golden presented the Luria-South Dakota, {{a new version of}} the battery created at the University of South Dakota that combined Luria and Christensen’s works. To develop this version and ensure it covered everything from both Luria and Christensen, Golden first created an exam that took approximately 18 hours to administer and contained nearly 2,000 procedures. From this base items were selectively removed if they were found to lack reliability or validity, be repetitive, be too long, or fail to accurately discriminate a brain injury. Existing interest in Luria’s work made this battery instantly popular, and as it was circulated, demand and research only grew. Western Psychological Services created the current revision, the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. It was published in 1980 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology and the International Journal of Neuroscience.|$|E

5000|$|Self-regulation {{has been}} {{conceptualized}} in proposed models by Tsui and Ashford (1994) {{as well as}} Wood and Bandura (1989). The models have some differences but agree on a fundamental sequence where individuals (a) regulate their attention and effort around self-set goals or assigned goals, (b) take action to achieve their goals, (c) obtain their goals or their performance strategy, if necessary, to maintain or enhance their progress toward their goals and (e) recommence the cycle. Tsui and Ashford (1994) <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> as setting the goal, behaving, detecting a discrepancy, and lastly reducing any discrepancy. This process is vital in leader development because it can have {{both internal and external}} effects. As Sosik, Potosky, and Jung (2002) stated that, [...] "individuals desire congruence between their own and others’ perceptions of their behavior, and, therefore, set and work toward goals to reduce perceptual discrepancies, gain congruence, and improve their effectiveness" [...] (p. 212). This is similar to the intrapersonal competence of self-awareness as individuals want their own perception of themselves be congruent with those of others, both outlining importance for leader development.|$|E
