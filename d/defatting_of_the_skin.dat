It isa composite, multiform-type process all aspects of which have not been exactly learnt yet. This phenomenonis a comprehensive result of a natural, internal process of aging, mass of UV-radiation dose (photoaging), influenceof different environmental factors and also <b>the</b> deficiency <b>of</b> genital hormones, which in the case ofwomen at <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> around 50 is defined as menopause. Hormonal replacement therapy involves supply of feminine genital hormones for minimising of menopausesymptoms and prevention of remote consequences. HRT significantly affects subjective self-assessment of theskin condition by women in menopause and changes some biophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface. Aims: to demonstrate changes to some biophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> affected by hormonal replacementtherapy and compare them with subjective self-assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> condition by women in menopause. Methods: Measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> surface (sebumetry, corneometry, pH-metry, mexametryand TEWL); questionnaire of subjective self-assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> condition by women in menopause. Results: Hormonal replacement therapy affects some biophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface. HRT increasedthe sebum level, water content, decreased erythema <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and reduced <b>the</b> transepidermal waterloss (TEWL). <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> melanin within skin grows due to the feminine hormone genital application. Subjectiveself-assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> condition by women in menopause does not correlate with results of measurementsof biophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface. Conclusions: Hormonal replacement therapy changes some biophysical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface andconsiderably improves appearance and functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> women in menopause.

40|$|Several {{approaches}} {{were examined}} for extracting the relatively hydrophobic protein recombinant dog gastric lipase (rDGL) expressed in <b>the</b> endosperm <b>of</b> transgenic corn seed. The first approach used minimal processing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seed before extraction (i. e. simple grinding of whole seed) followed by selective extraction to eliminate 72 % of contaminant proteins without compromising rDGL recovery from <b>the</b> meal <b>of</b> whole grain. <b>The</b> second approach added <b>defatting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole grain meal to reduce <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> detergent in <b>the</b> subsequent step for extracting rDGL. The third approach incorporated dry-milling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corn to recover an endosperm rich fraction, followed by extraction <b>of</b> this fraction. <b>The</b> dry milling strategy was most effective, resulting in recovery of 35 U rDGL/g of corn seed (50 U/g of endosperm) {{with a specific}} activity of 9 U/mg compared to 22 U and 3 U/mg for the first strategy and 36 U and 3. 7 U/mg for the second.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between <b>the</b> yellow colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and serum bilirubin concentration, reserve albumin concentration, and pH {{was investigated in}} 76 icteric neonates. Significant linear correlation existed between yellow colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and serum bilirubin concentration, reciprocal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reserve albumin concentration, and the squared hydrogen ion concentration. Furthermore, <b>the</b> basic yellowness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> at birth correlated linearily with <b>the</b> yellow colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> measured when <b>the</b> child became jaundiced. The results support the proposed hypothesis that bilirubin is transferred from plasma to skin through two different mechanisms: (a) leakage of bilirubin-albumin complexes into extravascular spaces and (b) precipitation of bilirubin acid in phospholipid membranes. The latter mechanism suggests that measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yellow colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{may be a better}} predictor of brain damage than the serum bilirubin concentration and thus be of clinical utility. Measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yellow colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> as a method of obtaining serum bilirubin concentration is unreliable...|$|R

5000|$|Irritant diaper {{dermatitis}} develops when skin {{is exposed to}} prolonged wetness, increased skin pH caused by urine and feces, and resulting breakdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stratum corneum, or outermost layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> This {{may be due to}} diarrhea, frequent stools, tight diapers, overexposure to ammonia, or allergic reactions.

40|$|In {{modelling}} {{and understanding}} the contact and friction behaviour <b>of</b> human <b>skin,</b> <b>the</b> elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is an important input parameter. For <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> design rules for <b>the</b> engineering <b>of</b> surfaces in contact with <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> an expression that describes the relation between <b>the</b> elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact is essential. Although an exact description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> requires an anisotropic, nonlinear, viscoelastic model, in this study {{it was found that}} for contact modelling involving relatively small deformations, the mechanical behaviour seems to be accurately described by a single parameter: the effective elastic modulus. The effective elastic modulus is shown to decrease several orders <b>of</b> magnitude when <b>the</b> length scale increases, which is <b>the</b> consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rather complex anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> At an indentation depth <b>of</b> 10 [*]µm, <b>the</b> effective elastic modulus was shown to decrease from 0. 15 to 0. 015 [*]MPa when <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indenter increases from 10 [*]µm to 10 [*]mm. <b>The</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elasticity is explained by the variation in the composition and properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>skin</b> layers. This study shows that for <b>the</b> contact modelling <b>of</b> human skin, a closed-form expression based on <b>the</b> anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> exists, which yields <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effective elastic modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact depending on variables such as age, gender and environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Lymphoepithelioma-like {{carcinoma}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is a rare, low malignant cutaneous neoplasm. We {{report a}} case of an elderly woman with lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> in <b>the</b> forehead.

A histological reassessment showed lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> with perineural invasion, which is rare and considered more aggressive. The patient therefore received adjuvant radiotherapy after the recommended wide excision. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is a variant of squamous cell carcinoma, and histologically, it resembles the more aggressive lymphoepithelioma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nasopharynx.
