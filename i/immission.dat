[...] Citizens cooperatives (Genossenschaft) participating in wind energy tenders have special dispensations. [...] Wind energy auctions will be held more often in the beginning, with three in 2017 and four in 2018, in order to quickly establish a price level. [...] The annual capacity for onshore wind farms will be set at 2.8GW per year for 2017 to 2019 and at 2.9GW thereafter. [...] In order to better synchronise the development of the grid with renewables growth, the addition of onshore wind will be restricted to specified 'grid congestion zones' where high inputs of renewable electricity cannot be accepted because of network congestion. [...] These areas are to be identified by the Federal Network Agency. [...] The new rules on funding offshore wind farms will apply to those projects that commence operation in 2021 or later. [...] From 2025, the government will specify the sites for future wind farms and investors will then compete for the right to build at those locations. [...] This centralised (Danish) model is designed to ensure competition and to make project approvals, site planning, and network connections more cost effective and better integrated. [...] Between 2021 and 2024 a transitional auction model will be used and wind farms that have been planned and approved but not built will compete in two rounds of tenders for a restricted amount of capacity. [...] Offshore wind will remain capped at 15GW by 2030 and the capacity auctioned each year will be consistent with this target. [...] In 2021, only wind farms in the Baltic Sea will be considered, due to a shortage of network connections at the North Sea. [...] Biomass projects will also participate in the new auction system. [...] Biomass capacity is to be expanded by 150MW annually in the next three years and by 200MW annually for the following three years. [...] Installations with a capacity greater than 150kW will also be able to tender. [...] Biomass facilities will only receive remuneration for half their runtime in order to incentivize their use during times of high electricity prices. [...] Hydroelectricity, geothermal, and mine, landfill, and sewage gas are excluded from the auction system because of the prospect of insufficient competition.|$|E

40|$|This keynote {{introduces}} various {{contributions to}} a structured session on sound quality {{organized by the}} present author. In the last decade, basic research as well as practical applications of sound quality increased substantially. This holds true for sound quality of emissions e. g. in product sound {{as well as for}} sound quality of <b>immissions</b> e. g. in the environment. For product sound, two cases of sound quality are considered: one, where sound quality is the dominant, generic feature of a product like musical instruments or loudspeakers, and a second, where sound quality is a by-product like the sound of Dieselengines or- to give a more exotic example- the sound quality of snoring. As concerns sound <b>immissions,</b> wanted sounds typical for a soundscape and unwanted sounds typical for noise <b>immissions</b> can be distinguished. However, also sounds blending perfectly into a soundscape like the noise of a chain saw in the soundscape of a forest, may be pretty annoying. For both product sound and sound quality of the environment, influences of the meaning of sounds have to be considered. Additional extra-aural effects like the image of brand names or audio-visual interactions can significantly influence sound quality judgements. ...|$|R

5000|$|... {{there are}} three levels of {{regulation}} for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad subjective <b>immission</b> control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an objective <b>immission</b> control that uses specific levels of sound {{considered to be a}} noise disturbance. Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation. The concept that a potential violator should have fair warning that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} {{is aimed at}} improving {{the knowledge of the}} mobility of the heavy metals cadmium and zinc in vulnerable soil types. We use the term vulnerable with reference to vulnerability of groundwater for contamination by soil leaching. At diffuse soil <b>immissions</b> of heavy metals, accumulation is often supposed to occur mainly in the topsoil. Binding of heavy metals in this soil compartment is relatively strong, because of de presence of soil organic matter, clay-minerals and sesquioxides. If soil contains little organic matter and no clay minerals a reduced accumulation in the topsoil and an increased leaching of heavy metals to the groundwater is expected. Also the pH of the soil is of influence on this leaching. Cadmium contamination of the environment has drawn attention since the sixties. The most important occasion was an environmental calamity in Japan where rice paddy was irrigated by cadmium contaminated river water. The pollution was originated from an upstream situated mine. Also in the Netherlands concern exists about pollution of the environment by cadmium. Especially in the Dutch-Belgian Kempen elevated cadmium contents are found in soils and plants, as a result of industrial pollution.

40|$|Without any doubt, the noxa "noise" {{brings about}} {{economically}} measurable {{damage to the}} health and performance of people concerned. In 2004, more than 30 % of the population in the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg felt annoyed by traffic noise and almost 20 % by aircraft noise. Noise emitted from industrial plants and leisure time facilities must still be added to these noise sources. So far, the individual types of noise sources were considered separately. Requirements, calculation and measurement methods are available for the respective types of noise. The impact of the individual types of noise, however, cannot be taken into consideration separately but must be integrally assessed as a totality of noise sources.

40|$|Abstract Background Unmanaged or {{old-growth forests}} are of {{paramount}} importance for carbon sequestration and thus for the mitigation of climate change among further implications, e. g. biodiversity aspects. Still, the importance of those forests for climate change mitigation compared to managed forests is under controversial debate. We evaluate the adequacy of referring to CO 2 flux measurements alone and include external impacts on growth (nitrogen <b>immissions,</b> increasing temperatures, CO 2 enrichment, changed precipitation patterns) for an evaluation of central European forests in this context. Results We deduce {{that the use of}} CO 2 flux measurements alone does not allow conclusions on a superiority of unmanaged to managed forests for mitigation goals. This is based on the critical consideration of uncertainties and the application of system boundaries. Furthermore, the consideration of wood products for material and energetic substitution obviously overrules the mitigation potential of unmanaged forests. Moreover, impacts of nitrogen <b>immissions,</b> CO 2 enrichment of the atmosphere, increasing temperatures and changed precipitation patterns obviously lead to a meaningful increase in growth, even in forests of higher age. Conclusions An impact of unmanaged forests on climate change mitigation cannot be valued by CO 2 flux measurements alone. Further research is needed on cause and effect relationships between management practices and carbon stocks in different compartments of forest ecosystems in order to account for human-induced changes. Unexpected growth rates in old-growth forests – managed or not – can obviously be related to external impacts and additionally to management impacts. This should lead to the reconsideration of forest management strategies. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper assesses {{and compares}} {{existing}} and new technologies for space heating in Germany (e. g., heat pumps, and solar thermal and wood pellet systems) {{in terms of}} their environmental impacts. The various technologies were analyzed {{within the context of the}} new German legislation. The assessment was carried out on three levels: 1. Global emissions: a life cycle assessment was carried out in order to find the global environmental footprint of the various technologies; 2. Local emissions: the effects of local emissions on human health were analyzed; and 3. Immissions: the <b>immissions</b> were evaluated for the various technologies using a dispersion calculation. A special feature of this study is the substitution of frequently used database emission values by values obtained from field studies and our own measurements. The results show large differences between the different technologies: while electric heat pumps performed quite well in most categories, wood pellet systems performed the best with respect to climate change. The latter, however, are associated with high impacts in other environmental impact categories and on a local scale. The promotion of some technologies (especially systems based on fuel oil, a mixture of fuel oil and rapeseed oil, or a mixture of natural gas and biomethane) by the newly introduced German legislation is doubtful. In terms of the <b>immissions</b> of wood pellet systems, it can be concluded that, even for extremely unfavorable meteorological conditions, the regulatory limits are not exceeded and the heating systems have a negligible influence on the total PM load in the ambient air. heating systems; life cycle assessment; immissions; particulate matter; dispersion calculation...|$|R
