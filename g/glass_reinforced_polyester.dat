40|$|The {{flexural}} and compressive {{properties of}} <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polyester</b> (GRP) plates after exposure to fire are investigated. Large plates of the GRP composite {{were exposed to}} a kerosene fuel tray fire for times up to 10 min.

The residual flexural and compressive properties were measured at room temperature, and were found to decrease rapidly with increasing exposure time. It is shown that the post-fire structural properties can be approximated by modelling the burnt plate as a bi-layer material using a rule-of-mixtures formulation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{important}} issue {{of finding a}} relationship between a macroscopic damage variable {{and the process of}} damage accumulation within a material is addressed in this article. Monotonic and cyclic deformation behavior has been studied in a randomly distributed <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>polyester</b> matrix composite. The composite material is called sheet molding compound, abbreviated as SMC, with a short glass fiber weight of 30 %. The damage evolution in this planar isotropic material is studied by continuously monitor-ing axial, lateral, and specimen thickness strain components on the specimen. Based on these measurements, the damage volumetric strain was calculated that increased continu-ously with cycles in load-controlled experiments. However, in the strain-controlled experi-ments, where tensile stresses decayed rapidly with cycles, the corresponding damage volumetric strain reached a saturation level. Microscopic observations revealed that cracks grew along the matrix/fiber interfaces as well as the matrix/filler interfaces. Many of these cracks are normal to the specimen thickness direction. This observation is consistent with the increasing specimen thickness strain measured in the experiments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Composite materials, such as <b>glass</b> fibre <b>reinforced</b> {{polymers}} (GFRPs), {{possess the}} advantages of high strength and stiffness, low density, as well as manufacturing flexibility; therefore, their potential in replacing conventional materials (such as concrete, aluminium and steel) in building construction has become attractive. One of the major issues that hinder the extensive use of composite structures in high-rise building technology is related to their fire resistance performance. Significant efforts have been devoted to develop better material systems and composite manufacturing technologies to comply with various building construction safety codes, while maintaining the architectural aesthetic appeal. This paper presents the potential use of fibre reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) in modern façade systems, with a special focus on their fire performance.
