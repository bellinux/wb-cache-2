In this work, simulations of different loading cases are carried out on small samples of textile composites, taking into account all individual fibers of the fabric and interactions taking place between them. The most delicate issue is related to the modelling of contact-friction interactions between fibers,and the solution of the nonlinear problem that follows up by the means of robust algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms, and the increase of capacities of high performance computing, allow to simulate samples made of several hundreds of <b>interlocked</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Typically, {{continuous}} filament composite components are fabricated using a filament winding technique. In this operation, fibers {{are introduced to}} a rotating mandrel while a guide holding the material traverses {{back and forth to}} place the material in a helical pattern over the surface of the mandrel. This procedure is continued until complete coverage is obtained. An alternative method for fabricating {{continuous filament}} composite components is braiding. In the braiding operation a mandrel is traversed {{through the center of the}} braider while 144 strands of material traverse around a carrier ring. As the fibers are applied to a mandrel surface, 72 carriers holding the fibers travel clockwise, while another 72 carriers travel counterclockwise to <b>interlock</b> <b>fibers.</b> An additional 72 carriers located on the back of the braider introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite giving the composite lateral strength. The goal of using the braider is to reduce production time by simultaneously applying 144 strands of material onto a mandrel as opposed to the four-strand wrapping most filament winding techniques offer. Benefits to braiding include the ability to (1) introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite structure; (2) fabricate non-symmetric components without using complex functions to produce full coverage; and (3) produce a component with a higher degree of damage tolerance due to the <b>interlocking</b> of <b>fibers.</b> The fabrication of bore evacuator chambers for a tank cannon system is investigated by utilizing a 144 carrier braiding machine, an industrial robot, and a resin applicator system...|$|R

50|$|Spinning is the {{practice}} of combining a small set of threads to achieve a long and continuous thread {{with the use of}} an instrument called a spindle. The zone is an instrument made of a small wand that usually gets thinner at both ends; that was used alongside a tortera or piruro. The spindle is inserted into the bottom to make a counterweight. It starts spinning, taking the rueca (where the fiber was set to be spun). Fibers that are laid down in the zone are quickly turned between the thumb and index fingers and twisted to <b>interlock</b> the <b>fibers,</b> creating a long thread. After the desired lengths of threads are attained, the threads are intersected and woven in various combinations to make fabrics.|$|R
40|$|MnO 2 is {{currently}} under extensive investigations for its capacitance properties. MnO 2 crystallizes into several crystallographic structures, namely, α, β, γ, δ, and λ structures. Because these structures {{differ in the}} way MnO 6 octahedra are interlinked, they possess tunnels or interlayers with gaps of different magnitudes. Because capacitance properties are due to tercalation/deintercalation of protons or cations in MnO 2, only some crystallographic structures, which possess sufficient gaps to accommodate these ions, {{are expected to be}} useful for capacitance studies. In order to examine the dependence of capacitance on crystal structure, the present study involves preparation of these various crystal phases of MnO 2 in nanodimensions and to evaluate their capacitance properties. Results of α-MnO 2 prepared by a microemulsion route (α-MnO 2 (m)) are also used for comparison. Spherical particles of about 50 nm, nanorods of 30 − 50 nm in diameter, or <b>interlocked</b> <b>fibers</b> of 10 − 20 nm in diameters are formed, which depend on the crystal structure and the method of preparation. The specific capacitance (SC) measured for MnO 2 is found to depend strongly on the crystallographic structure, and it decreases in the following order: α(m) > α δ > γ > λ > β. A SC value of 297 F g- 1 is obtained for α-MnO 2 (m), whereas it is 9 F g- 1 for β-MnO 2. A wide (4. 6 Å) tunnel size and large surface area of α-MnO 2 (m) are ascribed as favorable factors for its high SC. A large interlayer separation (7 Å) also facilitates insertion of cations in δ-MnO 2 resulting in a SC close to 236 F g- 1. A narrow tunnel size (1. 89 Å) does not allow intercalation of cations into β-MnO 2. As a result, it provides a very small SC...|$|R
40|$|CMC hot-section {{components}} in advanced engines {{for power and}} propulsion will typically require high cracking strength, high ultimate strength and strain, high creep- rupture resistance, and high thermal conductivity in all directions. In the past, NASA has demonstrated fabrication {{of a variety of}} SiC/SiC flat panels and round tubes with various 2 D fiber architectures using the high-modulus high-performance Sylramic-iBN Sic fiber and Sic-based matrices derived by CVI, MI, and/or PIP processes. The thermo- mechanical properties of these CMC have shown state-of-the-art performance, but primarily in the in-plane directions. Currently NASA is extending the thermostructural capability of these SiC/SiC systems in the thru-thickness direction by using various 2. 5 D and 3 D fiber architectures. NASA is also using specially designed fabrication steps to optimize the properties of the BN-based interphase and Sic-based matrices. In this study, Sylramic-iBN/SiC panels with 2 D plain weave, 2. 5 D satin weave, 2. 5 D ply-to-ply interlock weave, and 3 D angle <b>interlock</b> <b>fiber</b> architectures, all woven at AITI, were fabricated using matrix densification routes previously established between NASA and GEPSC for CVI-MI processes and between NASA and Starfire-Systems for PIP processes. Introduction of the 2. 5 D fiber architecture along with an improved matrix process was found to increase inter-laminar tensile strength from 1. 5 - 2 to 3 - 4 ksi and thru-thickness thermal conductivity from 15 - 20 to 30 - 35 BTU/ft. hr. F with minimal reduction in in-plane strength and creep-rupture properties. Such improvements should reduce thermal stresses and increase the thermostructural operating envelope for SiC/SiC engine components. These results are analyzed to offer general guidelines for selecting fiber architectures and constituent processes for high-performance SiC/SiC engine components...|$|R

Overall, foam composites which were prepared with longer glass fibers exhibit better mechanical and thermal properties than those prepared with shorter glass fibers due to higher <b>interlocking</b> between the <b>fibers</b> and the foam cells, which result in better load distribution in the matrix...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBecause wood–plastic {{composites}} (WPC) strength {{relies on}} fiber-matrix interaction at fiber surface, {{it is likely}} that fiber surface chemistry {{plays an important role in}} WPC strength development. The objective of the present study is to investigate the relationships between fiber surface chemical characteristics and WPC mechanical properties. Different fibers were selected and characterized for surface chemical characteristics using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). WPC samples were manufactured at 40 % fiber content and with six different fibers. High density polyethylene was used as matrix and maleated polyethylene (MAPE) was used as compatibility agent. WPC samples were tested for mechanical properties and fiber-matrix interface was observed with scanning electron microscope. It was found WPC strength decreases as the amount of unoxidized carbon (assigned to lignin and extractives) measured with XPS on fiber surface increases. In the opposite case, WPC strength increases with increasing level of oxidized carbon (assigned to carbohydrates) on fiber surface. The same conclusions were found with FTIR where WPC strength decreases as lignin peaks intensity increases. Esterification reaction of fibers with MAPE occurs on polar sites of carbohydrates, such as hydroxyls (Osingle bondH). Thus, fibers with carbohydrates-rich surface, such as cellulose pulp, produced stronger WPC samples. Other factors such as mechanical <b>interlocking</b> and <b>fiber</b> morphology interfered with the effects of fiber surface chemistry...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fiber/epoxy resin {{composites}} are considered. The {{nature of}} the fiber structure and the interaction that occurs at the interface between fiber and matrix are emphasized. Composite toughness can be improved by increased axial tensile and compressive strengths in the fibers. The structure of carbon fibers indicates that the fiber itself can fail transversely, and different transverse microstructures could provide better transverse strengths. The higher surface roughness of lower modulus and surface-treated carbon fibers provides better mechanical <b>interlocking</b> between the <b>fiber</b> and matrix. The chemical {{nature of the}} fiber surface was determined, and adsorption of species on this surface {{can be used to}} promote wetting and adhesion.

40|$|Organic fibers {{generally}} have smooth surfaces and little superficial energy, which result in low {{adherence to the}} matrix. These fibers usually do not have chemical functional groups to form covalent bonds in the fiber– matrix interface. The most common treatments modify the fibers by removing the superficial layer, changing the topography and the chemical nature of the surface. Plasma treatment improves fiber-matrix adhesion largely by introducing polar or excited groups or even a new polymer layer that can form strong covalent bonds between the fiber and the matrix, and sometimes by roughening the surface of fibers to increase mechanical <b>interlocks</b> between the <b>fiber</b> and the matrix. In this study, jute fibers were subjected to low temperature oxygen plasma treatment to modify the fiber surface. The influence of plasma powers on the mechanical properties of jutefiber/high density polyetylene (HDPE) composites was investigated.

40|$|Abstract: Thermoset {{bioresin}} was synthesized from {{lactic acid}} and glycerol, and the resin was characterized {{for it to}} be used in composite applications. On the other hand, regenerated cellulose fibers were surface treated to improve the physico–chemical interactions at the fiber–matrix interface. The effect of surface treatments, silane and alkali, on regenerated cellulose fibers was studied by using the treated fibers as reinforcement in lactic acid thermoset bioresin. Mechanical tests were used as indicator of the improvement of the interfacial strength. Fiber surface treatments and the effect on adhesion to the matrix were characterized using microscopy images and thermal conductivity. Mechanical properties of the composites showed an increase when treated with silane as the bi-functional silane molecule acts as link between the regenerated cellulose fiber and the bioresin. Porosity volume decreased significantly on silane treatment due to improved interface and <b>interlocking</b> between <b>fiber</b> and matrix. Decrease in water absorption and increase in contact angle confirmed the change in the hydrophilicity of the composites. The storage modulus increased when the reinforcements were treated with silane whereas the damping intensity decreased for the same composites indicating a better adhesion between fiber and matrix on silane treatment. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the thermal stability of the reinforcement altered after treatments. The resin curing was followed using differential scanning calorimetry and the necessity for post-curing was recommended. Finite element analysis was used to predict the thermal behavior of the composites and a non-destructive resonance analysis was performed to ratify the modulus obtained from tensile testing.

The results showed that silane treatment improved the mechanical properties of the composites as the silane molecule acts as link between the cellulose fiber and the resin (the fiber bonds with siloxane bridge while the resin bonds with organofunctional group of the bi-functional silane molecule) which gives molecular continuity in the interphase of the composite.

40|$|The {{influence}} of crenulated noncircular fibers on the micromechanical stress states {{due to a}} transverse strain and to a temperature change in carbon/carbon composites is examined using the finite element method. Stresses at the interface of both fully bonded and fully disbonded fibers having two crenulation amplitudes and with two fiber volume fractions are presented. In each case, these interface stresses are compared to stresses at the interface of circular fibers which have {{the same degree of}} disbond and fiber volume fraction and are under the same loading conditions. For the disbonded cases, deformed meshes showing locations of fiber/matrix contact are also included. In addition to the interface stress states, selected composite properties are also computed and compared in each case examined. Interest in studying noncircular fibers stems from a desire to increase the transverse properties of carbon/carbon by introducing a mechanical <b>interlocking</b> between the <b>fiber</b> and the matrix. Results presented here indicate that this interlocking does in fact occur. Evidence from the interface stress data suggests, however, that any possible advantage of this interlocking may be outweighed by the disadvantage of stress concentrations which arise at the interface due to the crenulated geometry of the fibers...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 Reinforced {{polymeric}} composites are {{an increasingly}} utilized material {{with a wide}} range of applications. Fiber reinforced polymeric composites, in particular, possess impressive mechanical properties at a fraction of the weight of many other building materials. There will always, however, be a demand for producing lighter, stiffer, and stronger materials. Understanding the mechanism of adhesion and ways to engineer the reinforcement-matrix interphase can lead to the development of new materials with improved mechanical properties, and even impart additional functionality such as electrical conductivity. The performance of reinforced polymeric composites is critically dependent upon the adhesion between the reinforcement and the surrounding polymer. The relative adhesion between a filler and a thermoplastic matrix can be predicted using calculable thermodynamic quantities such as the Gibbs free energy of mixing. A recent model, COSMO-SAC, is capable of predicting the adhesion between organo-silane treated glass surfaces and several thermoplastic materials. COSMO-SAC uses information based on the charge distribution of a molecule’s surface to calculate many thermodynamic properties. Density functional theory calculations, which are relative inexpensive computations, generate the information necessary to perform the COSMO-SAC analysis and can be performed on any given molecule. The flexibility of the COSMO-SAC model is one of the main advantages it possesses over other methods for calculating thermodynamic quantities. In many cases the adhesion between a reinforcing fiber and the surrounding matrix may be improved by incorporating interphase modifiers in the vicinity of the fiber surface. The modifiers can improve the fracture toughness and modulus of the interphase, which may improve the stress transfer from the matrix to the fiber. In addition, the interphase modifiers may improve the mechanical <b>interlock</b> between the <b>fiber</b> surface and the bulk polymer, leading to improved adhesion. In recent years, the use of so called “migrating agents” have been used to self-assemble nanoparticle reinforced fiber-matrix interphases in thermosetting resin systems. The inclusion of a modest amount of thermoplastic migrating agent can lead to the formation of a self-assembled interphase, without causing aggregation of nanoparticles in the bulk phase. Formulations containing excess migrating agent, however, can induce aggregation in the bulk of increasing severity with increasing migrating agent concentration. Several techniques were used to study the mechanism by which the migrating agents operate including, scanning electron microscopy, and in situ fluorescence microscopy. The self-assembly mechanism by which migrating agents operate is described well by depletion forces, which are depend on the geometry of the approaching objects, as well as the migrating agent molecular weight and concentration...|$|R
