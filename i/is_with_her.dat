500|$|The use of film, {{rather than}} digital, cameras {{added to the}} [...] "old-fashioned" [...] nature of the production.

When Bella was with Edward, the camera was moved on a dolly, in a very rigid, straight line to reflect how their relationship was [...] "perfect". When Bella is with Jacob, the Steadicam provided a fluid and organic style; and when she <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> schoolmates, a slangy visual language was reflected by a handheld.|$|E

The single version of the song features a [...] "loping hip-hop beat and a staccato piano sample" [...] while Stefani [...] "splits wailing time with a chorus of alarms," [...] according to Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork Media. It also presents elements of reggae music and [...] "military snare drums" [...] mixed with crunk militarism. Lyrically, on [...] "Now That You Got It", the singer tells her lover that even though he <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> he still has {{to work hard to}} keep her and give her everything she wants.

500|$|Representing {{as he did}} a {{state in}} the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance {{on the issues that}} were tearing the nation apart. The {{occasion}} arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as [...] "probably his most effective speech in the Senate." [...] One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by [...] "the people," [...] he said: [...] "States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people." [...] He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: [...] "It is not for me to indicate the path she [...] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> and she will find me treading it with undivided affections." ...|$|E
500|$|Pauline {{is shown}} to be {{particularly}} hostile to the various female characters that feature in her sons' lives, and she epitomises the archetypal [...] "mother-in-law from hell". One of Pauline's most notable feuds <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> youngest son Martin's wife, Sonia. Animosity between the characters begins in 2000, when Sonia gives birth to Pauline's grandchild and decides to give the baby Chloe (later renamed Rebecca) up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort [...] "YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!" [...] The feuding over Chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline {{is shown to}} visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin's wishes, and then, following Sonia's affair with Naomi Julien, Pauline refuses to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regains custody. Critic for The Guardian, Grace Dent, commented [...] "At one point, you couldn't move around Walford for hitmen and gangsters, but now they've all been written out... leaving Pauline Fowler to reign the square like sodding Pablo Escobar in a sky-blue tabard and ski-pants, decreeing who can see their own kids, who can drink where and what everyone's eating in the cafe so as they won't spoil their teas. If I was Sonia, I'd have ransacked the hospital's dangerous drugs box by now and given that old crone a renal meltdown." [...] Various rows, slaps and insults were featured between the characters, caused by Pauline's continuous interference in Sonia's relationships with Martin and Rebecca. As Martin began to cede, allowing Sonia access to their daughter, Pauline was shown to concoct ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement.|$|E
