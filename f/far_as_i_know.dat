25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

[...] Ramsay recalls that [...] "The name [...] "Lobster" [...] was Steve Dorril's choice. I couldn't think of an alternative and I didn't think the name mattered.

It contains elements of pop and country music. Spence D. of the website IGN felt that Shakira adopted an [...] "almost modern day country-styled pop aesthetic". Throughout the song, her vocals are subdued, complete with [...] "rolling delivering, breathy accentuations, and... trill". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the lyrics [...] "You said you would love me until you died/And as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're still alive" [...] were similar to Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] (1995).|$|E

However, in 2002 editor Simon Wright {{resigned}} as {{he believed that}} the managing director of The Automobile Association intervened to prevent Pétrus from receiving a fifth rosette at the recommendation of the AA's inspectors.

This was followed by the resignation of inspector Sarah Peart over the same issue. The AA eventually relented and awarded Pétrus five rosettes.

500|$|Crane's poems, {{which he}} {{preferred}} to call [...] "lines", are typically not given as much scholarly attention as his fiction; no anthology contained Crane's verse until 1926. [...] Although it is not certain when Crane began to write poetry seriously, he once said that his overall poetic aim was [...] "to give my ideas {{of life as a}} whole, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it". [...] The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, The Black Riders and Other Lines and War is Kind, was unconventional for the time in that it was written in free verse without rhyme, meter, or even titles for individual works. [...] They are typically short in length; although several poems, such as [...] "Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind", use stanzas and refrains, most do not. [...] Crane also differed from his peers and poets of later generations in that his work contains allegory, dialectic and narrative situations.|$|E

He told his publisher, [...] "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to Asa Gray he said, [...] "I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists." [...] Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: [...] "next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." [...] However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, [...] "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> has cared for it." [...] The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.|$|E
500|$|Later authors {{appreciated}} Hebel's work too. Hermann Hesse once commented, [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> in no {{literary history}} do we yet read that Hebel {{was the greatest}} German novelist, as great as Keller and more confident and purer and mightier in effect than Goethe." [...] Theodor W. Adorno lauded his essay Die Juden as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} German prose plays in defence of the Jews". In Die gerettete Zunge, Geschichte einer Jugend, Elias Canetti described the influence that Hebel's Schatzkästlein had on him: [...] "I never wrote a book, but that I did not secretly aspire to his style, and I began by writing everything in shorthand, the knowledge of which I owe to him alone." [...] Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote, [...] "Hebel's stories are among the most beautiful in the German language", and included the [...] "Schatzkästlein" [...] and [...] "Die Rose" [...] in his Kanon Deutscher Literatur. [...] The first was also listed in the ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher.|$|E
500|$|According to Experience bassist Noel Redding, Hendrix {{told him}} it was about Hendrix's girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan. [...] Jimi's brother, Leon Hendrix, also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also {{included}} her sister Maddy, although their house was brown. Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by Linda Keith, Keith Richards' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter. [...] Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor, as the [...] "red house", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966. In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed [...] "Red House" [...] at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, he dedicated the song to her and added [...] "I {{got to get out of}} here, because my Linda don't live here no more" [...] to the lyrics. However, Billy Cox, longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix's post-Experience groups, explained, [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place or thing. [...] It was just a blues number that Jimi put together".|$|E

500|$|In the past, numismatic {{writers have}} {{described}} the Association and its activities harshly. Bowers states that the Oregon Trail coins [...] "are beautiful, but circumstances surrounding their issuance leave much to be desired". Slabaugh noted that [...] "Artistically, {{this is my favorite}} commemorative coin. [...] But from an ethical standpoint, it is not." [...] Swiatek and Breen wrote that the Association's [...] "activities in exploiting coin collectors and the general public eventually led to the unpopularity of commemoratives in Congress and ultimately to adamant Treasury Department opposition to any further commemorative issues, no matter how worthy the cause to be memorialized, no matter who represented the sponsoring commissions". [...] According to Bowers, [...] "as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars, 'to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion,' to erect 'suitable monuments, memorial and otherwise,' etc., never came to pass, at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins." [...] These, however, did not have the benefit of examining OTMA records. [...] Following the opening of Driggs's papers for research at Southern Utah University, an October 2013 article in The Numismatist concluded that though many documents, such as the arrangements with Scott's, are missing from his records, what there is [...] "seems consistent with Driggs wanting to use the coins to finance the marking of the Oregon Trail, not to line his own pockets".|$|E
500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun looking ahead {{to the possibility of}} a film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] in thinking about a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> right now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious about saying oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch kind of movie, but I could be totally wrong about that. I don't know." ...|$|E
