50|$|In California, in {{addition}} to <b>intra-LATA</b> and inter-LATA calling, there are ZUM (Zone Usage Measurement) areas within the local Service Areas.|$|E
50|$|As LATAs {{exist for}} US {{regulatory}} purposes, where {{they serve as}} a demarcation between <b>intra-LATA</b> calls (handled by regional Bell operating companies) and inter-LATA calls (handled by interstate long distance carriers such as AT&T), they have no legal significance in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{the local}} calling area {{includes}} a 13-mile (21 km) radius {{from the point}} of origination. The ZUM zone beyond that is divided into ZUM1 (12-13 mile radius), ZUM2 (14-15 mile (24 km) radius), and ZUM3 (15-16 mile (26 km) radius). Beyond the ZUM zone calls are considered <b>intra-LATA</b> or inter-LATA.|$|E

50|$|After the {{introduction}} of local exchange competition, most telephone companies outsourced directory assistance service to nationwide call centers. This has blurred the distinction between 4-1-1 and 555-1212. For regulatory reasons, where telephone service is provided by traditional local-exchange carriers, the local carrier will determine how to handle 411, the chosen local toll (<b>intra-LATA)</b> carrier will determine how to handle 555-1212 calls for area codes within the LATA, and the chosen long distance carrier for inter-LATA) calls will determine how to handle other area code-555-1212 calls. For service provided by cellular and VoIP carriers where the customer {{does not have a}} choice of local toll or long distance carriers, all calls may be handled the same way.|$|E
40|$|Regulatory {{commission}} {{hearings on}} <b>intra-LATA</b> toll competition have focused, {{for the purpose}} of revenue rebalancing, on the market elasticity of demand for <b>intra-LATA</b> toll service. This paper presents estimates of the <b>intra-LATA</b> toll elasticity based on a detailed model of residential customers' demand for short-haul service. The results are compared with those from other studies. The consensus of the studies indicates a residential elasticity of around - 0. 4. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the business telecommunications demands for local, <b>intra-LATA</b> and inter-LATA services, using US {{data from a}} Bill Harvesting R survey carried out during 1997. We model heterogeneity, which is present among firms due {{to a variety of}} different business telecommunication needs, by estimating normal heteroskedastic mixture regressions. The results show that a three-component mixture model fits the demand for local services well, while a two-component structure is used to model <b>intra-LATA</b> and inter-LATA demand. We characterize the groups in terms of their differences among the coefficients, and then use Retina to perform automatic model selection over an expanded candidate regressor set which includes heterogeneity parameters as well as transformations of the original variables.

40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} framework that derives information flows associated to economic and social transactions, intersectoral, point-to-point telecommunication flow functions are specified and estimated, using a very large data base on <b>intra-LATA</b> toll calls and a simultaneous equation estimation procedure that accounts for the endogeneity of reverse call flows. The effects of prices, distances, and market sizes vary significantly across intersectoral interactions, {{and so does the}} impact of reverse calls, pointing to different cases of information complementarity and substitutability. Flows always decrease with distance, pointing to complementarity between transportation and telecommunications. The demand for messages is always price-inelastic, while the demand for conversation minutes is always elastic. Overall, intra-residential calling appears to be most sensitive to telecommunicatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} semi-parametric {{approach}} to estimation in Tobit models. A generalized additive Tobit model of residential local long distance (<b>intra-LATA)</b> telephone demand is estimated on {{a cross-section of}} residential telephone consumers across twenty-eight states. While past studies of telecommunications demand have used fully parametric models, the model presented here is non-parametric in two dimensions: first no distributional assumption is made for the error distribution, and second, the demand equation is non-parametric with respect to price. We find that the elasticity of demand is substantially lower (in absolute value) that found in previous studies for a 40 % cut in tariffs.

40|$|Some {{perceive}} a dilemma between 'Universal Service' and competition in local telecommunications markets. Universal service objectives {{have been met}} primarily by a system of cross-subsidies that keep rates artificially low for some (usually residence) and artificially high for others (usually businesses). Increasingly regulators realize that these subsidies are untenable, but voice concern that cost-based rate restructuring will produce 'rate shock' and lower subscribership. Based on a quantitative analysis, the authors show that rate rebalancing may raise local rates in some cases, but these increases {{will be more than}} offset by reductions in <b>intra-LATA</b> toll prices. More importantly, declines in business rates will reduce enduser operating costs, ultimately translating to substantial indirect benefits to all consumers through lower prices for goods and services. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} the business telecommunications demand for local, <b>intra-LATA</b> and inter-LATA services, using US telecommunications {{data from a}} Bill Harvesting ® survey carried out during 1997. Available information does not allow specifying demand as function of prices; hence we use flexible modelling estimation tools {{in order to find}} a useful specification with improved predictive ability over alternative models. We use an automated selection method called RElevant Transformations of the Inputs Network Approach (RETINA) due to Perez-Amaral, Gallo and White [9] to approximate the demand function for each service. In addition, we use finite mixtures as a convenient framework to model heterogeneity due to the different usages of telecommunications services in business activity. Combining these tools in an appropriate way we obtain models with improved predictive ability over benchmark models estimated without using any variable selection strategy. 1...|$|E
