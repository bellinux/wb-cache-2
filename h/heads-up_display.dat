5|$|Despite the {{positive}} praise, the original title did not sell well. By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States. and the bulk in PAL regions, Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt {{the marketing of}} the game, as {{at the time of}} the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as Ico lacked any <b>heads-up</b> <b>display,</b> it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a <b>heads-up</b> <b>display,</b> plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|Oblivion can {{be played}} in either a first-or third-person view, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in {{isometric}} projection. The player may change {{the level of difficulty}} at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a <b>heads-up</b> <b>display,</b> which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by leveling up.|$|E

5|$|Tactical Realism: a {{variation}} of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and teamwork, removing most of the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (HUD) elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heads-up</b> <b>display,</b> which simulates {{the inside}} of Samus' helmet, {{features}} a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses. The display can be altered by exchanging visors; one uses thermal imaging, another has x-ray vision, and another features a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Metroid Prime introduces a hint system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game.|$|E

5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie {{provides}} information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> to determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} Cole {{to use his}} powers, he must have stored {{electrical}} power, represented by an energy meter on the player's <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources, recharging also restores Cole's health, though Cole's health can regenerate over time without recharging. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game. The player can use experience points to increase powers' effectiveness or unlock new powers. Experience points are awarded for actions including defeating enemies, healing citizens and completing missions. The player can use such powers to destroy environmental scenery such as towers and stone columns. Depending on the player's choices, the player can gain ice or fire powers from the game's female protagonists, Kuo and Nix. Additionally, passive abilities based on Karma level called Karmic Boosts can be unlocked.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{five different}} terrain settings with each level being {{played on a}} large map divided into several missions. These missions include seek-and-destroy, search-and-rescue, escorts, the destruction of bridges, supply drops and air support. In some sections the player forms part of a coordinated attack with AI-controlled allies, while in others the player directs ground troops {{in the style of}} a real-time strategy game. As well as engaging in combat, the player must monitor and replenish his fuel and ammunition supplies. The <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> shows this information, along with intelligence on missions objectives and on friendly and enemy units and their locations. The compass indicating mission objectives is a feature new to Nuclear Strike, as is a radar showing the positions of nearby enemies.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} no <b>heads-up</b> <b>display.</b> Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult. The health system {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. The player can control five craft: X-wing, A-wing, Y-wing, snowspeeder and V-wing. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, {{as well as}} varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft. Levels set on non-atmospheric moons expose the player's craft to space; thus disallowing the Speeder and V-Wing (which are repulsorcraft) from being used; but as on other levels, the craft is vertically confined. Nine bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|The player {{character}} {{is equipped with}} an energy shield which nullifies damage from weapons fire and forceful impacts. The shield's charge appears as a blue bar {{in the corner of}} the game's <b>heads-up</b> <b>display,</b> and it automatically recharges if no damage is sustained for a brief period. When the shield is fully depleted, the player is highly vulnerable, and further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. When this health meter reaches zero, the character dies and the game reloads from a saved checkpoint. Health can be replenished through the collection of health packs scattered around the game's levels, but the game's introduction of a regenerating shield mechanic represented a departure from FPS games of the time.|$|E

5|$|Ultima Underworld II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that takes place}} from a character's eye view in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player's goal is to adventure through dungeon-like indoor environments across eight parallel dimensions, while completing quests to help the inhabitants of each world. The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor {{to interact with the}} game's world and to manipulate the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (HUD) interface. Icons on the HUD allow the player to examine objects closely, to converse with non-player characters (NPCs) and to ready the player character's weapon, among other things. During the game, the player collects items and stores them in an inventory on the HUD. Because it uses the same engine as its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II shares many of that game's features. For example, it allows the player character to jump and swim, and it contains an automap.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The player controls the movement of the player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses numerical values for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's <b>heads-up</b> <b>display.</b> As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the player character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Call of Duty 2 is a first-person shooter {{that has}} a single-player story mode and a {{multiplayer}} mode. The player takes on the roles of several Allied protagonists in specific missions during World War II. The player can crouch and lie prone, {{and is able to}} scale low walls and other obstacles. Two firearms can be carried, which can be swapped with those left on the battlefield, and both fragmentation and smoke grenades can also be carried. A gun's iron sights can be used to aim more accurately. A compass on the <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (HUD) shows both allies and enemies, and objective markers to indicate locations the player must reach, areas to defend, or enemy cannons or tanks that the player must plant explosives on to disable. Emplaced weapons such as machine guns and flak cannons are available in some locations to take out enemy troops. In addition, some missions place the player in control of a tank.|$|E

40|$|Vehicle Satellite Navigation Systems {{are commonplace}} {{but from a}} safety point of view, can be problematic. They are {{situated}} on small screens and often placed at an angle which {{is not in the}} driver’s field of view. This promotes glances away from the road and reduces situational awareness for events which occur. Audio commands and visual maps which are used to instruct drivers typically require translation to situationally meaningful actions before execution in the real world. This increases the driver’s workload and risk of distraction. A virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display</b> concept which is novel to this thesis is introduced. The design was motivated by issues in the literature regarding workload and risk of distraction and was shaped using a field study. Also, as <b>head-up</b> <b>displays</b> are becoming common in new vehicles, the benefits they offer have been explored {{in the design of the}} virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display.</b> Navigation instructions would be embedded in a familiar object to the driver; a car image, to support driving practices (e. g. indicating, lane positioning and turning) which are absent in the abstract commands and visual maps employed by vehicle satellite navigation systems. The navigation instructions used by the virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display</b> are easy to understand and can reduce the processing times for the instructions. For example, rather than translate audio commands e. g. “after 200 yards turn left”, the driver sees the virtual car indicate left 200 yards from the turn and sees it turn left on arrival at the turn. Also, rather than translate complex visual maps, the driver replicates the actions of the virtual car. An initial prototype for the virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display</b> was designed after which usability evaluation was carried out in a driving simulator to refine the concept. The first two studies were part of the design process and involved assessing the feasibility and conformity of the virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display.</b> It was found that the virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display</b> was an intelligible way to present the navigation instructions to drivers and that it was better to conform the virtual car to the external environment. The third study compared the prototype of the virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display</b> with the prototype of an arrow <b>head-up</b> <b>display</b> and vehicle satellite navigation system. It was found that the virtual car <b>head-up</b> <b>display</b> had the least workload and risk of distraction and was the easiest to use. A synthesis of the research work is provided which outlines the key contributions to research...|$|R
5|$|Lost Coast {{uses the}} same first-person shooter {{gameplay}} mechanics as Half-Life 2. The game is viewed {{from the perspective of}} the player character, and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. A <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> at the bottom of the screen shows the player's health, energy gauge, and ammunition status, while available weapons are shown at the top. Health and armor energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using wall-mounted charging devices. The player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from Half-Life 2 at the beginning of the level, including a pistol, shotgun, crossbow, and gravity gun. The gravity gun allows the player to manipulate physical objects in the world; it can be used to pick up nearby objects and throw them at enemies or create cover from enemy fire. The gravity gun can also be used to perform several non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supply crates.|$|E
5|$|Midtown Madness {{features}} 4 single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz, {{the player}} must swing through 3 checkpoints {{and drive to}} the finish line within a time limit. The Circuit mode curtains off most of the city to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. The Checkpoint mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In the Cruise mode, the player can simply explore the city at their own pace. All of these modes except Cruise are divided into missions; completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions that traverse all modes include weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> includes, alongside information about the race, a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Wei Shen, a Chinese-American police officer who goes undercover and infiltrates the Sun On Yee Triad organization. The first missions of the game are a linear tutorial for controlling the character. After these missions, the player is allowed to explore the game's world and take part in side missions and other activities. Shen navigates the world by running, jumping, climbing over obstacles, swimming, and driving cars, boats and motorcycles. The <b>heads-up</b> <b>display</b> (HUD) interface features a mini-map that indicates targets, key locations (safe houses and contact points) and Shen's current position. The mini-map incorporates two meters: one shows Shen's health and the other his face. When the face meter fills, upgrades are unlocked such as health regeneration, improved combat abilities and reduced equipment costs. The HUD also displays the weapon carried and its ammunition count.|$|E
