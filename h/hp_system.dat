In order to fulfil energy and energy-efficiency building requirements, European and national legislations {{encourage the use of}} more sustainable {{heating and cooling}} options. A sustainable dimension implies that both environmental and economic aspects are taken into account; the life-cycle comparisons of different heating and cooling systems are therefore based on GHG emissions and costs. This work focuses only on the economic side of the life-cycle analyses (therefore excluding the environmental dimension) and presents a review of life-cycle cost (LCC) studies involving <b>HP</b> <b>systems.</b> The first objective is to present an overview of the most influential factors characterizing life-cycle cost methodologies for <b>HP</b> <b>systems</b> and to suggest methodological improvements which can make LCC analyses more robust.

The player controls a robot {{called a}} Unitron, and {{walks through the}} dungeons fighting battles to earn money and experience.

The game has a fairly standard <b>HP</b> <b>system.</b> Instead of MP, there is EP, and EP is consumed with every action in battle. EP regenerates with every battle. In the game, there are initially four dungeons and a town. Each of the four dungeons that are initially available, has elemental affinity, and seven floors. Each dungeon's layout, rather than being truly random, is selected from multiple preprogrammed layouts. The town is menu-driven, with access to [...] "Works", where you equip parts, develop parts, and save data. There is also a shop, and there are multiple areas you can visit {{to talk to the}} townspeople. Some of the townspeople provide stat boosts, or will sell items to you. Finally, there is an arena in town, where you can fight other Unitrons for money, prizes, and many levels of advancing rank. The game has two main goals. The first goal is to build your Unitron up as much as possible. The second, is to clear the first four elemental affinity dungeons, and then clear the final dungeon, finishing the game.|$|E

The attractor obtained with the PS algorithm matches the attractor obtained by integrating the system with the parameter replaced by the averaged value of the switched parameter values. The switching rule can be applied periodically or randomly over a set of given values. In this way, every stable cycle of the <b>HP</b> <b>system</b> can be approximated if its underlying parameter value equalizes the average value of the switching values. Moreover, the PS algorithm {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of Parrondo's game, which is applied for the first time to the <b>HP</b> <b>system,</b> by showing that losing strategy can win: "losing + losing = winning". If "loosing" is replaced with "chaos" and, "winning" with "order" (as the opposite to "chaos"), then by switching the parameter value in the <b>HP</b> <b>system</b> within two values, which generate chaotic motions, the PS algorithm can approximate a stable cycle so that symbolically one can write "chaos + chaos = regular".

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of renewable energy}} is a key policy for sustainable communities. Some of them are variable energy resources (VERs) since their production varies over the time and are not easily and perfectly predictable. An increasing share of VERs can, indeed, badly impact on the electricity grid. The paper focuses on assessing the effect of introducing a high share of VERs production, taking as reference case a small-size sustainable community, located in Central Italy, which aims to reach, at least, a 30 % CO 2 emission reduction by 2025.

40|$|Winter {{conditions}} on roads are {{a challenge for}} road administrators in cold climates and with increased public demands on safety, winter maintenance activities will increase. The most common winter maintenance activity in Scandinavia is anti-icing, which is performed when it is a risk for ice formation on the road surface. Commonly a truck is utilized for spreading freeze point depressant, like salt, on the pavement thereby lowering the freezing point and preventing ice formation on the surface. This method has been questioned {{for a number of}} reasons e. g. salts have negative effects on the local environment. An alternative method for de-icing is to use hydronic pavement (HP). HP consists of a pipe network, embedded inside the pavement, in which a fluid is circulated. The fluid collect solar energy during summer days and transports heat back to the road surface during icy winter days. The harnessed and released energy should be in balance, otherwise an additional heat sources is needed. This study has investigated the possibility of developing an alternative strategy to heat the pavement surface with stored low temperature fluids. By using the methodology, and software BRIDGESIM, a preliminary design of a hydronic pavement system have revealed that it is not feasible to design a system for the cold climate of Ö stersund (Sweden); only relying on harnessing solar energy and store the energy in a borehole thermal energy storage. However it was revealed that it is possible to design <b>HP</b> <b>system</b> for low supply temperatures of about 7 °C. Which is far below the supply temperature of about 35 °C, recommended by manufacturers of <b>HP</b> <b>system.</b> The prospect of utilizing low-temperature heat sources would make <b>HP</b> <b>system</b> more energy efficient which could make it an alternative to traditional winter maintenance methods...|$|E
40|$|Heating {{application}} {{efficiency is}} a crucial point for saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Today, EU legal framework conditions clearly define how heating systems should perform, how buildings should be designed in an energy efficient manner and how renewable energy sources should be used. Using heat pumps (HP) as an alternative “Renewable Energy System” could be one solution for increasing efficiency, using less energy, reducing the energy dependency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This scientific article will {{take a closer look}} at the different efficiency dependencies of such geothermal HP (GHP) systems for domestic buildings (small/medium HP). Manufacturers of HP appliances must document the efficiency, so called COP (Coefficient of Performance) in the EU under certain standards. In technical datasheets of HP appliances, these COP parameters give a clear indication of the performance quality of a HP device. HP efficiency (COP) and the efficiency of a working <b>HP</b> <b>system</b> can vary significantly. For this reason, an annual efficiency statistic named “Seasonal Performance Factor” (SPF) has been defined to get an overall efficiency for comparing HP Systems. With this indicator, conclusions can be made from an installation, economy, environmental, performance and a risk point of view. A technical and economic HP model shows the dependence of energy efficiency problems in HP systems. To reduce the complexity of the HP model, only the important factors for efficiency dependencies are used. Dynamic and static situations with HP´s and their efficiency are considered. With the latest data from field tests of HP Systems and the practical experience over the last 10 years, this information will be compared with one of the latest simulation programs with the help of two practical geothermal <b>HP</b> <b>system</b> calculations. With the result of the gathered empirical data, it allows for a better estimate of the <b>HP</b> <b>system</b> efficiency, their economic costs and benefits and their environmental impact...|$|E

It is of great importance to {{understand the difference between}} various available sensors and polarization modes and to consider how to homogenize the data sets for a following combined analysis. In this study, a uniform and consistent analysis across different SAR missions is carried out. Three pairs of overlapping hybrid- and full-polarimetric C-band SAR scenes from the Radar Imaging Satellite- 1 (RISAT- 1) and Radarsat- 2 satellites are used. The overlapping Radarsat- 2 and RISAT- 1 scenes are taken close in time, with a relatively similar incidence angle covering sea ice in the Fram Strait and Northeast Greenland in September 2015. The main objective {{of this study is to}} identify the similarities and dissimilarities between a simulated and a real hybrid-polarity (HP) SAR system. The similarities and dissimilarities between the two sensors are evaluated using 13 HP features.
