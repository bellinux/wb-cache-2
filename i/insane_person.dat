Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E
25|$|According to d'Eslon, Mesmer {{understood}} {{health as}} {{the free flow}} of the process of life through thousands of channels in our bodies. Illness was caused by obstacles to this flow. Overcoming these obstacles and restoring flow produced crises, which restored health. When Nature failed to do this spontaneously, contact with a conductor of animal magnetism was a necessary and sufficient remedy. Mesmer aimed to aid or provoke the efforts of Nature. To cure an <b>insane</b> <b>person,</b> for example, involved causing a fit of madness. The advantage of magnetism involved accelerating such crises without danger.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{insanity}} in English law dates from 1324, when the Statute de Praerogativa Regis allowed the King {{to take the}} lands of idiots and lunatics. The early law used various words, including [...] "idiot", [...] "fool" [...] and [...] "sot" [...] to refer {{to those who had}} been insane since birth, and [...] "lunatic" [...] for those who had later become insane, or were insane with some lucid intervals. In the criminal law, insanity was used as a defence in a roughly identical way from this point until the late 16th century; if an <b>insane</b> <b>person</b> commits a crime, he was not punished {{in the same way that}} a sane felon who committed the same crime would be. This was for several reasons; firstly, the cruel punishment usually meted out to felons to set an example would not have the same effect on the insane. Secondly, as felonies required a mens rea, an <b>insane</b> <b>person</b> could not be guilty because they did not have the capacity to hold a mens rea. Thirdly, the phrase furiosus solo fitrere punitur was used; [...] "a lunatic was punished by his madness alone".|$|E

2500|$|Concerns about {{lobotomy}} steadily grew. Soviet psychiatrist Vasily Gilyarovsky criticized lobotomy and the mechanistic brain localization assumption used {{to carry}} out lobotomy: [...] "It is assumed that the transection of white substance of the frontal lobes impairs their connection with the thalamus and eliminates the possibility to receive from it stimuli which lead to irritation and on the whole derange mental functions. This explanation is mechanistic {{and goes back to}} the narrow localizationism characteristic of psychiatrists of America, from where leucotomy was imported to us." [...] The USSR officially banned the procedure in 1950 on the initiative of Gilyarovsky.

In another, Suchorzewski would simply declare his intention, without even moving to threaten his son. In yet another one, that Bartoszewski describes three times in a slightly different fashion, Suchorzewski would try to block the king's way, imitating Reytan's gesture, but without involving his son. At another time, he would crawl on the parliament's floor, and deliver a speech in this fashion, an incident which caused the bishop Adam Krasiński to demand that [...] "somebody take this <b>insane</b> <b>person</b> to the asylum".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} four {{rebuttal}} witnesses was Menas Gregory, the former manager of the Bellevue psychiatric hospital, where Fish was treated during 1930. He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or <b>insane</b> <b>person.</b> Gregory replied that such a person was not [...] "mentally sick" [...] and that these were common perversions that were [...] "socially perfectly alright" [...] and that Fish was [...] "no different from millions of other people", some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the [...] "very same" [...] perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at The Tombs, Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying {{on the issue of}} sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, [...] "That is not masochism", as he was only [...] "punishing himself to get sexual gratification". The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but [...] "was a matter of taste" [...] and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion. Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.|$|E

60|$|Margaret Murdockson {{stated that}} she, for some time, {{believed}} {{her daughter had}} actually destroyed the infant in her mad fits, and that she gave the father to understand so, but afterwards learned that a female stroller had got it from her. She showed some compunction at having separated mother and child, especially as the mother had nearly suffered death, being condemned, on the Scotch law, for the supposed murder of her infant. When it was asked what possible interest she could have had in exposing the unfortunate girl to suffer for a crime she had not committed, she asked, if they {{thought she was going}} to put her own daughter into trouble to save another? She did not know what the Scotch law would have done to her for carrying the child away. This answer was by no means satisfactory to the clergyman, and he discovered, by close examination, that she had a deep and revengeful hatred against the young person whom she had thus injured. But the paper intimated, that, whatever besides she had communicated upon this subject was confided by her in private to the worthy and reverend Archdeacon who had bestowed such particular pains in affording her spiritual assistance. The broadside went on to intimate, that, after her execution, of which the particulars were given, her daughter, the <b>insane</b> <b>person</b> mentioned more than once, and who was generally known by the name of Madge Wildfire, had been very ill-used by the populace, under the belief that she was a sorceress, and an accomplice in her mother's crimes, and had been with difficulty rescued by the prompt interference of the police.|$|E
60|$|The {{barriers}} being now withdrawn, {{we walked}} adown {{the length of}} the nave, which did not seem to me so dim and vast as the recollection which I have had of it since my visit of a year ago. But my pre-imaginations and my memories are both apt to play me false with all admirable things, and so create disappointments for me, while perhaps the thing itself is really far better than I imagine or remember it. We engaged an old man, one of the attendants pertaining to the cathedral, to be our guide, and he showed us first the stone screen in front of the choir, with its sculptured kings of England; and then the tombs in the north transept,-- one of a modern archbishop, and one of an ancient one, behind which the <b>insane</b> <b>person</b> who set fire to the church a few years ago hid himself at nightfall. Then our guide unlocked a side door, and led us into the chapter-house,--an octagonal hall, with a vaulted roof, a tessellated floor, and seven arched windows of old painted glass, the richest that I ever saw or imagined, each looking like an inestimable treasury of precious stories, with a gleam and glow even in the sullen light of this gray morning. What would they be with the sun shining through them! With all their brilliancy, moreover, they were as soft as rose-leaves. I never saw any piece of human architecture so beautiful as this chapter-house; at least, I thought so while I was looking at it, and think so still; and it owed its beauty in very great measure to the painted windows: I remember looking at these windows from the outside yesterday, and seeing nothing but an opaque old crust of conglomerated panes of glass; but now that gloomy mystery was radiantly solved.|$|E
