5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing.

5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading {{producer}} of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60-70%. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in <b>jet</b> <b>and</b> rocket engines.|$|E

40|$|Recent work on <b>jets</b> <b>and</b> disk winds in low-mass X-ray {{binaries}} (LMXBs) {{suggests that}} they are {{to a large extent}} mutually exclusive, with jets observed in spectrally hard states and disk winds observed in spectrally soft states. In this paper we use existing literature on <b>jets</b> <b>and</b> disk winds in the luminous neutron star (NS) LMXB GX 13 + 1, in combination with archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data, to show that this source is likely able to produce <b>jets</b> <b>and</b> disk winds simultaneously. We find that <b>jets</b> <b>and</b> disk winds occur in the same location on the source's track in its X-ray color–color diagram. A further study of literature on other luminous LMXBs reveals that this behavior is more common, with indications for simultaneous <b>jets</b> <b>and</b> disk winds in the black hole LMXBs V 404 Cyg and GRS 1915 + 105 and the NS LMXBs Sco X- 1 and Cir X- 1. For the three sources for which we have the necessary spectral information, we find that simultaneous jets/winds all occur in their spectrally hardest states. Our findings indicate that in LMXBs with luminosities above a few tens of percent of the Eddington luminosity, <b>jets</b> <b>and</b> disk winds are not mutually exclusive, and the presence of disk winds does not necessarily result in jet suppression.

5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the <b>jet,</b> <b>and</b> not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
