40|$|Gun {{violence}} poses {{a serious}} threat to America’s children and youth. Existing data clearly point to the need for improved strategies for keeping guns {{out of the hands of}} children and youth and those who would harm them. Gun violence in schools is extremely rare, as are violent crimes committed by people with mental illness. However, the majority of youth murdered are killed with a firearm and nearly half of youth suicide deaths involve the use of a gun. Efforts to end youth gun violence must focus on accessibility and prevention. Additionally, federal safety and health agencies must be empowered to conduct comprehensive research into the causes of and solutions to this unacceptable source of <b>harm</b> to <b>our</b> children, <b>families,</b> and communities. Firearm Deaths in the United States (CDC, 2012) � In 2010, there were 2, 711 infant, child, and teen firearm deaths.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The strong {{development}} {{of information and}} communication technology (ICT) {{as well as the}} fact that there are currently over 800 million on-line users worldwide, bring us to the position of rethinking carefully about where all this data is going. Sending and receiving secure data is a well known concept. But what about data in the open space where everyone who knows how and has adequate technology can intercept or eavedrop our data and use it against us, to <b>harm</b> us or <b>our</b> <b>family</b> or to destroy the organization where we working in. The traditional answer to these in uences is the {{development of}} strong security mechanisms and systems which will be able to protect us (in most cases) from our self and from others as well. Such security systems have the possibility to monitor all communication between users in a speci c network or subnet and collect all information exchanged between them. And this is what we see as the main problem. Someone who monitors the system has access to all information about the network's users and can take advantage of these data as he pleases. This means that someone allways has full access to all private user data. Herein we introduce some ways of protecting users from legally monitoring of their private data...|$|R
