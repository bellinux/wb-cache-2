40|$|Densification of {{wood in the}} {{transverse}} direction increases the density. One {{of the reasons for}} densifying wood is to produce high quality timber from timbers of low quality. However, <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> shows an undesired behaviour, i. e. a tendency to return to its initial dimensions when it is subjected to heat and humidity, i. e. shape memory. There are several methods to overcome the problem of shape memory. This study uses a three-layered cross-laminated wood panel where one of the layers is of <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> and the other two are of normal wood together these will mechanically restrain the shape memory of the densified layer. The study includes three stages: * Densification of clear wood in the radial direction * Manufacture of a three-layered cross laminated composite product with <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> as a service layer * Testing of the shape stability when the composite was subjected to variations relative humidity (40 - 85 % RH at 20 °) The result of this study reveals the significance of service to bottom layer thickness ratio on the shape stability of the cross laminated composite. Consequently, the performance and the shape stability of the cross laminated composite were significant when the service to bottom layer thickness ratio increases. Therefore, it appears feasible to disclose the appreciable degree of shape stability, hardness and wear resistance of the product. Accordingly, cross laminated composite can be considered as one of the promising mechanical methods for improving moisture movement of <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> product.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the optimisation {{studies of}} a pre-stressed embedment-type timber joint system, the Kusabi–Nageshi (K–N) timber joint system, {{designed to be}} used for structures in seismic-prone countries. The K–N joint is composed of a triangular-sectioned beam and wedges in combination with bolts. Its resistive mechanism utilises the embedment strength of timber and the pre-stress in association with friction. In addition, elastic energy deposited in the bolt as storage fills the gap as it is deformed during the embedment. With the aim of optimising both mechanically and physically, several alterations were tested in terms of shape (taper angle) and of combining <b>densified</b> veneer <b>wood</b> (DVW) with the joint members. A cyclic loading test of the cross joints was made to examine their structural behaviour. The use of less tapered wedges showed higher stiffness and strength, but the beam beneath was undesirably embedded. Different combinations of reinforcement with <b>densified</b> veneer <b>wood</b> showed that the use of the wedges alone provided high optimisation, and an increase in bolt axial force. The successful test results observed in the alteration using the <b>densified</b> veneer <b>wood</b> are expressed using the ‘analytical K–N joint diagram', an analytical method modified from a conventional joint diagram used in mechanical engineering, which showed itself to be an applicable method to predict the trend of the altered K–N joint. The use of the new tapered angle and <b>densified</b> veneer <b>wood</b> for optimisation, and the performance predictions using the analytical K–N joint diagram, will need further precise investigations but their great benefits are potentially promising...|$|R

40|$|When wood is {{densified}} through semi-isostatical compression in a Quintus- press at pressures up to 140 MPa, {{the material}} properties change. The cells are flattened, size is decreased and shape is changed, {{as a consequence}} of this the density is increased. Most properties of native woods are strongly correlated to the density. This is also true for <b>densified</b> <b>wood.</b> To understand the compression mechanisms plastic and elastic strains were studied at different pressures. Strength, density, anatomy and swelling were studied. Some of the methods used were: image analysis, computer tomography scanning (CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical testing. Data was statistically analysed by linear regression and multivariate statistical methods. A big advantage of using semi-isostatic pressure is that wood of all dimensions, with knots and anomalous wood can be compressed without major checking. As the pressure is mediated through a flexible diaphragm the density becomes homogenous. Plain-sawn wood with inside-face to press-table gets the most homogenous density and the most rectangular shape. Strength is improved by the densification, especially the hardness, the bending and the axial compression strength. At water-soaking <b>densified</b> <b>wood,</b> the cell-shape recovers almost completely. This indicates the non-destructive character of the process. The swelling pressure, that develops when <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> is restrained from dimensional change and then water-soaked, is more than twice as high as for native wood. The swelling can be reduced by deep impregnation with oil in combination with a surface lacquer. Godkänd; 2006; 20061130 (pafi...|$|E

In our previous study, OHT was successfully applied to densified veneer, which resulted in improved dimensional stability. In the present study, the impact of OHT on <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> veneer hygroscopicity and mechanical properties was determined. OHT at 180, 200, and 220 ºC for 1, 2, and 3 hours was applied to densified Aspen (Populus tremuloides) veneers.

However, due to the contribution of densification, the hardness of oil-heat treated veneers was still two to three times higher than that of non-densified veneers. Similar results were found for tensile strength. Bending strength increased slightly at low OHT temperature, and then decreased at high temperature. Bending strength of oil-heat treated densified veneer samples was higher than that of non-densified ones. No significant effect of OHT was found on tensile MOE, but bending MOE increased after OHT.

40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} {{the need for}} timber {{connections}} with high fire performance. Connections of members in timber structures commonly comprise steel connectors, such as dowels, screws, nails and toothed plates. However, multiple {{studies have shown that}} the presence of exposed metal in timber connections leads to a poor performance under fire conditions. Replacing metallic fasteners with non-metallic fasteners potentially enhances the fire performance of timber connections. Previous studies showed that Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) dowels can be a viable replacement for steel dowels and that <b>Densified</b> Veneer <b>Wood</b> functions well as a flitch plate material. However, as the resin matrix of GFRP dowels is viscoelastic, connection creep, which is not studied before, can be of concern. Also no research has been carried out on the fire performance of these connections. Therefore, a study of the creep behaviour and the fire performance of non-metallic timber connections comprising GFRP dowels and a <b>Densified</b> Veneer <b>Wood</b> flitch plate was performed, as is discussed in this thesis. Predictive models were proposed to determine the connection slip and load bearing capacity at ambient and elevated temperatures and in a fire. The material properties and heat transfer properties required for these models were determined experimentally and predictions of these models were experimentally validated. Furthermore, an adjustment of the predictive model of connection slip at ambient temperature allowed approximating the creep of the connection. The material properties, required for the creep model, were determined experimentally and predictions of the model were compared to results of longterm connection tests. The study confirmed that timber members jointed with non-metallic connectors have a significantly improved fire performance to timber joints using metallic connections. Models developed and proposed to predict fire performance gave accurate predictions of time to failure. It was concluded that non-metallic connections showed more creep per load per connector, than metallic connections. However, the ratio between initial deflection and creep (relative creep) and the ratio between load level and creep were shown to be similar for metallic and non-metallic connections...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the behaviour of bond lines of <b>Densified</b> Veneer <b>Wood</b> (DVW) reinforced timber connections. Studies by Leijten in the 90 s have shown that reinforcing timber connections with DVW results in a significant enhancement of connection properties. The DVW is in these connections glued onto the timber. Recently, these reinforced connections were studied in column-beam and splice type arrangements using a connecting flitch plate. In these arrangements additional stresses are introduced in the bond line. A numerical study was performed to the bond line capacity, but experiments did not fully verify the predictions. For the present study the fracture mechanical properties of bond lines between DVW and Norway Spruce were determined experimentally, and were implemented in three dimensional finite element models. Delamination tests were performed to verify the numerical procedure. From these tests it is concluded that the numerical predictions correspond well to the experiments...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 In wood-based composites, the {{glue-line}} (interface) between wood-strands {{affects the}} stress transfer from one member to the next.

Metallic shear connections are very common in timber structures, but can fail quickly in fire conditions due to the high thermal conductivity of metals. In this study the fire performance of a non-metallic connection constructed from phenolic GFRP dowels and a DVW flitch plate is studied numerically and experimentally. The numerical predictions are obtained with a structural model linked to different heat transfer models. Experimental validation of the heat transfer models is obtained by measuring the temperature in connections that are subjected to radiant heat and fire.

40|$|Owing to its porous {{cellular}} structure and polymeric components, wood {{can be easily}} shaped in its transversal direction when it is heated and has sufficient water content. Thanks to this thermohydrous behaviour many manufacturing processes such as densification, moulding, shaping or bending can be considered. Thus, some mechanical properties like the hardness, the shear and tensile strength {{as well as the}} wood durability facing microorganisms are enhanced. However, the shape of this new material is not stable: it recovers its initial shape when remoistened. This phenomenon is called "shape memory " or "set-recovery" of shaped wood. Nevertheless, this problem can be solved by chemical and thermal treatments. This study focuses on thermo-hydrous treatments that allow the preservation of the ecological aspect of wood. The main objectives of this study are on one hand the better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to decrease or to eliminate the <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> during set-recovery thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) post-treatments, {{and on the other hand}} the optimization of the densification and THM post-treatment processes parameters and conditions. Preliminary, to better apprehend the elimination of the set-recovery, the origin of <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> shape memory are revised. Many studies showed that the shape memory of wood originates from the inner stresses induced by the deformation of cellulose microfibrils and other componants. This deformation generates an increase of the material elastic energy. Under moisture and heat conditions the inner stresses are relaxed by the quasi-overall recovery of microfibrils set. During the set-recovery the lignin follows the microfibrils movement due to their bonding to cellulose microfibrils by hemicelluloses. So the cellular walls come almost to its initial shape, allowing stored elastic energy to be dissipated. The hemicelluloses take a fundamental part during set-recovery as they assure the cohesion between cellulose microfibrils and lignin by physico-chemical bonds. Consequently the dissipation of elastic energy during THM post-treatments is facilitated by the rupture of these bonds causing the set-recovery of cellulose microfibrils and lignin. A model of the hemicelluloses hydrolysis reaction has been carried out. A high correlation between the polymerisation degree of the hemicelluloses and the set-recovery of <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> has been calculated by this model. The strong hydrolytic action on the hemicelluloses has also been confirmed by our physico-chemical analysis. Thus our model indicates that lignin must be in its rubber state to be able to eliminate totally the set-recovery. At higher temperatures (180 °C) the middle lamela becomes fragile due to the thermal degration and causes microcracks between the wood cells during the abrupt release of steam at the end of the post-treatment and during drying. These microcracks are also susceptible to be the source of the dissipation of elastic energy stored during the densification process. Finally, our results indicate that steam post-treatments are able to increase the cellulose crystallinity and the crystallites diameter. The decrease of the setrecovery can be also partially explained by these phenomena. With regard to densification and post-treatment THM conditions, the recovery tests results show an optimal temperature of densification at 110 °C under saturated vapour condition. Our mechanical tests testify a significant thermal damage from 180 °C. Thus the set-recovery elimination has to be done around 160 °C to avoid the intercellular microcracking problems when cooling and drying the samples. The post-treatment THM can be then a promising procedure to eliminate the set recovery for the industry. Nevertheless, further studies must be carried out for better understanding the cracking problem due to the drying process for bigger samples...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of glass}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymer dowels and <b>densified</b> veneer <b>wood</b> plate is proposed as a contemporary means {{of providing a}} non-metallic mechanically fastened timber connection. From fabrication to end of life, the use of mechanically fastened non-metallic connections {{has the potential to}} offer many benefits to the field of timber engineering. Currently metal free glued joints provide corrosion resistance and, when made with thermosetting resins, are safer in fire than using metallic mechanically fastened connections.

In response to this, the use of non-metallic components to provide a mechanically fastened metal free connection has been investigated. This paper presents results from a series of parallel to grain tensile connection tests in glued laminated timber. Nonmetallic dowels can be more closely spaced than metallic dowels and in terms of connection capacity per unit connected area, it is demonstrated that the proposed connection type has the potential to exceed the efficiency of metallic counterparts.

30|$|After these {{deformation}} processes, the deformed wood (products) {{must have}} their shape fixed. One effective method {{to overcome the}} dimensional instability of the products due to moisture is the impregnation of low molecular weight resins, such as phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin, into the wood prior to the forming process [3 – 5]. Low molecular weight PF resin can penetrate into the cell walls and softens them, so that PF resin-impregnated woods can be compressed under pressure of more than approximately 2  MPa with heating [6]. After curing under pressure and heat, the impregnated PF resin is polymerized to form a rigid cross-linked network in the cell wall, which prevents recovery of the original shape and results in a compressed and <b>densified</b> form of <b>wood.</b> The PF resin-impregnated compressed wood, which is generically referred to as Compreg, {{has been used for}} applications such as furniture and flooring because of its high dimensional stability and mechanical properties [7].|$|R

Increasing the use of renewable materials, such as wood, is essential {{if we are to}} achieve a sustainable use of the resources available to us. Densification of wood in general, and surface densification in particular, has the potential to improve the properties of widely available low-density wood species, opening up new fields of application, and fostering the use of wood products in general. The objective of this thesis is to put past research within the field of surface densification of solid wood and advancements within the present project into a context, and to suggest a path towards a performance-driven and cost-effective type of product. A prevalent research gap has been identified and this thesis summarizes how this gap can be filled by already conducted and future studies. Important aspects that need be handled in order to fulfill the overall vision of the large-scale commercialization of surface-densified wood products are considered. Past studies were successful in gaining a good understanding of different approaches to the densification of solid wood, such as using a hot press or a friction welding machine. Problems, such as the moisture-induced recovery of the <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> cells could be solved from a technological perspective. However, those studies did not take into account industrial implementation. Existing methods are time- and/or energy-consuming. The use of roller-pressing equipment showed promising results, but also highlighted certain limitations. Solid wooden boards have been successfully surface-densified at speeds of up to 80 m/min. However, problems arose regarding the plasticization and stabilization of the <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> cells, indicating that a continuous belt-press approach might be more viable with regard to the objective of industrial implementation. In parallel, a structured method to identify the most suitable wood species for surface densification has been presented, with the aim of propagating the use of surface-densified wood products and widening their fields of application. This method has confirmed the suitability of previously used wood species, and has also suggested alternatives not considered thus far. Previous studies into the surface densification of wood have provided a rather sound understanding of the densification process and have provided a useful foundation for the current project. The work done, thus far, has shown the viability of a continuous densification process and has indicated a sensible path towards the widespread establishment of surface-densified wood products on the market. ...|$|E
40|$|Compression {{under the}} effect of heat and steam, also called thermo-hygromechanical (THM) densification, can {{increase}} wood density and therefore improve its strength, stiffness, and hardness. Oil-heat treatment (OHT) is also known to reduce wood’s hygroscopicity and improve dimensional stability. A combination of both treatments can therefore produce wood with improved mechanical properties and dimensional stability. The objective of this project was to determine cell wall mechanical properties of THM-densified and OHT wood. Trembling aspen veneers were densified by a THM process and subsequently treated in canola oil at 200 and 220 °C. Nanoindentations were performed in earlywood cell walls. The results show that cell wall longitudinal modulus of elasticity increased significantly from 13. 5 GPa for the control {{to a maximum of}} 18. 2 GPa for THM <b>densified</b> <b>wood</b> with or without OHT. Cell wall hardness increased from 0. 27 GPa to a maximum of 0. 43 GPa. Both THM densification and OHT significantly increased cell wall hardness. Therefore, the increase in mechanical properties of THM-densified and OHT wood can be due to an increase in wood density resulting from a reduction in porosity but also to an increase in the mechanical properties of the cell wall...|$|E
40|$|Colonisation {{and wood}} {{degradation}} by three brown-rot fungi, Coniophora puteana, Gloeophyllum trabeum and Poria placenta, were studied in wood of Norway spruce (Picea abies) subjected to three different treatments: hygro-thermal (TH) (160 and 180 °C), mechanical densification and thermo-hygro-mechanical (THM) treatment including densification and post-treatment under saturated steam conditions at different temperatures (140, 160 and 180 °C). The weight loss induced by all three fungi was lowest in THM-densified wood post-treated at 180 °C. Highest weight losses were recorded for controls and TH-treated wood. Fungal colonisation varied in its intensity, {{depending on the}} treatment applied to the wood. Hyphal growth in controls and TH-treated wood was abundant, whereas in <b>densified</b> and THM-densified <b>wood</b> it was sparse and confined predominantly to the cell lumina of earlywood tracheids. Also, penetration of large-diameter hyphae and associated degradation in THM-densified wood was impeded by occlusion of the lumina, associated with irreversible compression (loss in shape memory). In contrast to C. puteana and P. placenta, which showed typical brown-rot behaviour, G. trabeum frequently showed hyphal tunnelling within the secondary walls of tracheids and xylem ray parenchyma of controls and thermally treated wood. Such growth was never observed in THM-densified wood post-treated at 180 °...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{the amount}} of metal used within a timber {{structure}} has many advantages, particularly when dealing with connections. Fire resistance and durability are commonly cited benefits. In addition the use of alternative connector materials minimises thermal bridging and can also provide a lighter weight structural solution. Existing contemporary forms of non-metallic timber connections are commonly provided {{through the use of}} adhesives. However, these connections are reliant on a need for careful offsite, prefabricated construction. Traditional green oak carpentry connections provide a mechanically fastened non-metallic solution. However, carpentry connections are not widely compatible with contemporary architectural design or with the use of modern engineered timber products such as glulam. Building upon research completed at the University of Bath, the aim of this thesis was to develop a mechanical, non-metallic connection system suitable for contemporary applications. Specific objectives were to investigate the structural performance of a defined connection system and to develop analysis methods to facilitate design. A review of the literature demonstrated a lack of uptake and use of mechanical non-metallic connections. Guidance for the design of mechanical fasteners reflects the lack of innovation and research into the use of non-metallic materials. Following an initial experimental investigation of non-metallic materials, an experimental testing programme was completed to investigate the use of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) dowels in conjunction with <b>densified</b> veneer <b>wood</b> (DVW) plates. The findings of the experimental study demonstrate that the use of these materials can provide a robust connection system for contemporary applications. The results of the experimental work provide guidance on dowel spacing requirements, connection response to load and connection failure modes. The failure modes of the proposed connection system were shown to be unique to the materials used and specific strength analysis methods have been developed to predict connection yield and ultimate strength. A method for predicting initial connection stiffness was also developed {{through the use of a}} beam on elastic foundation model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presented}} {{focuses on}} the development of a novel timber joint. Traditional timber joints with mechanical fasteners, particular dowel type fasteners, such as bolts exhibit a low strength and an unreliable stiffness and ductility caused by the presence of hole clearance and the unpredictable splitting of timber. The novel joint tackles all of these shortcomings. Local reinforcement glued to the timber members in the jointed area prevents unexpected splitting and results in the enhancement of the strength. By choosing a steel (gas) tube instead of a solid fastener, that fit in an over-sized hole, and by expanding the diameter after assembly of the joint, easy assembly and no hole clearance is insured. Due to the ductile behaviour of the reinforcement and the plastic deformation capacity of the tube the ductility of the joint is guaranteed. To assess the performance of this joints a comprehensive study was performed and reported in this article. Summarising the experimental results, it can be stated that <b>densified</b> veneer (ply) <b>wood</b> is an excellent mate. rial to reinforce the timber joint. It possesses a high embedding strength and stiffness compared to softwood and is able to sustain the high concentrated loads imposed by the tubes. It is demonstrated that the new joint possess a reliable and high strength and stiffness capacity in monotonic loading. When certain requirements are fulfilled the joint shows a superior behaviour in cyclic loading. Design examples show that when used in portal frames a considerable amount of timber can be saved, up to about 40 %, compared to joints with traditional dowel type fasteners, without a loss of safety.
