On Christmas Day, Radiohead released [...] "Spectre" [...] on the audio streaming site SoundCloud. According to Godrich, after the band had finished recording in France [...] "I {{went off and}} <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> it all together myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Pitbull and Jim Jones also {{recorded}} freestyle raps over the song. After releasing his version, Jones claimed {{in an interview}} that [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] was a song he originally recorded one year ago for an album by Pauly D, but that they ultimately scrapped it: [...] "When I started to hear the 'Harlem Shake' and heard the beat, I was like damn, I had the record for a year. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> the record out." ...|$|E
500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E

5000|$|That was an {{inspired}} song {{that came to}} me. I felt like <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> down words that were coming from somewhere else, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> stuck it out. Bob Dylan ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is very serious," [...] said Father Brown, {{gathering}} his errant hat and umbrella {{and standing}} up; [...] "in {{point of fact}} <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> your case before this gentleman, and his view--" ...|$|R
500|$|Though it {{was noted}} that even [...] "She" [...] has [...] "passing moments of lyrical {{humanity}} to go with the pliant music ("When I'm with my friends <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> on a front / But {{in the back of my}} top I'm writing songs about 'we'"). It's almost like there's boyish innocence lurking underneath all that bile." [...] The Village Voices Eric Harvey mused that the [...] "sinuous Frank Ocean feature [...] "She" [...] ramps up the voyeurism" [...] and noted that he [...] "keeps things within a Rear Window framework. He admits he's going through the dating motions strictly to get laid, but he also says that his violent front is just a show for his boys." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Buren's profile at the Pro Football Hall of Fame states he [...] "lined up as a halfback but played {{more like}} a fullback." [...] He had a rare {{combination}} of strength, speed, and endurance. While not as elusive or nimble as other backs, he preferred to run through tacklers instead of avoid them, and never ran out of bounds if he felt he could pick up extra yards. [...] "There's no trick," [...] {{he said of his}} running style. [...] "When I see I'm gonna be tackled <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> my head down and give 'em the shoulder." [...] He was described as a [...] "deadly tackler", hitting as hard on defense as he did when he carried the ball. His disregard for his own body led to many injuries for both himself and opposing players.|$|E
500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a coincidence," [...] he said. [...] "I was looking, sir, {{for your}} name in the pages which <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>put</b> into your hand. Surely the editor can't have refused to publish your letter?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He continued, [...] "This was {{the last}} song that was finished, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't <b>put</b> two and two {{together}} that this was even {{going to be on the}} album. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> kind of wrote it and was like 'oh, that was fun.'" ...|$|R

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} and commercial success {{of her two}} previous albums, Jackson continued to receive numerous comparisons to her brother Michael, often with doubts that she held staying power in the music industry. When Edna Gundersen of USA Today questioned her about the subject, she responded: [...] "Certain people feel I'm just riding on my last name... That's why <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> my first name on janet. and why I never asked my brothers to write or produce music for me." [...] Virgin Records expressed the album title [...] "punctuates the declaration of strength the singer, songwriter and producer boldly expresses on this moving collection of songs which explore love, sensuality, the power of sisterhood and her own evolving self-identity." [...] Thomas Harrison, author of Music of the 1990s (2011) wrote that [...] "he conscious decision was made, by the company and/or Jackson, to put her into the same league as other one-named artists, such as Madonna, Bono, and Prince, {{or at least to}} put her on the same standing as others in the industry who are often called by one name, such as Whitney, Mariah, Diana, Dolly, and Garth among others. Jackson could now, in a sense, stand on her own and not be seen as a product of the family entertainment machine." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant magazine recounted the title of the album ultimately [...] "announced the singer as completely independent of her male-dominated family [...] it positioned her as the person in charge of her sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{occupants}} of the lifeboat endured a freezing night. Mrs. Dodge was particularly badly affected by the cold but was helped by Quartermaster Alfred Olliver, who gave her his socks: [...] "I assure you, ma'am, they are perfectly clean. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> them on this morning." [...] At about 6:00a.m., they were rescued by Carpathia.|$|E
2500|$|Gavin Friday {{reworked}} {{the song}} for the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. He said, [...] "The Edge rang me up and said, 'Nobody wants to do The Fly – they're all afraid of it.' I think it's because {{it has its own}} essence, sonically. It was the lead single and the point of reinvention. U2 said it best: it was the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree. I remember seeing them working on Achtung Baby in its early stages. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> a rocket up their asses and said, 'Go for it.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George has scalded his leg badly, feyther. <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> Susan to bed, and he {{took the}} kettle off the fire to pour some water in the teapot, when Dick pushed him, or something, and the boiling water went over his leg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right-o!" [...] said Archie, affably, {{casting off}} his forbidding {{expression}} like a garment.

2500|$|Hynde and Honeyman-Scott {{have both}} {{acknowledged}} the influence their contrasting styles had {{on each other}} (Guitar Player, 1981; Uncut, 1999). According to Honeyman-Scott, Hynde had a unique style he adjusted to in several ways: [...] "She does {{quite a bit of}} rhythm guitar, and I don't know anybody who plays like her. It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. Instead, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> a little guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to me coming in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play. But it's because I've missed where she comes in! I just bluff it and hope for the best." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{concept of the}} series, the three females' boss would be a millionaire who often aided them in their assignments; however, Jackson and Spelling {{decided it would be}} more {{interesting}} to have the boss's identity remain a secret. With this, millionaire Charlie Townsend was an unseen character on the series who only spoke to the Angels via a Western Electric Speakerphone. John Forsythe, who played the unseen Charlie Townsend, directing the 'Angels' crime-fighting operations over a speaker-phone, recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set. Thus, Forsythe rarely met any of his female co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett-Majors at the tennis courts, as he recalled, [...] "I was coming off the court when she {{came up to me and}} said, 'Charlie! I finally met Charlie!'". Forsythe was offered the 'Charlie' role in a panicky late-night phone call from producer Aaron Spelling after the original choice, American film, stage and television actor, Gig Young, showed up too intoxicated to read his lines. [...] "I didn't even take my pajamas off – <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> on my topcoat and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron Spelling said, 'That's perfect.' And I went home and went back to bed".|$|E
2500|$|Lupe Fiasco was {{supposedly}} {{going to release}} a triple album, titled LupE.N.D. as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. From then he postponed LupE.N.D. indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively titled The Great American Rap Album in June 2009. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled We Are Lasers and then changed to Lasers. [...] "Lasers" [...] is a backronym for [...] "Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile". Referring to {{the title of the}} album, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I've always had that word in my head, I'm a word guy. And I thought 'lasers' would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> it in my 'think-tank' and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. That’s why I made it an acronym [...] to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it's bringing light to different circumstances which is what I try and do - bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects that are going on in the world, and 'L.A.S.E.R.S' is no different.|$|E

2500|$|Although Page {{recorded}} with many notable musicians, {{many of these}} early tracks are only available as bootleg recordings, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest {{of these is the}} early jam session featuring Jimmy Page and Stones guitarist Keith Richards covering Robert Johnson's [...] "Little Queen of Spades". Several early tracks with Page were compiled on the twin album release, [...] Page also {{recorded with}} Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called [...] "Scarlet" [...] was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stones Cameron Crowe: [...] "I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called [...] "Scarlet." [...] I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album".|$|E
2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You and I would not have gone outside to get the newspaper on a day like that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was our regular punter and as we were ready to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> my hands down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, you never got enough credit for that game.' It was so boring. I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E
