30|$|The {{conclusion}} {{based on}} Figures 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 is that varying the compression ratio <b>of</b> the diesel <b>engine,</b> within {{the entire range}} <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 1, 500 to 2, 800 rpm, to achieve a maximum engine torque leads to variations in the predicted performance variables compared to those predicted at constant compression ratio (rc[*]=[*] 16.4). These variations can be summarized as follows: (1) at an <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 1, 500 and 2, 460 rpm, there is no variation in all studied variables; (2) for the other values <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> the maximum pressure, maximum temperature, brake torque, thermal efficiency, and unfavorable NOx are increasing. On the contrary, the delay period, volumetric efficiency, residual gas fraction, and soot formation are decreasing.

The main originality {{of this paper is to}} present an efficient harmonic controller synchronized with the engine speed: the feedback law controls the Fourier parameters of the command. For time-variation <b>of</b> the <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> the adaptation <b>of</b> the harmonic controller ensures the convergence of the command.
