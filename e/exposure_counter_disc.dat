50|$|The {{original}} Leicaflex {{is readily}} identifiable from its CdS meter window and battery cover {{on the front}} of the prism housing just above the lens. It was offered in chrome and black enamel finishes, the latter being rare. The first series had a fan-shaped <b>exposure</b> <b>counter</b> window and a tripod socket attached by three screws, whereas the second series had a round <b>exposure</b> <b>counter</b> window, a tripod socket integrated in the bottom plate and a meter switch built in the advance lever. In use, the two series are virtually identical. 32,500 serial numbers were allotted to the original Leicaflex.|$|R

50|$|The Rolleiflex TLR film {{cameras were}} notable for their {{exceptional}} build quality, compact size, modest weight, superior optics, durability, simplicity, reliable mechanics and bright viewfinders. They were popular and widely imitated. The high-quality 7.5 cm focal length lenses, manufactured by Zeiss and Schneider, {{allowed for a}} smaller, lighter, more compact camera than their imitators. The highly regarded Zeiss Planar f2.8 and Schneider Xenotar lenses, both 80mm focal length and fast in comparison, are both {{state of the art}} optics. Unique to the Rolleiflex Automat and letter model cameras, the mechanical wind mechanism was robust and clever, making film loading semi-automatic and quick. This mechanism started the <b>exposure</b> <b>counter</b> automatically, auto-spaced the 12 or (on the later model F cameras) 24 exposures, and tensioned the shutter; all with less than one full turn of the film advance crank. This makes the Rolleiflex Automat/Letter model cameras very sought-after for shooting fast paced action, such as street photography.|$|R

To protect aluminum alloy AA 2024 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was chosen because of its interaction with copper rich intermetallic phases. Characterization of the inorganic-organic (I/O) hybrid phase confirms the formation of LDH-type sheets with an unusual high charge density.

40|$|Although patients’ {{psychotherapy}} outcome expectations {{correlate with}} posttreatment outcome, {{there is limited}} research explicating treatment elements that causally influence these expectations. Most relevant {{studies have focused on}} varied deliveries of a treatment rationale. Although elements of rationale delivery appear important for altering patients’ expectations, many studies have been marked by methodological shortcomings, such as lack of a control group. In this clinical analogue experiment, I examined the influence of expectancy persuasion methods, delivered in a video-based presentation of a cognitive-behavioral treatment rationale for social anxiety, on analogue patients’ post-rationale treatment beliefs, treatment motivation, social anxiety symptoms, and therapeutic action. One hundred and seventy-eight undergraduates screened for elevated social anxiety, and matched for sex and treatment history, were randomized to the experimental (rationale plus expectancy persuasion video) or comparison (rationale only video) group. Consistent with my hypotheses, there were significant increases across both groups in anxiety change expectations, perceived confidence in using CBT exposure techniques to address social anxiety, and perceived helpfulness of <b>exposure</b> techniques. <b>Counter</b> to my predictions, no other effects of time, group, or their interaction emerged for the various dependent variables. Additionally, exploration of socioeconomic status, conceptualization of social anxiety, and initial anxiety change expectations as potential moderators of group effects on the dependent variables revealed no significant findings. The results underscore the clinical importance of delivering a clear treatment rationale; however, they also suggest that the specific methods for persuading patients’ treatment beliefs and activities may have lacked sufficient potency to augment the effects of general rationale delivery...|$|R

5000|$|The {{bias toward}} threat {{perception}} evaluation of black people, caused by stereotypes, can be lessened {{with access to}} diagnostic cues (ex: {{presence or absence of}} a weapon) and motivation. Lay people are more racially biased, on average, than trained police officers. Target prototypicality is shown to moderate racial bias. Police officers show a reduced racial bias in comparison to members of the community, however police officers were no better than community members in their sensitivity to prototypic targets. Exposing people to stimuli where race is unrelated to the stereotype may eliminate racial bias. Initial responses were racially biased but research shows that extensive practice with race being unrelated to the task at hand worked to eliminate racial bias. [...] As counter-stereotypical information is aggregated form multiple sources, it may force a change in the stereotype decreasing its strength or negating it entirely. <b>Exposure</b> to <b>counter</b> stereotypic stimuli can reduce racial bias, making race non-diagnostic and unhelpful for the decision process; the characteristic (violence) is unrelated to the group (race). Critical characteristics (weapon possession) is statistically unrelated to race therefore paying attention to race may hinder your judgment because it is non-diagnostic (unessential) to the task at hand. It may be beneficial to expose individuals to counter stereotypic information and stereotypic stimuli to change the nature of category based responses. Racial bias appeared to be significantly reduced (for the parameters of the study) with training indicating that change can be made. A stereotype can be a gatekeeper, perpetuating itself by directing attention toward expected information, or as an efficient information-processing device that facilitates the extraction of novel information with the potential to undermine itself.|$|R
40|$|From a {{treatment}} perspective, {{it is highly}} relevant to pinpoint individual vulnerability factors for resistance to exposure treatment in highly fearful chronic pain patients. Previous fear conditioning research showed that healthy individuals scoring relatively high on trait anxiety display sustained fear to safety cues during extinction. In the context of fear of movement-related pain this intriguing question has been largely neglected so far. Even more importantly, positive psychological traits such as trait positive affect may function as protective factors against the spreading of fear to safe movements and improve exposure treatment outcomes. In this study, healthy participants completed a trait anxiety and trait positive affect questionnaire and underwent acquisition and extinction of fear of movement-related pain using an experimental voluntary movement paradigm. During acquisition, one movement (CS+) was paired with a painful stimulus, another movement was not (CS-). During extinction, the CS+ was no longer reinforced. Results show failure of fear inhibition to the CS- during extinction in healthy individuals scoring relatively high on trait anxiety or relatively low on positive affect. These findings {{seem to suggest that}} safety learning is more vulnerable in healthy people with a high anxious disposition and/or relatively lower levels of positive affect. In addition, this is the first study to show that the negative impact of high trait anxiety on fear inhibition to safe cues during extinction can be countered by high levels of positive affect. These findings may have important clinical implications. PERSPECTIVE: Both low positive affect and high trait anxiety are associated with impaired fear inhibition to non-painful movements during fear extinction. Interestingly, high levels of positive affect buffer against the negative impact of trait anxiety. Increasing positive affect during <b>exposure</b> may <b>counter</b> the effects of trait vulnerabilities and improve treatment outcomes...|$|R
40|$|A linguiça do tipo frescal é bem aceita e comercializada no Brasil. Mesmo pronta para o consumo, pode apresentar alguns micro-organismos patogênicos, caracterizando possível falha no seu controle higienicossanitário. A bactéria Escherichia coli destaca-se por ser indicativa de contaminação fecal, por apresentar resistência a antimicrobianos e alta variabilidade genética. O objetivo da presente pesquisa foi avaliar a qualidade microbiológica de linguiças suínas e de frango, artesanais e industriais, do tipo frescal, segundo a legislação brasileira vigente. Além disso, objetivou-se testar a susceptibilidade a antimicrobianos e identificar o perfil genético dos isolados de E. coli destas linguiças. As amostras foram coletadas nos meses de julho a agosto de 2013, em 43 açougues do Município de Aparecida de Goiânia, Goiás e, para cada uma delas, anotou-se o processo de fabricação, isto é, se artesanal ou industrial. Além disso, aferiu-se a temperatura das linguiças e de seus respectivos balcões de exposição à venda. As amostras foram submetidas à análise microbiológica de acordo com a RDC nº 12 de dois {{de janeiro}} de 2001, seguindo metodologia preconizada pela American Public Health Association. O teste de susceptibilidade a antimicrobianos seguiu a técnica de disco difusão em ágar Müeller–Hinton e a variabilidade genética foi observada pela técnica do Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis. Obtiveram-se oito isolados de E. coli e sete de Staphylococcus aureus. As linguiças artesanais, assim como as suínas estiveram mais contaminadas do que as industrializadas e de frango. Estas últimas apresentaram temperaturas médias menores do que as amostras suínas (6, 0 e 6, 5 ºC, respectivamente), enquanto que linguiças artesanais apresentaram temperaturas médias superiores às industriais (6, 8 e 5, 7 ºC, respectivamente). A maioria dos isolados de E. coli (71, 4 %) foi resistente a, no mínimo, um antibiótico testado. Apresentaram ainda maior resistência à tetraciclina e ampicilina (71, 4 %) e 100, 0 % apresentaram sensibilidade à ceftazidima, ciprofloxacina, {{aztreonam}} e imipenem. Observou-se ainda, alta variabilidade genética entre os isolados pela técnica do PFGE. As linguiças estiveram, em sua maioria, próprias ao consumo humano de acordo com a legislação brasileira, embora os resultados possam indicar falha no controle higienicossanitário, cepas resistentes a antibióticos e alta diversidade genética entre os isolados, indicando fontes diferentes de contaminação. Fresh sausages are well accepted {{and sold in}} Brazil. Even ready for consumption, they may contain some pathogenic microorganisms, featuring failure in sanitary control. The Escherichia coli stands out for being indicative of fecal contamination, due to its antimicrobial resistance and high genetic variability. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate the microbiological quality of pork and chicken sausages, homemade and industrial fresh type, according to Brazilian legislation. In addition, the objective was to test the antimicrobial susceptibility and to identify the genetic profile of E. coli isolated from these sausages. The samples were collected in July and August 2013 in 43 butchers of the city of Aparecida de Goiânia, Goiás and, for each of them, it was noted the manufacturing process, whether homemade or industrial. In addition, the temperature of <b>exposure</b> <b>counters</b> and sausages was measured. The samples were submitted to microbiological analysis according to RDC nº 12 of January 2, 2001, following the methodology proposed by the American Public Health Association. The susceptibility testing to antibiotics followed the diffusion technique in Müeller-Hinton agar and the genetic variability was observed by the technique of Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis. Were obtained from sausages, eight isolates of E. coli and seven of Staphylococcus aureus. The homemade sausages, as well as pork sausages were more contaminated than the industrialized and chicken. The chicken sausages presented lower average temperatures than strains pork sausages (6, 0 and 6, 5 ºC, respectively), whereas homemade sausages showed higher average temperatures compared to industrialized (5, 7 and 6, 8 ºC, respectively). The most strains of E. coli (71, 4 %) were resistant to at least one antibiotic tested. Higher resistance profile were observed to tetracycline and ampicillin, while 100, 0 % of the isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam and imipenen. There was observed a high genetic variability among isolates by PFGE technique.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the naturalistic observation of secondary behaviors performed by 66 drivers {{who took part}} in the Automotive Collision Avoidance System Field Operational Test (ACAS FOT). The ACAS FOT included two driver assistance systems, adaptive cruise control (ACC) and forward collision warning (FCW). Each driver participated in both baseline (no driver assistance systems for one week) and treatment conditions (both ACC and FCW available for 3 weeks). The method employed was to sub-sample video data, and code drivers’ secondary behaviors using 4 s video clips of the driver, collected every 5 minutes. Eight-hundred and ninety video clips were reviewed and coded while participants drove manually, with conventional cruise control, ACC, and FCW. The results show that drivers {{who took part in}} the field test were no more likely to engage in secondary behaviors when driving with ACC and FCW in comparison to manual control. When the driver assistance systems became available to the participants, there was an increase in the number of conversations drivers had with passengers, probably related to the driver explaining the novel ACAS system to passengers. The results have important implications in that, at least for the duration of <b>exposure</b> examined, they <b>counter</b> the concern often raised that driver assistance systems will promote driver distraction, lapses in attention or modification in perceived risk...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that Reinforced Concrete (RC) {{structures}} are vulnerable to a number of factors that can cause deterioration, such as excessive loading, fire and harsh environmental <b>exposure.</b> To <b>counter</b> deterioration and extend the life span of deteriorated structures, the Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) strengthening method has become a popular choice for structural repair. Due to the increased use of this strengthening method, design provisions have been developed for the repair of deteriorated concrete structures. Whilst FRP has been successfully applied to concrete structures where deterioration has been caused by external factors, the application of FRP to concrete structures damaged by internal factors such as Alkali Aggregate Reaction (AAR) is very limited. AAR is a chemical reaction which occurs in the concrete between the non-crystalline silicon oxide found in aggregate with the highly alkaline cement. The result of this reaction is expansion and then cracking starts deep within the concrete cement paste. The reaction is slow but progressive. When the expansion exceeds the tensile strain capacity of the concrete, cracks occur and the concrete loses its initial mechanical properties. Since the discovery of AAR by Stanton in 1940, many research studies have been carried out to develop understanding of how the reaction occurs, to establish guidelines to assess the reactivity of the aggregate, and to evaluate the effect of AAR on the mechanical properties of the concrete. Research on AAR is quite challenging due to the uncertainty of the reaction, as it is affected by factors such as type and amount of aggregate, the nature of the cement and environmental conditions. It is important to treat the concrete structures damaged by AAR in effective ways so that the expansion can be delayed and the life-span of affected structures can be extended. This thesis concerns the effectiveness of using FRP to repair RC structures damaged by AAR. The thesis begins with the assessment of the mechanical properties of concrete at various expansion levels. To relate to real phenomena, medium-scale RC columns were prepared and treated with FRP under two types of conditions: active and passive confinement. In active confinement, it was assumed that the expansion in the columns was continuing while in passive confinement it was assumed that the expansion had ceased. The residual strength of the columns after repair was evaluated and compared against other column properties. Furthermore, the effectiveness of FRP confinement to restrain expansion was monitored and analysed. A new strength model has been developed based on the experimental results. Evaluation of residual strength was compared against existing models, which were found to be ineffective for the prediction of the strength of damaged columns after repair. In addition, FE models were also developed to provide understanding of the behavior of AAR concrete, and to estimate the load-carrying capacity of the repaired columns...|$|R
