40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the spatial-temporal {{evolution of the}} attractiveness of a country's gateway for its international trade, using Shanghai as an example. The attractiveness is regressed on the transportation facilities and geographical conditions. Seaport development is {{found to have a}} major positive impact, followed by inland waterway, highway, and airport development. These positive impacts decrease with the need for highway haulage and with the distance from Shanghai showing an inverse U-shape <b>distribution.</b> <b>Rail</b> appears to have a U-shape distribution, implying a low application of multimodal transportation. A geographical pattern for the impacts of different transportation modes is delineated. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRail {{transports}} {{of single}} wagons or wagon groups are an indispensable {{part of the}} transport chain, such as for the forestry and the chemical industry. However, high production costs and low quality standards {{have led to a}} continuous decline in market shares in recent years. In order to counteract this tendency, ten European companies and research institutions, covering the areas of rail transport and logistics, have combined their forces in the scope of the research and development project ViWaS (Viable Wagonload Production Schemes). The goal: Innovative and simultaneously practical solutions for a sustainable wagonload transport. The applicability of these solutions and their effects have been proven with the aid of business cases in terms of field tests and pilot operations. The following main innovations have been achieved within the ViWaS project:(1) Improved “last-mile” operating concepts incorporating hybrid locomotives and bi-modal shunting engines (by Bentheimer Eisenbahn, Fret SNCF and SBB Cargo supported by HaCon and NEWOPERA) : The new production method for last-mile delivery is based on the idea of separating train movements and sidings shunting processes by deploying bimodal road-rail tractors. Processes within the sidings have been simplified; as a result costs for equipment and staff could be reduced considerably. Hybrid locomotives are fundamental in securing a seamless access to regional <b>distribution</b> <b>rail</b> networks. Potential cost advantages have been identified comparing different traction combinations of real-life transport chains. (2) Modular wagon technologies for a flexible and efficient use of resources (by Wascosa and SBB Cargo) : In detail, three components have been developed up to prototype status: Wascosa's Flex Freight Car is a light container wagon with an accessible floor and thereby applicable for various transport purposes. The Timber Cassette 2. 0 is a new superstructure for log wood transport that features foldable stanchions and can be used in combination with a container wagon. In case the Timber Cassette is not loaded, it can be removed and stacked at the terminal or on a container wagon. Empty runs will be minimized generating efficiency improvements. Additionally, SBB Cargo has developed the so-called Container Loading Adapter, another add-on to a container wagon. It facilitates container loading and unloading in sidings. SBB Cargo will deploy this new component within the “Swiss Split” production system, combining intermodal with wagonload transport. (3) Smart wagon telematics allowing improved tracking at reduced costs (by Eureka) : A separate abstract “Smart Telematics Enabling Efficient Rail Transport” (Contribution ID 875) has been submitted for TRA 2016). 4. A new simulation tool for planning and optimizing single wagonload networks (by ETH Zürich) : WagonSIM is an agent-based simulation tool for rail freight networks to facilitate the optimization of SWL production schemes. It is based on the OpenSource software MatSIM. The tool models the routing of freight wagons according to the routes within the real SWL network. Therefore, the modelling of two network levels is required, the production network and the physical infrastructure. The ViWaS project is co-financed by the European Commission in the scope of the Seventh Framework Programme...|$|E
3000|$|Swiss Split is a rail {{service in}} Switzerland which {{distributes}} containers via conventional shunting yards directly from intermodal terminals {{to the final}} recipients’ sidings by rail. Today’s Swiss Split service is quite successful, but it still has several weaknesses that reduce its competitiveness compared to container distribution by truck. Thus, the two main research questions were: Which feasible improvements for container <b>distribution</b> by <b>rail</b> can be determined?

30|$|The {{analysis}} of today’s Swiss Split <b>distribution</b> by <b>rail</b> showed {{weaknesses in the}} fields of rolling stock, transhipment terminal structures and the production schemes for SWL. Thus, a new container wagon has been developed to serve the sidings. The terminal structure has been improved by a new gateway terminal. The production schemes for SWL have been improved by applying a train-coupling-and-sharing network structure and an improved schedule structure for SWL trains. An agent based simulation software for rail freight has been developed to assess the improvements in the production scheme. At last, the new business model for Swiss Split has led to an integration of transhipment processes and <b>rail</b> <b>distribution.</b> In sum all of these measures have resulted in significant cost reductions for the container <b>distribution</b> by <b>rail.</b>|$|R

3000|$|... ‘Which {{feasible}} improvements for container <b>distribution</b> by <b>rail</b> can be determined?’ and ‘How far {{do these}} improvements increase {{the competitiveness of}} container <b>distribution</b> by <b>rail</b> compared to container distribution by truck?’ The {{research suggests that the}} breakeven distance for Swiss Split compared to truck container distribution be decreased from 140 to 70  km and in such case using SWL for final distribution Swiss Split becomes competitive to trucking even for short transport hauls. The research concludes that rail freight can be competitive compared to road transport if a holistic approach which tackles all weaknesses of the existing services is applied.|$|R

40|$|Running rails used as {{a return}} {{conductor}} and ungrounded scheme have been widely adopted in DC traction power systems. Due to the longitudinal resistance of running rails and insulation resistance of rail-to-ground, {{there will be a}} potential rise between running rails and the ground when return current flows through the running rails, which is known as rail potential. At present, abnormal rise of rail potential exists widely in DC traction power systems. The present rail potential model still cannot simulate and explain the abnormal rail potential in the system. Based on the analysis of power distribution with multiple trains running in multiple sections, a dynamic simulation model of rail potential in the whole line is proposed. The dynamic <b>distribution</b> of <b>rail</b> potential and stray current in DC traction power systems when multiple trains run in multiple sections is analyzed, and the impact of traction current <b>distribution</b> on <b>rail</b> potential is evaluated.

40|$|Rail track {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including rail, sleepers, ballast layer, sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation of rail track under moving traffic on frequent track degradation of rail tracks, especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size <b>distribution</b> of <b>rail</b> track layers on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation of rail track under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size <b>distributions</b> of <b>rail</b> track structural layers have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load. Further, the limitations in con-ventional test methods used in laboratories to estimate the plastic deformation of rail track materials lead to underestimate the plastic deformation of rail tracks...|$|R

30|$|The {{research}} bases {{on previous}} analyses regarding {{the weaknesses of}} container <b>distribution</b> by <b>rail</b> in Switzerland. For each of the identified weaknesses, suitable improvements were developed. The effects of these improvements {{were supposed to have}} an impact on the efficiency and the quality of the services. The improvements were then assessed by applying a cost model for rail freight and truck transportation. For this purpose, today’s Swiss Split was modelled in a base case and the input data for the cost model (e.g., round trips per day for wagons, routing for the transports, train length and train utilisation) were changed according to the estimated effects of the improvements. To finally estimate the impact of the improvements on the SWL production schemes, an agent based simulation for SWL was developed and applied.|$|R
