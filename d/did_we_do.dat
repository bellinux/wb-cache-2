And what <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

The gatefold packaging features a painting stating [...] "Greetings from the Blink-182 Dude Ranch," [...] which {{was intended to be}} a pastiche of both [...] "cheesy postcards" [...] and a parody of Bruce Springsteen's Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.. Art direction for the album was headed by Tim Stedman, with Stedman and graphic designer Ashley Pigford designing the package. The disc art, a revolver chamber, was designed by artist Victor Gastelum, while the band photography was done by Steven Shea. DeLonge recalled in 2012 that the only [...] "bad" [...] aspect of Dude Ranch in retrospect were the jokes found within the inside artwork: [...] "I remember sitting at the Sombrero taco shop going, 'Fuck, we’ve got to finish off our album cover, let’s just write some jokes to these cowboy pictures.' Why <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that? We should have had better jokes for those pictures." ...|$|E

2500|$|The late President Coolidge once said, [...] "America's {{business}} is business." [...] Therein lies the answer. We naive artists, {{we wanted to}} see what was going on in the world of art, we wanted to open up the mind of the public to the need of art. <b>Did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it? We did more than that. The Armory Show affected the entire culture of America. Business caught on immediately, even if the artists did not at once do so. The outer appearance of industry absorbed the lesson like a sponge. Drabness, awkwardness began to disappear from American life, and color and grace stepped in. Industry certainly took notice. The decorative elements of Matisse and the Cubists were immediately taken on as models for the creation of a brighter, more lively America. (Walt Kuhn) ...|$|E

[...] Christie asked during a Brick, New Jersey town hall meeting. [...] The Star-Ledger editorial board answered that Richard Nixon had cut deals with Democrats, but had still abused power; and that despite Christie's early bipartisanship, he has thrown himself into several partisan standoffs; and that his personal style had always been [...] "vindictive and aggressive"; and concluded that Christie [...] "created the culture that inspired" [...] the lane closures.|$|E

For {{the first time in}} the prize's history, the judges were unanimous. In December 2005, a survey of the world's largest firms of architects published in 2006 BD World Architecture 200 voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world. However, Ken Shuttleworth, who worked for Foster and Partners on the design of {{the building}}, said in 2011 that he believed the style was now out-moded: [...] "I was looking at the glass all around and , 'Why on earth <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that?' Now we would do things differently". The building featured in recent films such as Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Russell Crowe's A Good Year, Sharon Stone's Basic Instinct 2, and Woody Allen's Match Point and, rechristened the Spirit of London, became the spaceship centrepiece of Keith Mansfield's 2008 novel Johnny Mackintosh and the Spirit of London.|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu {{opposed the}} Oslo accords from their inception. In 1993, he {{dedicated}} a chapter, entitled [...] "Trojan Horse", {{of his book}} A Place Among the Nations to argue against the Oslo Peace Process. He asserted that Amin al-Husseini {{had been one of}} the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's 'alleged exterminationist Nazism.' During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that [...] "neither President Clinton nor Secretary [...] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace." [...] In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: [...] "They asked me before the election if I'd honor ," [...] "I said I would, but... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. How <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it?

60|$|Converts are {{interesting}} people.

Some of us even got the length of singing and speech-making, but the younger portion of the band soon lost their appetites and dispersed--some to romp, some to ramble, others to engage in games.|$|E

God fulfils himself in many ways: ways we little think of {{when we try to}} set up our own {{shortsighted}} laws against his Word. When does the Devil catch hold of a man? Not when he's working and not when he's drunk; but when he's idle and sober. Our own natures tell us to drink when we have nothing else to do. Look at you and me! When we'd both earned a pocketful of money, what <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> Went on the spree, naturally. But I was humble minded. I did as the rest did.

60|$|Some of M. Lefebure's 'facts' (of objects moving untouched) were {{certainly}} frauds, like the tricks of Eusapia. But, {{even if all}} the facts recorded were frauds, such impostures, performed by savage conjurers, who certainly profess {118d} to produce the phenomena, might originate, or help to originate, the respect paid to 'fetishes' and the belief in Mana. But probably Major Ellis's researches into {{the religion of the}} Tshi-speaking races throw most light on the real ideas of African fetishists. The subject is vast and complex. I am content to show that, whatever De Brosses <b>did,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not abandon a search for the motives of the savage fetishist. Indeed, De Brosses himself did seek and find at least one African motive, 'The conjurers (jongleurs) persuade them that little instruments in their possession are endowed with a living spirit.' So far, fetishism is spiritualism.|$|E
