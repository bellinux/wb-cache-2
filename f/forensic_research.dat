5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for <b>Forensic</b> <b>Research</b> in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E
5|$|The July {{storm was}} not the last to damage the Treasure Coast of Florida in 1933: a much {{stronger}} cyclone in September, with winds of 125mph (200km/h), extensively damaged the same area that the July storm affected. This storm overshadowed memories of the earlier hurricane, and would be remembered as among the worst on the Treasure Coast {{as late as the}} 1980s. The occurrence of twohurricanes on the east coast of Florida in the same season is a relatively rare event in historical records, but not unprecedented: for instance, <b>forensic</b> <b>research</b> by weather historian David M. Ludlum suggests that two or more hurricanes in 1837 may have affected the region. Citing reports from William Reid in Law of Storms (1838), Ludlum noted that two hurricanes affected Central and Northeast Florida on August1–2 and September6, respectively, while other storms, potentially hurricanes, may have done so later in September. The September hurricane struck between St. Augustine and Jacksonville. Incidentally, the 1837 Atlantic hurricane season was apparently very active, like 1933; as in 2004, a record four hurricanes hit the state of Florida, including the infamous Racer's Storm in October.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{was shot}} {{four or five}} times and was {{severely}} injured, but survived. It has been popularly believed that his pocket watch stopped one shot. The watch is displayed in the LDS Church History Museum in Salt Lake City; the watch was broken and was used to help identify the time of the attack. In 2010, <b>forensic</b> <b>research</b> by J. Lynn Lyon of the University of Utah and Mormon historian Glen M. Leonard suggested that Taylor's watch was not struck by a ball, but rather broke against the window ledge. Columbia University historian Richard Bushman, the author of , also supports this view.|$|E
25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{research}} with some clerid species. <b>Forensic</b> <b>research</b> is limited {{because of their}} late arrival on carrion, but members such as Thanasimus undatulus have been researched as a possible role in integrated pest management or IPM. Thanasimus undatulus is a predator of bark beetles. Some species of bark beetles such as the southern pine beetle and the mountain pine beetle can become pests to the lumber industry because in large numbers they can cause damage and kill live trees. Thanasimus undatulus has been researched as a possible biological control agent for these pests. Researchers and forestry officials have used bark beetle aggreagation pheromones to attract the checkered beetle to specific trees. This causes the bark beetles to be overwhelmed, extensively preyed upon by the clerid beetles, and typically eliminated.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the proper}} {{specimens}} are collected, {{a series of}} DNA sequencing tests can be initiated. [...] Several methods of DNA sequencing exist to further analyze the gut material of the insect and eventually track down human microsatellite DNA. [...] The sequencing methods currently utilized by forensic labs include STR or short tandem repeat profiling and HVR or the hyper variable regions of DNA. The current DNA analysis on forensic cases and <b>forensic</b> <b>research</b> indicates that STR profiling is generally successful, whereas HVR sequencing proved to a better choice in DNA testing, as its results had a higher success rate. In new research on the DNA analysis; [...] "STR typing of human DNA from fly larvae fed on decomposing bodies" [...] STR profiling created a complete profile in seven of the thirteen cases, and two cases displayed an incomplete set of alleles whereas four of the cases showed incomplete profiling. [...] On the other hand, HVR sequencing was successful in all cases except one, So there is a slight margin of error when utilizing the STR profiling method of DNA typing in forensic analysis.|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, Collins' {{attorneys}} {{introduced a}} renowned neutron analyst named Dr. Robert Jervis {{in an effort}} to discredit the earlier testimony of the forensic experts who had testified on behalf of the prosecution. Dr. Jervis testified as to his belief that insufficient chemical samples had existed in the samples retrieved from the basement which the prosecution scientists had worked with to form their conclusions, and that to form a conclusive neutron activation analysis, at least ten components in a hair sample must be compared, whereas only five components had been used by the prosecution's forensics experts to determine their findings. The forensic experts who had testified on behalf of the prosecution, Dr. Jervis stated, had therefore based their conclusions on [...] "insufficient data". Dr. Jervis' conclusions were supported by a private consultant named Auseklis Perkons, and a Massachusetts-based Director of <b>Forensic</b> <b>Research</b> named Samuel Golub. Perkons testified as to his belief that the hair samples retrieved from Beineman's panties were of a [...] "different origin" [...] than the hair samples retrieved from the Leiks' basement, whereas Golub stated that because he had found only one single fiber upon the victim's panties, the likelihood of her undergarments accumulating these hairs from a basement was extremely remote. In rebuttal to the testimony of Dr. Golub, the defense recalled Dr. Walter Holz on August 12 to testify as to the samples he had himself taken to Dr. Golub for identification; Dr. Holz affirmed that he had taken twenty magnified photographic slides of samples retrieved from Beineman's panties to Dr. Golub's laboratory for analysis, and that they had contained numerous man-made fibrous materials.|$|E
