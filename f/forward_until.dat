5|$|Shane Williams is Wales' record try-scorer with 58 tries. Williams is also Wales' record try-scorer in Six Nations Championships with 22 and the Rugby World Cups with 10. Colin Charvis' 22 tries is {{the all-time}} Welsh {{record for a}} forward, and was the world record for tries by a <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> 2011.|$|E
5|$|Davout, {{seeing the}} confusion, {{personally}} led the 57th Line Regiment (Le Terrible) <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> {{he had his}} horse shot from under him; he fell so hard that General Sorbier reported him as dead. General Rapp arrived to replace him, only to find Davout alive and leading the 57th forward again. Rapp then led the 61stLine Regiment forward when he was wounded (for the 22ndtime in his career).|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
50|$|In lava deltas, hyaloclastites {{form the}} main {{constituent}} of foresets formed {{ahead of the}} expanding delta. The foresets fill in the seabed topography, eventually building up to sea level, allowing the subaerial flow to move <b>forwards</b> <b>until</b> it reaches the sea again.|$|R

5000|$|A doubled block also blocks {{trailing}} {{pieces of}} the player who created the block, or blocks them unless they roll the exact number {{to land on the}} block; additionally, the doubled block cannot move <b>forwards</b> <b>until</b> the block that landed upon it moves off again. This reduces the tactical advantage of a block and makes the game more interesting.|$|R
5|$|VOC forces {{landed on}} 4–5 May on Trunajaya's right flank. Trunajaya {{did not expect}} an attack on this flank, and {{consequently}} it was only lightly defended. VOC took Ampel after little resistance. In the following days, the VOC established its battery in Ampel, simultaneously conducting desultory negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya accused Speelman of being unknightly by attacking his right flank instead of his main position. Both Trunajaya and VOC moved their works <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> their artillery batteries faced each other at pistol-shot distance. Trunajaya dammed the river, the VOC's source of fresh water; afterwards, the VOC troops were limited to brackish water, and diseases soon spread.|$|E
5|$|Despite the support, {{the state}} caved {{to some of}} the {{complaints}} of the opposition, resulting in a delay of the project. By November1963, the state told Caroline officials that the design of bridges along NY330 required changing to new state highway standards. The state began working also on assessing property values of the land required for the new position. They stated that unless the state budget could not afford it, the project would begin the process in 1964. Patience ran thin by February1964 with the Caroline town officials, who demanded progress from the state, who stated that the project could not move <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> there was funding. By November1964, the state admitted nothing would happen until at least 1965, two years behind schedule. This time, the construction would be delayed due to delays in acquiring land and personnel.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{continued}} as divisional commander {{for most of}} the campaign at Gallipoli. Of tall stature, he made constant tours of the front line amidst jokes that the communication trenches needed to be dug deeply to allow for his height. On one visit to Quinn's Post on 7 May, he personally directed troop deployments to counter a potential Turkish counterattack. Despite his inspections, his reputation amongst the rank and file of the division did not improve. Nor was his co-ordination of offensive operations sound; during the August offensive, his lack of oversight allowed one of his brigade commanders, Brigadier General Francis Johnston, a British Army officer on secondment to the NZEF, to vacillate over deployment of reinforcements. On the morning of 8 August, the Wellington Infantry Battalion was in tenuous possession of Chunuk Bair but required support to consolidate its position. Johnstone did not order his reinforcements <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> later that day. Crucial momentum was lost and Chunuk Bair was later recaptured by the Turks.|$|E

So I shall not say good-bye, Richard. For {{what would be the}} use of that, you know, when I am coming back so soon!" ...|$|R
5|$|Picton's probing {{attacks against}} the French center also met stiff resistance. Picton split the 3rd Division, sending Thomas Brisbane's brigade up the right spur toward Foy's {{position}} and Keane's brigade up the left spur toward Darmagnac's division. Keane was supported by Manley Power's Portuguese brigade from 3rd Division. Brisbane was followed up the right spur by Clinton's 6th Division. Since the valleys between the spurs were deep and muddy, both advances were restricted to narrow fronts. Picton's skirmishers quickly drove back the French outposts. When the leading brigades came under accurate artillery fire from the Escorial and Lafaurie knolls, Picton held back his formed troops and reinforced his skirmish line to seven British light companies, three 5th/60th Foot rifle companies and the entire 11th Caçadores Battalion. This heavy skirmish line moved <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> it {{came into contact with}} Soult's main defense line, but it was unable to press any farther. For two hours, Picton waited for Beresford's attack to make progress as the two sides skirmished.|$|E
5|$|The {{border between}} the Reich and Yugoslavia was {{unsuitable}} for motorised operations. Due to the short notice of the invasion, {{the elements of the}} invading German 2nd Army that would make up LI Infantry Corps and XLIX Mountain Corps had to be transported from Germany, German-occupied France and the Nazi puppet Slovak Republic, and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas in time for 6 April. In the area of responsibility of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski, the XLIX Mountain Corps was significantly delayed, and did not start pushing <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> 8 April. On the following day, the Germans advanced on Celje. In response to withdrawals on the right flank of the 7th Army, 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and Mountain Detachment Triglavski fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river on 9 April. Elements of XLIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the Karawanks railway tunnel near Jesenice, and the Italians made several attacks on the weakened sector of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{prevented}} a swift Soviet breakthrough into Estonia {{and gave the}} underground National Committee of the Republic of Estonia enough time to attempt to re-establish Estonian independence. On 1 August 1944, the national committee pronounced itself Estonia's highest authority and on 18 September 1944, acting head of state Uluots appointed a new government led by Otto Tief. Over the radio in English, the government declared its neutrality in the war. The government issued two editions of the Riigi Teataja (State Gazette) but {{did not have time}} to distribute them. On 21 September, the national forces seized the government buildings in Toompea, Tallinn and ordered the German forces to leave. The flag of Estonia was hoisted at the tower of Pikk Hermann, to be removed by the Soviets four days later. The Estonian Government in Exile served to carry the continuity of the Estonian state <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> 1992, when it handed its credentials over to the incoming President, Lennart Meri.|$|E
30|$|The Request packets (RREQs): RREQs are {{normally}} used whenever a source node {{wants to start}} communicating with a destination node; it floods the network with request packets. An RREQ is <b>forwarded</b> <b>until</b> it reaches the destination node or a node which has a route {{to communicate with the}} destination node. For each retransmission, the number of hops is incremented. Moreover, RREQs are used to form the direct path between the source and the destination nodes.|$|R

50|$|O'Neill's forces took up {{defensive}} positions near a ford {{across the}} river and at a nearby mill. O'Neill led some of his troops <b>forwards</b> <b>until</b> they made contact with the enemy, then withdrew hastily {{in an effort to}} draw Moore's army onto unfavourable ground. As they advanced in pursuit the Protestant troops were raked with crossfire, particularly from the mill where O'Neill had stationed musketeers. Faced with heavy fire, Moore's men withdrew. They regrouped but two further assaults were driven back.|$|R
5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move <b>forward</b> <b>until</b> a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.|$|E

25|$|Like the snout, {{the lower}} jaws are elongated. However, in some species, like Eurhinosaurus and Excalibosaurus, {{the front of}} the snout far {{protrudes}} beyond the lower jaws. While {{the front of the}} lower jaw is typically low, its rear depth is very variable. The greater part of the lower jaw is formed by the front dentary, the tooth-bearing bone. At its inner side the dentary is covered by a splenial that extends <b>forwards</b> <b>until</b> the symphysis, the common contact surface where both lower jaws are grown together. The jaw joints do not allow a horizontal chewing movement: they function as simple hinges to vertically open or close the jaws.|$|R
