5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E
5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs made their way <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Well</b> of Loneliness.|$|E

5|$|Maggie {{asks the}} group for help to remove a bloated walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water. Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E
5|$|Moelia and {{his family}} depart for Ciwalirang the {{following}} morning, hoping that Noesa Brama will consent to the marriage of Moelia and Retna Sari. The priest accepts the proposal, but expresses regret over {{the destruction of the}} statue after he discovers that Retna Sari and Soerijati had not gone willingly with the men from Palembang. He weds Moelia and Retna Sari and has them promise that their first son will be raised a Hindu and become king of the Baduy; he then surrenders all his power to his daughter. Later, hoping that his spirit and those of his ancestors can control the volcano, Noesa Brama secretly commits suicide by jumping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> Several weeks later, activity at the volcano drops, although it remains active.|$|E
50|$|Graz'zt {{has even}} been known to {{maintain}} alliances {{with those who have}} failed him — the most notable of these being the demon lord Ebulon, who once served Graz'zt as a general. When Ebulon was defeated by Demogorgon and then imprisoned in <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> of Darkness, Graz'zt sent his armies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> of Darkness in a daring rescue attempt but failed. Now and then, the Dark Prince sends champions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> to attempt rescues, but the humiliation of his initial failure has kept him from making additional massive forays <b>into</b> <b>the</b> prison plane.|$|R

5|$|The 19thcentury saw {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} the castle. In 1826 repairs {{were made to the}} well in the keep. At the same time a survey was carried out by A. W. N. Pugin and he excavated around the keep, investigating how it was built. He descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> in a bucket in an unsuccessful search for treasure. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, leased the castle to the Corporation of Rochester in 1870 for use as a public park; when it opened to the public in 1872, Rochester Castle was presented as a picturesque ruin, with trees planted in the enclosure and the walls overgrown with ivy. In 1884 the Corporation bought the castle for £6,572 (equivalent to £3.4million in 2009 terms). Between 1896 and 1904, George Payne carried out repairs. In {{the first quarter of the}} century the gardens acquired a German field gun and a tank from the First World War, and a bandstand, though they were removed by 1961. Ivy was removed from the keep between 1919 and 1931 and the planting in the castles scaled back. In 1960 the origin of Boley Hill was investigated archaeologically, but the excavations failed to provide firm dating evidence.|$|E
5|$|While campaigning against Venetian forces, Skanderbeg {{managed to}} inflict a serious defeat on July 23, 1448, seriously {{weakening}} Venetian power in Albania. The siege of Svetigrad continued, however, and Marin Barleti {{writes that the}} Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> of the fortress, forcing the garrison to refuse to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut off the water supply and induced the garrison to surrender. Given the circumstance, Perlati promised a surrender if the garrison were allowed a safe passage through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that the garrison should be promised safe passage and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would only be intensified through such an act; he decided to instead return the garrisoning force to Skanderbeg. On July 31, 1448 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{travels to}} Cairo, where they {{meet up with}} Indy's friend Sallah, a skilled excavator. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with {{a replica of the}} {{headpiece}} (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Indy discovers Marion is alive, bound and gagged in a tent, but does not release her for fear of alerting the Nazis. Indy, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive, seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer.|$|E

25|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{carried out}} in the Barnett Shale is done by pumping a mixture of water, sand, and various chemical additives (to affect viscosity, flow rates, etc.) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> bore at a sufficient pressure to create and propagate a fracture in the surrounding rock formation down hole. This is crucial in low permeability rock as it exposes more of the formation to the well bore and greater volumes of gas can be produced by the increased surface area. Without hydraulic fracturing, the wells would not produce at an economically feasible rate.|$|E
