5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> the soil or inside the stems of plants, {{and to do}} this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E

5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E

5000|$|One {{tradition}} concerning Mary Magdalene {{says that}} {{following the death}} and resurrection of Jesus, she used her position to gain {{an invitation to a}} banquet given by the Roman Emperor Tiberius. When she met him, she held a plain <b>egg</b> <b>in</b> her hand and exclaimed, [...] "Christ is risen!" [...] The Emperor laughed, and said that Christ rising from the dead was as likely as the <b>egg</b> <b>in</b> her hand turning red while she held it.

5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the <b>eggs.</b> <b>In</b> the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the top}} of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the <b>eggs.</b> <b>In</b> Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> a dead leaf, but more usually in a silk egg sac on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E

5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|The queen only lays 10–20 <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> {{the very}} {{early stages of the}} colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay <b>eggs.</b> <b>In</b> some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Adult frogs {{lay their}} <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, {{one at a}} time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.|$|E
