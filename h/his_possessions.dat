5|$|And, it is {{a mistake}} to think, that the most {{hardened}} sinner, who oweth <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> or titles to any such wicked arts of thieving, can have true peace of mind, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, and amid the cries of ruined widows and orphans.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mentioned}} noblemen are brothers Michael Kacsics and Simon Kacsics, the Voivode of Transylvania (1209–1212; 1215) and Ban of Slavonia (1212; somewhere 1213–1218). Simon {{took part}} in the murder of Queen Gertrude of Merania (24 September 1213); therefore, King Andrew II of Hungary confiscated <b>his</b> <b>possessions.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1870 Spruyt {{returned}} to the Orange Free State and to private law practice. He established himself in Ladybrand, a territory conquered by the Orange Free State in the last Basotho War of 1867.

5|$|In mid-July Warwick had to {{withdraw}} from government to his estates on account of illness. When he died on 12 August 1315, political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had had Warwick poisoned. He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire, an establishment to which his family had been benefactors. In value, <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> were second only {{to those of the}} earl of Lancaster among the nobility of England.|$|E
5|$|Kalam {{was noted}} for his {{integrity}} and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, {{and was in}} the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> went to his eldest brother, who survived him.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, Henry prepared {{an invasion}} of Deheubarth. Rhys made plans to resist, but was persuaded by his council to meet the king to discuss peace terms. The terms were much harsher than those offered to Owain: Rhys was stripped of all <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> apart from Cantref Mawr, though he was promised one other cantref. The other territories were returned to their Norman lords.|$|E
5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord and all <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad {{fell on his}} wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and {{it was found that}} the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three {{drug dealers and}} collect a guitar case {{containing}} cocaine, which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie and his men invade the jockey's hotel room and take all <b>his</b> <b>possessions.</b> The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van {{to escape from the}} jockey's men and realise they had stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the cocaine, which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the cocaine is missing and set out to find Charlie.|$|E

5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
5|$|In 1087, William was fatally injured {{during a}} {{campaign}} in the Vexin. Henry joined his dying father near Rouen in September, where the King partitioned <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> among his sons. The rules of succession in western Europe {{at the time were}} uncertain; in some parts of France, primogeniture, in which the eldest son would inherit a title, was growing in popularity. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands – usually considered to be the most valuable – and younger sons given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.|$|E

5|$|In June 1651, Frederick William {{broke the}} {{provisions}} of the Peace of Westphalia by invading Jülich-Berg, bordering <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> in Cleves-Mark at the lower Rhine river. The Treaty of Xanten, which had ended the War of the Jülich succession between Brandenburg and the count palatines in 1614, had partitioned the once united Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg among the belligerents, and Jülich-Berg was since ruled by the Catholic counts of Palatinate-Neuburg. After the Thirty Years' War, Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg, disregarded a 1647 agreement with Frederick William which had favored the Protestants in the duchies, while Frederick William insisted that the agreement be upheld. Besides these religious motives, Frederick William's invasion also aimed at territorial expansion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about <b>his</b> <b>possessions</b> that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E

He also {{continued to}} operate his school in Blandongan, as well as the employment office, which trained young men and women for positions such as maids, gardeners, and bellhops, then placed them with employers. Several of PahWongso's students came from islands other than Java.
