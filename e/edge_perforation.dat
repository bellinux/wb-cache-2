Differences in initial composition and configuration influence the amount but not the general tendencies of the variations of morphological spatial pattern (MSP) class proportions with scale. Increase of P led to data generalization resulting in either a removal of the small size features or their potential transformation into other non-core MSP classes, while an increase of S decreases the MSP core area and this process may transform small core areas into the MSP class islet. We established that the behavior of the MSPA classes with changing scale can be categorized as consistent and robust scaling relations in the forms of linear, power, or logarithmic functions over a range of scales.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and application framework for monitoring {{the state and}} dynamics of forest spatial pattern is presented. Starting from a binary forest map, forested pixels are classified as "perforated", "edge", "patch", "core", "connector" and "branch". These six spatial pattern classes contribute information related to fragmentation and structural connectivity. Fragmentation processes {{are related to the}} size and frequency distribution of core forest units, and the proportion and type of <b>edges,</b> <b>perforation</b> and patches. Structural connectivity is addressed with the amount and type of connectors and branches.

50|$|Another test {{is to use}} a {{magnifying}} glass to see if gum has gathered on the <b>perforation</b> <b>edges</b> of the stamp. This will not occur with an original gum stamp as the normal method of stamp production is to perforate a whole sheet of stamps after the sheet is first gummed and then printed. This means the gum is evenly distributed on the back of all the stamps contained on the sheet before perforating. The perforating process does not perfectly cut the paper. Fine tears develop along the round areas of the <b>perforation</b> <b>edges</b> because of this process. Also, when the stamps are torn to separate them from the sheets, fine tears along the perforation tips develop. These fine tears from perforating and tearing render tiny hairs descending {{from the edge of the}} stamp. Examination of these hairs will help detect a regummed stamp. Remember, with this test it is important not to look at the gum, but rather the <b>perforation</b> <b>edges.</b> The edges will be somewhat hairy on an original gummed stamp, but on a regummed stamp the hairs will be glued together in varying degrees. This gum may also gather unevenly at the <b>perforation</b> <b>edges.</b> On expert regumming jobs the person making the alteration may file the perforations to restore the original look to the stamps edge, but they almost always leave an imperfection or two that may only be caught by an expert.|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} forest {{monitoring}} at landscape level {{on the basis}} of a methodology combining satellite data mapping and image morphological processing. It aims to contribute to reporting on trends of forest fragmentation and connectivity, by using forest spatial pattern metrics. The Carpathians were selected as a study area. For five case study areas single-date forest - non-forest maps derived from Landsat images acquired in the 1980 s and 2000 s were an input for the post-classification change detection. Morphological image processing was applied then to map forest spatial pattern into six classes (core, patches, <b>edges,</b> <b>perforation,</b> connectors and branches). Further, connectivity and fragmentation processes were assessed {{on the basis of}} the proportion of forest pattern classes. We found a general trend of forest increase over the last decade. An increase of forest fragmentation and connectivity was noticed for four case study areas and a decrease for one case study area. The increase of forest cover may indicate the decline of importance of mountain agriculture, while changes of forest fragmentation and connectivity are probably related to the transformation of forest management practices in the 1990 s in the region. We conclude, that the proposed methodology allows assessing trends in forest fragmentation and connectivity at approximately 1 ha minimum mapping unit. JRC.

40|$|A {{new method}} based on {{mathematical}} morphology and combined with customized measures {{was applied for}} European reporting on forest ecosystem goods and services, with special emphasis on forest spatial pattern processes ¿fragmentation and lack of connectivity- leading to loss of biodiversity. Four pattern processes were informed over a 10 years time frame from the European CORINE Land Cover data at 100 m spatial resolution. They capture (1) sample effects (when habitat units are totally lost), (2) area effects (reduction of habitat units in number and size, small/large fragments issue), (3) isolation effects (increased distance between habitat units, reduction of structural/functional connectivity), and (4) edge effects (creation of forest edge habitat, internal and external edge effects). The computation {{of each of the}} four patterns processes is based on combinations of seven forest spatial patterns classes (core, small fragments, <b>edges,</b> <b>perforation,</b> connectors as bridges and loops, branches) identified with 100 m edge width in the year 1990 and 2000. European hot spots maps and associated area statistics summarized the processes at country and administrative NUTS 3 management levels. The direction and degree of each forest processes is informed: low and high increase and decrease levels. Each management unit was also assigned a forest proportion category (60 %) in 1990. The most critical hot spots for the survival of area-sensitive forest interior species were identified for the four processes in the less forested regions (below 30 % threshold). This large-scale harmonized assessment identified landscape level hot spots of pattern changes where local surveys are needed and correction measures would probably be necessary for conservation and landscape restoration.

It is {{an indicator of the}} Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe. A new method based on mathematical morphology is proposed for this indicator implementation. This new method enables to classify and map seven spatial pattern classes (core, small fragments/flecks, <b>edges,</b> <b>perforation,</b> connectors as bridges and loops, branches) from any binary land cover maps. European forest pattern maps were obtained from the 100 m spatial resolution Pan-European CORINE land cover map for the years 1990 and 2000 and from a new 25 m spatial resolution European forest for the year 2000. Pattern statistics showed the diversity fo 27 European countries at 100 m resolution for year 2000. Trends in forest pattern from 1990 to 2000 were analyzed per provincial administrative unit. Based on the structural seven pattern classes the following four pattern processes were measured: core forest, forest structural connectivity, external fragmentation accounting for small fragment and for external-to-core borders, internal fragmentation accounting for forest perforation and other internal-to-core borders. The results show summary maps that depict the trends (reduction, increase) for each pattern process. Pattern trends can be interpreted as positive or negative depending on species guilds (interior versus edge species). Despite a stable overall forest cover observed at 100 m over the 10 years, changes in forest pattern took place with a regional variety in type and direction over Europe. The proposed method represents an applicable assessment scheme suitable for the continental scale. It has identified hot spots of pattern changes where further study on species population is needed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{paper is}} focused on the {{crystallization}} of Ni-P amorphous thin films produced by a chemical reduction method. The results of differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) experiments, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of the microstructures are presented. The surface morphology of Ni-P amorphous films can be described in terms of arrays of spherical particles and holes, related to H 2, distributed mostly at their borders. The DSC studies of the films showed two exothermic effects at 370 and 440 oC. This implies that crystallization proceeds in two stages. First, the metastable crystalline phase Ni 12 P 5 is formed and then transforms into the equilibrium phases Ni 3 P and Ni. After annealing at a temperature below the peak of crystallization, the amorphous structure is visible. However, near the <b>edge</b> of <b>perforations</b> of TEM thin foils, the presence of the nanocrystals were revealed and the holes disappeared.

We herein describe a new case of successful repair of an iatrogenic rectal perforation by the endoloop/clips technique.

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s {{computer}} paper printing, {{cross and}} <b>edge</b> <b>perforations</b> are done only by mechanical perforators. The mechanical perforation process works fine since {{the width of}} the bridges and the length of the holes to be perforated remain large. Concerned with improvements in quality, printers have introduced microperforations. The holes and bridges of the perforation pattern are so small that after the user has torn off the sheet of computer paper along the <b>perforation</b> pattern, the <b>edges</b> of the document are very smooth and clean. Unfortunately, microperforations are reaching the limits of what can be achieved by the mechanical perforators. Because of the physical contact between the perforating tool and the paper, the perforation pattern is damaged. The tensile strength of the microperforation pattern decreases significantly and the paper often jams in the computer printers. Mechanical perforator dies wear and may even break. Therefore, holes are incompletely perforated or missing, so that the document is likely to be damaged when it is torn off along the perforation pattern by the user. Incomplete or missing perforations increases the tensile strength of the perforation pattern. Therefore, the printer can increase the quality of a perforation pattern by reducing its variability in tensile strength. This thesis studies the perforation of computer paper by laser beam. It is demonstrated through a microscopic study that laser perforations are free of all the defects which are inherent to the mechanical perforation process. It has been found that laser perforated holes remain open while mechanically perforated holes close back just after being perforated. The tests which have been carried out show that using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do microperforations reduces the variability in the tensile strength from 0. 694 kilograms to 0. 0751 kilograms. This improvement is significant. However, using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do large-size perforations reduces the variability in tensile strength only from 0. 0421 kilograms to 0. 0338 kilograms. This improvement is not significant. A mathematical model expressing the relationship between the tensile strength of a perforation pattern, {{the width of the}} bridges, and the number of bridges per inch has been established. The correlation found between the model and the experimental values is high (r = 0. 98). This mathematical model is a simple method which allows the printer to adjust the tensile strength of a laser perforation pattern to the desired value. This model requires only simple calculations, and the knowledge of one basic characteristic - the tensile strength of the paper. As a conclusion, the laser beam is a very valuable tool which can achieve very high quality microperforations on computer paper. However, it seems not worth using a laser to do large-size perforations on computer paper since the decrease in tensile strength variability over the mechanical perforation process is not significant. The fact that laser perforated holes remain wide open could improve high speed folding and piling in the press deliveries by allowing the air trapped between the sheets of computer paper to escape through the perforated holes. This property has also already found an interesting application for cigarette filter paper...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the etiology, {{diagnosis and treatment}} of spontaneous perforation of the colon. METHODS: The clinical data of 10 cases of spontaneous perforation of the colon, observed at Fuding hospital from January 2004 to December 2007, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean age at onset was 65 years (range from 45 to 73). Seven patients had a history of chronic constipation. All patients complained of sudden lower abdominal pain. The perforation occurred after coloclysis and administration of senna leaves in two patients. Nine patients had signs of peritoneal irritation. Seven cases underwent abdominal paracentesis, which was diagnostic in six. Only one case was definitely diagnosed prior to surgery. One patient underwent neoplasty of the colon, another a partial resection of colon, six a neoplasty of the colon plus sigmoid colostomy, and two underwent Hartmann surgery. All perforation sites were opposite to the mesenteric <b>edge.</b> The <b>perforation</b> sites were located on descending colon in one case, sigmoid colon in three cases, and rectosigmoid colon in six cases. In five patients, surgical pathological examination was consistent with the microscopical changes of colonic perforation caused by feces. Three patients died after surgery.

40|$|Bacterial leaf blight of {{eucalyptus}} is initially characterized by water soaked, angular, amphigenous and interveinal lesions, concentrated {{along the main}} vein, at the edges or scattered on the leaf blade. As the disease progresses, the lesions become brown to pale, and when young leaves are infected leaf cut areas at the <b>edges</b> or <b>perforations</b> {{at the center of}} the lesions may appear due to abortion of the necrotic area. Eventually, necrosis may be found on petiole and twigs. Leaf fall commonly occurs on highly susceptible genotypes due to the early senescence of diseased leaves. Precise diagnosis is accomplished by bacterial exudation from leaf sections placed in a water drop under light microscope (200 x). Twenty-five bacterial isolates from Amapá (2), Bahia (4), Minas Gerais (2), São Paulo (9), Pará (3), Mato Grosso do Sul (1), and Rio Grande do Sul (4) States, which induced hypersensitive reaction (HR) in non-host plants and were pathogenic to eucalyptus, when inoculated by inoculum injection, were identified by biochemical assays, using carbon sources (MicroLogTM BIOLOG) and sequence analysis (16 S rDNA).

Aim: to test cellulose use in the closure of septal perforation in rabbits and to compare fibrosis, inflammation, vascular congestion and graft integrity. Materials and Methods: Fifteen rabbits. The rabbits {{were divided into two}} groups: Control: Five rabbits and Bionext ® and fibrin glue Tissucol®: Ten rabbits. Septal perforations were done in all of them. In the Bionext ® group the closure was performed with the placement of cellulose. Results: Two rabbits died in the first week. Cellulose group: 2 closures without the cellulose in between the septum membrane and in 4 cases the graft {{stood in the middle of}} the perforation locked in place by the edges. No closure in the control group. Conclusion: There was no closure of the perforation of the nasal septum with the graft between the septum membranes. There was no statistically significant difference concerning acute inflammation, vascular congestion and fibrosis between the 2 groups. In cases in which the graft remained in place, there was no change in its integrity. It may be used as a substructure for reepithelization of the <b>perforation</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} proven that {{otoliths}} reflect morphology, morphometry and chemical composition of the environment that fish frequent. However, {{it has not been}} established if extreme environmental changes can be reflected by such structure. In this study, we analyze the morphology and morphometry of otolith sagitta of silverside (Odontesthes bonariensis) living in a setting that shows important environmental changes as Chasicó lake in Buenos Aires province (38 ° 37. 380 ’S- 63 ° 4. 735 ’W). We compared physicochemical parameters of water (pH, conductivity, ion concentration Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + y Cl-) measured in the lake in 2010 with bibliographic data of 1999, 2003 and 2004 and different morphometric variables of silverside otoliths captured in 1998 and in 2010. The ion concentration of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + y Cl- increased between 11 % and 90 % in the period 1999 - 2010; the lake reduced its surface 20 % in conjunction with a decrease in precipitations. We observed alterations in the distinctive morphological otolith pattern in about 18 % of the individuals sampled, like irregular <b>edges</b> and <b>perforations.</b> We found a smaller width-length relation of the otolith for the year 2010 thus, indicating a decrease in its circularity. These morphological variations could be provoked by alterations in calcium carbonate deposition related to an increase in salinity and conductivity due to reduction in the surface of the lake. In conclusion, this study would indicate that morphology and morphometry of otoliths reflect environmental stress. Fil: Avigliano, Esteban. Universidad de Buenos Aires.

40|$|Backscatter {{electron}} microscopy (BSE) {{is a powerful}} technique for investigating cancellous bone structure. Its main function is to offer information regarding the degree of mineralization of the tissue within individual trabeculae. To illustrate the qualitative {{information that can be}} drawn from BSE imaging technique, we present a study on human vertebral cancellous bone. This tissue is continuously remodeled through osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic new bone apposition. It is thought that osteoclastic resorption pits are especially deleterious for vertebral bone architecture since they often perforate the thin trabeculae; the osteoblasts being unable to repair the gap. In addition, excessive stress may also disrupt the architecture in case of trabecular fracture or damage accumulation. Waves of new bone formation were easy to identify in BSE. Often these waves were connecting both <b>edges</b> of a <b>perforation</b> and called bridges. Additionally, we present a few images of microcallus formations. A microcallus is described as a small mass of woven bone that generally repairs a trabecula. The microstructural aspects of different microcalluses are presented and discussed. Both bridges and microcallus should be considered as examples of the repair porcess since they obviously preserve the connectivity of the trabeculae. However, bridges were much more frequent than microcallus (396 vs 15). Both mechanisms probably illustrate the normal response to different local stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment of}} persistent eardrum perforation is conventional surgical closure using myringoplasty or a tympanoplasty type I. In this study the valence of a modified, CO 2 -laser-assisted de-epithelialization of perforation margins was investigated. Material and methods: A total of 44 patients with mesotympanal eardrum perforation (diameter 1 - 5 mm) {{were included in}} a partially retrospective and partially prospective study. The genesis of the eardrum perforations was partially traumatic or the eardrum did not heal after spontaneous perforation caused by an acute otitis media or after surgery. The procedure was performed under topical anaesthesia. Focussed, adjacent, single CO 2 laser pulses (1 watt, 0. 05 s) were applied with the laser otoscope Otoscan® (Lumenis, Yokneam, Israel) along the <b>edge</b> of the <b>perforation</b> until complete de-epithelialization. This was done to stimulate growth. Closure of eardrum perforation was monitored using an ear microscope and if this treatment was not successful after three attempts conventional surgical therapy was suggested. Results: Complete eardrum closure occurred in 27 cases (61 %), 17 patients (39 %) had a residual perforation, of which 9 experienced a significant reduction of the perforation. There were no complications {{during and after the}} treatment. Conclusion: A closure rate of at least 61 % (27 / 44) can be expected with a CO 2 -laser-assisted de-epithelialization of the perforation margins. This procedure can be performed under topical anaesthesia and is an economic, painless and facile alternative to conventional surgical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Evaluation {{of a new}} material, {{high-density}} porous polyethylene (HDPP), {{which is}} covered with fascia lata, for experimental nasal septal perforation closure. Methods. Twenty New Zealand albino rabbits were included and divided into study and control groups. A lateral incision was made from the lateral aspect of the left nares to the incisura nasomaxillaris. After exposure of the cavum nasi, the nasal mucoperichondrium was elevated bilaterally. A full-thickness 0. 5 × 0. 5 -cm perforation was created over the septum nasi with a No. 11 surgical blade. A fascia lata graft {{was used for the}} study group. The HDPP was covered with fascia lata and placed under the elevated mucosa. HDPP without a fascial covering was used in the control group. Four months after the procedure, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate resorption of the material. The animals were sacrificed, and the nasal septum was completely removed. Macroscopic and histopathological examinations were performed on the nasal septum. Results. All rabbits had survived after the 4 -month period. Macroscopically, nine of 10 (90 %) perforations were closed in the fascia lata-covered HDPP group. Histopathological examination of these nine rabbits revealed that the continuity of cartilage was disturbed in the perforation areas. Granulation tissue was inverted in areas in which the cartilage continuity was disturbed. The HDPP had remained intact at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>perforation.</b> In the HDPP group, six of 10 implants were still perforated (60 %) and four (40 %) were closed. The fascia lata-covered HDPP implant had...|$|R
