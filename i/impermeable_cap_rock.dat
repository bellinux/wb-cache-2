40|$|We show fine‐scale {{variations}} of seismic velocities and converted teleseismic waves that reveal {{the presence of}} zones of high‐pressure fluids released by progressive metamorphic dehydration reactions in the subducting Philippine Sea plate in Tokai district, Japan. These zones have a strong correlation with the distribution of slow earthquakes, including long-term slow slip (LTSS) and low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs). Overpressured fluids in the LTSS region appear to be trapped within the oceanic crust by an <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> in the fore-arc, and impede intraslab earthquakes therein. In contrast, fluid pressures are reduced in the LFE zone, which is deeper than the centroid of the LTSS, because there fluids are able to infiltrate into the narrow corner of the mantle wedge, leading to mantle serpentinization.

30|$|Kaneshima et al. (1996) {{interpret}} the VLPD inflation as a gradual increase in fluid pressure due to injection {{of heat and}} gas from magma at deeper levels. In this model, the LPP signals are the direct manifestation of this injection of magmatic materials into the hydrothermal system situated at shallow levels beneath the crater. Hence, both the VLPD and LPP seismicity record the increasing pressurization of the hydrothermal system as hot magmatic gases vaporize hydrothermal fluids, causing them to boil. At a critical overpressure exceeding the tensile strength of the <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> sealing {{the top of the}} hydrothermal system, the rocks fail and fluids discharge and erupt by opening a conduit to the surface crater, generating the SPT seismicity and allowing the hydrothermal reservoir to deflate. No large LPP signals are observed during deflation because the system is depressurizing.|$|R

Pronounced 2 ̆ 2 underpressuring 2 ̆ 2 (fluid pressures less than hydrostatic) occurs throughout the convection cell {{if and only if}} a tight, nearly <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> (chert) exists over the cell.

40|$|The Amulet Rhyolite {{formation}} {{is one of}} five rhyolitic formations that alternate with basalt-andesitc formations to form the central Noranda volcanic complex. Most of the economic, volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits in the Noranda area are interpreted to have formed after extrusion of the Amulet Rhyolite and during the onset of volcanism which produced the Amulet Andesitc. Detailed mapping and petrography reveal that the Amulet Rhyolite for-mation is composed predominantly of silicified andesitic flows. Some small, true rhyolitic domes occur throughout he formation. Silicified andesites (58 - 70 % SiO 2) were divided into two alteration facies; mottled (epidote-quartz altered) andesitc and silicified andesitc. Silici-fication was early, widespread, and contemporaneous with volcanism and resulted in increased Si and Ca contents and decreased Fe, Mg, Ti, A 1, and Zn contents in the flows. Mottled and silicified andesites are interpreted {{to be the result of}} water-rock interaction related to the circulation of seawater through originally highly permeable andesitic flows. Silicification even-tually sealed the upper part of the aquifer forming an <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock.</b> Postsilicification fluid discharge onto the sea floor through breaches in the cap rock produced massive sulfides accompanied by chloritic and sericitic alteration. The discharge was restricted to, and ema-nated from, synvolcanic features reflected in the alignment of the Amulet and Millenbach orebodies. Silicified andesites of the Amulet Rhyolite formation are products of extensive regional alteration that presents a larger exploration target for massive sulfide deposits than does proximal chloritic and sericitic alteration beneath orebodies...|$|E
30|$|Climate {{researchers}} {{have observed that}} the carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration in the atmosphere have been growing significantly over the past century. CO 2 from energy represents about 75 % of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Annex B (Developed) countries, and over 60 % of global emissions. Because of <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> hydrocarbon reservoirs are able to sequester CO 2. In addition, due to high-demand for oil worldwide, injection of CO 2 is a useful way to enhance oil production. Hence, applying an efficient method to co-optimize CO 2 storage and oil production is vital. Lack of suitable optimization techniques in the past led most multi-objective optimization problems to be tackled {{in the same way}} as a single objective optimization issue. However, there are some basic differences between the multi and single objective optimization methods. In this study, by using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for an oil reservoir, some appropriate scenarios are proposed based on simultaneous gas storage and enhanced oil recovery optimization. The advantages of this method allow us to amend production scenarios after implementing the optimization process, by regarding the variation of economic parameters such as oil price and CO 2 tax. This leads to reduced risks and time duration of making new decisions based on upcoming situations.|$|R
5000|$|The Ventura Anticline is a {{geologic}} structure {{that is part}} of the Ventura oil fields, the seventh largest oil field in California that was discovered in the 1860s. The anticline runs east to west for 16 miles, dipping steeply 30-60 degrees at both ends. Ventura County has a high rate of compression and seismic activity due to the converging San Andreas Fault. As a result, the Ventura anticline rises at a rate of 5 mm/year with the adjacent Ventura Basin converging at a rate of about 7-10 mm/year. [...] The anticline is composed of a series of sandstone rock beds and an <b>impermeable</b> <b>rock</b> <b>cap</b> under which vast reserves of oil and gas are trapped. Eight different oil bearing zones along the anticline vary greatly from 3,500 to 12,000 feet. The oil and gas formed these pools as they migrated upward during the Pliocene Era and became contained beneath the caprock. This oil field is still active and has a cumulative production of one billion barrels of oil making it one of the most vital historical and economic features of Ventura County.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} of a fault controlled geothermal reservoir has been developed. Heated lighter water, rising in the fault, is assumed to charge a reservoir which, in turn, is overlain by a thin <b>impermeable,</b> thermally conducting <b>cap</b> <b>rock.</b> The mass flow rate or the pressure associated with the charging process at the fault inlet is unknown and can only be estimated. Thus, in this paper, the pressure in the fault {{at the bottom of}} the reservoir is assumed to be prescribed. Quasi-analytic solutions for the velocity, pressure, and temperature are obtained in the fault-reservoir system for a high Rayleigh number flow. In this approximation, the upwelling fluid does not cool off appreciably until it reaches the cold upper boundary of the reservoir and encounters conductive heat loss. This thermal boundary layer, which is thin at the top of the fault, grows outward laterally and occupies the full thickness of the aquifer far away from the fault. The mathematical model is based on the flow of liquid water in a saturated porous medium. The solution techniques involve the combination of perturbation methods, boundary layer theory and numerical methods. The analysis of this generic model can be applied to liquid dominated geothermal systems where the thickness of the impermeable caprock is very small compared to the depth of the reservoir...|$|R

This study describes their petrographic characteristics {{in an attempt to}} determine the nature and temperature of mineralizing fluids in order to better understand the fluid migrations that led to massive stratabound fluorite deposition. The general paragenesis encompasses two major mineralizing events causing a succession of fluorite, barite, and quartz in all deposits. The two mineralizing events were preceded by two corrosion (dissolution or karstification) events affecting both the dolomite host rock at Pierre-Perthuis and Marigny-sur-Yonne and the limestone host rock at Courcelles-Frémoy with the creation of 1 – 10 m cavities and microscopic vugs. At Antully, the blocky calcite initially cementing the sandstone was partially dissolved. Microthermometric data on aqueous two-phase inclusions attest to CaCl 2 -rich fluids giving rise to fluorite deposition in the Pierre-Perthuis, Courcelles-Frémoy, and Antully deposits. Homogenization temperatures range from 80 to 100 °C at Pierre-Perthuis and Courcelles-Frémoy, with sporadically higher temperatures. The range of CaCl 2 contents is 6. 5 – 15 wt. % at Pierre-Perthuis, 1. 7 – 9. 4 wt. % at Courcelles-Frémoy, and 1. 6 – 16. 3 wt. % at Antully. The thermal history of the northwestern Morvan, compiled from organic matter, clay minerals and apatite fission track data indicates that the temperatures in fluorite and barite are higher than the maximum temperature recorded in sediments. This implies deep ascendant hydrothermal brine circulation during the Early Cretaceous.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) &#x 2013; the {{collection}} of carbon dioxide (CO~ 2 ~) from industrial sources and its injection underground &#x 2013; is an important technology to reduce CO~ 2 ~ emissions to the atmosphere, mitigating climate change. The North Sea, with mature hydrocarbon fields and saline aquifers offers an attractive storage location for CO~ 2 ~ produced by the UK&#x 2019;s gas and coal-fired power plants. The principal concern with CCS {{is to ensure that}} the CO~ 2 ~ does not leak into the oceans or atmosphere over hundreds or thousands of years. We propose a storage strategy where CO~ 2 ~ and brine are injected together followed by brine injection alone. We predict that using this technique around 95 % of the CO~ 2 ~ can be rendered immobile in pore-scale (10 s micron) droplets in the porous rock. Over thousands to billions of years the CO~ 2 ~ may dissolve or precipitate as carbonate, but it will not migrate upwards and so is effectively sequestered. This design is demonstrated through numerical simulation of field-scale flow through a North Sea aquifer coupled to an experimentally-based model of small-scale trapping. The CO~ 2 ~ is trapped during the decades-long lifetime of the injection phase, avoiding the need for extensive monitoring for centuries. The method does not rely on <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> to contain the CO~ 2 ~; this is only a secondary containment for the small amount of remaining mobile gas.

40|$|White, Muffler, and Truesdell (1971) and Truesdell and White (1973) {{developed}} a conceptual model of transport in vapor-dominated geothermal zones. The main {{theme of the}} model is that coexisting liquid and vapor phases form a counterflowing convection system similar to that observed in a heat pipe (Dunn and Reay, 1976). It is hypothesized that water evaporates from a deep water table, passes upward through the formation, and condenses at an <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock,</b> effectively transferring the latent heat of boiling through the formation. The liquid water then percolates downward, completing the cycle. The physics involved in the flow system is illustrated {{in an analysis of}} an idealized one-dimensional, homogeneous, 2 km deep vapor-dominated zone which is bounded below by a water table which has a temperature of 236 °C. Flow of water and steam in the system is assumed to be described by Darcy’s law for unsaturated porous materials. The liquid water potential, defined as the Gibbs free energy per unit volume of water, is used in place of the liquid pressure in the equation for water because flow in a highly unsaturated medium is to be considered. Comparison of figures 2 and 4 illustrates that the liquid saturation in a two-phase convection system can be much higher than that predicted from a static pressure analysis. As a result, the “vapor pressure lowering” effect expected in a static system disappears. The decrease in P{sub V} at the top of figure 4 is caused by temperature decrease; the relative vapor pressure in the dynamic system is above 99 %. However, the permeability used in this example is very low. At higher permeabilities the condensing steam drains out of the system much faster, and the saturation approaches the static profile. 5 refs., 4 figs...|$|E

40|$|The Salton Sea Geothermal Field is {{the largest}} water-dominated {{geothermal}} field in the Salton Trough in Southern California. Within the trough, local zones of extension among active right-stepping right-lateral strike-slip faults allow mantle-derived magmas to intrude the sedimentary sequence. The intrusions serves as heat sources to drive hydrothermal systems. We can characterize the field in detail because we have an extensive geological and geophysical data base. The sediments are relatively undeformed and {{can be divided into}} three categories as a function of depth: (1) low-permeability cap rock, (2) upper reservoir rocks consisting of sandstones, siltstones, and shales that were subject to minor alterations, and (3) lower reservoir rocks that were extensively altered. Because of the alteration, intergranular porosity and permeability are reduced with depth. permeability is enhanced by renewable fractures, i. e., fractures that can be reactivated by faulting or natural hydraulic fracturing subsequent to being sealed by mineral deposition. In the central portion of the field, temperature gradients are high near the surface and lower below 700 m. Surface gradients in this elliptically shaped region are fairly constant and define a thermal cap, which does not necessarily correspond to the lithologic cap. At the margin of the field, a narrow transition region, with a low near-surface gradient and an increasing gradient at greater depths, separates the high temperature resource from areas of normal regional gradient. Geophysical and geochemical evidence suggest that vertical convective motion in the reservoir beneath the thermal cap is confined to small units, and small-scale convection is superimposed on large-scale lateral flow of pore fluid. Interpretation of magnetic, resistivity, and gravity anomalies help to establish the relationship between the inferred heat source, the hydrothermal system, and the observed alteration patterns. A simple hydrothermal model is supported by interpreting the combined geological, geophysical, and thermal data. In the model, heat is transferred from an area of intrusion by lateral spreading of hot water in a reservoir beneath an <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock...</b>|$|E
40|$|We modifed a streamlined-based {{simulator}} {{based on}} the work of Batycky et al. (1997) [7] to solve CO 2 transport in aquifers and oil reservoirs. We then use this to propose design strategy for CO 2 injection to maximise storage in aquifers and to maximise both CO 2 storage and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in oil reservoirs. We first extended Batycky et al. (1997) [7]'s streamline simulator from two phases (aqueous phase and hydrocarbon phase) and two components (water and oil) to a three- phase (aqueous phase, hydrocarbon phase and solid phase) and four-component (water, oil, CO 2 and salt) simulator specialized for CO 2 injection. We solved CO 2 transport equations in the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases along streamlines and in the direction of gravity. To capture the physics of CO 2 transport, in the hydrocarbon phase, we used the Todd-Longsta® (1972) [112] model to represent sub-grid-block viscous fingering. We implemented a thermodynamic model of mutual dissolution between CO 2 and water and resulting salt precipitation [104; 105]. The resultant changes in porosity and permeability due to chemical reaction and salt precipitation were also considered. We accounted for two cycles of relative permeability hysteresis (primary and secondary drainage and imbibition) by applying two di®erent trapping models: Land (1968) [69] and Spiteri et al. (2005) [103]. Therefore, relative permeability changes and variations in the trapped non-wetting phase saturations due to hysteresis can be updated on a block-by-block basis. We then used this streamline-based simulator to design CO 2 storage in aquifers. We propose a carbon storage strategy where CO 2 and brine are injected into an aquifer together followed by brine injection alone. This renders 80 - 95 % of the CO 2 immobile in pore-scale (10 s ¹m) droplets within the porous rock; over thousands to billions of years the CO 2 may dissolve or precipitate as carbonate, but it will not migrate upwards and so is e®ectively sequestered. The CO 2 is trapped during the decades-long lifetime of the injection phase, reducing the need for extensive monitoring for centuries. The method does not rely on an <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> to contain the CO 2; this is only a secondary containment for the small amount of remaining mobile gas. Furthermore, the favorable mobility ratio between injected and displaced fluids leads to a more uniform sweep of the aquifer leading to a higher storage e±ciency than injecting CO 2 alone. This design was demonstrated through one-dimensional simulations that were verified through comparison with analytical solutions. We then performed simulations of CO 2 storage in a North Sea aquifer. We design injection to give optimal storage e±ciency and to minimise the amount of water injected; for the case we study, injecting CO 2 with a fractional flow between 85 and 100 % followed by a short period of chase brine injection to give the best performance. Sensitivity studies were conducted for different rock wettabilities and comparison with the Land trapping model. We found that the effectiveness of our proposed strategy is very sensitive to the estimated residual CO 2 -phase trapping. We then extended our study of the design of CO 2 storage in aquifers to oilfields. We again constructed analytical solutions to the transport equations accounting for relative permeability hysteresis. We used this to design an injection strategy where CO 2 and brine are injected simultaneously followed by chase brine injection. We studied field- scale oil production and CO 2 storage for di®erent CO 2 volumetric fractional flowrates. While injecting at the optimum WAG ratio gives the fastest oil recovery, this allows CO 2 to channel through the reservoir, leading to rapid CO 2 breakthrough and extensive recycling of the gas. We propose to inject more water than optimum. This causes the CO 2 to remain in the reservoir, increases the field life and leads to improved storage of CO 2 as a trapped phase. Again, a short period of chase brine injection at the end of the process traps most of the remaining CO 2. Finally, we investigated the e®ect of salt (halite) precipitation during dry, supercritical CO 2 injection using our modifed streamline-based simulator. In this study, pseudo one- dimensional and two-dimensional homogeneous and heterogeneous systems were used to study the sensitivity of di®erent parameters, which include relative permeability, grid size and brine salinity to salt precipitation. In our three-dimensional model, based on a geological model of a CO 2 injection site, we constructed a near wellbore fine grid model with almost 1. 5 million grid cells. Simulations were conducted successfully, and we found that salt precipitation can be a very important e®ect to consider when dry CO 2 is injected into a high salinity reservoir. In this reservoir, after only 2 years of CO 2 injection, about 20 % of permeability of the reservoir was reduced, which will seriously reduce the injectivity of the injector and fluid flow within the reservoir.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a revision and update of the geology of the Wairakei-Tauhara (WKTH) geothermal system. The research is focussed around {{the use of}} U-Pb dating of zircons in key stratigraphic units, coupled with presentation of a robust stratigraphic architecture to establish the timing of major volcanic and volcano-tectonic events, including those that help to constrain the broader scale evolution of the Whakamaru Caldera and Taupo-Reporoa Basin (TRB) and those that initiated or rejuvenated the geothermal system. The present day Wairakei-Tauhara geothermal system is much younger than previously estimated and is now proposed to be a 3 km depth (beyond the limits of drilled wells). At the Wairakei and Tauhara fields, these pyroclastics are intercalated with greywacke sediment, demonstrating that the area was within a long-lived basin westwards of the North Island axial ranges. At ~ 1. 8 Ma, the earliest dated volcanism at Wairakei began with eruption of andesitic lavas at the eastern margin of TVZ. These lavas were later buried by sediments and rhyolitic pyroclastics, including the locally named Stockyard ignimbrite that is correlated by its U-Pb zircon age spectrum with 1. 0 Ma Raepahu Formation ignimbrites erupted from the Mangakino Volcanic Centre. Magmatic activity in the following ~ 0. 3 - 0. 4 Ma is represented locally by only two WK-TH volcanic episodes (at 0. 95 Ma and 0. 73 Ma). Wairakei well stratigraphy also highlights a major hiatus in local volcanism and deposition until the ~ 0. 35 Ma Whakamaru eruptions. These and associated structural collapse were the events that may have initiated frequent volcanic and volcanotectonic episodes in the Wairakei-Tauhara area. Syn-eruptive piecemeal collapse of the caldera is inferred to have created the fault pathways for small batches of crystal-poor rhyolite, probably derived from a Whakamaru-like magma system, to intrude and erupt {{in much the same}} locations in the WK-TH area. This post-Whakamaru period (0. 31 Ma until 0. 22 Ma), overlaps with the age span of the majority of surficial rhyolitic volcanism in the Maroa Volcanic Centre, north and northwest of the WK-TH area. The Taupo-Reporoa Basin evolved in major volcano-tectonic episodes beginning around 0. 35 Ma. In the south, displacement of Whakamaru Group ignimbrite across an elongate, central graben-like structure between the Wairakei and Tauhara fields is explained by 0. 9 - 1. 7 km subsidence of large NE-SW trending fault blocks, during piecemeal collapse of the Whakamaru Caldera. Further local collapse is proposed, which was nearly contemporaneous with 0. 31 Ma eruptions that formed a ~ 10 x 12 km block faulted, newly recognised Waiora caldera and generated > 30 km³ of Waiora Formation ignimbrites that syn-eruptively filled the new caldera. Rhyolite lava eruptions also starting at ~ 0. 31 Ma on the eastern margin of the Tauhara Field and in the Wairakei Field, were the first of many spatially overlapping lavas and intercalated local pyroclastic units collectively mapped as the Waiora Formation. U-Pb and U-Th dating of zircons, zircon growth textures revealed by cathodoluminescence, and whole rock REE geochemistry are integrated with petrography to outline overlapping compositions of the lavas, several of which are also analytically indistinguishable in age. Correlations between Waiora Formation rhyolitic lavas and ignimbrites are equivocal with the available data, but the geochemistry suggests that early Waiora Formation ignimbrites may have been derived from a Whakamaru-like magma source that was distinct from contemporaneous Maroa rhyolite lavas. Infilling and subsidence of the Waiora caldera continued at varied rates until ~ 0. 22 Ma. After 0. 22 Ma there was a hiatus in volcanism in the local WK-TH area, during which lacustrine sediments accumulated in the local part of Lake Huka at ~ 1 mm/y. These fine grained Huka Falls Formation deposits became the <b>impermeable</b> <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> of the modern WK-TH geothermal system. Volcanism did not wholly cease in the local area, or elsewhere in the TRB, however. There were shallow intrusions and subaerial dome extrusions of rhyolite at ~ 0. 14 - 0. 12 Ma, and at ~ 0. 1 Ma there was the subaqueous eruption of middle Huka Falls Formation rhyolite. The new U-Pb ages reflect magma systems active in the local area at least at 1. 8 Ma, 0. 95 Ma, and 0. 73 Ma, but {{there is no evidence of}} any associated geothermal system during one of these episodes. The Whakamaru eruptions and collapse episodes may have initiated the first geothermal system in the WK-TH area. The overlapping ages of Waiora Formation rhyolites, and spatial clustering beneath the Wairakei Field, show that underlying magmatism might have supported a geothermal system in more or less the same location at numerous times during the past ~ 0. 3 Ma. Previously, the geothermal system was inferred to have been active since ~ 0. 5 Ma, but in its modern state, the system is now interpreted to have begun at ~ 60 ka and has been sustained since then by the presence of an underlying NE dome magma system...|$|E

On the contrary, the contrast of thermal conductivity is located at the interface between the sediments and the granitic basement. The whole sedimentary cover associated with a lower thermal conductivity than in the basement contributes to a thermal blanketing of the insulating sediments. The effect has been already identified as a key factor to explain the higher geothermal gradient at depth than the average European one (Freymark et al. 2017; Scheck-Wenderoth et al. 2014). The discrepancy in terms of depths between the permeability and thermal conductivity contrast highlights a decoupling of the cap rocks: the whole sedimentary cover corresponds to the thermal <b>cap</b> <b>rock,</b> whereas only the upper sediments behave as a hydraulic <b>cap</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|R
30|$|An {{impermeable}} {{rock that}} acts as a barrier to further migration of hydrocarbon liquids is referred as Seal (<b>cap</b> <b>rock).</b> Rocks that form a barrier or cap above and around reservoir rock forming a trap such that fluids cannot migrate beyond the reservoir. The permeability of a seal capable of retaining fluids through geologic time is ~ 10 − 6 to 10 − 8 darcies. Commonly known <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> are shale, mudstone, anhydrite, salt.|$|R
30|$|In <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> research, {{most studies}} have {{concentrated}} on lithologic characterization, static sealing performance and mechanisms, or thickness and spatial distribution. Little has been published on dynamic <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> evolution. Assessments of the sealing ability of the cover layer during the buried stage mainly correlate the porosity with the breakthrough pressure, only considering the effect of compaction on porosity. To consider only the rupture of rock caused by the change of formation, pressure in the uplift stage does not enable an accurate assessment of the sealing ability. For mechanistic studies on the microscopic sealing of different lithology covers, previous work has been conducted mostly on mudstone, with little attention to gypsum and dense carbonate rocks. For practical applications, more studies are required to investigate the relationships between different cover layers (regional <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> and direct <b>cap</b> <b>rocks)</b> {{and the distribution of}} oil and gas (Jin 2014).|$|R
40|$|AbstractProduction of {{hydrocarbons}} from geological reservoirs, and {{injection of}} fluids {{such as water}} or CO 2 into geological strata are accompanied with stress changes in the reservoir and in the <b>cap</b> <b>rock.</b> If the stress changes are large enough, they may reactivate faults or pre-existing natural fractures, or induce new fractures in the reservoir and/or the <b>cap</b> <b>rock.</b> Fractures in the <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> caused by stress changes during CO 2 injection may threaten the <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> integrity. Fractures within the reservoir may increase its injectivity, improve hydraulic communication and thereby facilitate spreading of the injected fluid. The objective of this work was to classify possible stress dynamics and fracturing scenarios that may take place under geological storage of CO 2. A compendium of stress regimes and expected fracture patterns is compiled {{that can be used}} as a quick guide when evaluating the risk of fracturing under CO 2 injection into deep saline aquifers or depleted fields as well as when estimating geomechanical effects of reservoir stimulation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluid dynamic {{potentials}} {{are critical}} to the entrapment, distribution, phase, leakage and migration of hydrocarbons. The classification system combines two <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> proper t ies (static and dynamic) wi th five seal and leakage modes (capillary seal, pressure seal, hydraulic resistance seal, water drive leakage and hydraulic fracturing leakage) and two hydrocarbon migration mechanisms {{into and out of}} a trap (fill/spill and fill/leak). Static <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> such as thick shales, usually seal more than the vertical closure of the trap, {{as a consequence of the}} critical po re throat capillary pressure (capillary seal). In two-phase hydrocarbon systems fill/spill tends to concent ra te gas. Hydraulic fracturing is usually required to generate significant leakage through static <b>cap</b> <b>rocks.</b> Then fill/leak tends to concentra te oil. Dynamic <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> such as inhomogeneous sand/shale sequences and faults have less sealing capacity than the static <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> but are more widespread. They are strongly affected by variations in the fluid dynamic propert ies and are less dependen t on capillary pressure. Water potentials are often critical, for seal (pressure seal) or for leakage and redistribution (water drive leakage). Hydraulic resistance seal is important for trapping of oil and crucial for concentrat ion of oil relative to gas (fill/leak) ...|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the absence}} of {{regional}} <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Lower Paleozoic for the entire Tazhong Low Rise, several sets of effective local <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> are well preserved on the Northern Slope. Of these the best is the Ordovician mudstone of the Sangtamu Formation; {{the second is the}} Silurian Red Mudstone Member of the Tatairtag Formation and the marl of the Ordovician Lianglitag Formation; and the third is the gray mudstone of the Silurian Kepingtag Formation. The dense limestone of the Ordovician Yingshan Formation and the gypsum of the Middle Cambrian have shown initial sealing capacity. These effective <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> are closely related to the distribution of Lower Palaeozoic hydrocarbons in the Tazhong Low Rise. With well-preserved Sangtamu Formation mudstone and its location close to migration pathways, rich Lower Paleozoic hydrocarbon accumulation {{can be found on the}} Northern Slope. Vertically, most of the reserves are distributed below the Sangtamu Formation mudstone; areally, hydrocarbons are mainly found in the areas with well-developed Sangtamu Formation mudstone and Lianglitag Formation marl. Burial history and hydrocarbon charging history show that the evolution of Lower Palaeozoic <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> controlled the accumulation of hydrocarbon in the Tazhong Low Rise. Take the Red Mudstone Member of the Tatairtag Formation and Sangtamu Formation mudstone for examples: 1) In the hydrocarbon charging time of the Late Caledonian — Early Hercynian, with top surfaces at burial depths of over 1, 100 m, the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> were able to seal oil and gas; 2) During the intense uplifting of the Devonian, the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> with top surfaces at burial depths of 200 – 800 m and 500 – 1, 100 m respectively were denuded in local areas, thus hydrocarbons trapped in earlier time were degraded to widespread bitumen; 3) In the hydrocarbon charging time of the Late Hercynian and Himalayan, the top surfaces of the <b>cap</b> <b>rocks</b> were at burial depths of over 2, 000 m without intense uplifting and denudation thereafter, so trapped hydrocarbons were preserved. Based on <b>cap</b> <b>rocks,</b> the Ordovician Penglaiba Formation and Lower Cambrian dolomite could be potential targets for exploration on the Tazhong Northern Slope, and combined with hydrocarbon migration, less risk would be involved.|$|R

30|$|The greater {{heat flow}} in rift-related {{sedimentary}} basins enhances rapid {{transformation of the}} organic matter, and the high seismic activity enables the migration of newly formed liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.

To {{ensure that the}} CO 2 is trapped securely and will not escape to the surface, storage in such formations must be designed carefully. The geochemical reactions involved depend on {{the composition of the}} injected fluid introduced in the aquifer and the composition of the initial minerals assemblage and the aquifer brine. This thesis studies mineral dissolution/precipitation during CO 2 storage, both in the <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> and the storage aquifer itself. The overall objective is to propose an ideal storage design for long term, inexpensive and safe CO 2 disposal in saline aquifers. The rate-limiting effects of CH 4 impurities in gas streams on the CO 2 reactivity in the <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> and aquifer (carbonate and sandstone) at conditions representative of storage locations are studied. Representative geochemical data of formation water and mineralogy assemblages of <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> (Nordland shale) overlying the Sleipner field, Dogger carbonate aquifer from Paris basin, France and Frio sandstone aquifer from Texas, US, are used.

40|$|<b>Cap</b> <b>rock</b> {{integrity}} {{is an essential}} characteristic of any re-servoir {{to be used for}} long-term CO 2 storage. Seismic AVOA (amplitude variation with offset and azimuth) tech-niques have been applied to map HTI anisotropy near the <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> of the Weyburn field in southeast Saskatchewan, Canada, with the purpose of identifying potential fracture zones that may compromise seal integrity. This analysis, supported by modeling, observes the top of the regional seal (Watrous Formation) to have low levels of HTI anisotropy, whereas the reservoir <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> (composite Midale Evaporite and Ratcliffe Beds) contains isolated areas of high intensity anisotropy, which may be fracture-related. Properties of the fracture fill and hydraulic conductivity within the inferred fracture zones are not constrained using this technique. The predominant orientations of the observed anisotropy are parallel and normal to the direction of maximum hori-zontal stress (northeast–southwest) and agree closely with previous fracture studies on core samples from the reservoir. Anisotropy anomalies are observed to correlate spatially with salt dissolution structures in the <b>cap</b> <b>rock</b> and overlying horizons as interpreted from 3 D seismic cross sections...|$|R
