5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably African sleeping sickness, smallpox, swine influenza and amoebic dysentery, ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that half-a-million Congolese <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while excess deaths rose.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November 2011, British citizen Neil Heywood {{was found}} dead in his Chongqing hotel room. At the time, local {{authorities}} declared he <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> alcohol over-consumption, though his family noted that he was not a heavy drinker. The official cause of death was not scrutinized until several months later, when revelations emerged that Heywood's death was a homicide, and Bo Xilai was implicated.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 1952, despite {{advice from}} {{those close to}} him, the King went to London Airport to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via Kenya.

The U.S. Coast Guard found the boat, Kaught Looking, at about 3:00a.m., overturned on a jetty near Government Cut and South Pointe Park, and found Fernandez and two other men, Eduardo Rivero and Emilio Jesus Macias, dead. A Florida Wildlife Commission official initially confirmed that Fernández <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> the impact of the crash. The commission received a toxicology report from the medical examiner of Miami-Dade County, but opted not to release the results.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} day one {{prisoner}} pleaded guilty to charges of riot and conspiracy to riot, and was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other defendants were also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness testimony {{and the possibility that}} White <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> a pre-existing thrombotic condition. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of rioting, and the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The King {{was buried}} in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 15 July. His only {{legitimate}} child, Princess Charlotte of Wales, <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> post-partum complications in 1817, after delivering a stillborn son. The second son of George III, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, had died childless in 1827, so the succession passed to the third son of George III, Prince William, Duke of Clarence, who reigned as William IV.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E

5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two {{witnesses}} were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> being hit {{on the head with}} a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
5|$|After Delfina {{moved through}} Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter {{provided}} shelter, water, and relief items to the affected residents. Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, caused a cholera outbreak that affected at least 400people. By January27, 12people <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> the disease. Flooding also caused a malaria outbreak that killed 45people in the country. Government officials deployed {{food to the}} affected areas by airplane and by road, after workers repaired damaged bridges. Residents in Mozambique gradually recovered from storm damage {{in the weeks after}} it struck. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas.|$|E
5|$|After the 23 July {{show at the}} Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham {{and members}} of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of {{promoter}} Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance. The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.|$|E

5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> internal bleeding caused by blunt force {{trauma to the}} abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} local science museum has a display of meteorites, the Fringe team is able to secure Dr. Crick (Alan Ruck), {{the man behind the}} osmium injections, and another {{paraplegic}} who has taken Dr. Crick's injections as they attempt to steal the display. With Dr. Crick in custody, Walter learns that the man had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft. He happened upon the combination of the osmium-lutetium alloy that generated a material lighter than air, and sought to refine a permanent solution to give his own paraplegic son the ability to walk, having promised the same to those that <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> earlier, lethal doses of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|The 1924–25 season, {{the first}} year of NHL {{expansion}} to the United States, saw major changes in Ottawa's lineup. Jack Darragh retired and <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> appendicitis months after his final game. Making his debut in goal for Ottawa was Alex Connell, replacing Benedict. Replacing Broadbent was Hooley Smith, who had played for Canada in the 1924 Olympics. Lionel Hitchman was sold to the expansion Boston Bruins and replaced by Ed Gorman. It was also the debut season of Frank Finnigan. Off the ice, Gorman and Ahearn squabbled over ownership. In January 1925, during the season, Gorman sold his share of the Senators to Ahearn and left the Senators organization, later joining the expansion New York Americans.|$|E

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. Still, they had to fly over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
5|$|There are {{hundreds}} of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 79 hospitals and clinics with 23,967 beds. The hospitals and clinics care for more than 700thousand patients per year and employ 5,205 medical doctors, including 3,929 specialists. There are 6,379 private practice offices, {{and a total of}} 41,271health workers in the country. There are 63 emergency medical service units, responding to more than a million calls. The principal cause of death in 2008 was cardiovascular disease at 43.5% for men and 57.2% for women, followed by tumours, at 29.4% for men and 21.4% for women. In 2009 only 13 Croatians had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 6 <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> the disease. In 2008 it was estimated by the WHO that 27.4% of Croatians over age of 15 are smokers. According to 2003 WHO data, 22% of the Croatian adult population is obese.|$|E
5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>from</b> suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
