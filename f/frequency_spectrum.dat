John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the <b>frequency</b> <b>spectrum,</b> there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E
