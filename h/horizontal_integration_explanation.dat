40|$|This paper applies {{theories}} of industrial organisation explaining the motives for vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> to {{shed some light}} on the relationship between home and foreign production of multinational firms (MNEs). It is argued that once the preconditions for the existence of MNEs are taken into account, namely the motives for integration of firm across country borders, both in the vertical <b>integration</b> and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> case a complementary relationship is plausible. Especially, for horizontally integrated MNEs with multiplant economies of scale generated by inputs with public good characteristics it is demonstrated that home and foreign production are complements if multiplant economies of scale and/or marginal transportation costs are sufficiently large. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> model is also analyzed in an oligopolistic setting and similar results are obtained. ...|$|R

50|$|Some {{benefits}} of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> strategy {{is that it is}} good for fast changing work environments as well as providing a broad knowledge base for the business and employees. High levels of <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> leads to high levels of communication within the business. Another benefit of using this strategy is that it leads to a larger market for merged businesses, and it is easier to build good reputations for a business when using this strategy. A disadvantage of using the <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> strategy is that this limits and restricts the field of interest that the business is expanding the new products into. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> can affect a business's reputation, especially after a merge has happened between two or more businesses. There are three main benefits to a business's reputation after a merge. A larger business helps the reputation and increases the severity of the punishment. As well as the merge of information after a merge has happened, this increases the knowledge of the business and marketing area they are focused on. The last benefit is more opportunities for deviation to occur in merged businesses rather than independent businesses.|$|R

The focus to <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> in designing/redesigning business programmes may serve the following objectives: offering more value added courses to students; making the course offerings relevant to industry needs; logical integration of various courses within degree programs; improving job prospects for students.

40|$|Practice-based {{commissioning}} (PBC) in the UK {{is intended}} to improve both the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> of health care, {{in order to avoid}} escalating costs and enhance population health. Vertical integration involves patient pathways to treat named medical conditions that transcend organisational boundaries and connect communitybased generalists with largely hospital-sited specialists, whereas <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> involves peerbased and cross-sectoral collaboration to improve overall health. Effective mechanisms are now needed to permit ongoing dialogue between the vertical and horizontal dimensions to ensure that medical and nonmedical care are both used to their best advantage. This paper proposes three different models for combining vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> – each is a hybrid of internationally recognised ideal types of primary care organisation. Leaders of PBC should consider a range of models and apply them in ways that are relevant to the local context.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{consider}} multiproduct supply chains of distinct firms and their <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration.</b> In particular, we develop multiproduct supply chain network models {{prior to and}} post their <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> with explicit capacities associated with the eco-nomic activities of production, storage, and distribution. In addition, we propose a measure, which allows one to quantify and assess, from a supply chain network perspective, the synergy benefits associated with the integration of multiproduct firms through mergers/acquisitions. We utilize a system-optimization perspective for the model development and provide the variational inequality formulations, which are then utilized to propose a computational pro-cedure which fully exploits the underlying network structure. We illustrate the theoretical and computational framework with numerical examples. This paper is {{a contribution to the}} literatures of supply chain integration and mergers and acquisitions.

But it allows the merged firm to deviate only in a subset of markets, which hinders reputation building by making it more difficult for consumers to monitor its quality. We show that these effects give rise to a reputation-based theory of the optimal firm size and derive its comparative statics. Copyright (c) 2009, RAND. ...|$|R

50|$|Supplier-Base {{strategy}} {{is the main}} factor that determines component-level target costing because it is known to {{play a key role}} in the details a firm has about its supplier capabilities. There are three characteristics that make up the supplier-base strategy, including the degree of <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration,</b> power over suppliers and nature of supplier relations. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> captures the fraction of product costs sourced externally. Cost pressures on suppliers can drive target costing if the buying power of firms is high enough. In turn, this may lead to better benefits. More cooperative supplier relations have been shown to increase mutual benefits in terms of target costs particularly at a component level.|$|R
40|$|Many {{academic}} innovations {{over the}} last 20 years demonstrate how occupational science has matured as a discipline (Pierce, 2012). However, the paucity of scholarship {{of teaching and learning}} in occupational science highlights a continued need for disciplinary growth. Specifically, little scholarship documents the integration of occupational science content across courses in academic programs (Wood et al., 2000). Course integration has been successfully used in other content areas and academic disciplines, and general evidence supports course integration as a means of improving curricular design and student learning (Vidic 2 ̆ 6 Wietlauf, 2002). One particular course integration strategy—horizontal integration—involves fusing content across courses in a specific academic term. Integrating content via such strategies helps achieve the following four educational objectives, according to Case (1991) : (a) helping students deal with the world’s complexity; (b) overcoming students’ rigid perceptions of subject boundaries; (c) helping students respect and view knowledge as seamless; and (d) promoting efficiency in thinking and learning. Such educational objectives appear particularly relevant for occupational science education given the discipline’s interdisciplinary and complex nature. This paper presents the <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> of Saint Louis University’s fall undergraduate occupational science courses. In their junior year, students in the Bachelors of Science in Occupational Science (BSOS) program take three occupational science courses per semester. These two semesters were designed in 2004 to impart basic terms and concepts, theoretical perspectives, and topics in occupational science. The fall semester courses in particular were initially conceptualized as covering distinct yet related aspects of the Person-Environment-Occupation model (Law et al., 1996), but the purpose and content of these courses shifted as occupational science developed. In light of the need {{to keep pace with the}} discipline’s advances, the authors used <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> to restructure the fall semester occupational science courses in 2012. This paper compares and contrasts the presentation of occupation and related concepts in Saint Louis University’s fall occupational science courses pre-, post-, and one year following <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration.</b> Course descriptions, schedules, and assignments provide evidence of changes made consequent to <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration.</b> Faculty and student perspectives, which were gathered at multiple points before and after the integration, help frame the pros and cons of this educational strategy. Reflections on this <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> process underscore the need for effective faculty collaboration to integrate content. Reflections also ground suggestions for future <b>horizontal</b> <b>integration</b> efforts. In addition, this paper identifies implications for occupational science education and the discipline’s development as a whole...|$|R
