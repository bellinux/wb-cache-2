Whatever clothes you want you had better <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> where you will get the proper things for your money." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{at great}} pains to give my philosophical, political, and social matter the best {{literary}} and critical backing we could <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> I hunted sedulously for good descriptive writing and good criticism; I was indefatigable in my readiness to hear and consider, if not to accept advice; I watched {{every corner of the}} paper, and had a dozen men alert to get me special matter of the sort that draws in the unattached reader. The chief danger on the literary side of a weekly is that it should {{fall into the hands of}} some particular school, and this I watched for closely. It seems impossible to get vividness of apprehension and breadth of view together in the same critic. So it falls to the wise editor to secure the first and impose the second. Directly I detected the shrill partisan note in our criticism, the attempt to puff a poor thing because it was [...] "in the right direction," [...] or damn a vigorous piece of work because it wasn't, I tackled the man and had it out with him. Our pay was good enough for that to matter a good deal....|$|E
5000|$|London Eating, a {{restaurant}} review website {{says of the}} Obalende Suya, [...] "the suya is {{the best you can}} <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> authentic, very fresh, made right in front of you. The downside is that {{it takes a long time}} before you get your order and the asaro sells out in no time at all". The motto of its takeaway is, [...] "We don't sell fast food, we sell good food fast!".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Frank said, [...] "I'm just up {{from the}} country. I {{thought it would be}} easy to <b>get</b> a place <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> but I don't find it so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so {{glad you}} do," [...] the countess answered, heartily. [...] "I don't care {{for a life of}} perfect frivolity and fashion, such as one <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> If it were not for Gladys's sake I {{sometimes}} think I would give it up entirely. Do you know, I often wish my life had been cast very differently--cast among another set of people from the people I have always mixed among. Whenever I meet clever people--literary people and scholars--I always feel so sorry I haven't moved all my life in their world. From one point of view, I quite recognize what you said just now, that these artificial distinctions should not exist between people who are really equals in intellect and culture." ...|$|R
50|$|Upon <b>getting</b> her PHD <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> <b>in</b> 2009, Stella Nyanzi {{managed to}} secure {{a job at the}} Makerere University as a Researcher at the Law, Gender & Sexuality Research Project, Faculty of Law, Makerere University where she worked until December 2013.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's hard to <b>get</b> {{good work}} <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> ma'am. There {{are so many}} in London--they take the bread out of each other's mouths. If we had only {{had the money to}} emigrate, he would have married me long since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not particularly," [...] said Sir Henry. [...] "Of course one can't <b>get</b> a house <b>in</b> <b>London</b> for nothing. I {{shall have}} rather a bargain of that if I can pay the money down. The great thing {{is whether you}} like it." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} they had been back {{for more than a}} month, that the {{engagement}} between Bertha and Major Mallett was announced by Lady Greendale to her friends, and it was generally supposed that it had but just taken place. The announcement gave great satisfaction, for the general opinion had been that Bertha would <b>get</b> engaged <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> and that Greendale would be virtually lost to the county.|$|R
6000|$|... 'For goodness' sake!' cried Alda, 'he doesn't want to <b>get</b> {{taken on}} <b>in</b> <b>London!</b> To have him singing and {{fiddling}} in public {{would be worse}} than anything. You put that out of his head, I hope, John. Even if he changed his name--' ...|$|R
50|$|Under {{their new}} identity, {{they were more}} {{successful}} <b>getting</b> attention <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> They moved {{to the city and}} secured live work. They rapidly got management with Jonathan Shalit and later a record deal with Sony Music UK for two singles and an album. The pair worked on recording material and continued to perform live, including opening for D12, and appearing on MTV. Their Scottish identity was known only to a small circle.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must flit, {{and again}} seek some other home. Though he should keep our secret,--and I {{believe he will}} if he be asked,--it will be known {{that there is a}} secret, and a secret of such a nature that its {{circumstances}} have driven us hence. If I could <b>get</b> literary work <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> perhaps we might live there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a pity," [...] said Kate, [...] "that {{you could}} not bring the books here, and then I could help you, for {{although}} I do not pretend to be deeply learned in scriptural knowledge, I daresay I know enough for your purpose; but why not <b>get</b> the books <b>in</b> <b>London?</b> Is there any necessity for buying them in Yarmouth?" ...|$|R
50|$|Webb's {{first major}} work was the {{restoration}} of the medieval St Bartholomew-the-Great <b>in</b> Smithfield, <b>London.</b> His brother Edward Alfred Webb was the churchwarden at the time, and his association with the church probably helped the young architect <b>get</b> the job. <b>In</b> <b>London,</b> Webb's best known works include the Queen Victoria Memorial and The Mall approach to, and the principal facade of, Buckingham Palace, which he re-designed in 1913.|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor was}} hours gone away. I {{began to feel}} unspeakably forlorn and helpless, so much so as even to wish selfishly that Robert might really have sailed from America, and might <b>get</b> to <b>London</b> <b>in</b> time to assist and console me.|$|R
50|$|Paul and Nick {{were flown}} back to England at Granada's expense for {{the filming of}} 35 Up and 42 Up respectively. Paul was flown back again for 49 Up and visited Symon. Bruce was {{affected}} by Neil's plight and offered him temporary shelter in his home shortly before 42 Up, allowing Neil time to <b>get</b> settled <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> Despite Neil's eccentricities during his two-month stay, they clearly remained friends, with Neil later giving a reading at Bruce's wedding. In 56 Up, Suzy and Nick are interviewed together, having become friends due to their shared rural upbringing.|$|R

50|$|The film {{opens with}} a man (Tom Fisher) sitting eating breakfast with his family. He drives away from his house to Birmingham New Street, where he boards a train; he <b>gets</b> off <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> He has {{probably}} been walking around all day, because it is nighttime when we see him finding a spot outside a shop and laying down to sleep. When he wakes up the next day, {{he goes to the}} park, where he throws his smart phone into a lake, opens his wallet, destroys his bank cards and throws them in the bin (along with his wallet with a family photo, but then he returns to retrieve it) and puts the money in his back pocket.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{reviews for}} Burning Blue were {{predominantly}} positive, but many American critics {{took a more}} contrary view as later staging did not reflect the changing acceptance of homosexual relationships. Don Shewey in The Advocate wrote, [...] "DMW Greer’s play Burning Blue takes a Reefer Madness approach to homosexuality. Ostensibly a fictional condemnation of the U.S. military’s hypocritical [...] "don’t ask, don’t tell" [...] approach to gay servicemen, this far-fetched melodrama presents homosexuality {{as a kind of}} science-fiction virus transmitted by the heady combination of red lights and disco music." [...] He wondered, [...] "And how on earth has such a nonsensical sub-soap-opera script <b>gotten</b> productions <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York?" ...|$|R
50|$|Phase 1 {{involves}} {{building a}} platform on the Cotswold Line, a station building, interchange facilities, a 300 space car park, road access and infrastructure for phase 2 construction.

60|$|The {{dress of}} their sister for to-day was exactly {{that of a}} respectable workman's {{relative}} who had no particular ambition {{in the matter of}} fashion--a black stuff gown, a plain bonnet to match. A veil she wore for obvious reasons: her face was <b>getting</b> well known <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> and it had already appeared at the private view in an uncovered state, when it was scrutinized more than the paintings around. But now homely and useful labour was her purpose.|$|R

60|$|It {{was nearly}} {{the end of}} October when Miss Mackenzie left the Cedars {{and at that time}} of the year there is not much {{difficulty}} <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> lodgings <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> The house which her brother Walter occupied in Arundel Street had, at his death, remained {{in the hands of an}} old servant of his, who had bought her late master's furniture with her savings, and had continued to live there, letting out the house in lodgings. Her former mistress had gone to see her once or twice during the past year, and it had been understood between them, that if Miss Mackenzie ever wanted a room for a night or two <b>in</b> <b>London,</b> she could be accommodated at the old house. She would have preferred to write to Hannah Protheroe,--or Mrs Protheroe, as she was now called by brevet rank since she had held a house of her own,--had time permitted her to do so. But time and the circumstances did not permit this, and therefore she had herself driven to Arundel Street without any notice.|$|R
50|$|Nearly {{incapacitated}} by guilt, Dirk resolves to {{take his}} now-late client's wild claims seriously. During his investigation, Gently encounters exploding airport check-in counters, the gods of Norse mythology, insulting horoscopes, a sinister nursing home, a rhino-phagic eagle, an I Ching calculator (to which everything calculated above the value of 4 is apparently 'a suffusion of yellow'), a god who gives his powers to a lawyer and an advertising executive in exchange for clean linen, and an attractive American woman who gets angry when she can't <b>get</b> pizza delivered <b>in</b> <b>London.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Brazilian-born Inacio Ribeiro and British-born Suzanne Clements met {{on their}} first day at Central Saint Martins, London where they had {{enrolled}} on the MA in fashion led by Wendy Dagworthy. Graduating in 1991 with Firsts and marrying a year later, they established their eponymous brand in 1993. In a joint interview with The Independent in 2010, Ribeiro said: [...] "The creation of Clements Ribeiro was a real accident. When we graduated, {{it was impossible to}} <b>get</b> a job <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> We went to Milan and hated it, so doing our own thing made sense".|$|R
40|$|Thanks Smith for {{revising}} {{his paper}} on 'Bertolonia'.

5000|$|James Sherley was the Treasurer of the Plymouth Adventurers <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> This was a {{consortium}} of investors who financed the Plymouth Colony. The colonists had been shipping goods and products back to London to repay their loans, but the Plymouth Colony partners in America {{felt that they had}} not been getting adequate accounting for the sale of their goods in England; in short, they felt they were being cheated by their London partners. After [...] "diverse days" [...] spent on this matter, John Atwood was finally able to <b>get</b> the partners <b>in</b> <b>London</b> and Plymouth to agree to a compromise. It took two years, however, before the situation was finally resolved in 1642.|$|R

Alejandro spots Rachel while he performs with his bandmates. After Rachel becomes intoxicated and suddenly left the party, Alejandro finds her attempting to sleep in a bus stop. He helps her up and calls a taxi to bring her into Alejandro's home to rest.|$|R
50|$|Her career {{commenced}} as a cabaret artiste {{in restaurants}} and supper clubs in San Francisco. In 1945 {{she appeared in}} her own radio program. While she was appearing <b>in</b> Annie <b>Get</b> Your Gun <b>in</b> <b>London</b> (1947 - 1950), she studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1948. As a fundraiser to help rebuild the RADA theatre, she appeared as Nell Gwynne in In Good King Charles's Golden Days at Drury Lane Theatre (Oct 1948). She appeared at the <b>London</b> Palladium <b>in</b> 1958 while doing a concert tour of Europe and in cabaret at The Talk of the Town in February 1963.|$|R
60|$|And it was {{all about}} tea, a word which, since '67, had been {{steadily}} becoming the most vexed in the language. The East India Company had put forth a complaint. They had Heaven knows how many tons <b>getting</b> stale <b>in</b> <b>London</b> warehouses, all by reason of our stubbornness, and so it was enacted that all tea paying the small American tax should have a rebate of the English duties. That was truly a master-stroke, for Parliament to give it us cheaper than it could be had at home! To cause his Majesty's government to lose revenues for the sake of being able to say they had caught and taxed us at last! The happy result is now history, my dears. And this is not a history, tho' I wish it were. What occurred at Boston, at Philadelphia, and Charleston, has since caused Englishmen, as well as Americans, to feel proud. The chief incident in Annapolis I shall mention in another chapter.|$|R

He only knows her as a family friend. Lord Desham, who is {{attracted}} to Jody, uses his influence to arrange for the young man to marry his WREN fiancée without the customary delay. After some broad hints from Desham, Lieutenant Pierson finally realizes why Jody has been so helpful and asks his mother (by that title) for a dance.|$|R
60|$|Already {{preparations}} {{had been}} made {{for the sale of}} the furniture, which was to take place next day. Everything was to be sold except the scientific books which had belonged to his father. These had been packed in a great box until the time when he might place them in a library of his own, and the doctor kindly offered to keep it for him until such time should arrive. Frank wrote a long letter to Ruthven, telling him of his loss, and his reasons for leaving Deal, and promising to write some day and tell him how he was <b>getting</b> on <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> This letter he did not intend to post until the last thing before leaving Deal. Lucy had already gone to her new home, and Frank felt confident that she would be happy there. His friend, the doctor, who had tried strongly, but without avail, to dissuade Frank from going up to London to seek his fortune there, had promised that if the lad referred any inquiries to him he would answer for his character.|$|R
5000|$|War {{called him}} once more, when he {{enlisted in the}} force {{assembled}} by his relation, Captain John Meade of the Grenadier Guards, that left on 7 September 1746 for the abortive Raid on Lorient. Returning to London, next year he took his mother back to Dublin, where he acted and sang in Dublin shows, some written in part by Laetitia. [...] After her death in 1750, he was warned by the Irish government that her activities had been tolerated but he was liable to be deported. Finishing Volume III of her Memoirs, he left with his wife <b>in</b> 1754 to <b>get</b> it printed <b>in</b> <b>London.</b> There he tried to live as a writer, becoming friendly with fellow-Irishman Oliver Goldsmith, but suffered three spells of imprisonment for debt in the Marshalsea. He had little further success in the theatrical world, quarrelling with both Samuel Foote and David Garrick. His own memoirs were printed <b>in</b> <b>London</b> <b>in</b> two editions, coming out in 1760 and 1761. He died somewhere in Europe, presumably to escape creditors, in 1763.|$|R
