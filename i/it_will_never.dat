5|$|Because of the hurricane's {{destruction}} in Central America {{and elsewhere in}} North America, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Mitch {{in the spring of}} 1999; <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with Matthew in the 2004 season, which was itself retired after the 2016 season.|$|E
5|$|Due to its impact, {{the name}} Gloria was {{retired from the}} Atlantic {{tropical}} storm naming list. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with Grace in the 1991 season.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the high}} damage, the name Carol {{was removed from the}} naming list for 10years. The name was reused in the 1965 season, but was retroactively retired, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> again be used for an Atlantic {{hurricane}}. Carol was the first Atlantic hurricane name in history to be retired.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Elena has a {{multifaceted}} legacy; it is remembered {{not only for}} its severe impacts, but also for its unpredictability and the wide extent of pre-storm preparations. Due to its notoriety, the name Elena was retired from the cyclical list of Atlantic hurricane names in the spring of 1986. Consequently, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced by Erika, which was first used during the 1991 season.|$|E
5|$|While no {{fatalities}} were reported, the cyclone brought record-breaking rainfall to Australia, {{which led}} to a sharp decrease in the country's gold output. The cyclone also caused minor damage in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. In the spring of 2005, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology retired the name Fay from use, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> be used again as a cyclone name.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E

Try to imagine a world where Schnapp's work never existed... It simply can't be done, because Schnapp's designs are inextricably woven into the very fabric of American pop culture. That is a legacy most designers can only dream of.|$|R

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become {{sufficiently}} hot to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> be known what basis these {{allegations}} {{had in fact}} but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrives at}} a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the {{apparent}} leader. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark. The party battles Nene, but are easily defeated. They are {{thrown out of the}} base and start to fall to their deaths, but a beam of light from the base catches them, and brings them back to the base. The party find three small floating spheres {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres. The party refuses, and instead hold onto the spheres for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E

25|$|The {{acquisition}} by {{the young}} chaffinch of its song {{was the subject of}} an influential study by British ethologist William Thorpe.

He also found that in adult chaffinches, castration eliminates song, but injection of testosterone induces such birds to sing even in November, when they are normally silent.|$|E

25|$|Achieving {{a closed}} orbit is not {{essential}} to lunar and interplanetary voyages. Early Russian space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit. NASA considered launching Apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary parking orbit and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory. This costs additional propellant because the parking orbit perigee must be high enough to prevent reentry while direct injection can have an arbitrarily low perigee because <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> be reached.|$|E
