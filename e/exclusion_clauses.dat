5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E
500|$|The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (...) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{provided}} implied terms in contracts for {{the supply of}} goods and for hire-purchase agreements, and limited the use of <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses.</b> The result of a joint report by the England and Wales Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, First Report on Exemption Clauses, the Act was granted the Royal Assent on 18 April 1973 and came into force a month later. It met with a mixed reaction from academics, who praised the additional protection it offered {{while at the same}} time questioning whether it was enough; several aspects of the Act's draftsmanship and implementation were also called into question. Much of the Act was repealed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the 1973 Act's provisions.|$|E

500|$|In Karsales (Harrow) Ltd v Wallis [...] 1 W.L.R. 936 {{the courts}} {{developed}} {{the doctrine of}} fundamental breach; if one party had breached the contract {{in such a way}} that, if there was no exclusion clause, it would void the contract, such a contract could be set aside. Although a step forward, this doctrine was problematic, as pointed out by Lord Reid in Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [...] 1 AC 361; it failed to discriminate between <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> that were the result of unequal bargaining and those that were not. [...] In 1970 the England and Wales Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission produced their First Report on Exemption Clauses, designed to reform this area of law. The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was partially based on that report, but it went further in some respects. It was given the Royal Assent on 18 April 1973, and came into force a month later.|$|E
500|$|The Act is {{designed}} to prevent the avoidance of implied terms through <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses.</b> It provides (in Section 4) that any attempt to exclude a seller in consumer sales from Sections 2 and 3 is void. In non-consumer sales an exclusion clause is void [...] "to {{the extent that it}} is shown {{that it would not be}} fair or reasonable to allow reliance on the term". The burden of proof in such situations is on the party seeking to avoid liability through the exclusion clause. For determining whether it is [...] "fair or reasonable" [...] to allow the exclusion clause, five tests are used; 1) whether the parties were of equal bargaining strength, 2) whether the buyer was induced to agree to the clause, 3) whether the buyer knew, or ought to have known of the exclusion clause, 4) where the liability is conditional, if the condition is reasonable and 5) whether the goods were supplied as part of a special order. These basic tests were later extended into the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|E
500|$|Under earlier {{contractual}} theory {{a contract}} was an [...] "empty form" [...] {{that the two}} parties, as equal partners, could use to create such obligations and rights as they saw fit. Once a contract was signed, ways {{to get out of}} it were limited to whether it had been signed under duress, misrepresentation, or fraud. The general theory was freedom of contract; a contract can include almost any terms, as long as both parties agree to them. But in reality this doctrine was problematic. Firstly, while the idea that a person should be held to those terms he agrees to and signs works well with individually negotiated contracts, it does not with [...] "standard form" [...] contracts– printed, non-specific contracts drawn up in advance by one party, such as those used by banks. Such contracts can include clauses that severely restrict the rights of one party (<b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses).</b> Secondly, while the idea that signing a contract indicates consent worked well when there was little disparity between the parties, when the parties are a small business or individual and a major corporation, the smaller party may have to [...] "take or leave" [...] the contract, which can be a problem if all other corporations in the industry use similar terms. Although it had long been argued that [...] "unfair" [...] clauses should be struck down, the courts were obliged by the doctrine of freedom of contract to uphold them.|$|E

500|$|Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt & Co, the {{decision}} {{in which it was}} decided agreements excluding judicial supervision are invalid, is partially overruled by Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 provides that, where such an agreement is drafted, the High Court no longer has the automatic right to request additional reasons from the arbitrator or grant leave to appeal {{the decision}}. Such <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> must be specific, but can be general in nature; Section 3(2) states that it can be framed [...] "to relate to a particular award, to awards under a particular reference or to any other description of awards, whether arising out of the same reference or not". Section 3(6) provides an exception, which covers [...] "domestic" [...] arbitration agreements; these are defined as agreements where leave to appeal would not be valid in a jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom, and no parties are businesses or individuals legally based in the UK. In this situation, the exclusion clause is only valid if agreed to after the start of arbitration. A second exception is found in Section 4(1); where the contract arbitration is based on is within admiralty jurisdiction, to do with commodities trading, or an insurance agreement, it will not be valid unless either it was entered into after the start of arbitration or the law applicable to the contract is not that of England and Wales. In any situation, the High Court can be asked to give a decision on a point of law, or the exclusion clause removed, should all parties agree.|$|E
2500|$|Attempts by {{contracting}} parties to exclude liability for misrepresentations {{are subject to}} the same restrictions as are found for <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> generally under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. It was held in HIH Insurance Ltd v Chase Manhattan Bank that it is never possible to exclude liability for fraudulent misrepresentations. But it is possible to exclude liability for negligent misrepresentation, liability under Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) or innocent misrepresentation. The requirement, however, is that the exclusion is [...] "reasonable" [...] according to UCTA 1977 s 11, in conjunction with Sch 2.|$|E
2500|$|The third kind of remedy, for {{unauthorised}} gains, is restitution. In Murad v Al Saraj the Murad sisters {{entered a}} joint venture (creating a fiduciary relation, like for trustees) with Mr Al Saraj to buy a hotel. He deceitfully told them he was investing all his own money, when in fact he set off a debt from the seller and took an undisclosed commission. When sued {{to give up the}} profits he made, he submitted that the sisters would have entered the transaction even if they had known what he had done. Arden LJ rejected this argument, affirming that upon such a wrong, it was not open for the fiduciary to argue what might, hypothetically, have happened. A reduction in liability could only come from a determination of the value of skill and effort contributed. This is less generously quantified for dishonest fiduciaries, but generous allowances are typically given, as in Boardman v Phipps for fiduciaries who all along act honestly. Trustees who are found to commit wrongs may also have a defence under the Trustee Act 1925 sections 61–62. This gives courts discretion to relieve liability for people who acted [...] "honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused". There may also be <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> in the trust deed, up to the point of removing liability for fraud and open conflicts of interest. Chiefly <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses</b> will erase liability for breaches of the duty of care, although for professional trustees the ability to do this is constrained by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. If agreements for money management take place through contracts, a professional trustee probably cannot exclude liability for breach of contract under section 3, because given that he would be better placed to take out insurance liability exclusion will probably not be reasonable under section 11. Lastly, the Limitation Act 1980 sections 21–22 prevents claims for innocent or negligent trust breach being pursued six years after the right of action accrues, again with the exception for fraud or property converted by trustees for their own use, where there is no limit.|$|E

2500|$|One it is {{established}} which terms {{are incorporated into}} an agreement, their meaning must be determined. Since the introduction of legislation regulating unfair terms, English courts have become firmer in their general guiding principle that agreements are construed {{to give effect to}} the intentions of the parties from the standpoint of a reasonable person. This changed significantly from the early 20th century, when English courts had become enamoured with a literalist theory of interpretation, championed in part by Lord Halsbury. As greater concern grew around the mid-20th century over unfair terms, and particularly <b>exclusion</b> <b>clauses,</b> the courts swung to the opposite position, utilising heavily the doctrine of contra proferentum. Ambiguities in clauses excluding or limiting one party's liability would be construed against the person relying on it. In the leading case, Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v R the Crown's shed in Montreal harbour burnt down, destroying goods owned by Canada Steamship lines. Lord Morton held that a clause in the contract limiting the Crown's excluding liability for [...] "damage... to... goods... being... in the said shed" [...] was not enough to excuse it from liability for negligence because the clause could also be construed as referring to strict liability under another contract clause. It would exclude that instead. Some judges, and in particular Lord Denning wished to go further by introducing a rule of [...] "fundamental breach of contract" [...] whereby no liability for very serious breaches of contract could be excluded at all. While the rules remain ready for application where statute may not help, such hostile approaches to interpretation were generally felt to run contrary to the plain meaning of language.|$|E
