40|$|Abstract – In this paper, the {{performance}} of the classifier for classifying the Remote Sensing (RS) images is evaluated. The variety, type and extent of land cover throughout a region can be estimated through satellite remote sensing. This meets a need common to <b>ecological</b> applications. <b>Land</b> cover <b>classification</b> is undertaken through RS images acquired by multispectral sensors. In this study, Walsh Hadamard transform was used for feature transformation of the RS images and information gain for feature reduction. The features selected were classified using Naïve Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, J 48 decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classifiers were evaluated using a Subset of Salinas dataset consisting of corn_senseced_green_wees and Lettuce_romaine_ 5 wk...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to discuss}} the method of land-type <b>classification</b> and <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> {{evaluation}} especially for the landscape conservation in Izena Island located in Okinawa Islands, southwest Japan, wherein geographical distributions of plant communities (actual vegetation) were phytosociologically surveyed by the author et al. (1978). First of all methodological discussion concerning <b>land</b> <b>classification,</b> the concept {{of which has been}} reviewed by many applied geographers like MABBUTT (1968), was carried out. In this article the author proposed "potential natural vegetation (TUXEN 1956) and landform" -oriented <b>land</b> <b>classification</b> as a sort of bio-physical <b>land</b> <b>classification</b> from genetically interpreted landscape approach. This method of classification is considered to be useful for land evaluation because of the integrated character of the two indexes and the appropriateness of forming a connection with land-use through actual vegetation which is influenced by both land potentiality and land use. In this study island land was classified into 13 bio-physical land units and their connection with other land elements such as surface geology and soils was considered. Such land units were mapped and connected with land use by using vegetational substitution. In the contemporary relationship possibility of land uses and land-use forms seem to be dependent upon the potentiality of land units. It is suggested that land evaluation can be performed through consideration of the way the relations between land units and land uses should be planned from the ecological point of view in the future. Concerning such <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> evaluation, land units have summarized into 6 evaluated groups which present common characters for the countermeasures of land conservation. Then, in the specified area of the study island, land evaluation was tried for the purpose of protection of nature and recreation. This {{is an example of a}} landscape plan based on the results of land evaluation, which include the importance of land conservation, the vaue of natural or semi-natural vegetation and the desirability of land for the construction of roads, footpaths and recreational facilities. As a result of the case-study, the effectiveness of <b>land</b> <b>classification</b> and <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> evaluation has been suggested. This study is a preliminary attempt to join the geographical and ecological method to landscape planning through land-type classification and evaluation. This sort of approach seems to get much importance under the critical circumstances for the development planning in Japan, especially in the humid subtropical islands where land potentiality for developments is relatively low and land itself is very limited...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Ecological</b> <b>land</b> is {{like the}} “liver ” of a city and is very useful to public health. <b>Ecological</b> <b>land</b> change is a {{spatially}} dynamic non-linear process under the interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors at different scales. In this study, by setting up natural development scenario, object orientation scenario and ecosystem priority scenario, a Cellular Automation (CA) model has been established to simulate the evolution pattern of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> in Beijing in the year 2020. Under the natural development scenario, most of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> {{will be replaced by}} construction land and crop land. But under the scenarios of object orientation and ecosystem priority, the <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> area will increase, especially under the scenario of ecosystem priority. When considering the factors such as total area of <b>ecological</b> <b>land,</b> loss of key <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> and spatial patterns of land use, the scenarios from priority to inferiority are ecosystem priority, object orientation and natural development, so future land management policies in Beijing should be focused on conversion of cropland to forest, wetland protection and prohibition of exploitation of natural protection zones, water source areas and forest parks to maintain the safety of the regional ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization is {{accompanied}} by the intense transformation and conflicts among different land use types that produce a series of economic, social, and environmental impacts. Ascertaining the quantity and pattern optimization of urban <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> is critical to solving urban environmental problems and realizing urban sustainable development. Using the Chinese city of Changzhou, an important and typical city in the Yangtze River delta, as the case study, we applied the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCRM) to calculate the amount of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> that meets the demand of socioeconomic development and ecological protection considerating the source of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> and constructed land, ecosystem services, and the resistance plane. Results showed that the suitable <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> area is about 1006. 9 km(2), which is 53. 8 % of the total urban area of Changzhou, and is mainly distributed in Wujin and Xinbei districts. Considering the <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> space and functional changes {{of the study area}} and comparing the current land use status with the model simulation results, we propose three land use types. For urban <b>ecological</b> <b>land,</b> positive protection measures and prohibiting economic development initiatives are necessary. For ecotones between urban developed <b>land</b> and <b>ecological</b> <b>land,</b> protection should be given priority and economic development activities should be rigidly controlled. For constructed land, measurements and policies should be taken to promote reasonable development and improve land intensity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>land</b> is a {{land use}} {{category}} provided with considerable ecological value and a vital indicator reflecting regional eco-environmental quality. However, it has experienced severe fragmentation during the rapid urbanization in China which strongly threatened the regional <b>ecological</b> security, <b>land</b> use pattern and human living environment. Therefore, analysis of spatiotemporal change of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> use and <b>ecological</b> landscape pattern is particularly essential. In this paper, a case study was made in Nong’an County, which is a typical black soil farming area located in northeast China facing severe conflicts among cultivated land protection, urban expansion and ecological security. A landscape fragmentation evaluation model was proposed to measure the degree of regional <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> fragmentation. We also determined the land use change features through the methods of dynamic change information exploration and by performing transfer trajectory analysis {{during the period from}} 1996 to 2014. The results showed that the <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> in Nong’an County has experienced increasing fragmentation during the past 18 years. The statistical results showed that the <b>land</b> transition between <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> and other land categories was quite frequent, and it especially appeared as a dramatic decline of grassland and severe increase of saline-alkali land. In addition, human interferences especially construction activities and cultivated land occupation were still the dominant factors to the fragmentation of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> and the frequent transition among the land use categories. The fragmentation degree showed a downward tendency {{at the end of the}} study, which indicated noticeable benefits of land use regulation and land protection policies directed towards <b>land</b> <b>ecological</b> value. This study aims to provide a scientific evaluation model for measuring <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> fragmentation degree, and figure out the regional land use transition relationships to offer suggestions for decision-making and provide a practical case in a typical region...|$|R
30|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} As {{described}} in article 1 {{of this series}} (Hornsmann et al. 2008), the <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> <b>classification</b> of Europe (ELCE) encompassing 40 classes was calculated by using Classification and Regression Trees (CART).

Additionally, the approach will be extended by the predictive mapping of vector-associated diseases.|$|E
30|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} The first two {{articles}} of this series (Hornsmann et al. 2008; Weustermann et al. 2009) comprised how the <b>Ecological</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Classification</b> of Europe (ELCE) was calculated. Moreover several ecological classes were described exemplarily. In this part 3 of the series the ELCE is compared with two European ecoregionalisations at several levels of differentiation. These are the Digital Map of European ecological regions (DMEER) and the Environmental Stratification of Europe (EnS). In addition the ELCE was opposed to the ecoregionalisation of Germany. The alignment was carried out both functionally and statistically {{and served as a}} basis for the examination of the functional consistency of the ELCE.|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{much of the}} United States, {{systems of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> <b>classification</b> are used to divide the forested {{landscape}} into units that are biologically and operationally meaningful. No such system currently exists in central Massachusetts, however, due to the extensive and prolonged effects of human land use. ^ Initial research {{on a series of}} State Forests in central Massachusetts indicate that physical site characteristics such as the presence of a hardpan, soil texture and type of glacial deposition can be correlated with patterns in vegetation distribution. These factors are similar to those used by W. B. Leak in creating an ecological land type (ELT) classification for the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire. A system was created to adapt and transfer the White Mountain ELTs to central Massachusetts. The system was then applied to a variety of sites in central Massachusetts at two different scales. The habitat classification system reflected general trends of vegetation composition and productivity, particularly at a local landscape level, but further work is needed to better account for the effect of land use history and local ecological variation. ^ An underlying assumption of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> <b>classification</b> is that vegetation is most strongly influenced by site factors that are related to soil moisture availability. Direct soil moisture measurements were made on a variety of sites throughout a season at Cadwell Memorial Forest in Pelham, Massachusetts. Analysis showed a relatively poor correlation between soil moisture measured that year and long-term site productivity. However, the pattern of short term (weekly) variation in soil moisture was related to general trends in productivity. ^ The hydrologic model, TOPMODEL, was used to create a relative wetness potential index within a GIS framework to predict site productivity based on potential soil moisture availability. While this model showed some potential in predicting general soil moisture status, it was not well correlated with the direct soil moisture measurements. ...|$|E

In this study, theoretical and technical frameworks of regionalisation on the eco-environmental function of the river systems were preliminarily formulated. According to the river eco-environmental functions, Luanhe River was regionalised into four types of first-class functional areas, i. e., ecological preservation areas, habitat restoration areas, ecological buffer areas and development and utilisation areas. Combined with the main functions of all functional areas, <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> use of the river system in Luanhe River was assessed and planned. The total area of basic <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> use was 876. 98 km 2 ; that of restrictive <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> use was 1745. 52 km 2 ; that of <b>ecological</b> <b>land</b> use of the river system returned from farmland was 284. 25 km 2 ; and that returned from construction land was 17. 35 km 2 .
