She had watched earnestly the conversation between the doctor and her parents, and when the former had left and they explained what was proposed, her face brightened up.|$|E
25|$|Fingerspelling (or dactylology) is the {{representation}} of the letters of a writing system, and sometimes numeral systems, using only the hands. These manual alphabets (also known as <b>finger</b> <b>alphabets</b> or hand alphabets), have often been used in deaf education, and have subsequently been adopted as a distinct part of a number of sign languages; there are about forty manual alphabets around the world. Historically, manual alphabets have had a number of additional applications—including use as ciphers, as mnemonics, and in silent religious settings.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{writers have}} {{suggested}} that the body and hands were used to represent alphabets in Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Assyrian antiquity. Certainly, [...] "finger calculus" [...] systems were widespread, and capable of representing numbers up to 10,000; they are still in use today in parts of the Middle East. The practice of substituting letters for numbers and vice versa, known as gematria, was also common, and {{it is possible that the}} two practices were combined to produce a <b>finger</b> calculus <b>alphabet.</b> The earliest known manual alphabet, described by the Benedictine monk Bede in 8th century Northumbria, did just that. While the usual purpose of the Latin and Greek <b>finger</b> <b>alphabets</b> described by Bede is unknown, they were unlikely to have been used by deaf people for communication — even though Bede lost his own hearing later in life. Historian Lois Bragg concludes that these alphabets were [...] "only a bookish game." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purposes}} for which these sign lexicons were used were varied. Travelling Franciscan friars used <b>finger</b> <b>alphabets,</b> possibly as memory aids for preaching, and in Benedictine monasteries, signs representing words {{were used for}} limited communication when silence was required. Rather than the popularly imagined total [...] "Vows of Silence," [...] the Rule of St. Benedict actually dictates that conversation is only not allowed in {{certain areas of the}} monastery and during certain hours of the day. It was only much later, in the 17th century, that certain Cistercian and Trappist orders came to see absolute silence as a penance to endure along with the other deprivations of their austere lives.|$|R

It describes her rapid mental growth and improvement during twelve months more, and brings her little history down {{to the end of}} last year. It is very remarkable, that as we dream in words, and carry on imaginary conversations, in which we speak both for ourselves and for the shadows who appear to us in those visions of the night, so she, having no words, uses her <b>finger</b> <b>alphabet</b> in her sleep. And it has been ascertained that when her slumber is broken, and is much disturbed by dreams, she expresses her thoughts in an irregular and confused manner on her fingers: just as we should murmur and mutter them indistinctly, in the like circumstances.|$|E

The complacent motion of his head and forefinger as he gently beat time, and corrected the air with imaginary punctuation, the smile that mantled on his features at every jocose passage, and the sly look he stole around to observe its effect, the calm manner in which he shut his eyes and listened when there was some little piece of description, the changing expression with which he acted the dialogue to himself, his agony that the deaf gentleman should know what it was all about, and his extraordinary anxiety to correct the reader when he hesitated at a word in the manuscript, or substituted a wrong one, were alike worthy of remark. And when at last, endeavouring to communicate with the deaf gentleman by means of the <b>finger</b> <b>alphabet,</b> with which he constructed such words as are unknown in any civilised or savage language, he took up a slate and wrote in large text, one word in a line, the question, 'How - do - you - like - it?' - when he did this, and handing it over the table awaited the reply, with a countenance only brightened and improved by his great excitement, even Mr. Miles relaxed, and could not forbear looking at him for the moment with interest and favour.|$|E

40|$|Communication {{between student}} and {{learning}} source represents the main media {{for the teaching}} / learning process. For Deaf and Dumb (D&D) such communication could be processed via speech visualization media. All the oral/audio instructional material could be translated into the corresponding material via visual mode. Three main modes of communication for the D&D are commonly used. They are <b>alphabets</b> <b>finger</b> spelling (one hand and two hands), sign language and lip movement reading. Our paper covers sign language and finger spelling (one hand) because according to our survey the e-dictionary for lip movement is not available yet. The authors developed an e-learning module (eLM) which displays only sign language clips for selected thirty words from the e-vocabulary of video clips of sign language. Also they developed another e-learning module which displays the same thirty words but in finger spelling from other e-vocabulary of <b>alphabets</b> <b>finger</b> spelling one hand picture files. A selected sample of seven D&D students in real school of Hearing Impaired students have been tested to write {{the words in the}} two e-learning modules.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{understanding of}} human brain functions {{makes it possible to}} directly interact with the brain for therapeutic purposes. Implantable brain computer interfaces promise to replace or restore motor functions in patients with partial or complete paralysis. We postulate that neuronal states associated with gestures, as they are used in the <b>finger</b> spelling <b>alphabet</b> of sign languages, provide an excellent signal for implantable brain computer interfaces to restore communication. To test this, we evaluated decodability of four gestures using high-density electrocorticography in two participants. The electrode grids were located subdurally on the hand knob area of the sensorimotor cortex covering a surface of 2. 5 – 5. 2  cm 2. Using a pattern-matching classification approach four types of hand gestures were classified based on their pattern of neuronal activity. In the two participants the gestures were classified with 97 and 74  % accuracy. The high frequencies (> 65  Hz) allowed for the best classification results. This proof-of-principle study indicates that the four gestures are associated with a reliable and discriminable spatial representation on a confined area of the sensorimotor cortex. This robust representation on a small area makes hand gestures an interesting control feature for an implantable BCI to restore communication for severely paralyzed people...|$|R
40|$|Sign {{language}} is a method of communication for deaf-mute people with articulated gestures and postures of hands and <b>fingers</b> to represent <b>alphabet</b> letters or complete words. Recognizing gestures is a difficult task, due to intrapersonal and interpersonal variations in performing them. This paper investigates the use of Spiral Passive Electromagnetic Sensor (SPES) as a motion recognition tool. An instrumented glove integrated with wearable multi-SPES sensors was developed to encode data and provide a unique response for each hand gesture. The device {{can be used for}} recognition of gestures; motion control and well-defined gesture sets such as sign languages. Each specific gesture was associated to a unique sensor response. The gloves encode data regarding the gesture directly in the frequency spectrum response of the SPES. The absence of chip or complex electronic circuit make the gloves light and comfortable to wear. Results showed encouraging data to use SPES in wearable applications...|$|R

In real time, the system can track the 3 D position and 2 D orientation of thumb and index finger of each hand without the use of special markers and gloves. For someone who can hear, it is difficult to imagine what it is like to be deaf. Many people associate ‘deaf with handicapped’, but this is not really correct. A handicapped person, like someone who is blind, has trouble functioning independently in everyday life. Deaf people do not have this problem: they can ride a bike, drive a car, go to work, shop, and go on vacation like everybody else. The greatest problem for a deaf person is “Communication”. The main motive of the paper is to simplify the communication between normal and deaf people and bring them in normal flow of society. To study the first phase of the finger spelling recognition task involves the segmentation of finger spelling hand gestures from image sequences. The aim of this paper to convert finger spelled word to text (Character by Character) as well as speech. Second phase includes Text to Image conversion process. In this sentences are scanned entered by user and then alphabets separation module separate the alphabets from sentences and corresponding image is display to viewers. Here images are nothing but <b>finger</b> spelling <b>alphabets...</b>|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedGesture {{interfaces}} {{have long}} been pursued {{in the context of}} portable computing and immersive environments. However, such interfaces have been difficult to realize, in part {{due to the lack of}} frameworks for their design and implementation. Analogical to a game engine which is used to build computer games, a gesture interface engine is a framework which is used to build gesture interfaces systematically, conveniently, and efficiently.; Rather than using a low-level high-dimensional joint angle space, we describe and recognize handposes in a 'lexical' space, in which each handpose is decomposed into elements in a <b>finger</b> state <b>alphabet.</b> A handpose is defined by finger spelling, i. e., by specifying the pose of each finger and the inter-relation between any two fingers. Dynamic gestures are defined as handpose transformation, hand translation, and rotation. The alphabet and underlying grammar form a simple but expressive gesture notation system called GeLex.; The implementation of the gesture interface engine is based on a Canesta laser camera that produces reliable low-resolution depth images at video rates. By decomposing and recognizing handposes as finger states, we achieve robust handpose recognition in real-time (30 frames/second). Dynamic gestures are recognized using finite state machines and explicit gesture manifold tracking. By implementing a generic gesture recognition algorithm which recognizes a large set of gestures, and a mechanism to adapt it to a specific application based on an interface description (in GeLex), the development of a gesture interface is simplified.; Other functionalities provided by the gesture interface engine include: a system called 'SmartCanvas' which enables a user to write and draw on a regular desk with his/her fingers; algorithms to detect and remove conflicts within a gesture set, i. e., whether two gestures used together may cause recognition errors and/or interpretion ambiguity.; Also, the thesis explores the development of intuitive gesture interfaces. In an intuitive gesture interface, a user interacts with a system with natural gestures, and the intended meanings are correctly interpreted by the system using a gesturesemantic database. The goal is to minimize the learning efforts and adaptation required from a user when presented with a new gesture interface...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 40 - 42) This {{study was}} undertaken {{to test the}} effectiveness of an innovative technique using the manual <b>alphabet</b> (<b>finger</b> spelling) in the spelling instruction of learning disabled junior high school students. Two Special Education classes at two different schools in Ventura County, California, (twenty-five students in all), were each divided into experimental and control groups. After a 200 -word pretest was administered to all, and finger spelling taught to the experimental groups, students studied 60 words similar to those on the pretest over a six-week period, ten words per week. The program {{for the two groups}} differed only in that the experimental group students practiced words by finger spelling and the control group by repeated writing. Analysis of the subsequent posttest, composed of the same words as the pretest, indicated a superiority of the control method over the experimental for transferability to new words, but the experimental group in one class improved far more in words studied than did the control group. (Such records for the other class could not be compared.) The indication is that, using the experimental design of this study, words studied may be learned more effectively with finger spelling than with writing repeatedly, but the latter method is more beneficial for learning spelling patterns and applying them to new words not studied. Numerous ideas for future scientific studies of finger spelling were generated from this experiment. Such studies are well justified by the positive outcomes of the study [...] -the enthusiasm of teachers and students for using finger spelling and the effect of the method on self-esteem, motivation, and behavior of the students involved...|$|R

He reasoned that a deaf and blind child would have most use of learning to speak (rather than using e.g. the <b>finger</b> <b>alphabet).</b> Hofgaard first taught Kåta to pronounce the letters, then to combine two letters into a syllable, and finally multi-syllabic words before trying to attach meaning to what had until then been presented as a complicated game. The first words used were: [...] (watch), [...] (foot), and [...] (table). The words {{were associated with the}} objects over several days until Ragnhild understood that the words named the object. After that she learned to understand others by placing her hand on their lips as they spoke, she learned to write, and to read Braille.During the summer of 1889, Kåta met with Mary Swift Lamson (1822-1909) who had taught Laura Bridgman at the Perkins School for the Blind. At that time, Mrs. Lamson reported that Kåta could already speak simple sentences. In 1890, ten-year-old Helen Keller was introduced to the story of Ragnhild Kåta and was inspired by her ability to learn to speak.|$|E

This methodology is based on the intelligibility according to variable transmission channel capacity for different video formats.

The results obtained were applied a standard scale for subjective evaluation of image quality and percentages evaluation of recognizability as used in acoustics. Based on this results of objective evaluation of logatom recognizability with respondent involvement we search the method, which correlate best with intelligibility.

40|$|To {{create a}} {{universal}} {{system for the}} control of gene expression, we have studied methods {{for the construction of}} novel polydactyl zinc finger proteins that recognize extended DNA sequences. Elsewhere we have described the generation of zinc finger domains recognizing sequences of the 5 ′-GNN- 3 ′ subset of a 64 -member zinc <b>finger</b> <b>alphabet.</b> Here we report on the use of these domains as modular building blocks for the construction of polydactyl proteins specifically recognizing 9 - or 18 -bp sequences. A rapid PCR assembly method was developed that, together with this predefined set of zinc finger domains, provides ready access to 17 million novel proteins that bind the 5 ′-(GNN) 6 - 3 ′ family of 18 -bp DNA sites. To examine the efficacy of this strategy in gene control, the human erbB- 2 gene was chosen as a model. A polydactyl protein specifically recognizing an 18 -bp sequence in the 5 ′-untranslated region of this gene was converted into a transcriptional repressor by fusion with Krüppel-associated box (KRAB), ERD, or SID repressor domains. Transcriptional activators were generated by fusion with the herpes simplex VP 16 activation domain or with a tetrameric repeat of VP 16 ’s minimal activation domain, termed VP 64. We demonstrate that both gene repression and activation can be achieved by targeting designed proteins to a single site within the transcribed region of a gene. We anticipate that gene-specific transcriptional regulators of the type described here will find diverse applications in gene therapy, functional genomics, and the generation of transgenic organisms...|$|E
40|$|In Slovak Republic, {{fundamentals}} of protection of people, property and environment are {{established by the}} Constitution of Slovak Republic, the Security Strategy of Slovak Republic and by numerous Acts, Declarations or Regulations of Government which refer to Civilian Protection and Integrated Rescue System. Legislative standards with regards to protection of health or property {{does not take into}} account people with health disabilities despite the fact that the right for safety and timely warning of imminent danger is granted for every citizen on the territory of Slovak Republic. Objective of my diploma work is to investigate readiness of institutions participating on solutions of extraordinary events which struck people with health disabilities. Based on results of quantitative survey we would like to point out on deficiencies of the system and to propose a solution to improve procedures of the Integrated Rescue System and Civil Protection with regards to people with health disabilities. Further objective is to process a proposal of methodical tutorial which would contain basis gesticulation important for communication with the hearing impaired. Theoretical part of the diploma work consists of several chapters. The first part discusses basic families, classes and types of health impairment. Further on system of Civil Protection and its mission was processed. Last part is dedicated to the Integrated Rescue System. In that chapter we described fundamental and other rescue branches which by large participated on solutions of extraordinary events. The theory was processed by means of law legislation, sources of literature and internet websites. The empirical (practical) part of the thesis has been used qualitative research method. Because it is extremely difficult to collect such data were made through guided interview with experts of Civil Protection and managers of particular rescue branches (Fire fighting and Rescue Force, Rescue Health Service, Police Force) only in three selected counties of Presov region (Poprad, Stará Ľubovňa, Prešov). Results of the managed interview were evaluated by SWOT analysis which compares the internal and external environment. On the basis of empirical phenomenon a searching strategy (WO) was chosen whereby the focus was laid on utilizing opportunities and eliminating weaknesses. Based on results we concluded that issue of health disability isn?t incorporated into law legislation and plans to solve extraordinary events. There is no common education of managerial and executive rescue branches which would enable them to gather fundamental knowledge of classes and specifications of health disability, possibilities of communication and means of first-aid provision. For further qualitative and quantitative development of education there is a deficiency of material-didactic instruments which serve to accomplish the objective. We also concluded that when rescuing health-impaired people there are no special procedures and methods taken into account. At the same time for the hearing-impaired there is no system of timely warning and information of imminent danger and possibility to call rescue branches through the emergency phone line. With regards to existing deficiencies we proposed practical recommendations. To improve communication with hearing impaired people we created a proposal of a methodical instrument for rescue branches which contains basic signs.
