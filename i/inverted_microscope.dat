25|$|An <b>inverted</b> <b>{{microscope}}</b> is {{a microscope}} with its light source and condenser on the top, above the stage pointing down, while the objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up. The <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope</b> {{was invented in}} 1850 by J. Lawrence Smith, a faculty member of Tulane University and the Medical College of Louisiana.|$|E
2500|$|The Tulane University School of Medicine {{was founded}} in 1834 and is the 15th oldest medical school in the United States. Faculty have been noted for innovation. For example, in 1850 J. Lawrence Smith invented the <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope.</b> In the {{following}} year John Leonard Riddell invented the first practical microscope to allow binocular viewing through a single objective lens. In 2001 the Tulane Center for Gene Therapy started as the first major center in the U.S. to focus on research using adult stem cells. The school has highly selective admissions, accepting only 175 medical students from more than 10,000 applications. [...] It comprises 20 academic departments: Anesthesiology, Biochemistry, Family and Community Medicine, Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Orthopaedics, Otolaryngology, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics, Pharmacology, Physiology, Psychiatry and Neurology, Radiology, Structural and Cellular Biology, Surgery and Urology.|$|E

50|$|The {{first child}} born from a gamete {{micromanipulation}} (technique in which special tools and <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> are used that help embryologists to choose and pick an individual sperm for ICSI IVF) {{was a child}} in Singapore-born in April 1989.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{immersion}} can generally {{only be used}} on rigidly mounted specimens {{otherwise the}} surface tension of the oil can move the coverslip and so move the sample underneath. This can also happen on <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> because the coverslip is below the slide.|$|R
50|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{are used}} in {{micromanipulation}} applications where space above the specimen is required for manipulator mechanisms and the microtools they hold, and in metallurgical applications where polished samples can be placed {{on top of the}} stage and viewed from underneath using reflecting objectives.|$|R

50|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{are useful}} for observing living cells or organisms {{at the bottom of}} a large {{container}} (e.g., a tissue culture flask) under more natural conditions than on a glass slide, as is the case with a conventional microscope.Inverted microscope is also used for visualisation of the mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in the technique called microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay(MODS).|$|R
50|$|Oil {{immersion}} {{objectives are}} used only at very large magnifications that require high resolving power. Objectives with high power magnification have short focal lengths, facilitating {{the use of}} oil. The oil {{is applied to the}} specimen (conventional microscope), and the stage is raised, immersing the objective in oil. (In <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> the oil is applied to the objective).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>microscope.</b> It {{should have}} 20X and 40X lens, with Hoffman optics, and a 37 °C surface {{to have an}} optimal {{maintenance}} of the biological material.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{requirements}} that an IVF lab need to correctly perform ICSI technique. There are basically 5 main elements: laminar flow cabinet, <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope,</b> micromanipulators, microinjectors and anti-vibration table.|$|E
50|$|Two {{kinds of}} optical {{microscope}} are generally {{used to examine}} flat, polished and etched specimens: a reflection microscope and an <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope.</b> Recording the image is achieved using a digital camera working through the eyepiece.|$|E
30|$|Phase {{contrast}} imaging {{was carried}} out on Leica AF 6000 live cell imaging workstation. Fluorescence imaging was performed with Zeiss LSM 710 or Olympus FV 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope and Leica DMI 6000 B wide-field fluorescence microscope. For fluorescence imaging, the samples were prepared up-side-down for imaging on <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> to avoid fluorescence quenching caused by the gold thin-film substrates. Imaging was performed immediately after preparation.|$|R
25|$|The use of oblique (from the side) {{illumination}} {{gives the}} image a three-dimensional (3D) appearance and can highlight otherwise invisible features. A more recent technique {{based on this}} method is Hoffmann's modulation contrast, a system found on <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> for use in cell culture. Oblique illumination suffers from the same limitations as bright field microscopy (low contrast of many biological samples; low apparent resolution due to out of focus objects).|$|R
50|$|Fluidic force {{microscopy}} (FluidFM) {{is a type}} of {{scanning probe}} microscopy, and is typically used on a standard <b>inverted</b> light <b>microscope.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope</b> that Hayflick {{modified}} {{for use in}} his {{tissue culture}} and mycoplasma work and on which all other such microscopes have been modeled has been acquired by the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.|$|E
50|$|The FluidFM {{technology}} is typically used {{on top of}} an <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope.</b> In addition to standard AFM experiments, FluidFM provides the possibility to perform countless other applications, such as single cell injection and adhesion as well as nanolithography and spotting.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{immersion}} objectives {{can have}} practical difficulties {{due to their}} shallow depth of field and extremely short working distance, which calls {{for the use of}} very thin (0.17 mm) cover slips, or, in an <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope,</b> thin glass-bottomed Petri dishes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Orientation {{control of}} {{biological}} cells under <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{is important for}} cell birefringent imaging and micro-manipulation. Taking our microrobotic mouse embryo injection research as an example, this paper presents a cell orientation con-trol system operated under <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes.</b> A compact mo-torized rotational stage for inverted microscopy was developed for orienting the polar body of mouse embryos away from the injection site to avoid damage of cellular organelles. An in-house developed microdevice was used for immobilizing many cells into a regular pattern. The polar body is tracked by a visual tracking algorithm with a translation-rotation-scaling motion model, providing image position feedback to an image-based visual servo controller {{that is responsible for}} online calibration of coordinate transformation during visually servoed orientation of the first embryo. High-speed, automatic cell orientation is then conducted on other embryos in the same batch of immobilized embryos through coordinate trans-formation and 3 -DOF closed-loop position control. Experimental results demonstrate that the cell-orientation system is capable of orienting mouse embryos at a high speed of 720 ◦/s with an accuracy of 0. 24 ◦.

30|$|Observation and {{photography}} on Zeiss Axiovert <b>invert</b> <b>microscope</b> with a Zeiss AxioCam M 5 Rc digital camera (Zeiss Corp., Germany) were done as described (Yi et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2014). Confocal microscopic observation and time-lapse imaging {{were performed on}} the UltraView VoX (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using an Olympus water-immersion 40 × objective lens (NA = 1.15; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by using software Volocity 6.2. 1 (PerkinElmer) setting for sequential record modes at 3 channels of laser lines at 405, 488 and 561 nm.|$|R
50|$|Alongside {{developments}} in inter-disciplinary, clinical and confocal microscope solutions, Nikon’s digital imaging technologies and software solutions support all microscopy and imaging functions, image management and analysis. The Eclipse Ti series of <b>inverted</b> <b>microscopes,</b> for example, allows the simultaneous mounting of confocal, TIRF module and multiple stacked epi-fluorescence filter turrets {{to make this}} microscope the ideal live cell imaging platform. Long term timelapse imaging of living cells is becoming an increasingly important technique - for which Nikon has developed the very latest in Cellogy and Cell Care - the BioStation series.|$|R
50|$|The {{stage of}} an <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope</b> is usually fixed, and focus is {{adjusted}} {{by moving the}} objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The focus mechanism typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>inverted</b> <b>{{microscope}}</b> is {{a microscope}} with its light source and condenser on the top, above the stage pointing down, while the objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up.

50|$|Some LSFMs {{have been}} {{developed}} where the sample is mounted as in standard microscopy (e.g. cells grow horizontally {{on the bottom of}} a petri dish) and the excitation and detection optics are constructed in an upright plane from above. This also allows combining a LSFM with a standard <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope</b> and avoids the requirement for specialized sample mounting procedures.|$|E
40|$|Live imaging of {{above ground}} meristems {{can lead to}} new {{insights}} in plant development not possible from static imaging of fixed tissue. The use of an upright confocal microscope offers several technical and biological advantages for live imaging floral or shoot meristems. However, many departments and core facilities possess only <b>inverted</b> confocal <b>microscopes</b> and lack the funding for an additional upright confocal microscope. Here we show that imaging of living apical meristems can be performed on existing <b>inverted</b> confocal <b>microscopes</b> {{with the use of}} an affordable and detachable InverterScope accessory...|$|R

50|$|Their {{products}} {{include the}} EVOS Microscope, a digital <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope</b> {{for use in}} fluorescence and transmitted light applications. It utilizes a light-emitting diode (LED) illumination system. The integrated microprocessor and imaging system, and a high resolution digital camera let users process and analyze live and captured images. The 15-inch LCD display replaces the traditional eye pieces. Software features include time-lapse, cell counting and transfection analysis.|$|E
50|$|Radial {{stagnant}} point flow (RSPF) {{system has}} currently {{been used for}} the experiment of bacterial adhesion with the verification of DLVO theory. It is a well-characterized experimental system and is useful for visualizing the deposition of individual bacteria on the uniform charge, flat quartz surface. The deposition of bacteria on the surface was observed and estimated through an <b>inverted</b> <b>microscope</b> and recorded at regular intervals (10 s or 20 s) with a digital camera.|$|E

30|$|To {{identify}} phytoplankton species, each {{sample was}} shaken well {{to obtain a}} homogenized sample. Thereafter, three replicates of each sample (1  ml) were pipetted from the 30  ml sample and poured into a Sedgewick-Rafter counting chamber under an <b>invert</b> <b>microscope</b> (Vollenweider 1974; Newell 1977). Species identification was performed using valid identification keys (Prescott 1962; Kasymov 2000; Tiffany and Britton 1971). Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS software (version 11.5). The data were tested to check for the normality. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) {{was used for the}} existence of significant differences (P[*]<[*] 0.05) between transects seasons and depths. Multivariate regression was used in this study. Phytoplankton phyla were considered as dependent variables and transect and depth were considered as independent variables.|$|R
