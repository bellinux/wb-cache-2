40|$|The lung is {{a highly}} {{branched}} tree-like tubular system that results from more than 20 generations of <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> airways and consists of 300 million alveoli for gas exchange. Airway branches form via branching morphogenesis and then mature into <b>conducting</b> airways, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> number and distribution of different cell types need to be precisely controlled. <b>The</b> <b>conducting</b> airways contain four lung cell types: club cells, ciliated cells, basal cells, and neuroendocrine cells. SOX 2 is a well-known conducting airway marker. SOX 2 is a transcription factor that {{is known to be}} important in embryonic development and induction of pluripotent stem cells. We hypothesized that SOX 2 controls cell differentiation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> airways. To determine the role of SOX 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> airways, we used various mouse models to determine if SOX 2 controls cell differentiation. SOX 2 was deleted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lung epithelium by using Sox 2 EGFP/CKO and ShhCre/+. We observed a decrease in club cell, basal cell, and neuroendocrine cell differentiation when Sox 2 is absent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> airways.

We found that SOX 2 expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alveoli region reprograms alveoli cells into conducting airway cells. Mutant alveolar type 1 and type 2 cells expressing SOX 2 are able to generate basal –like cells. Further, through microarray analysis we found SOX 21, a transcription factor, significantly down regulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of Sox 2. Sox 21 has a unique expression pattern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> airways. <b>The</b> expression of SOX 21 is uniform <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proximal airways and sporadic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distal airways. Together, these data suggest SOX 2 controls cell differentiation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> airways.

5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his {{activities}} from then until early 545, by which time he was the garrison commander of Rome. Along with the general Conon {{he was responsible for}} the city's defence during the siege by Totila in 546. During the siege he restricted himself to passive defence, refusing to sally forth from the walls even when Belisarius, who had returned from the east and landed with reinforcements at the nearby Portus Romanus, ordered him to do so. As a result, Belisarius' attempts to succour the beleaguered city failed. Procopius heavily criticizes Bessas for his conduct during the siege. He neglected of the civilian population of the city and enriched himself by selling the starving populace the grain he had hoarded at exorbitant prices. The civilians were so exhausted by famine that when he finally allowed those who wanted to leave the city to do so, many simply died on the wayside, while others were killed by the Goths. Finally, he proved negligent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> of the defence, and allowed security measures to grow lax: guards slept at their posts, and patrols were discontinued. This allowed four Isaurian soldiers to contact Totila, and on 17 December 546, the city was betrayed to the Goths. Bessas managed to escape with the greater part of the garrison, but the treasure that he had amassed was left behind for the Goths to enjoy. Following his dismal performance in Italy, Bessas was apparently recalled to Constantinople.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the elastic properties of CsH 2 PO 4 has been performed by Brillouin spectroscopy throughout a temperature range which includes the superionic transition at T_ S∼ 233 ^∘C.

5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> of affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide {{that there is a}} justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E
