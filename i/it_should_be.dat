Mahavira {{taught that}} every living being has {{sanctity}} and dignity {{of its own}} and <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> respected just as one expects one's own sanctity and dignity to be respected. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The concept applies to action, speech, and thought.|$|E

5|$|Although the Juno orbiter, which {{arrived at}} Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called JunoCam, {{it is almost}} entirely focused on {{observations}} of Jupiter itself.

5|$|At the Tehran Conference Winston Churchill {{made his}} famous remark that in wartime 'truth is so {{precious}} {{that she should}} always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.â€™ Clarke's principle was the opposite.

5|$|In September 2009, {{more than}} two years after the accident, CENIPA {{announced}} the results of official investigations.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} convergency is {{considered}} responsible for uniquely tetrapod features found also in other non-elpistostegalian {{fish from the}} period like Sauripterus (finger-like jointed distal radial bones) or Tarrasius (tetrapod-like spine with 5 axial regions).|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{noted that}} the figure above for Chongqing's Administrative Area {{includes}} the entire Municipality of Chongqing whereas the City Population only counts the urbanized districts making up Chongqing city.

5|$|Many early researchers, {{both before}} and after the {{periodic}} table was published, were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> easier to find than other undiscovered elements.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E

5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review.
