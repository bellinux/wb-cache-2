5|$|The nucleus {{provides}} {{a site for}} genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of <b>gene</b> <b>regulation</b> that are not available to prokaryotes. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of <b>gene</b> <b>regulation</b> is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of <b>gene</b> <b>regulation</b> or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A gene {{regulatory}} relation often {{changes over}} time rather than being constant. But many gene regulatory networks available in databases or literatures are static {{in the sense that}} they are either snapshots of gene regulatory relations at a time point or union of successive <b>gene</b> <b>regulations</b> over time. Such static networks cannot represent temporal aspects of gene regulatory interactions such as the order of <b>gene</b> <b>regulations</b> or the pace of <b>gene</b> <b>regulations.</b> Results We developed a new qualitative method for representing dynamic gene regulatory relations and algorithms for identifying dynamic <b>gene</b> <b>regulations</b> from the time-series gene expression data using two types of scores. The identified gene regulatory interactions and their temporal properties are visualized as a gene regulatory network. All the algorithms have been implemented in a program called GeneNetFinder ([URL]) and tested on several gene expression data. Conclusions The dynamic nature of dynamic gene regulatory interactions can be inferred and represented qualitatively without deriving a set of differential equations describing the interactions. The approach and the program developed in our study would be useful for identifying dynamic gene regulatory interactions from the large amount of gene expression data available and for analyzing the interactions. </p...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of <b>gene</b> <b>regulation</b> and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of <b>gene</b> <b>regulation</b> is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background It {{is one of}} the {{ultimate}} goals for modern biological research to fully elucidate the intricate interplays and the regulations of the molecular determinants that propel and characterize the progression of versatile life phenomena, to name a few, cell cycling, developmental biology, aging, and the progressive and recurrent pathogenesis of complex diseases. The vast amount of large-scale and genome-wide time-resolved data is becoming increasing available, which provides the golden opportunity to unravel the challenging reverse-engineering problem of time-delayed gene regulatory networks. Results In particular, this methodological paper aims to reconstruct regulatory networks from temporal gene expression data by using delayed correlations between genes, i. e., pairwise overlaps of expression levels shifted in time relative each other. We have thus developed a novel model-free computational toolbox termed TdGRN (Time-delayed Gene Regulatory Network) to address the underlying <b>regulations</b> of <b>genes</b> that can span any unit(s) of time intervals. This bioinformatics toolbox has provided a unified approach to uncovering time trends of <b>gene</b> <b>regulations</b> through decision analysis of the newly designed time-delayed gene expression matrix. We have applied the proposed method to yeast cell cycling and human HeLa cell cycling and have discovered most of the underlying time-delayed regulations that are supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence and that are remarkably consistent with the current knowledge on phase characteristics for the cell cyclings. Conclusion We established a usable and powerful model-free approach to dissecting high-order dynamic trends of gene-gene interactions. We have carefully validated the proposed algorithm by applying it to two publicly available cell cycling datasets. In addition to uncovering the time trends of <b>gene</b> <b>regulations</b> for cell cycling, this unified approach {{can also be used to}} study the complex <b>gene</b> <b>regulations</b> related to the development, aging and progressive pathogenesis of a complex disease where potential dependences between different experiment units might occurs. </p...|$|R

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed. Motivation: Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference based on genomic data {{is one of}} the most actively pursued computational biological problems. Because different types of biological data usu-ally provide complementary information regarding the underlying GRN, a model that integrates big data of diverse types is expected to increase both the power and accuracy of GRN inference. Towards this goal, we propose a novel algorithm named iRafNet: integrative random forest for gene regulatory network inference. Results: iRafNet is a flexible, unified integrative framework that allows information from heteroge-neous data, such as protein–protein interactions, transcription factor (TF) -DNA-binding, gene knock-down, to be jointly considered for GRN inference.
