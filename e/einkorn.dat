5|$|Agriculture was {{independently}} {{developed on}} the island of New Guinea. In Greece from c. 11,000 BC lentils, vetch, pistachios, and almonds were cultivated, while wild oats and wild barley appear in quantity from c. 7,000 BC alongside <b>einkorn</b> wheat, barley, sheep, goats and pigs, while emmer was used on Cyprus between 9,100 and 8,600 BC.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and <b>einkorn</b> wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with <b>einkorn,</b> emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild ass, wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation {{of wheat}} {{began to spread}} beyond the Fertile Crescent after about 8000BCE. Jared Diamond traces the spread of {{cultivated}} emmer wheat starting in the Fertile Crescent sometime before 8800 BCE. Archaeological analysis of wild emmer indicates that it was first cultivated in the southern Levant with finds dating {{back as far as}} 9600BCE. Genetic analysis of wild <b>einkorn</b> wheat suggests that it was first grown in the Karacadag Mountains in southeastern Turkey. Dated archeological remains of <b>einkorn</b> wheat in settlement sites near this region, including those at Abu Hureyra in Syria, suggest the domestication of <b>einkorn</b> near the Karacadag Mountain Range. With the anomalous exception of two grains from Iraq ed-Dubb, the earliest carbon-14 date for <b>einkorn</b> wheat remains at Abu Hureyra is 7800 to 7500 yearsBCE.|$|E
25|$|<b>Einkorn</b> wheat (T. monococcum) is diploid (AA, two {{complements}} {{of seven}} chromosomes, 2n=14).|$|E
25|$|<b>Einkorn</b> (T. monococcum)– A diploid {{species with}} wild and {{cultivated}} variants. Domesticated {{at the same}} time as emmer wheat.|$|E
25|$|The emmer and the <b>einkorn</b> were {{sometimes}} grown as maslin, or mixed crops. The lower-yield <b>einkorn</b> predominates over emmer, {{which has been}} attributed to its better resistance to heavy rain. Hemp (Cannabis sativum) and flax (Linum usitatissimum) gave the LBK people the raw material of rope and cloth, which they no doubt manufactured at home as a cottage industry. From poppies (Papaver somniferum), introduced later from the Mediterranean, they may have manufactured palliative medicine.|$|E
25|$|Along with <b>einkorn</b> wheat, emmer {{was one of}} {{the first}} crops domesticated in the Near East. It was widely {{cultivated}} in the ancient world, but is now a relict crop in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.|$|E
25|$|Wild emmer grows wild in the Near East. It is a {{tetraploid}} wheat {{formed by}} the hybridization of two diploid wild grasses, Triticum urartu, closely related to wild <b>einkorn</b> (T. boeoticum), and an as yet unidentified Aegilops species related to A. searsii or A. speltoides.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of Ötzi's {{intestinal}} contents showed two meals (the {{last one}} consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, {{the other of}} red deer and herb bread. Both were eaten with grain as well as roots and fruits. The grain from both meals was a highly processed <b>einkorn</b> wheat bran, quite possibly eaten {{in the form of}} bread. In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of <b>einkorn</b> and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plumlike fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild. Hair analysis was used to examine his diet from several months before.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>einkorn</b> and spelt wheats, emmer is a hulled wheat. In other words, it {{has strong}} glumes (husks) that enclose the grains, and a semibrittle rachis. On threshing, a hulled wheat spike breaks up into spikelets. These require milling or {{pounding}} {{to release the}} grains from the glumes.|$|E
25|$|Wild {{species of}} barley and emmer wheat were domesticated and {{cultivated}} in the Jordan River Valley {{as early as}} the 9th millennium BCE. Archaeologists have found the carbonized seeds of two kinds of primitive wheat, <b>einkorn</b> and emmer, and two-rowed barley, in the earliest levels of digs at Jericho, one of the first cities in the world.|$|E
25|$|Early Mehrgarh {{residents}} {{lived in}} mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, <b>einkorn</b> and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents {{of the later}} period (5500BCE to 2600BCE) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. Mehrgarh is probably the earliest known center of agriculture in South Asia.|$|E
25|$|Once {{agriculture}} started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, {{human activity}} {{resulted in the}} selective breeding of cereal grasses (beginning with emmer, <b>einkorn</b> and barley), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would {{have been seen as}} undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore not stored and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.|$|E
25|$|Pollen in {{the first}} meal showed {{that it had been}} {{consumed}} in a mid-altitude conifer forest, and other pollens indicated the presence of wheat and legumes, which may have been domesticated crops. Pollen grains of hop-hornbeam were also discovered. The pollen was very well preserved, with the cells inside remaining intact, indicating that it had been fresh (a few hours old) at the time of Ötzi's death, which places the event in the spring. <b>Einkorn</b> wheat is harvested in the late summer, and sloes in the autumn; these must have been stored from the previous year.|$|E
25|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that Neolithic material culture was introduced to Europe via western Anatolia, and that similarities in cultures of North Africa and the Pontic steppes are due to diffusion out of Europe. All Neolithic sites in Europe contain ceramics, and contain the plants and animals domesticated in Southwest Asia: <b>einkorn,</b> emmer, barley, lentils, pigs, goats, sheep, and cattle. Genetic data suggest that no independent domestication of animals took place in Neolithic Europe, and that all domesticated animals were originally domesticated in Southwest Asia. The only domesticate not from Southwest Asia was broomcorn millet, domesticated in East Asia. The earliest evidence of cheese-making dates to 5500 BCE in Kujawy, Poland.|$|E
25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including <b>einkorn</b> wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E
25|$|Phases IIIA and IIIB (9,300–8,600 BC) {{represent}} the Mureybetian, a subphase of the PPNA that {{was named after}} Mureybet and {{is found in the}} area of the Middle Euphrates. Architecture diversified, with rectangular, multi-cellular buildings appearing next to the round buildings that were already known from the previous phases. Walls were built from cigar-shaped stones that were created by percussion and that were covered with earth. Semi-subterranean structures also continued to be used and they are compared to similar structures found at nearby and contemporary Jerf el-Ahmar, where the structures are interpreted as special buildings with a communal function. Many rooms in the rectangular structures were so small that they could only have served for storage. Hearths and cooking pits lined with stones continued to be located in the outdoor areas. The wild varieties of barley, rye and <b>einkorn</b> were consumed in phase III. Different lines of evidence suggest that these cereals were cultivated rather than gathered. Hunting of equids and aurochs was more important than of gazelle, while fish remains were rare in phase III contexts. Based on use-wear analysis, it could also be established that animal hides were processed at the site using bone and stone tools. The earliest known writing for record keeping evolved from a system of counting using small clay tokens. The earliest use of small clay tokens for counting were found in phase III. It coincided with a period of explosive rapid growth of the use of cereals in the Near East.|$|E
500|$|Wild grains were {{collected}} and eaten {{from at least}} 20,000 BC. From around 9,500 BC, the eight Neolithic founder crops—emmer wheat, <b>einkorn</b> wheat, [...] hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas, and flax—were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC, followed by sheep between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs {{in the areas of}} modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 7,000 BC. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 5,000 BC. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 8,000 and 5,000 BC, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Bananas were cultivated and hybridized in the same period in Papua New Guinea. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 4,000 BC. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Emmer {{is found}} in {{a large number of}} Neolithic sites {{scattered}} around the fertile crescent. [...] From its earliest days of cultivation, emmer was a more prominent crop than its cereal contemporaries and competitors, <b>einkorn</b> wheat and barley. Small quantities of emmer are present during Period 1 at Mehrgharh on the Indian subcontinent, showing that emmer was already cultivated there by 7000-5000 BC.|$|E
2500|$|In northeastern Europe, emmer (in {{addition}} to <b>einkorn</b> and barley) {{was one of}} the most important cereal species and this importance can be seen to increase from 3400 BC onwards. Pliny the Elder, notes that although emmer was called far in his time formerly it was called adoreum (or [...] "glory"), providing an etymology explaining that emmer had been held in glory (N.H. 18.3), and later in the same book he describes its role in sacrifices.|$|E
2500|$|In the Near East, in {{southern}} Mesopotamia in particular, cultivation of emmer wheat {{began to decline}} in the Early Bronze Age, from about 3000 BC, and barley became the standard cereal crop. This has been related to increased salinization of irrigated alluvial soils, of which barley is more tolerant, although this study has been challenged. Emmer had {{a special place in}} ancient Egypt, where it was the main wheat cultivated in Pharaonic times, although cultivated <b>einkorn</b> wheat was grown in great abundance during the Third Dynasty, and large quantities of it were found preserved, along with cultivated emmer wheat and barleys, in the subterranean chambers beneath the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. Neighbouring countries also cultivated <b>einkorn,</b> durum and common wheat. In the absence of any obvious functional explanation, the greater prevalence of emmer wheat in the diet of ancient Egypt may simply reflect a marked culinary or cultural preference, or may reflect growing conditions having changed after the Third Dynasty. Emmer and barley were the primary ingredients in ancient Egyptian bread and beer. Emmer recovered from the Phoenician [...] settlement at Volubilis (in present-day Morocco) has been dated {{to the middle of the}} first millennium BC.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{agriculture}} {{is believed to}} have originated and become widespread in Southwest Asia around 10,000–9,000 BP, though earlier individual sites have been identified. The Fertile Crescent region of Southwest Asia is the centre of domestication for three cereals (<b>einkorn</b> wheat, emmer wheat and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea) and flax. The Mediterranean climate consists of a long dry season with a short period of rain, which may have favored small plants with large seeds, like wheat and barley. The Fertile Crescent also had a large area of varied geographical settings and altitudes and this variety may have made agriculture more profitable for former hunter-gatherers in this region in comparison with other areas with a similar climate [...]|$|E
2500|$|The four {{wild species}} of wheat, {{along with the}} domesticated {{varieties}} <b>einkorn,</b> emmer and spelt, have hulls. This more primitive morphology (in evolutionary terms) consists of toughened glumes that tightly enclose the grains, and (in domesticated wheats) a semi-brittle rachis that breaks easily on threshing. The result is that when threshed, the wheat ear breaks up into spikelets. To obtain the grain, further processing, such as milling or pounding, is needed to remove the hulls or husks. In contrast, in free-threshing (or naked) forms such as durum wheat and common wheat, the glumes are fragile and the rachis tough. On threshing, the chaff breaks up, releasing the grains. Hulled wheats are often stored as spikelets because the toughened glumes give good protection against pests of stored grain.|$|E
2500|$|Barley {{was one of}} {{the first}} domesticated grains in the Fertile Crescent, an area of {{relatively}} abundant water in Western Asia, and near the Nile river of northeast Africa. The grain appeared in the same time as <b>einkorn</b> and emmer wheat. [...] Wild barley (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) ranges from North Africa and Crete in the west, to Tibet in the east. [...] The earliest evidence of wild barley in an archaeological context comes from the Epipaleolithic at Ohalo II at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee. [...] The remains were dated to about 8500 BCE. [...] The earliest domesticated barley occurs at aceramic ("pre-pottery") Neolithic sites, in the Near East such as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B layers of Tell Abu Hureyra, in Syria. By 4200 BCE domesticated barley occurs as far as in Eastern Finland. Barley has been grown in the Korean Peninsula since the Early Mumun Pottery Period (circa 1500–850 BCE) along with other crops such as millet, wheat, and legumes.|$|E
2500|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 15,000 years ago. Rice was domesticated in China between 13,500 and 8,200 years ago, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer and <b>einkorn</b> wheat, [...] hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. [...] Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia at an unknown time. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago.|$|E
50|$|From the {{northern}} part of the Fertile Crescent, the cultivation of <b>einkorn</b> wheat spread to the Caucasus, the Balkans, and central Europe. <b>Einkorn</b> wheat was more commonly grown in cooler climates than emmer wheat, the other domesticated wheat. Cultivation of <b>einkorn</b> in the Middle East began to decline in favor of emmer wheat around 2000 BC. Cultivation of <b>einkorn</b> was never extensive in Italy, southern France, and Spain. <b>Einkorn</b> continued to be cultivated in some areas of northern Europe throughout the Middle Ages and until the early part of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|<b>Einkorn</b> wheat {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} cultivated forms of wheat, alongside emmer wheat (T. dicoccum). Grains of wild <b>einkorn</b> have been found in Epi-Paleolithic sites of the Fertile Crescent. Although gathered from the wild for thousands of years, <b>einkorn</b> Wheat was first domesticated approximately 10,000 years BP in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) or B (PPNB) periods. Evidence from DNA finger-printing suggests <b>einkorn</b> was first domesticated near Karaca Dağ in southeast Turkey, an area in which a number of PPNB farming villages have been found.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Einkorn</b> wheat (from German <b>Einkorn,</b> {{literally}} [...] "single grain") {{can refer}} {{either to the}} wild species of wheat, Triticum boeoticum, or to the domesticated form, Triticum monococcum. The wild and domesticated forms are either considered separate species, as here, or as subspecies: Triticum monococcum subsp. boeoticum (wild) and T. monococcum subsp. monococcum (domesticated). <b>Einkorn</b> is a diploid species (2n = 14 chromosomes) of hulled wheat, with tough glumes ('husks') that tightly enclose the grains. The cultivated form {{is similar to the}} wild, except that the ear stays intact when ripe and the seeds are larger. The domestic form is known as petit épeautre in French, <b>Einkorn</b> in German, <b>einkorn</b> or littlespelt in English, piccolo farro in Italian and escanda menor in Spanish.|$|E
