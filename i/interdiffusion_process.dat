It is a poor conductor and can cause electrical failure of the joint {{that can lead to}} mechanical failure. At lower temperatures, about 400 - 450°C, an <b>interdiffusion</b> <b>process</b> takes place at the junction. This leads to formation of layers of several intermetallic compounds with different compositions, from gold-rich to aluminium-rich, with different growth rates. Cavities form as the denser, faster-growing layers consume the slower-growing ones. This process, known as Kirkendall voiding, leads to both increased electrical resistance and mechanical weakening of the wire bond. When the voids are collected along the diffusion front, a process aided by contaminants present in the lattice, it is known as Horsting voiding, a process similar to and often confused with Kirkendall voiding.|$|E

The influence of the cap layer hickness, composition, and deposition technique on the degree of interdiffusion were all systematically investigated. Electron-beam evaporated SiO 2 films of varying thickness, chemical-vapor-deposited SiOxNy films of varying composition, and spin-on SiO 2 films were used as cap layers during rapid thermal annealing (850 - 950 degree). Photoluminescence at 10 K has been employed to determine the interdiffusion-induced bandgap shifts and to calculate the corresponding Al-Ga and In-Ga interdiffusion coefficients. The latter were found to increase with the cap layer thickness (e-beam SiO 2) up to a limit determined by saturation of the outdiffused Ga concentration in the SiO 2 caps. A maximum concentration of [Ga] = 4 - 7 x 10 (19) ccm in the Si 02 caps was determined using secondary ion mass spectroscopy profiling. Larger band-edge shifts are also obtained when the oxygen content of SiOx Ny cap layers is increased, although the differences are not sufficiently large for a laterally selective <b>interdiffusion</b> <b>process</b> based on variations in cap layer composition alone. Much larger differences are obtained by using different deposition techniques for the cap layers, indicating that the porosity of the cap layer is a much more important parameter than the film composition for the realization of a laterally selective <b>interdiffusion</b> <b>process.</b> For the calculated In 0. 2 Ga 0. 8 As/GaAs interdiffusion coefficients, activation energies EA and prefactors D 0 were estimated to ranging from 3. 04 to 4. 74 eV and 5 x 10 (3) to 2 x 10 (5) square centimeter/s, respectively, dependent on the cap layer deposition technique and the depth of the MQW from the sample surface...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a quantitative study of intermixing in GaAs/AlGaAs and ZnSe/ZnCdSe single quantum well semiconductor structures. In this study, a method of iterative isothermal anneals and photoluminescence used to characterize this phenomenon has enabled {{the evolution of the}} diffusion coefficients for the <b>interdiffusion</b> <b>process</b> with anneal time to be followed. The blue-shift emissions arising from this method are predicted by a model based on Fick's law of diffusion. This model is developed in an attempt to relate the energy shift that is observed experimentally to the diffusion length. The mixing is modelled using an error function expression to solve the diffusion equation so as to describe the variation in well shape which is attributed to compositional disordering induced during thermal processing. Using this approach, where evidence of intermixing was monitored, the emission would be expected to shift measurably. Data has been taken to cover a wide temperature range to establish values for the activation energy EA. From this data, it has been found that the diffusion coefficients at various temperatures are thermally activated with an energy of 3. 6 +/- 0. 2 eV in GaAs/AlGaAs. The data is compared with the available literature data taken under a wide range of experimental conditions. We show that despite the range of activation energies quoted in the literature all the data appears to be consistent with a single activation energy. Departures from the 'mean' value are ascribed to experimental uncertainties in determining the diffusion coefficients for example, to fluctuations in the composition of the material, to techniques used, or {{to a wide range of}} perturbations. Photoluminescence observations on ZnSe/ZnCdSe show that an improvement in the optical quality of these quantum well structures was found for anneals at temperatures (~ 500 °C). A value of EA = 2. 9 +/- 0. 3 eV was derived from the experiments for the <b>interdiffusion</b> <b>process</b> over a 250 K temperature range and four decades of interdiffusion coefficient.
