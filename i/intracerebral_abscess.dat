40|$|The {{operative}} {{management of}} <b>intracerebral</b> <b>abscesses</b> remains controversial, with both primary radical excision and repeated aspiration having their advocates. This paper describes a surgical technique which combines the advantages while avoiding the disadvantages {{of the two}} surgical approaches. At open operation the abscess is widely incised, all pus removed from within the capsule and any daughter loculi under direct vision and the empty capsule irrigated with antibiotic solution before closure of the wound without drainage. Fifteen cases were treated by this method. There were no deaths, 13 patients made full neurological recoveries and two were left partially disabled. In only one case was a second operation necessary to remove pus which had re-formed after an adequate primary clearance. There were no cases of wound sepsis or of late recurrence of the abscess...|$|R
40|$|Rhodococcus equi is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} opportunistic pathogen in solid organ transplant recipients. Primary pulmonary involvement {{is the most common}} finding. We report a case of a 42 -year-old female kidney transplant recipient who developed multiple disseminated abscesses caused by R. equi while on adequate antimicrobial therapy. The patient presented with subcutaneous abscesses in the hip region and mamma and had 2 <b>intracerebral</b> <b>abscesses.</b> There were no clinical and radiologic signs of pulmonary involvement in contrast to most clinical cases described in the literature. R. equi was cultured from all abscesses. The patient died of progressive neurologic complications. Post mortem examination confirmed infection with R. equi and showed microscopic evidence of necrotizing pneumonia. This report shows that R. equi should be considered as a cause of infection in solid organ transplant recipients even without initial clinical and radiologic signs of pulmonary involvement. Despite adequate therapy, the outcome can be fatal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{determine}} predicting {{factors for}} repeated surgical drainage {{in patients with}} <b>intracerebral</b> brain <b>abscesses.</b> METHODS: Patients operated between 01 / 2008 and 10 / 2013 with a single-burr-hole technique to drain an <b>intracerebral</b> brain <b>abscess</b> were included from our prospective database. Clinical and radiological characteristics were analyzed retrospectively and compared between patients requiring a single surgical abscess drainage (S group) vs. patients requiring multiple surgical abscess aspirations (M group). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean age 42. 6 years, 14 females) including 27 patients in the S group and 8 in the M group were included in this study. Age, gender, causing bacterial agent, surgical technique and abscess volume were comparable for both groups. Preoperative mean C-reactive protein (CRP) (13. 9 mg/l vs. 56. 1 mg/l, p= 0. 015) was significantly higher in the M group. Preoperative mean leukocyte count (12. 3 × 109 /l vs. 8. 9 × 109 /l, p= 0. 050) was borderline significantly higher in the M group.

40|$|Summary: Previous {{findings}} {{have demonstrated the}} diag-nostic usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging in depict-ing specific features of a brain abscess. We report {{a case of a}} cerebral abscess, which ruptured into the ventricular system, including its findings on both diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Purulent material within the left lateral ventricle, {{similar to that of the}} central abscess cavity, was strongly hyperin-tense on diffusion-weighted images. However, variable sig-nal intensity changes were observed on the ADC map; these probably corresponded to regional variation of the concen-tration of protein in the purulent material. In this case, both diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps were im-portant and complementary in the evaluation of ventricular extension of an <b>intracerebral</b> <b>abscess...</b>|$|E

40|$|Black molds or dematiaceous fungi {{are rare}} {{etiologic}} agents of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>abscesses</b> and such infections carry a high mortality {{of up to}} 70 % despite combined surgical and antifungal therapy. While the growing use of immunosuppressive therapies and organ transplantation have caused {{an increase in the}} incidence of rare fungal cerebral infections, occurrence in immunocompetent hosts is also possible. We describe a 60 -year-old female patient with a cerebral abscess caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. The case illustrates the clinical and radiological similarities between glioblastomas and brain abscesses and emphasizes the need to perform histological and microbiological studies prior to the initiation of any form of therapy. Long-term survival from cerebral black mold abscesses has been reported only when complete surgical resection was possible. The recommended antifungal treatment involves the use of amphotericin B combined with a triazole and, if possible, flucytosine. Highly-active new generation triazole antifungal compounds (voriconazole or posaconazole) are likely to offer improved survival rates for patients with rare mold infections. In particular, posaconazole could be a new therapeutic option given its better tolerance, lower toxicity and fewer drug-drug interactions. We discuss clinical, microbiological and practical pharmacological aspects and review current and evolving treatment option...|$|R
40|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{aspergillosis}} is an often fatal complication of invasive Aspergillus infection. Relevant disease models {{are needed to}} study the pathophysiology of cerebral aspergillosis and to develop novel therapeutic approaches. This study presents a model of central nervous system aspergillosis that mimics important aspects of human disease. Eleven-day-old non-immunosuppressed male Wistar rats were infected by an intracisternal injection of 10 mul of a conidial suspension of Aspergillus fumigatus. An inoculum of 7. 18 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU) consistently produced cerebral infection and resulted in death of all animals (n = 25) within 3 - 10 days. Median survival time was 3 days. Histomorphologically, all animals developed <b>intracerebral</b> <b>abscesses</b> (2 - 26 per brain) containing abundant fungal hyphae and neutrophils. Fungal culture of cortical homogenates yielded maximal growth on day 3 after infection (5. 4 log(10) CFU/g, n = 15) that declined over time. Galactomannan concentrations in cortical homogenates, assessed as an index for hyphal burden, peaked on days 3 - 5. Fungal infection spread to peripheral organs in 83 % of animals. Fungal burden in lung, liver, spleen and kidney was two orders of magnitude lower than in the brain. The successful establishment of a model of cerebral aspergillosis in a non-immunosuppressed host provides the opportunity to investigate mechanisms of disease and to develop novel treatment regimens for this commonly fatal infection...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral abscesses {{are rare}} but often lethal {{complications}} of invasive Aspergillus sinusitis.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} the structural findings in brain sonography of African infants with complicated sporadic bacterial meningitis. Materials and Methods: Retrospective assessment of medical records {{of patients who}} underwent brain sonography on account of complicated bacterial meningitis. The brain sonography was carried out over a 4 -year period (between September 15, 2004 and September 14, 2008). Result : A total of 86 infants were studied (40 boys and 46 girls in a ratio of 1 : 1. 1); more than 70 % of the patients were aged below 6 months. Presenting complaint included convulsion with fever in 34 (39. 53 %), persistent fever 20 (23. 26 %), bulging fontanelles 8 (9. 30 %), coma 7 (8. 14 %) and sepsis with convulsion 6 (6. 98 %), among others. Patients′ place of previous treatment included specialist hospitals 33 (38. 37 %), private hospitals 21 (24. 42 %), herbal home centres 12 (13. 95 %), nursing homes 8 (9. 30 %), patent medicine stores 7 (8. 14 %) and other non-doctor attended clinics 5 (5. 81 %) infants. The sonographic findings included hydrocephalus 36 (41. 86 %), cerebral infarction 12 (13. 95 %), encephalocoele 9 (10. 49 %) and <b>intracerebral</b> <b>abscess</b> 7 (8. 14 %) infants.

40|$|Bacterial infections of {{the central}} nervous system present as a medical emergency, thus {{requiring}} rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment. The most prevalent bacterial infections seen {{in the intensive care unit}} can be summarized as acute bacterial meningitis, subdural empyema, <b>intracerebral</b> <b>abscess,</b> and ventriculitis, which all commonly involve the brain parenchyma. The infections can either be community-acquired or hospital-acquired, e. g., after neurosurgical intervention, as a complication of severe neurotrauma or related to indwelling cerebrospinal fluid drains. Community-acquired bacterial meningitis is most commonly caused by the pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and meningococcus (Neisseria meningtidis), and is often complicated by hearing loss, cerebrovascular complications, and seizures. Brain abscesses are frequently associated with contiguous or metastatic foci of infection such as otitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, or endocarditis which need to be detected and treated early during disease course. Despite optimal treatment, many patients are at risk for both major systemic and neurologic complications, leading to a substantial mortality and risk of major disability in survivors. Empiric treatment depends on regional antibiotic resistance patterns of common pathogens. For subdural empyema and brain abscesses, neurosurgical drainage of the infection is required alongside prolonged antibiotic treatmen...|$|E

Stereotactic aspiration and subsequent matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight analyzer (MALDI-TOF) spectrometry revealed Porphyromonas gingivalis as the only causative anaerobe microorganism. Secondary incision and drainage was required due to neurological deterioration with increased dimensions of the abscess, intracranial pressure and formation of a subdural occipitoparietal empyema. Oral imaging was positive for apical periodontitis of multiple elements; therefore, the remaining dentition was removed. Targeted antibiotic treatment included intravenous ceftriaxone and ornidazole.

This small number does not allow any conclusion for this subgroup. It should be noted that patients having infective endocarditis, bone and joint infection, acute mediastinitis, <b>intracerebral</b> or intra-abdominal <b>abscess</b> were excluded from the above studies.

40|$|Background: The {{frontal lobe}} {{is the second}} most common {{location}} for brain abscess after the temporal lobe. Since the advent of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanning, diagnosis has become easier, but the prognosis of brain abscess is still poor. Treatment is based on antimicrobial therapy and neurosurgical evacuation, but controversy still remains as to the merits place of each. Methods: This study describes 2 cases of patients with frontal abscesses treated by endonasal transethmoidal sinus surgery (ESS) and reviews the literature on this topic. Results: Follow-up revealed no cerebrospinal fluid leak in both patients, complete abscess drainage in one patient, and incomplete drainage in the other. Conclusions: ESS drainage of frontal abscesses is feasible in <b>intracerebral</b> and epidural <b>abscesses</b> if they have a thick shell and are in contact with the skull base.
