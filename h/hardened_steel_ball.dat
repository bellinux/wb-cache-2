Targets in a flexural configuration with two different sizes (thicknesses) of 1 and 2 mm were ballistic-impacted under a fully supported condition. The severity of impact damage, {{as well as the}} degree of post-impact strength degradation, increased with increasing impact velocity, increased with decreasing target size, and was greater in SN 282 than in AS 800 silicon nitride. The critical impact velocity where targets fractured catastrophically decreased with decreasing target size and was lower in SN 282 than in AS 800.

40|$|Collapsible {{steering}} column designs are credited with saving tens-of-thousands of lives since their introduction {{in the late}} 1960 `s. The collapsible {{steering column}} is a safety feature designed to absorb energy and protect-the driver in a head-on collision. One {{of the most frequently}} used design concepts employs two telescoping metal tubes that slide over one another as the occupant impacts the steering wheel. <b>Hardened</b> <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> bearings are embedded in a plastic sleeve located between the two tubes. There are two primary mechanisms for energy absorption during steering column collapse. One is the friction between the bearing and tube surfaces.

In this paper we will present an overview of a parallel finite element code, currently under development, {{that can be used to}} simulate the highly nonlinear response of this energy absorbing mechanism. Our parallel algorithms are constructed on a message-passing foundation. The actual message-passing implementation used was the Argonne-developed p 4 package.

Once the algorithm is restructured as a set of processes communicating through messages, the program can run on systems as diverse as a uniprocessor workstation, multiprocessors with and without shared memory, a group of workstations that communicate over a local network, or any combination of the above.

40|$|Fibre-reinforced {{composite}} materials are increasingly used in airframes and {{the tendency is}} to built the main fuselage in Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). In general CFRP has a wide application in light-weight structural members, because it {{is characterized by a}} high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratio, but it is vulnerable to damage caused by transverse loads, such as those arising from indentation and impact loading. One of the main reasons that inhibits more widespread applications of {{composite materials}} is their lack of resistance to low velocity and low energy impact damage[1 - 3], particularly in the case of thermoset matrix like epoxy, while the probability of such loadings occurring during the manufacture, service or maintenance of composite structures is very high [4] The research dealt with the correlation between damage and tensile residual strength in quasi-isotropic carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin laminate loaded at the centre. Load was applied by means of a servo hydraulic machine and it was supposed to simulate a low velocity impact. The Acoustic Emission (AE) technique was used to detect damage progression. Tensile resistance after indentation was investigated and correlated with acoustic emissions parameters. This was been done for different lamination sequences on specimens cut from the damaged plates and for two different damage levels, one corresponding to the first load drop in the load-displacement curve[5] and to the complete perforation of the plate.

The wear tests were carried out by using a ball-on-flat geometry at a translation frequency of 8 Hz and slip amplitude of 100 mum. Friction force was recorded on line during the tests. At the end of the tests, the wear scars were examined by laser surface profilometry, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. It has been observed that the frictional and wear mechanisms are very different for copper, nickel and Cu/Ni multilayers. Fretting of copper creates a relatively smooth wear scar mainly by mechanical ploughing of the asperities on steel counterbody (abrasive wear) and shows a very little third body interaction. Fretting of nickel involves adhesive wear resulting in a large transfer of steel to nickel, which is attributed to the strong chemical interaction between nickel and the steel counterbody. Fretting on multilayers involves a strong third body interaction resulting in ploughing mainly by debris (abrasive wear). The coefficient of friction is approximately 0. 45 for copper, and approximately 0. 8 for nickel as well as for multilayers. The values of the coefficient of friction for nickel and Cu/Ni multilayers found under the present fretting conditions are approximately double the corresponding values reported earlier for sliding wear conditions. It has been found that Cu/Ni multilayer is more resistance to fretting wear than the constituents, copper and nickel. Furthermore, the fretting wear resistance of Cu/Ni multilayers with 5 nm thick sublayer is better than that of the multilayers with 10 nm thick sublayers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

HPPGDP produced high ionization of both Ar and N 2 in the plasma that corresponded to dense ion bombardment on the biased steel samples to induce effective plasma surface heating and to form high nitrogen concentration on the biased steel surfaces, and therefore fast nitriding (> 10 µm/hour) was achieved.

The results showed that it is possible to obtain calcium doped lanthanum manganite by mechano-synthesis, using a weight ratio of ball to powder of 12 : 1, after 3 h of milling. The evolution of the phase transformation during the milling time is reported. Increases in milling time produce exponential decrease in the particle size, up to 680 nm after I la of milling. After the milling process it is obtained a powder compound with an orthorhombic structure (S. G. Pbnm). A prolonged milling time (> 9 h) produce an important reduction in the particle size but this is accompanied with a high iron contamination caused by metallic residues originated from vial and balls and also, after 9 It of milling time, it was found an important distortion in orthorhombic structure, obtaining two types of parameters.

40|$|Applying {{cutting fluid}} in a {{metal-cutting}} process {{can reduce the}} rate of tool wear and improve surface quality. However, cutting fluid has negative effects on the working environment {{and the use of}} cutting fluid also increases the total production cost. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} reduce the use of cutting fluid during machining. To serve that purpose, a minimal-cutting-fluid technique was studied. In the present work the cutting fluid was applied in a form of a high-velocity, narrow, pulsed jet at a rate of 2 ml/min. The performance of machining with pulsed-jet application was studied in high-speed milling of <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> compared to dry machining and machining with flood application. The results clearly show that compared to dry machining and machining with flood application, machining with pulsed-jet application lowers cutting forces, reduces tool wear, increases tool life, and improves surface roughness, especially when machining with high cutting velocity. Moreover. the amount of cutting fluid consumed at the rate of 2 ml/min is a drastic reduction compared to flood application. Also, no harmful oil mist is generated during the pulsed-jet application. In conclusion, the pulsed-jet application can be applied to milling process of <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> using <b>ball</b> end mills; it reduces the negative effects to the environment, improves machining performances, and consequently reduces total production cost.

A commercial high-energy ball mill (ZOZ GmbH, Simoloyer) {{was used for the}} mechanical alloying with elemental powders of Si (99.99 %), Fe (99.9 %), and Mn (99.9 %) in the stoichiometric of 80 : 18 : 2  wt%, respectively, as the starting materials. The powders were loaded into the machine’s <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> chamber with <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> of 4.7  mm diameter for milling. The milling cycle was characterized by a time interval of 45  s at 12  m s− 1 (circumferential velocity), followed by 15  s at 8  m s− 1 for 12  h and was fully carried out under super-high-purity argon atmosphere. The mass ratio of milling ball-to-powder materials was maintained as 20 to 1. The electrode slurry {{was prepared}} by first mixing 0.025  g of ketjen black (KB) and 1.35  g of polyamide-Imide (PAI) binder solution (14.8 % binder and balance deionized water solution from Aekyung Chemical Co., LTD) in 2.6  g of deionized water for 4  h or more using magnetic stirrer at 100 RPM on a hot plate at 25  °C. KB was used as a conductive filler additive, and PAI binder was chosen because of their high carboxylic groups which are known to form strong bonds with metal surfaces and maintain good electrical contacts between the electrode particles [12, 28]. Active material was prepared by making a blend of the Si/alloy sample powder (40 %) with MC 20 (Mitsubishi Corp.—Synthetic Graphite) and SFG 6 graphite (TIMCAL TIMREX®—Synthetic Graphite) in the ratio of 42 and 18 %, respectively. Active material blend (0.945  g) was then mixed in the KB-PAI binder solution slurry using ACE NISSEI homogenizer at 5000 RPM for 15  min. MC 20 (0.93  g) and SFG 6 (0.4  g) artificial graphite were added in sequence to the slurry solution with each step mixed at 5000 RPM for 10  min. The final contents were mixed using a spatula, and again a final mixing was performed using the ACE NISSEI homogenizer at 5000 RPM for 15 – 30  min to get the homogenous electrode slurry. The order of materials for slurry making was decided based on {{the size and shape of}} the material components for homogeneous and good quality electrodes. The electrode preparation composition in total included Si/alloy (15.1  wt%), MC 20 (53.1  wt%), SFG 6 (22.8  wt%), PAI binder (8  wt%), and KB (1  wt%). The overall solid content used was around 40 %. The resultant slurry was poured onto a Cu-foil, and doctor blade with thickness set to (0.15  ±  0.01  mm) was run at 1.2 speed unit of CV- 400 Rotech Lab Coater to get a final active material loading of ~ 2  mg cm− 2. The electrodes were put for drying in a vacuum oven at 110  °C for 10  h. The electrodes after drying were punched into 14 -mm disks.|$|R
