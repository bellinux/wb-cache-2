When Sky {{finds out that}} Lana is planning {{to have sex with}} Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called Freak Girl and The Enigma and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are not right for each other.|$|E

25|$|The energy {{eigenvalues}} {{from this}} equation form a discrete spectrum of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis – any wavefunction may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally {{as an integral}} over a measure. This is the spectral theorem in mathematics, and in a finite state space <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix.|$|E

For example, {{it is very difficult to}} know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending.|$|E
25|$|The raised ranch is {{a two-story}} house, {{in which a}} {{finished}} basement serves as an additional floor.

25|$|The {{additions}} method seem to {{be taught}} in two variations, which differ only in psychology. Continuing the example of , the first variation attempts to subtract 9 from 6, and then 9 from 16, borrowing a 10 by marking near the digit of the subtrahend in the next column. The second variation attempts to find a digit which, when added to 9, gives 6, and recognizing that is not possible, gives 16, and carrying the 10 of the 16 as a one marking near the same digit as in the first method. The markings are the same; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> matter of preference as to how one explains its appearance.|$|E
25|$|This m6A {{modification}} has {{a notable}} effect on translational dynamics. As expected, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> modified adenosine base, m6A base-pairs with uridine during decoding. However, the adenosine’s methylation hinders tRNA accommodation and translation elongation. When an m6A-modified codon interacts with its cognate tRNA, it acts {{more like a}} near-cognate codon interaction instead of the cognate codon interaction. This {{can be seen in}} that the delay in the tRNA accommodation, which is dependent upon both the position of the m6A in the mRNA codons and on how accurate the translation is. To summarize, translation-elongation dynamics are slower for codons with m6A and different locations of these modified nucleotides in the mRNA codons affect decoding dynamics in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Narita-san {{has been}} a {{favorite}} site for excursions and pilgrimages by citizens of the nearby metropolitan area ever since the Tokugawa shoguns moved the national capital to Edo in 1603. After nearby Narita International Airport became the primary international hub for Japanese air traffic in the late 1970s, Narita-san also began to attract increasing numbers of foreign tourists, especially {{those who have a}} long layovers in transit. The airport is just a short train ride from either JR East Narita Station or Keisei Narita Station. From each station, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> short walk to the temple, along picturesque streets with many small shops selling snacks and other foodstuffs, as well as good-luck charms and other souvenirs, such as Daruma dolls.|$|E

25|$|Mammals are a clade, and {{therefore}} the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> section of the clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined {{by a combination of}} the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.|$|E
25|$|A {{deterministic}} Turing {{machine is}} the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem {{in any of these}} branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see non-deterministic algorithm.|$|E
25|$|Spuhler's {{hypothesis}} is a stand-alone hypothesis of extended female sexuality. Spuhler suggests that extended female sexuality has evolved as {{a by-product of}} an adaptation in females that increases the levels of adrenal hormones. He proposed that secretion of higher levels of adrenal hormones were initially selected in women {{in order to increase}} endurance for walking or running. This hypothesis suggests that the larger adrenal glands {{may have contributed to the}} development of extended female sexuality as they are also the main source of 'libido hormones', which increase the female's sexual drive. Thus, extended sexuality is little to do with sexual behavior, or evolutionary advantage, but rather <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> by-product of hormones. However, this hypothesis cannot account for extended female sexuality in invertebrates, which lack adrenal systems. Additionally Spuhler highlighted the existence of larger thyroid and adrenal glands in humans compared to other primates. However, no empirical evidence has established the link between hormones and endurance walking as an adaptation and extended female sexuality as a natural incidental effect. As there are costs to extended sexuality, it can be argued that selection would serve the dissociation of extended sexuality from the mechanism that affects endurance walking.|$|E
