5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL {{is the only one}} of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner.</b> Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E

[...] Mark Evans of the Evening Herald wrote: [...] "'The Last Temptation of Krust' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> for its title alone as Krusty the clown becomes a satiric 'alternative' comedian but then sells out by advertising the Canyonero SUV road hazard." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote positively of the episode in The Star-Ledger, citing the Canyonero sequence as [...] "the real reason to watch" [...] the episode and that [...] "It's an oversize vehicle that will create oversized laughs."

Another reviewer from IANS called the film [...] "senseless yet entertaining" [...] and stated [...] "Mahesh's dashing {{performance as a}} mafia kingpin with a hidden personal agenda is commendable and deserves high appreciation. Businessman may be perverse and appeal only to the masses, yet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> for unexplainable reasons." [...] Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and opined that Businessman was an entertaining film if watched uncritically. She added [...] "There's no doubt that Puri Jagan has played to the gallery and kept the masses and Mahesh's image in mind while conceiving this film. It's just Mahesh all the way." ...|$|E

[...] Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols found that [...] "her souffle of hip-hop, soul, R, funk and dance music falls a bit flat". Rolling Stones Brian Hiatt called The Cookbook Elliott's [...] "least cohesive, most {{conventional}} album yet." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watson viewed that [...] "she's clearly lost without Timbaland", calling him [...] "the main ingredient of her original flavor". Steve Horowitz of PopMatters noted that it [...] "does have a few duds" [...] and found some of the [...] "offensive lyrics" [...] as flaws, but wrote that [...] "While not every cut <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner,</b> Elliott does a fairly consistent job of gaining the listener's attention through her outrageous lyrics and performance style".|$|E

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of}} the biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being dazzled by the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film.

500|$|Urlacher dislocated {{his wrist}} in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He {{underwent}} surgery, {{and went on}} to miss the remainder of the season.

Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner,</b> and that formula worked for us. I hate to say it, but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E

[...] The Times of India also rated it four out of five: [...] "It introduces the most outrageous scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages {{to get away with it}} because it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana [...] "can make you laugh out loud and also strike an emotional chord." [...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music." [...] For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: [...] "Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer".|$|E

500|$|Rachel Saltz of The New York Times reviewed, [...] "The {{pleasure}} {{principle is}} palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying {{example of the}} new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. It may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs." [...] Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, [...] "Dhoom 2 has all {{of the benefits of}} a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse." [...] L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, [...] "A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make you feel that nothing else matters." [...] Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing [...] "By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin {{to take care of the}} thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial." [...] Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, [...] "With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> all the way at the box office!" ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for GamePro, Captain Squideo called Destruction Derby [...] "the most raucous racing {{experience}} of the fall". He believed that its [...] "graphics are almost all you could want for a game" [...] of this type, but wrote that [...] "nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, [...] "Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun." [...] Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that [...] "the beauty of the game" [...] is the strategy involved in making [...] "calculated strikes" [...] against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, [...] "If you go all {{out and try to}} make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds." [...] He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode [...] "is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were [...] "most fun to be had" [...] in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, [...] "Destruction Derby <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> in every capacity." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably [...] "lacking" [...] but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.|$|E
