5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, human water use {{has more than}} doubled and {{affected}} streamflow over various regions of the world. However, it remains unclear to what degree <b>human</b> water <b>consumption</b> intensifies hydrological drought (the occurrence of anomalously low streamflow). Here, we quantify over the period 1960 – 2010 the impact of <b>human</b> water <b>consumption</b> on the intensity and frequency of hydrological drought worldwide. The results show that <b>human</b> water <b>consumption</b> substantially reduced local and downstream streamflow over Europe, North America and Asia, and subsequently intensified the magnitude of hydrological droughts by 10 – 500 %, occurring during nation- and continent-wide drought events. Also, <b>human</b> water <b>consumption</b> alone increased global drought frequency by 27 (± 6) %. The intensification of drought frequency is most severe over Asia (35 ± 7 %), but also substantial over North America (25 ± 6 %) and Europe (20 ± 5 %). Importantly, the severe drought conditions are driven primarily by <b>human</b> water <b>consumption</b> over many parts of these regions. Irrigation is responsible for the intensification of hydrological droughts over the western and central US, southern Europe and Asia, whereas the impact of industrial and households’ consumption on the intensification is considerably larger over the eastern US and western and central Europe. Our findings reveal that <b>human</b> water <b>consumption</b> {{is one of the more}} important mechanisms intensifying hydrological drought, and is likely to remain as a major factor affecting drought intensity and frequency in the coming decades...|$|R
