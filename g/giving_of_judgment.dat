The poor anxious watchers below could only guess by the gestures what was being agitated as to their fate, and Stephen was feeling it sorely hard that Giles should be pleaded for as the master's kinsman, and he left to so cruel a fate, no one saying a word for him but unheeded Lucas. Finally, without <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> the whole of the miserable prisoners, who had been standing without food for hours, were marched back, still tied, to their several prisons, while their guards pointed out the gibbets where they were to suffer the next day.|$|E

[...] Determining whether reasons for judgment are adequate is a contextual exercise that may call for different information or depth of reasoning based on the circumstances of the case. In general, Canadian courts are expected to provide reasons for judgment as a duty to the public at large, to demonstrate that the judge or judges have engaged with the parties' pleadings, to explain why the parties won or lost, and to allow for meaningful appellate review (in the event that the case may be appealed).|$|R

Sittings for the {{purposes}} <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> <b>judgment</b> were normally held at two o'clock on Thursday afternoons; non-judicial matters were not dealt with during these sittings. Only the Law Lords {{who served on the}} Appellate Committee spoke, but other Lords were free to attend, although they rarely did so. After all five members of the Committee had spoken, the question was put to the House: [...] "That the report from the Appellate Committee be agreed to." [...] The House then voted on that question and on other questions related thereto; the decisions on these questions constituted the House's formal judgment.|$|R

Ash fusibility of coal was divided into three levels according to softening temperature.

50|$|Sir John Jervis CJ, for the Court of Exchequer Chamber {{ruled that}} the bond was valid, so the Royal British Bank could enforce the terms. He said the bank was deemed {{to be aware that}} the {{directors}} could borrow only up to the amount resolutions allowed. Articles of association were registered with Companies House, so there was constructive notice. But the bank could not be deemed to know which ordinary resolutions passed, because these were not registrable. The bond was valid because there was no requirement to look into the company's internal workings. This is the indoor management rule, that the company's indoor affairs are the company's problem.

40|$|Statistical {{methods are}} used to some extent in {{virtually}} all areas of science, technology, public affairs, and private enterprise. The variety of applications makes any single unifying discussion difficult if not impossible. We concentrate {{on the role of}} statistics in research in the natural and social sciences and the associated technologies. Our aim is to give a relatively nontechnical discussion of some of the conceptual issues involved and to bring out some connections with general epistemological problems of statistical inference in science. In {{the first part of this}} chapter (7 (I)), we considered how frequentist statistics may serve as an account of inductive inference, but because this depends on being able to apply its methods to appropriately circumscribed contexts, we need to address some of the problems in obtaining the methods with the properties we wish them to have. <b>Given</b> the variety <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> and background information this requires, it may be questioned whether any account of inductive learning can succeed in being “objective. ” However, statistical methods do, we think, promote th...|$|R
40|$|The review essay {{discusses}} Wayne Martin’s Theories <b>of</b> <b>Judgment,</b> {{which claims}} that theories <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> confront the difficulty that its object belongs to three distinct sciences: logic, psychology, and phenomenology. The essay denies {{that there is}} such a thing as a phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> as judgment is not an object of experience, but an act of spontaneity. Moreover, it suggests a more radical reading of Kant than the one proposed by Martin: Kant was right to identify the unity of the content <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> with the force <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> which entails that the subject matter of logic, insofar as it treats of relations <b>of</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> and psychology, insofar as it treats <b>of</b> acts <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> is the same...|$|R

5000|$|Mr Justice Hobhouse <b>gave</b> the <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> the Court. He held that, whilst an {{interest}} rate swap contract had (at least potentially) a speculative character, where the interest rate swaps entered into by parties or institutions involved in the capital markets and/or the making and receiving of loans, the normal inference was that such contracts were not wagering or gaming. That inference would only be rebutted if the purpose and interest of both parties to the transaction was to wager, {{in which case the}} contracts would be legally invalid and unenforceable. [...] He further held that in any event the transactions would have been validated by section 63 of the Financial Services Act 1986. Having made those findings, he declined to answer the third issue as irrelevant.|$|R
50|$|Lord Hope, Lord Walker, Lord Collins, Lord Clarke and Lord Wilson, on appeal, {{unanimously}} {{held that}} the car valeters were engaged under contracts of employment and this was not affected by the clauses which stated that they were self-employed, had no obligation to work, no right to receive work, and could substitute another worker. Lord Clarke, <b>giving</b> the <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> the court, emphasised that a contract of employment was a specific kind of contract, not to be treated the same as commercial contracts, because {{there may be an}} element of inequality of bargaining power. The <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> Rimer LJ, in Consistent Group Ltd v Kalwak, suggesting that contractual documents contained the expression of the true intentions of the parties unless there was a sham, intended to deceive third parties, was expressly doubted. Accordingly under the valeters were employees and 'workers' as defined and were entitled both to remuneration at the rate of the national minimum wage and to paid leave.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{introduce}} the theory <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> aggregation, a growing interdisciplinary research area. The theory addresses the following question: How can a group of individuals make consistent collective judgments on a <b>given</b> set <b>of</b> propositions on the basis of the group members' individual judgments on them? I begin by explaining the observation that initially sparked the interest in judgment aggregation, the so-called "doctinal" and "discursive paradoxes". I then introduce the basic formal model <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> aggregation, which allows me to present some illustrative variants of a generic impossibility result. I subsequently turn to the question of how this impossibility result can be avoided, going through several possible escape routes. Finally, I relate the theory <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> aggregation to other branches of aggregation theory. Rather than offering a comprehensive survey of the theory <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> aggregation, I hope to introduce the theory in a succinct and pedagogical way, providing an illustrative rather than exhaustive coverage of some of its key ideas and results...|$|R
