5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol,</b> the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|The District {{is divided}} into four {{quadrants}} of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building. All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond {{with the number of}} blocks away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b> Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.|$|E
5|$|Albany's first {{city hall}} was the Stadt Huys, {{built by the}} Dutch at the {{intersection}} of Broadway and Hudson Avenue probably in the 1660s, though possibly earlier. It was probably replaced around 1740 with a larger building, which continued {{to be known as the}} Stadt Huys. In 1754, the Stadt Huys was the location of the Albany Congress, where Benjamin Franklin presented the Albany Plan of Union, the first proposal to unite the British American colonies. In 1797 Albany was declared the state capital of New York and the New York Legislature made its home in Albany's city hall. In 1809 the Legislature opened the first New York State Capitol and Albany's government moved in with the Legislature. After purchasing a plot of land at the eastern terminus of Washington Avenue, across Eagle Street <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol,</b> the city government moved into a new city hall designed by Philip Hooker in 1832.|$|E

50|$|The 1970s {{renovation}} {{restored the}} interior of the building to its original condition, but by the 1990s, it was apparent that the building needed exterior and structural repairs.

5|$|Until 2007, US-89 {{followed}} State Street to North Temple (100 North), {{two blocks}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol,</b> {{but now it}} turns at 400 South, following the former alignment of SR-186 and SR-176 west and north on 300 West, and rejoining its pre-2007 route at North Temple. In this area, modern US-89 runs for one block with the UTA TRAX Red Line in its median before crossing the TRAX line in Main Street's median, then passing the Frank E. Moss United States Courthouse, Pioneer Park, the historic Warehouse District at Pierpont Avenue, Japantown, EnergySolutions Arena, the Arena TRAX station, the Triad Center, and West High School. As it leaves downtown, 300 West curves northwesterly and becomes Beck Street, meeting the modern terminus of SR-186 at Victory Road at {{the back side of}} Capitol Hill.|$|E

25|$|At {{the corner}} of Congress Avenue and Pecan Street in Austin stood a pair of legendary bars, the Crystal Saloon and Iron Front Saloons.

25|$|Following {{the church}} shooting, many {{commentators}} questioned the continued {{display of the}} flag at the memorial on the State House grounds. The flag had first been erected in 1962 by the state's Democratic governor in a protest against desegregation. Opposition and attempts to remove the flag began almost immediately. In 1996, then-governor David Beasley pushed to have it removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> dome, only to back off and then be driven from office two years later in the political blowback.|$|E
50|$|In 1821, Mexico {{had become}} free of Spanish reign {{and opened the}} area legally to colonists; {{settlers}} poured into the area by the hundreds.

5000|$|The large {{government}} buildings {{around the park}} were, like <b>the</b> state <b>capitol,</b> built in <b>the</b> late 19th century.

The cathedral adds some Gothic Revival to the mix. The residential areas in the north primarily have two-story brick townhouses dating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

25|$|Having {{reached the}} Thames, Plautius halted and sent for Claudius, who arrived with {{elephants}} and heavy artillery and completed {{the march on}} the Catuvellaunian capital, Camulodunum (Colchester). A Roman province {{was established in the}} conquered territory, and alliances made with nations outside direct Roman control. Plautius became governor of the new province, until 47 when he was replaced by Publius Ostorius Scapula. On his return to Rome and civil life, Plautius was granted an Ovation, during which the emperor himself walked by his side to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{games of}} September were named Ludi Magni; {{originally}} {{they were not}} held every year, but later became the annual Ludi Romani and were held in the Circus Maximus after a procession <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b> The games were attributed to Tarquinius Priscus, and linked to the cult of Jupiter on the Capitol. Romans themselves acknowledged analogies with the triumph, which Dumézil thinks {{can be explained by}} their common Etruscan origin; the magistrate in charge of the games dressed as the triumphator and the pompa circensis resembled a triumphal procession. Wissowa and Mommsen argue that they were a detached part of the triumph on the above grounds (a conclusion which Dumézil rejects).|$|E
25|$|As Chief Justice, he was {{responsible}} for overseeing many of the day-to-day functions of the court, and oversaw the court during its move <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol</b> of Corydon to Indianapolis in 1825. In 1831 the General Assembly granted the court permission to hold sessions anywhere within Indianapolis that they should chose, due to crowding in the statehouse. Blackford petitioned to have a chamber made available in the Indiana Governor's Mansion which was at that time being used for office space. He oversaw a fourth move to the new Indiana Statehouse in 1839. The court remained there for the remainder of his time on the bench.|$|E

25|$|On 4 May, Acevedo Vilá marched from La Fortaleza, the Governor's house, to the Capitol. It was {{the first}} time in Puerto Rican history that such an event has happened. In Puerto Rican custom, the Governor walks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> to La Fortaleza when he takes the oath of office. Acevedo Vilá was criticized due to the {{similarities}} between this march and an episode of the TV series The West Wing, in which the President of the United States (portrayed by Martin Sheen) walks from the White House, home of the President, to the U.S. Capitol, home of the U.S. Congress, in order to resolve a federal budget crisis.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the removal}} of the flag, the NAACP {{announced}} the end of its boycott of South Carolina. This action marks the end of a fifteen year long boycott of the state. The initiation of the boycott began in 2000, when the Confederate Flag was moved from atop the State House to a Confederate memorial {{on the grounds of the}} Capitol. A motion to remove the boycott by the NAACP was called shortly after state legislation voted to remove the flag <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> grounds. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks celebrated the state's decision, commenting that the action would make South Carolina more welcoming for all people regardless of their skin color.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{first met}} on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in New York City. When Philadelphia became the capital, the Court met briefly in Independence Hall before {{settling}} in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the Court occupied various {{spaces in the}} United States Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home. The four-story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble. The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol, but maintains its own police force separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Police.|$|E
