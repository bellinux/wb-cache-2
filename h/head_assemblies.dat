5000|$|Tape motion on many systems was bidirectional, i.e. tape {{could be}} read either forward or {{backward}} {{at the request of}} the controlling computer. Because the supply vacuum column kept a small, constant tension in the reverse direction, the capstan could feed backwards without the tape bunching up or jumping out of path. Unlike most audio tape systems, the capstan and <b>head</b> <b>assemblies</b> were always in contact with the tape, even during fast forward and reverse operations, only moving the head assembly away from the tape path during high-speed rewind.

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{observed}} performance of the geotechnical instrumentation deployed on the Spent Fuel Test-Climax (SFT-C), the following conclusions and recommendations are offered. Further research is required to fully understand the observed failures of linear potentiometers utilized in sealed or partially ventilated extensometer <b>head</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Based on our field observations, we recommend deploying Schaevitz LVDTs or proximeters as extensometer transducers where a sealed head assembly is required. The user must be cognizant of the potential drift and thermal instabilities of these units, however. The first-generation wire extensometers and fracture monitors developed for this test are an accurate, reliable means for measuring convergence and discrete joint motion, respectively. The improved hermetically sealed vibrating-wire stressmeters function reliably. Calibration of the gauge remains difficult and further work is warranted in this area. Utilization of a single lot of sheathed thermocouples in a zone box configuration is a cost-effective, accurate, and reliable means of measuring temperatures in the repository environment. Care {{must be taken to}} tailor the sheath composition to the test thermal and chemical environment. Monitoring and post-test studies will continue at the SFT-C through 1984. Included in these studies will be post-test calibrations of all accessible instrumentation. A final report on the performance of the field instrumentation will be prepared at that time...|$|E
40|$|In {{phase one}} of this project, Mr. Dubose needed {{assistance}} to evaluate his Minimal Crevice Volume (MCV) Piston Ring concept {{to see if it}} showed enough technical merit to warrant the expenditure of time and money into patenting the concept and commercializing it. He initially enlisted the help of Texas Tech University, and subsequently Honeywell FM and T, to evaluate the concept for technical feasibility. This evaluation included engineering evaluations of the concept's functionality and manufacturability, along with design analysis and refinement through finite element analysis and other methods. The Principal Investigator at FM and T (Greg Schuttler) and Dr. Maxwell at Texas Tech provided feedback to Mr. Dubose on the functional feasibility of the concept, and the Principal Investigator at FM and T provided manufacturability guidance. Dr. Maxwell had engineering students and a graduate student at Texas Tech conduct static finite element studies to further evaluate the concept; and an extensive dynamic finite element evaluation of the concept, including design refinement, was carried out at FM and T by the Principal Investigator and Jim Mahoney. The results of the FM and T finite element analysis were used as a justification for Mr. Dubose to pursue patent application for this concept. The dynamic finite element study pushed the state-of-the-art for this type of study at FM and T. It also served as a vehicle to facilitate the familiarization of FM and T associates outside the Finite Elements group in Engineering with finite element techniques and capabilities, a plant goal. In phase two of this project, Mr. Dubose was attempting to prove the viability of his already patented ''Variable Orbital Aperture'' concept. All three of the major US automotive corporations had expressed an interest in Mr. Dubose's multiple valve disc concept, if it could be proven that an effective sealing method could be found, since rotary valve engines have historically been nearly impossible to seal. To accomplish this, Mr. Dubose proposed to build a functional single-disc cylinder head to try different seal designs. Texas Tech had a Kawasaki single cylinder engine that was suitable for this use, and it was decided that a rotary valve cylinder head would be fabricated to fit this engine. To this end, Texas Tech provided assistance in creating the cylinder head design, assisted by Honeywell FM and T. Several design iterations were created, and both wax and stereolithography models were created at FM and T to assist the design process. The wax and stereolithography models were used for conceptual visualization of the designs, fit-up checks of the various components with the actual engine, and even flow testing of the intake and exhaust ports. When the design was finalized, two prototype cylinder <b>head</b> <b>assemblies</b> were machined, from aluminum and steel supplied by Texas Tech and Mr. Dubose, in the FM and T Model Shop. The engine was then to be assembled and tested at Texas Tech. At the time that this project was closed, the engine had not yet been completely assembled and tested...|$|E

The device comprises a print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> (1), a radiation source assembly, and a heat source controllable by a control unit acting on a thermal photolinkable material layer separated on a working plane (E). The print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> is positioned in a controlled manner relative to the working plane, and is connected to two reservoir containers (2, 3, 4) in which liquid to paste-like photolinkable materials each having a different photosensitivity level are stored. The respective material is delivered via the print <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> to the selected locations in the region of the working plane. The radiation source assembly emits electromagnetic radiation in an areal manner depending upon the photosensitivity of the photolinkable material that is delivered to selected locations on the working plane.
