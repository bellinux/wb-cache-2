Materials and Methods: the research was conducted in 2009 among 153 children aged 7 - 10 years. The research group consisted of 80 girls and 73 boys. The diagnostic survey method with use of a questionnaire technique and a set of indirect motor trials was applied. Results: the research has shown that the health behaviours of young Polish children do not differ from their peers in other countries. The largest percentage of early school-age children in Malbork achieved the average level of physical fitness (57. 0 %), while the percentage of students with low (22. 0 %) and high (21. 0 %) level was similar. Conclusions: the connection between pro-health attitudes of early school-age children (i. <b>e.,</b> leisure <b>activities,</b> <b>own</b> health condition, nutrition and the use of drugs) and the level of their physical fitness was not ascertained...|$|R

For our observed period (1997 - 2011), while the share of firms engaged in offshoring fell {{during the period from}} around 25 % to 22 %, offshoring per worker within offshoring firms almost doubled. We make use of this variation to contribute to the literature on several fronts by examining both the internal (i. <b>e.,</b> firms' <b>own</b> offshoring <b>activities)</b> and the external (i. e., neighboring firms’ offshoring activities) effects of offshoring on workers' employment spells. To deal with potential endogeneity, we use instruments based on world supply shocks for both the internal and external measures of offshoring. Our results suggest that external offshoring has a greater impact on job security than internal offshoring. In addition, having a university degree, being young, and being new to the job all reduce the risk of a job exit due to increased external offshoring. This result is indicative of a Schumpeterian job restructuring effect of offshoring, where old jobs are replaced by newer ones. Finally, the increased risk of a job exit from external offshoring is limited to workers in small firms that do not offshore themselves, suggesting a higher vulnerability of these firms to local shocks. offshoring; heterogeneous firms; job security; globalizatio...|$|R
