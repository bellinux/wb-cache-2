5|$|Arriving at Batavia in the {{aftermath}} of the engagement, Linois was the subject of criticism from the Dutch governors for his failure to defeat the China convoy. They also refused his requests to make use of the Dutch squadron stationed in port for future operations. Rejoined by Atalante, Linois sold two captured country ships and resupplied his squadron, before sailing for Isle de France, Marengo arriving on 2 April. During the return journey, Linois had detached his frigates and they captured a number of valuable merchant ships sailing independently before joining the admiral at Port Louis, which Decaen had renamed Port Napoleon. On his arrival, Linois was questioned by Decaen about the engagement with the China Fleet and when Decaen found <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> unsatisfactory the governor wrote a scathing letter to Napoleon, which he despatched to France on Berceau. Linois remained at Isle de France for the next two and a half months, eventually departing with Marengo, Atalante and Sémillante in late June, while Belle Poule was detached to cruise independently.|$|E
5|$|Northup begins {{working on}} the {{construction}} of a gazebo with a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt). Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to American slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Solomon overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Bass, risking his life, agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm that <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent him from leaving. Solomon gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom. Patsey faints as Solomon leaves.|$|E

25|$|Socrates' second argument, the Theory of Recollection, {{shows that}} it is {{possible}} to draw information out of a person who seems not to have any knowledge of a subject prior to his being questioned about it (a priori knowledge). This person must have gained this knowledge in a prior life, and is now merely recalling it from memory. Since the person in Socrates' story is able to provide correct answers to his interrogator, it must be the case that <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> arose from recollections of knowledge gained during a previous life.|$|E
25|$|After the report, another Guard officer came to Tripp and {{his colleagues}} with new {{information}} which did substantiate some of the allegations, and revealed to them DeZarn's role in the 1990 party. He was indicted on a perjury charge in 1996. His attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have the indictment dismissed {{on the grounds that}} <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> were literally truthful. The district court refused to do so since other witnesses had answered questions about the 1991 party with reference to the 1990 one, and that DeZarn's other answers had shown he knew which party was at issue.|$|E
25|$|Four conversations are {{described}} in the seventh and eighth cantos of the epic. These include the first conversation between Aṣṭāvakra and Janaka, followed by the three debates of Aṣṭāvakra – {{the first one to}} convince the gatekeeper to let him into the assembly; then <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> to the cryptic questions of Janaka; and finally the Śāstrārtha between Bandī and Aṣṭāvakra, in which the seemingly simple enumerations of the numbers one to thirteen belie enigmas and latent meanings which lie beneath. These conversations in the epic are the same as in the Mahābhārata, and the comparison between the poetry in the Saṃskṛta of Mahābhārata and the Hindi of Aṣṭāvakra is noteworthy.|$|E

500|$|Stansfield {{was born}} in Plymouth, Devon, as the third of four children, and {{supported}} Nottingham Forest. On 2 June 2001 he married Marie, {{with whom he had}} three sons. Devon journalist Gary Andrews remembered Stansfield as a man who would spend time with his family after matches while speaking to fans and the press. He wrote that [...] "I had the pleasure of interviewing Adam on a regular basis...I say pleasure, because <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> were thoughtful and intelligent and he came across as a man who was delighted to be back home with his friends and family".|$|E
500|$|Scott Lowe's {{survey found}} that Falun Gong's spiritual teachings and promise of good health were the most common reasons for people to have taken up the practice. In Lowe's survey, 22 {{respondents}} gave [...] "Master Li's philosophy and <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> to life's most difficult questions" [...] as their primary attraction to the practice, while another twenty were attracted for health benefits. Nine were drawn by the moral principles, twelve by the books, ten by the exercises, and small numbers of others {{by a variety of}} other factors. Several respondents apparently realized that other forms of qigong were [...] "shallow, exoteric, and superficial," [...] while they came to believe that Falun Gong is the [...] "most complete, efficacious, and comprehensive system of spiritual cultivation on the planet." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical opinion {{has also}} noted that both parts of the story arc offer an {{alternative}} explanation for {{the events of the}} series so far, a [...] "less romantic" [...] outcome that paints the ongoing plot as an elaborate hoax to defer attention from the government's experiments, both military and medical. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff feels that such an explanation would [...] "speak more to the sadness {{at the core of the}} X-Files to have Mulder find <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> and be forced to accept they weren't what he was looking for", comparing such a realization to the hero of Don Quixote. This [...] "hoax" [...] plot device would later be revisited in both the fourth season finale [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and the fifth season's opening two-part episodes [...] "Redux and Redux II", although to a much lesser degree of effectiveness.|$|E

The general refused to do so unless the Americans publicly announced their support for him. The Americans then asked Khánh about his plans for the future, but felt that <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> betrayed a lack of direction. After talking to Phát and Đức, they concluded the same, so they decided to back the incumbent and made a press release through the embassy endorsing Khánh. Their decision was augmented by the rebels' inability to land a decisive blow, making the Americans more favorable to a continuation of Khánh's rule. The Voice of America broadcast a message emphasizing ongoing U.S. support for Khánh and opposition to the coup. It said the Americans had been monitoring the situation closely and that the incumbent regime was functioning; it further said: ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the next}} court session on July 15, {{prosecutors}} submitted evidence that V. N. had received 13,500US$ from an unknown source {{just before she}} recanted the charges during the May court session. The prosecution submitted the evidence {{in an attempt to}} show that V. N.'s original statements and desire to press the charges were valid, and later attempts to recant were in bad faith. Brown then took the stand but refused to answer questions as to why his initial statements to Japanese police were different from what Takaesu later stated in court had actually happened on the night in question. The prosecutor asked Brown, [...] "Your original statement that she made sexual advances was false?" [...] Brown replied, [...] "I am not going to answer that." [...] When asked why he would not answer, Brown replied, [...] "Because I want the opportunity for this court to see publicly the type of corruption and distortion of evidence by the police and the prosecutor." [...] Takaesu later said that another reason for Brown's refusal to answer most of the questions was because <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> could be used by the USMC in separate military justice actions against Brown.|$|E
500|$|Maund {{arrived in}} Cape Town in late June 1888 and {{attempted}} to gain Robinson's approval for the Cawston–Gifford bid. Robinson was reserved in <b>his</b> <b>answers,</b> saying that he supported the development of Matabeleland by a company {{with this kind of}} backing, but did not feel he could commit to endorsing Cawston and Gifford exclusively while there remained other potential concessionaires, most prominently Rhodes—certainly not without unequivocal instructions from Whitehall. While Rudd's party gathered and prepared in Kimberley, Maund travelled north, and reached the diamond mines at the start of July. On 14 July, in Bulawayo, agents representing a consortium headed by the South African-based entrepreneur Thomas Leask received a mining concession from Lobengula, covering all of his country, and pledging half of the proceeds to the king. When he learned of this latter condition Leask was distraught, saying the concession was [...] "commercially valueless". Moffat pointed out to Leask that his group did not have the resources to act on the concession anyway, and that both Rhodes and the London syndicate did; at Moffat's suggestion, Leask decided to wait and sell his concession to whichever big business group gained a new agreement from Lobengula. Neither Rhodes's group, the Cawston–Gifford consortium nor the British colonial officials immediately learned of the Leask concession.|$|E

500|$|Gordon-Cumming was {{replaced}} in the witness box by the prince. Examined by Clarke, {{he stated that}} he had not seen any cheating, and was ignorant of the accusations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. After 20 minutes of questions from both Clarke and Russell, the prince was free to depart. As the prince was leaving the witness box, a member of the jury put two questions to Edward: whether the heir had seen [...] "nothing of the alleged malpractices of the plaintiff?", and [...] "what was your Royal Highness's opinion at the time as to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" [...] To the first question the prince replied {{that he had not}}, although he explained that [...] "it is not usual for a banker to see anything in dealing cards"; to the second, he stated that [...] "the charges appeared to be so unanimous that it was the proper course—no other course was open to me—than to believe them". In comparison with Gordon-Cumming's performance in the witness box, Edward did not make a strong impression; the reporter for The New York Times noticed [...] "that the heir apparent was decidedly fidgety, that he kept changing his position, and that he did not seem able to keep his hands still... Except to those near him, only two or three of <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> were fairly audible throughout the courtroom". The Daily News agreed, and stated that the impression gained from the prince's performance was unfavourable.|$|E
500|$|Garnet's recent {{interrogation}} {{was only}} the first of many. [...] Generally, <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> were carefully considered and demonstrated a passive resistance to his questioners; {{the use of the}} rack was a distinct possibility, one which he answered with [...] "Minare ista pueris [...] ". [...] What information he did give up was of limited interest only. His jailer, a man named Carey, was employed by Waad to gain the priest's trust, offering to relay letters to his nephew in the Gatehouse Prison. [...] Carey then placed Garnet into a cell containing a hole through which he was able to converse with Oldcorne, who was in a neighbouring cell. [...] From [...] "a place which was made for this precise purpose", two government eavesdroppers were therefore able to record details of conversations between the two priests. Their communications were mostly innocent, although Garnet's admission that on one occasion he drank too much wine was later used against him, along with other incriminating evidence recorded during their stay. His communications with his nephew, and Anne Vaux, were also intercepted. Most of these letters found their intended recipient, but not before they had first been read by Waad, who also kept Salisbury informed. Although Garnet told Vaux that the Council's evidence constituted nothing but [...] "presumptions", insufficient for a state trial, early in March he confessed, possibly as a result of torture. Vaux too was arrested and interrogated twice, just as further questions were being asked of Garnet by the council and the king, the latter interested in his opinion on theological matters.|$|E
