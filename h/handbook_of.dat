5|$|A {{large number}} of {{subspecies}} have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the <b>Handbook</b> <b>of</b> the Birds of the World.

Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus {{was described as a}} species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|After Ealdred's {{return to}} England he {{took charge of}} the sees of Hereford and Ramsbury. Ealdred also {{administered}} Winchcombe Abbey and Gloucester Abbey. The authors of the <b>Handbook</b> <b>of</b> British Chronology Third Edition say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060, but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant, or that he was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, chess {{organization}} developed quickly. Many chess clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club {{played against}} the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824. Chess problems became {{a regular part of}} 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed {{some of the}} most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (<b>Handbook</b> <b>of</b> Chess), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Eloise Kirkpatrick Dilling (April 19, 1894 – May 26, 1966) was an American {{writer and}} {{political}} activist.

5|$|In 2005, Pamela C. Rasmussen {{granted the}} taxon {{autonomous}} status in her book, Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide, uncoupling the species from S. leucopsis.

5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (<b>Handbook</b> <b>of</b> Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E
5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} circles, the word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in Irish reference books, such as <b>Handbook</b> <b>of</b> Irish Philately, the term forerunners usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for mail in Ireland.|$|E
