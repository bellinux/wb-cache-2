2500|$|In {{all these}} cases, cooling {{on the upper}} and lower {{surfaces}} of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal <b>fracture</b> <b>pattern</b> with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces. As cooling continued these cracks gradually extended toward the centre of the flow, forming the long hexagonal columns we see in the wave-eroded cross-section today. [...] Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling.|$|E
2500|$|The Caloris floor plains {{material}} {{is a special}} problem and {{is not included in}} the Caloris Group. The plains have some features in common with the Maunder Formation in the floor of Orientale on the Moon but do not show the radial and circumferential ridges characteristic of the Maunder that led to its interpretation as a basin floor unit. The Caloris floor plains have a more open, coarser <b>fracture</b> <b>pattern</b> than does the Maunder. In addition, the Caloris ridges and the fractures cutting them have a crude rhombic pattern that led Strom and others to conclude that the plains materials subsided and then were gently uplifted to produce the open tension fractures observed. The ridges in the floor of Caloris lack the crenulated crests that are common on lunar ridges. Regardless of the origin and tectonic history of these plains, it seems clear that they represent a deep basin fill that obscures the original floor of the Caloris Basin.|$|E
2500|$|The plains {{material}} {{that forms the}} floor of the Caloris Basin has not been included in the Caloris Group and is mapped separately from the smooth plains. In many way, the Caloris-floor plains are similar to the smooth plains, except that they have been buckled and fractured into numerous ridges and grooves that intersect to form a grossly polygonal pattern. The dominant trends of these features are concentric and radial to the center of Caloris. On the basis of photometric evidence, Hapke and others (1975) suggested that {{the central part of the}} basin floor may be 7±3 km lower than the outer edge. Strom and others argued that the ridges were formed by compressive stress generated by subsidence of the floor, and the fractures by subsequent uplift of the center of the basin to produce crustal lengthening and the observed <b>fracture</b> <b>pattern.</b> The origin of the material itself is doubtful. It may consist of sheets of volcanic material emplaced shortly after the basin was formed or it may be material formed by the Caloris event either as melt or as the upper part of a plug of plastic {{material that}} rose in the crater floor as part of the impact process. Whatever the origin of this material, it seems clear that it covers the original floor of the excavated crater.|$|E

40|$|Natural <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> in folded carbonates {{are highly}} heterogeneous. The present-day {{fractures}} {{are often the}} result of pre-folding, syn-folding and post-folding related fractures. Furthermore, syn-folding fractures may differ in different domains of the fold. Although there are studies that characterize <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> in outcropping folds, {{there is still a}} poor understanding of the relation between large-scale deformation (i. e. folding), and small-scale deformation (i. e. fractures), especially in terms of stresses and process-based predictions of fractures. Our overarching goal is to assess the sensitivity of reservoir-scale flow to different <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> and different <b>fracture</b> properties. Therefore we build multi-scale models of 3 D fracture networks in outcropping folds {{in the foothills of the}} Tunisian Atlas (central Tunisia). The fracture data is collected from outcrops using efficient methods that collect both fractures and the 3 D geometry of the outcrops. We interpret small-scale deformation in terms of stresses and combine this with fold-scale mechanical models to predict the <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> in 3 D throughout the fold. The 3 D model is used to model fracture fluid flow. This work presents a new approach to outcrop studies, that distinguishes different stages of fracturing and uses stresses to make predictions about <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> in similar structures.

2500|$|The circumbasin scarps around Caloris, Tolstoj, and Mozart are {{the most}} {{prominent}} structural features in the quadrangle. The main Caloris Montes scarp is thought to approximate {{the edge of the}} basin of excavation of Caloris and is probably a structural and stratigraphic counterpart of the Montes Rook scarp around the Orientale Basin on the Moon. A subdued outer scarp is present around most of the visible part of Caloris, better seen in the Shakespeare quadrangle to the north. This scarp is generally coincident with the transition between the massifs of the Caloris Montes Formation and the lineated facies of the Van Eyck Formation. The roughly rectilinear outlines of massifs within the Caloris Montes suggest structural control by a prebasin <b>fracture</b> <b>pattern.</b> The much lower, discontinuous outer scarp is considered to be the feeble equivalent of the Montes Cordillera scarp around Orientale. Like the Cordillera, it probably lies outside the limit of the crater of excavation. Its poor development and spacing much closer {{to the edge of the}} basin may be due to the greater mercurian gravity, as described by Gault and others. The Van Eyck Formation is characterized by an extensive radial ridge-and-valley system with minor concentric scarps and lineaments. These features are considered for the most part as gouges and depositional plumes from secondary cratering within the Van Eyck; the remarkably straight ridges and steep walls, however, suggest formation by fracturing.|$|E

30|$|The {{fracture}} orientations {{derived from}} the outcrops in this study show a degree of similarity; for instance, a common NE–SW set exists, and {{in three of the}} four outcrops a second NW–SE group occurs (Fig.  6). However, other studies carried out in this region (e.g. Dezayes et al. 2015; Meier et al. 2015; Peters 2007) show that a wider range of <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> have been observed in this area. In addition, we found that in the Cleebourg outcrop with fault zone exposure, individual layers host different fracture systems (Figure  7). Both observations suggest that the permeability-controlling <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> are difficult to predict in the study area. This assumption is further supported by the two <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> that were identified in the well, based on FMI data (Fig.  13; Reinecker et al. 2015). None of these <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> coincides with those observed at the surface. At a depth of about 3275  m, i.e. the depth at which total mud loss occurred, and where the API values are increased (Fig.  10 a), a fault is expected based on the seismics (Lotz 2014). We propose that it is likely that this fracture system belongs to the damage zone of the fault, rather than reflecting the regional trend.|$|R

40|$|The {{stiff and}} fragile {{structure}} of thermosetting polymers, such as epoxy, accomplices the innate cracks to cause fracture {{and therefore the}} applications of monolithic epoxy are not ubiquitous. However, it is well established that when reinforced especially by nano-fillers, its ability to withstand crack propagation is propitiously improved. The crack is either deflected or bifurcated when interacting with strong nano-filler such as Multi-Layer Graphene (MLG). Due to the deflection and bifurcation of cracks, specific <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> are observed. Although these <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> seem aesthetically appealing, however, if delved deeper, they can further be used to estimate the influence of nano-filler on the mechanical properties.

40|$|Violent {{behaviour}} can be {{seen all}} over the world and across time; it is also intrinsically linked to culture. As such, the analysis of skeletal material presents excellent physical evidence of violent occurrences within communities. The current thesis looks to understand the possible presence of <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> and interpersonal violence in London during the 18 th and 19 th centuries by analysing the <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> observed on six skeletal collections from the geographical area and characterised by various social and economic contexts. The contextualisation of each burial ground proved to be imperative to the research. The statistical results revealed that grouping collections together based on their socioeconomic status does not describe nor explain the <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> seen in the collections considering that some did not emulate the characterisation implemented upon them by the media or City officials at the time. It also was found that the patrilineal society and the subsequent sexual division of labour had a profound effect on the results especially when comparing the prevalence of fractures between men and women. Therefore, this thesis provides a comprehensive overview of <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> and the presence of interpersonal violence in regards to the different lifestyles and socioeconomic contexts found in London during the 18 th and 19 th centuries and how such behaviour affected the individuals’ daily lives...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of stone}} tool {{production}} {{has long been}} used as a proxy for cognitive development in early human cultures. In the context of South‐east Asia (SEA) and Australia a lack of ‘advanced’ examples of lithic technologies seen elsewhere in the world has led to the labeling of SEA and Australian cultures as simple and undeveloped. Arguments have been raised in an attempt to refute this claim, including the replacement of stone as a medium for artefact production with shell. The differentiation between cultural and taphonomic modification in shell has been problematic, due largely to a lack of understanding of taphonomy the morphologies different species of shell on a micro scale and subsequently the fracture mechanics of molluscan shell under specific forces. The identification of artefactual shell specimens is sometimes based on little more than a hunch. This project attempts to determine the difference between the resulting <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> of cultural and taphonomic damage using high and low powered microscopy. The resulting <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> from use‐wear experimentation was compared to controlled fracture experimentation using low powered light microscopy and high powered scanning electron microscopy.

When these results are then compared to archaeological specimens from Golo cave in Gebe Island, a previously excavated site in the Maluku island group in Indonesia, similar <b>fracture</b> <b>patterns</b> are observed indicating the presence of culturally modified shell in the Golo Cave assemblage. This project highlights the significance of micro scale analysis in the identification of shell artefacts as well as providing insight into the differing forms of mechanical failure in molluscan shell as well as depicting the suitability of shell as a medium for artefactual us...|$|R

A third model for comparison is based on interacting `penny-shaped' micro cracks introduced by Healy et al. [Nature 439, 64 (2006) ]. The former models predict a bimodal fracture angle distribution, with two narrow peaks separated by 60 ○ - 90 ○ symmetrically {{on both sides of}} the direction of the largest principal stress, while the latter predicts a single broader peak in the same direction with standard deviation in the range 15 ○ - 20 ○.
