The paper {{focused on the}} height structure of Scots pine saplings affected by (1) retained solitary pine trees or (2) a pine-dominated <b>edge</b> <b>stand.</b> The study material in (1) and (2) con-sisted of ten separate regeneration areas in southern Finland. In (1) 2 -m radius study plots were located at 1, 3, 6 and 10 m distances from 10 systematically selected, solitary retained trees in each stand. In (2) the study plots were systematically located within 20 m from the <b>edge</b> <b>stand.</b> Competition of the individual trees was modelled using ecological field theory. The 24 th and 93 rd sample percentiles were used for estimating the height distribution using the two-parameter Weibull function. The models incorporated the effect of varying advanced tree competition on the predicted percentiles. Competition free dominant height {{was used as a}} driving variable for the developmental phase. Competition resulted in retarded height development within a radius of about 6 m from the retained tree, while it extended up to roughly half of the dominant height of the <b>edge</b> <b>stand.</b> The height distribution without exter-nal competition was relatively symmetrical, but increasing competition resulted in a mor...|$|R

30|$|Deng et al. 2012 [5] {{proposes a}} unified model, PAV, for ranking {{heterogeneous}} objects, such as papers, author, and venues. PAV explores object ranking in bibliographic information where objects are papers, authors and venues. In PAV the bibliographic information network {{is represented by}} a weighted directed graph, where a vertex stands for an object, an <b>edge</b> <b>stands</b> for the link between objects, and a weight over an <b>edge</b> <b>stands</b> for the degree of contribution that one object devotes to the importance or reputation of the corresponding object sharing the same edge with the object. The rank (importance or reputation) of an object is {{the probability that the}} corresponding vertex is accessed by random walk in the PAV graph. The authors claim PAV is an efficient solution for ranking author, paper, and venues simultaneously. According to their method, the importance or reputation of an author is influenced by his co-authors, his papers, and the venues that published his papers. The importance or reputation of a paper is influenced by its authors, its venue, and the papers that cited it. The importance or reputation of a venue is influenced by the papers that it published and the authors who had papers published by the venue. PAV model transforms the problem of ranking objects into the problem of estimating probability parameters. For estimating probabilities the authors developed an algorithm based on matrix computing. The authors claim their algorithm could be ran efficiently by proving that the underlying computing method is convergent.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Networks {{are often}} studied as graphs, where the {{vertices}} stand for entities {{in the world}} and the <b>edges</b> <b>stand</b> for connections between them. While relatively easy to study, graphs are often inadequate for modeling real-world situations, especially those that include contexts of more than two entities.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel method for {{identifying}} dense communities of classes (clusters) within an object-oriented software system. These clusters suggest the decomposition of the software system into smaller subsystems. Also, such clusters can imply relevance of functionality and thus be used as reusable components. To accomplish the identification we employ a technique from algebraic graph theory known as spectral graph partitioning. We create a graph representation of the object-oriented software system in which nodes stand for the classes and the <b>edges</b> <b>stand</b> for the discrete messages exchanged between the classes. Our approach is based on an iterative method for partitioning the graph in order to identify dense communities of classes. ...|$|R
