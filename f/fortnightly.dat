5|$|The Poor Print was {{originally}} {{set up in}} Hilary 2013. However, the publication in its current guise was established in Michaelmas 2014 as an online-only magazine, with a <b>fortnightly</b> print edition then introduced in Michaelmas 2015. This format of a <b>fortnightly</b> print edition, supplemented with additional content online, has continued until the present day.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher {{was also}} a member of the fraternal {{organisation}} the United Ancient Order of the Druids, and attended meetings <b>fortnightly</b> in Newton, not far from Ponsonby. He also played several sports in addition to rugby, including cricket, yachting and athletics.|$|E
5|$|Pick ran {{his office}} on a <b>fortnightly</b> cycle and his {{workload}} was prodigious. Barman described Pick's office as a training school for future managers, with a regular turnover of staff who {{would go on to}} management positions when Pick thought them ready.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Lasker {{founded the}} first of his chess magazines, The London Chess <b>Fortnightly,</b> which was {{published}} from August 15, 1892 to July 30, 1893. In the second quarter of 1893 there was a gap of ten weeks between issues, allegedly because of problems with the printer. Shortly after its last issue Lasker traveled to the US, where he spent the next two years.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Lawson {{also began}} to write a <b>fortnightly</b> cooking {{articles}} for The New York Times, and brought out a profitable line of kitchenware, called the Living Kitchen range, which is sold by numerous retailers. Her range's value has continued to grow, starting at an estimated £2 million in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} services are co-ordinated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive. Waste management is co-ordinated {{by the local}} authority, Gateshead Council, which provides refuse collections, which became <b>fortnightly</b> in March 2012. Sheriff Hill's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is Northern Powergrid. Northumbrian Water supplies drinking water, which is sourced from Kielder Reservoir, and also has responsibility for waste water services.|$|E
5|$|SS Wittekind {{was built}} by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg for North German Lloyd’s Roland Line, which was a <b>fortnightly</b> {{steerage}} and freight service from Bremen to New York. Launched on 3 February 1894, Wittekind—named for Wittekind (c. 730–808), the Duke of Saxony—and sister-ship Willehad were the first twin-screw steamers expressly built for North German Lloyd. The new liner sailed on her maiden voyage to Hoboken, New Jersey on 14 April.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{daily news}} {{publications}} on Nauru, {{although there is}} one <b>fortnightly</b> publication, Mwinen Ko. There is a state-owned television station, Nauru Television (NTV), which broadcasts programmes from New Zealand and Australia, and a state-owned non-commercial radio station, Radio Nauru, which carries programmes from Radio Australia and the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1882, Bradwall's {{only place}} of worship is the Wesleyan Chapel Methodist Church on Ward's Lane. The church {{is one of four}} in the Sandbach Mission Area (the others are in Sandbach, Sandbach Heath and Wheelock), and {{services}} are held <b>fortnightly</b> on Sunday. The minister is the Rev'd Kim Stilwell. Historic Minutes, financial and administrative records between 1882 and 1928 are held at the Cheshire Record Office. In 1982, the Chapel celebrated its centenary.|$|E
5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed <b>fortnightly</b> collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} camp, Baden-Powell went on an extensive speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Pearsons, {{to promote his}} forthcoming Scouting for Boys, which officially began the Scout movement. It initially appeared as six <b>fortnightly</b> installments, beginning in January 1908, and later appeared in book form. Scouting began to spread throughout Great Britain and Ireland, then through {{the countries of the}} British Empire, and soon {{to the rest of the}} world. A reunion of the original campers was held in 1928 at the Chief Scout's home at Pax Hill in Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sindy's {{product manager}} Edward Machin {{announced}} that Sindy would reclaim the lead over Barbie within two years. Hasbro redesigned Sindy and spent approximately £1.5m on advertising. A Sindy magazine was also launched {{in this period}} to challenge the <b>fortnightly</b> Barbie magazine. A £1 million advertising campaign was introduced in 1991 with five advertisements highlighting Sindy's collection of beach and pool wear. The advertisement showed footage of Sindy combined with live action sequences from a look-alike.|$|E
5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna. Maria Antonia's education was neglected, {{and when the}} French showed an interest in her, her mother went about educating her {{as best she could}} about the court of Versailles and the French. Maria Theresa kept up a <b>fortnightly</b> correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
5|$|Sunny Stories {{was renamed}} Enid Blyton's Sunny Stories in January 1937, {{and served as}} a vehicle for the {{serialisation}} of Blyton's books. Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story, about an anti-heroine based on a doll owned by her daughter Gillian, was published in the magazine. Blyton stopped contributing in 1952, and it closed down the following year, shortly before the appearance of the new <b>fortnightly</b> Enid Blyton Magazine written entirely by Blyton. The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953, and the magazine ran until September 1959.|$|E
5|$|The Chaser group's {{founding}} members were Charles Firth, Dominic Knight, Craig Reucassel, and Julian Morrow. In 1999 they started The Chaser, a <b>fortnightly</b> satirical newspaper. Chas Licciardello, Andrew Hansen, and Chris Taylor later joined the group; and in 2006, after various ventures in radio, stage, and television, this line-up created The Chaser's War on Everything, its most successful program, which screened on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) station ABC1. By its second season in 2007, the show had forged {{a reputation for}} ambush-style stunts and deliberate controversy.|$|E
5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared <b>fortnightly,</b> but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Cunard, who {{was back}} in Halifax, {{unfortunately}} {{did not know of}} the tender until after the deadline. He returned to London and started negotiations with Admiral Parry, who was Cunard's good friend from when Parry was a young officer stationed in Halifax 20 years earlier. Cunard offered Parry a <b>fortnightly</b> service beginning in May 1840. While Cunard did not then own a steamship, he had been an investor in an earlier steamship venture, Royal William, and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia. Cunard's major backer was Robert Napier whose Robert Napier and Sons was the Royal Navy's supplier of steam engines. He also had the strong backing of Nova Scotian political leaders at the time when London needed to rebuild support in British North America after the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 2s {{financial}} success {{was a major}} factor in Sega catching up to Nintendo in the early-1990s console wars. It brought their market share up to 50% within six months of its release. Tails, whom Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduced, would go on {{to become one of the}} most prominent and frequently recurring characters in the series, appearing and acting as Sonic's sidekick in most of the franchise's media, including in recent games such as Sonic Colors, Sonic Generations, and Sonic Lost World in which most of the recurring cast does not appear or is relegated to minor roles. Furthermore, Sonic the Hedgehog 2s popularity managed to extend to various merchandise such as comic books (the well-received <b>fortnightly</b> Sonic the Comic), a television series, and a sequel, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which received similar acclaim.|$|E
5|$|The first {{organised}} {{postal service}} was established between Madras and Calcutta by Governor Edward Harrison in 1712. After reform and regularisation, a new postal system {{was started by}} Sir Archibald Campbell and was introduced on 1 June 1786. The Presidency was divided into three postal divisions: Madras North up to Ganjam, Madras South-West to Anjengo (erstwhile Travancore) and Madras West, up to Vellore. In the same year, a link with Bombay was established then in 1837, the Madras, Bombay and Calcutta mail services were integrated to form the All-India Service. On 1 October 1854, the first stamps were issued by the Imperial Postal Service. The General Post Office (GPO), Madras, was established by Sir Archibald Campbell in 1786. In 1872–73, a bimonthly sea-mail service began between Madras and Rangoon. This {{was followed by the}} commencement of a <b>fortnightly</b> sea-mail service between Madras and ports on the eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|The temple priests {{perform the}} pooja (rituals) during festivals {{and on a}} daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are {{performed}} six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Pundarikakshan and Pankajavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves {{in front of the}} temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and <b>fortnightly</b> rituals performed in the temple.|$|E
5|$|Wilde, having {{tired of}} journalism, had been busy setting out his {{aesthetic}} ideas more fully {{in a series}} of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue appeared in The Nineteenth Century, and Pen, Pencil and Poison, a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in The <b>Fortnightly</b> Review, edited by Wilde's friend Frank Harris. Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, bons mots and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.|$|E
5|$|With {{fewer than}} 800 {{people on the}} island at any time, {{facilities}} are limited; they include a bakery, butcher, general store, liquor store, restaurants, post office, museum and information centre, a police officer, a ranger, and an ATM at the bowling club. Stores are shipped to the island <b>fortnightly</b> by the Island Trader from Port Macquarie. There is a small four-bed hospital and dispensary. A small botanic garden displays labelled local plants in its grounds. Diesel-generated power is 240 volts AC, as on the mainland. There is no public transport or mobile phone coverage, but there are public telephones, fax facilities and internet access {{as well as a}} local radio station and newsletter, The Signal.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} school {{was established in}} the 1870s and grew to 65 students by 1901. Mond's business expanded throughout {{the latter part of the}} 19th century and the prosperity of the town did likewise. He built a large grain store opposite the mill and opened offices and a depot in Launceston. Westbury Municipal Council built a public hall on the main road in 1883. The current weatherboard town hall dates from c1900 and the old hall is presumed to have been destroyed prior to this. At the town's height in the 19th century, just after the return of men from the Victorian gold fields, the town had four public houses and a population of approximately 400. It had four public houses operating two of which, Prince of Wales and the Carrick Hotel, remained open in 1901. As of 1883 it was reported that the inns were kept open by the Carrick Races and <b>fortnightly</b> livestock sales. Carrick's livestock sales were held at the Carrick Hotel and were the main fat stock sales for Launceston. At the turn of the century the town had no reticulated water. It relied on wells, rainwater and the inconstant river.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{transport}} operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam {{to transfer}} wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted {{as part of}} the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers. Separate evacuation flights began on 1July 1966, and continued at <b>fortnightly</b> intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Emma Cons, a Victorian philanthropist {{who ran the}} Old Vic theatre in {{a working-class}} area of London, began {{presenting}} regular <b>fortnightly</b> performances of opera excerpts. Although the theatre licensing laws of the day prevented full costumed performances, Cons presented condensed versions of well-known operas, always sung in English. Among the performers were noted singers such as Charles Santley. These operatic evenings quickly became more popular than the dramas that Cons had been staging separately. In 1898, she recruited her niece Lilian Baylis to help run the theatre. At {{the same time she}} appointed Charles Corri as the Old Vic's musical director. Baylis and Corri, despite many disagreements, shared a passionate belief in popularising opera, hitherto generally the preserve of the rich and fashionable. They worked on a tiny budget, with an amateur chorus and a professional orchestra of only 18 players, for whom Corri rescored the instrumental parts of the operas. By {{the early years of the}} 20th century, the Old Vic was able to present semi-staged versions of Wagner operas.|$|E
5|$|School {{clubs and}} {{societies}} include singing and drama clubs, chess club, sports clubs, film club and computer games club. A student council system is in place which acts as a forum between pupils and staff; elected representatives of each year group attend <b>fortnightly,</b> pupil-run meetings to discuss school policies with staff. On the Ruskington site, a pupil-run Interact Club, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Sleaford and Kesteven, coordinates charitable and community work in the school. The school newspaper club produces an annual newsletter and the school takes part in the BBC School Report day. Badminton, association football, volleyball, trampolining and gymnastics clubs are run every week at the Academy. The physical education department runs Inter-House sports competitions and co-ordinates school rugby, association football, basketball, boccia and netball teams. The music department hosts a junior and senior choir, swing band, Woodwind ensemble, Samba group and Vocal groups; the music rehearsal rooms can be booked for band practice. Pupils can audition for parts in the school's annual musical production and summer cabaret. For a fee, pupils may take up music lessons taught by tutors at the school. The school has supported music students in local and regional music festivals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, forty-two per cent of Hercules flying hours {{were devoted to}} Australian Army operations. The C-130s {{undertook}} long-range missions to support Australian forces fighting in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972. Following the deployment of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment to South Vietnam in early 1965, the RAAF began <b>fortnightly</b> C-130 flights into the country from June that year. These flights were initially conducted by C-130As, and carried high-priority cargo and passengers from Richmond to Vung Tau in South Vietnam via either Butterworth or Singapore. The scale of the supply flights into South Vietnam expanded in 1967 when No.2 Squadron RAAF, which was equipped with English Electric Canberra bombers, was deployed to Phan Rang. A large airlift codenamed Winter Grip was also conducted in mid-1967 to replace two Australian Army battalions, which had completed their year-long tour of duty, {{with a pair of}} fresh battalions. The Hercules were called upon to support the withdrawal of the 1st Australian Task Force (1ATF) from South Vietnam, and Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons undertook many sorties to fly equipment and personnel out of the country during 1971. In late 1972, C-130s were used to withdraw the last remaining Australian force in South Vietnam, the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam; the final elements of this force departed aboard two Hercules on 20December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{enrolled}} at the recently established University College Dublin (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French and Italian. He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken was published in The <b>Fortnightly</b> Review; {{it was his first}} publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, Tom Kettle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and Oliver St. John Gogarty. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith in his newspaper, United Irishman, in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as an English- and Irish-speaking scholar living with his mother and father, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road), Clontarf, Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Meridian {{is served}} by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city {{originally}} had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the <b>Fortnightly</b> Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Until 1980, Tharunka was {{a weekly}} newspaper, {{switching}} to a <b>fortnightly</b> magazine format from 1981. In 2004 and 2005, Tharunka returned to a tabloid newspaper format. In 2006, Tharunka returned to the <b>fortnightly</b> magazine format. Since 2013, the newspaper has been published in a tabloid newspaper format.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, Trollope, George Henry Lewes, {{and others}} founded the <b>Fortnightly</b> Review. Somewhat against Trollope's judgement, {{it was decided}} that the new {{magazine}} was always to contain a novel. Trollope, called upon to produce the first novel, wrote The Belton Estate between 30 January and 4 September 1865; it was serialised in the <b>Fortnightly</b> beginning with its first issue on 15 May 1865, and running through 1 January 1866.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{attached}} {{no great}} importance to formal syllabuses and course structures. He was {{much more interested in}} the contact between teacher and student, and brought in a system of <b>fortnightly</b> undergraduate essays which has persisted for a long time. There were <b>fortnightly</b> tutorials and weekly seminars, all supplemented by lectures. Postgraduate research was, surprisingly, not a high priority although he encouraged his younger colleagues in research, and pursued his own research with vigour and distinction.|$|E
