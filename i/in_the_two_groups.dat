5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhine {{primates}} {{were first}} grouped under the genus Lemur by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae published in 1758. At the time, only three species were recognized, {{one of which}} (the colugo) is no longer recognized as a primate. In 1785, Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert divided the genus Lemur into two genera: Prosimia for the lemurs, colugos, and tarsiers and Tardigradus for the lorises. Ten years later, É. Geoffroy and Georges Cuvier grouped the tarsiers and galagos due to similarities in their hindlimb morphology, a view supported by German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, who placed them in the family Macrotarsi while placing the lemurs and tarsiers in the family Prosimia (Prosimii) in 1811. The use of the tarsier-galago classification continued for many years until 1898, when Dutch zoologist Ambrosius Hubrecht demonstrated {{two different types of}} placentation (formation of a placenta) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Two-sample t-tests for a {{difference}} in mean involve independent samples or unpaired samples.

2500|$|A Q–Q plot is used {{to compare}} the shapes of distributions, {{providing}} a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions. [...] Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or theoretical distributions. [...] The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data {{can be viewed as a}} non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions. [...] A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing histograms of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret. [...] Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model. [...] This can provide an assessment of [...] "goodness of fit" [...] that is graphical, rather than reducing to a numerical summary. [...] Q–Q plots are also used to compare two theoretical distributions to each other. [...] Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a scatter plot, or even for the numbers of values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> being compared to be equal.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{taxonomy}} {{does not}} study criteria such as [...] "higher" [...] and [...] "lower" [...] states of development or distinctions between [...] "main" [...] and [...] "side" [...] branches—only family relationships indicated by cladistic methods are considered relevant. From {{this point of}} view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis — segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called Ecdysozoa hypothesis. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the Lophotrochozoa and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis. Proponents of this hypothesis assume that the aforementioned similarities between annelids and velvet worms either developed convergently or were primitive characteristics passed unchanged from a common ancestor to both the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> independently, while in the second case, {{it is a very}} old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group Cycloneuralia, containing the threadworms (Nematoda), horsehair worms (Nematomorpha) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons (Kinorhyncha); penis worms (Priapulida); and brush-heads (Loricifera).|$|E
6000|$|Many {{writers have}} denied the {{possibility}} of such wonderful resemblances being produced by the accumulation of fortuitous variations, but if the reader will call to mind {{the large amount of}} variability that has been shown to exist in all organisms, the exceptional power of rapid increase possessed by insects, and the tremendous struggle for existence always going on, the difficulty will vanish, especially when we remember that nature has the same fundamental groundwork to act upon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> general similarity of forms, wings of similar texture and outline, and probably some original similarity of colour and marking. Yet there is evidently considerable difficulty in the process, or with these great resources at her command nature would have produced more of these mimicking forms than she has done. One reason of this deficiency probably is, that the imitators, being always fewer in number, {{have not been able to}} keep pace with the variations of the much more numerous imitated form; another reason may be the ever-increasing acuteness of the enemies, which have again and again detected the imposture and exterminated the feeble race before it has had time to become further modified. The result of this growing acuteness of enemies has been, that those mimics that now survive exhibit, as Mr. Bates well remarks, [...] "a palpably intentional likeness that is perfectly staggering," [...] and also [...] "that those features of the portrait are most attended to by nature which produce the most effective deception when the insects are seen in nature." [...] No one, in fact, can understand the perfection of the imitation who has not seen these species in their native wilds. So complete is it in general effect that in almost every box of butterflies, brought from tropical America by amateurs, are to be found some species of the mimicking Pieridae, Erycinidae, or moths, and the mimicked Heliconidae, placed together under the impression that they are the same species. Yet more extraordinary, it sometimes deceives the very insects themselves. Mr. Trimen states that the male Danais chrysippus is sometimes deceived by the female Diadema bolina which mimics that species. Dr. Fritz Müller, writing from Brazil to Professor Meldola, says, [...] "One of the most interesting of our mimicking butterflies is Leptalis melite. The female alone of this species imitates one of our common white Pieridae, which she copies so well that even her own male is often deceived; for I have repeatedly seen the male pursuing the mimicked species, till, after closely approaching and becoming aware of his error, he suddenly returned."[100] This is evidently not a case of true mimicry, since the species imitated is not protected; but it may be that the less abundant Leptalis is able to mingle with the female Pieridae and thus obtain partial immunity from attack. Mr. Kirby of the insect department of the British Museum informs me that there are several species of South American Pieridae which the female Leptalis melite very nearly resembles. The case, however, is interesting as showing that the butterflies are themselves deceived by a resemblance which is not so great as that of some mimicking species.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effect of {{tirofiban}} combined with clopidogrel on serum inflammatory factors and coagulation functions in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: A total of 106 patients with AMI were selected and randomly divided into observation group (55 cases) and control group (51 cases). The control group was given clopidogrel based on conventional therapy, and the observation was given tirofiban based on the control group. For 2 weeks, the changes of serum inflammatory factors (TNF-α, hs-CRP, IL- 6, P-selection) and coagulation functions (PT, TT, APTT) between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> were observed. Results: After treatment, TNF-α, hs-CRP, L- 6 and P-selection levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> both decreased compared with that before treatment (P< 0. 05), TNF-α, hs-CRP, L- 6 and P-selection levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> observation group were decreased more significantly than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group (P< 0. 05). After treatment, PT, TT and APTT levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> both extended compared with that before treatment (P< 0. 05), PT, TT and APTT levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> observation group were improved more significantly than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group (P< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference}} in adverse reactions between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Tirofiban combined with clopidogrel could restrain inflammatory response and regulate coagulation functions more significant in patients with AMI, and better than that of using clopidogrel alone...|$|R
