5|$|There {{are several}} {{experimental}} therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including <b>immunologic,</b> hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the Her2 protein, {{has been used}} in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. <b>Immunologic</b> therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of <b>immunologic</b> defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
25|$|The tetragametic {{state has}} {{important}} implications for organ or stem-cell transplantation. Chimeras typically have <b>immunologic</b> tolerance to both cell lines.|$|E

25|$|Recently, SDSE {{has been}} linked to post-streptococcal {{glomerulonephritis}} and acute rheumatic fever. These <b>immunologic</b> sequelae have previously only been associated with Streptococcus pyogenes.|$|E
25|$|Simplest {{classification}} tree: SLE {{is diagnosed}} {{if a person}} has an <b>immunologic</b> disorder (anti-DNA antibody, anti-Smith antibody, false positive syphilis test, or LE cells) or malar rash. It has sensitivity = 92% and specificity = 92%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immunologic</b> disorder: Positive anti-Smith, anti-ds DNA, antiphospholipid antibody, and/or false {{positive}} serological test for syphilis; sensitivity = 85%; specificity = 93%. Presence of anti-ss DNA in 70% of cases (though also positive with rheumatic disease and healthy persons).|$|E
25|$|HLA {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} not naturally occurring, and {{with few exceptions}} are formed {{as a result of}} an <b>immunologic</b> challenge to a foreign material containing non-self HLAs via blood transfusion, pregnancy (paternally inherited antigens), or organ or tissue transplant.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of chickenpox is primarily {{based on the}} signs and symptoms, with typical early symptoms followed by a characteristic rash. Confirmation of the diagnosis is by examination of the fluid within the vesicles of the rash, or by testing blood for evidence of an acute <b>immunologic</b> response.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{compounds}} {{found in}} mushrooms, primarily polysaccharides, can up-regulate {{the immune system}} and may have anti-cancer properties. For example, beta-glucans such as lentinan have been shown in laboratory studies to stimulate macrophage, NK cells, T cells and immune system cytokines and have been investigated in clinical trials as <b>immunologic</b> adjuvants.|$|E
25|$|P. aeruginosa {{uses the}} {{virulence}} factor exotoxin A to inactivate eukaryotic elongation factor 2 via ADP-ribosylation {{in the host}} cell, much as the diphtheria toxin does. Without elongation factor 2, eukaryotic cells cannot synthesize proteins and necrotise. The release of intracellular contents induces an <b>immunologic</b> response in immunocompetent patients.|$|E
25|$|L. paracasei is a {{constituent}} in the therapeutic, nutritional treatment VSL#3. This proprietary, standardized, formulation of live bacteria {{may be used}} in combination with conventional therapies to treat ulcerative colitis. A systematic review provided significant evidence of beneficial clinical and <b>immunologic</b> effects of Lactobacillus paracasei LP-33 strains in the treatment of Allergic rhinitis.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is {{the most}} {{important}} human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, <b>immunologic,</b> and homeostatic functions. Various synthetic glucocorticoids are available; these are widely utilized in general medical practice and numerous specialties either as replacement therapy in glucocorticoid deficiency or to suppress the immune system.|$|E
25|$|Acquired {{angioedema}} (AAE) can be <b>immunologic,</b> nonimmunologic, or idiopathic. It {{is usually}} caused by allergy and occurs {{together with other}} allergic symptoms and urticaria. It can also occur as a side effect to certain medications, particularly ACE inhibitors. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of swelling, frequently of the face, lips, tongue, limbs, and genitals. Edema of the gastrointestinal mucosa typically leads to severe abdominal pain; in the upper respiratory tract, it can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|The {{peoples of}} other continents (sub-Saharan Africans, Native Americans, Ab{{original}} Australians and New Guineans, {{and the original}} inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous Khoisan peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and Bantu. He believes {{this is due to}} these societies' technologic and <b>immunologic</b> advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{pathology}} (Commonwealth) or Anatomic pathology (U.S.) is {{a medical}} specialty that {{is concerned with the}} diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, <b>immunologic</b> and molecular examination of organs and tissues. Over the last century, surgical pathology has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology. Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovan Battista Morgagni from Forlì.|$|E
25|$|To reduce murine {{antibody}} immunogenicity (attacks by {{the immune}} system against the antibody), murine molecules were engineered to remove immunogenic content and to increase <b>immunologic</b> efficiency. This was initially achieved by the production of chimeric (suffix -ximab) and humanized antibodies (suffix -zumab). Chimeric antibodies are composed of murine variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Taking human gene sequences from the kappa light chain and the IgG1 heavy chain results in antibodies that are approximately 65% human. This reduces immunogenicity, and thus increases serum half-life.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{of breast}} milk's {{properties}} are understood, but its nutrient content is relatively consistent. Breast milk {{is made from}} nutrients in the mother's bloodstream and bodily stores. Breast milk has an optimal balance of fat, sugar, water, and protein that is needed for a baby's growth and development. Breastfeeding triggers biochemical reactions which allows for the enzymes, hormones, growth factors and <b>immunologic</b> substances to effectively defend against infectious diseases for the infant. The breastmilk also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development.|$|E
25|$|When {{the kidneys}} {{are no longer}} able to sustain the demands of the body, end-stage kidney failure is said to have occurred. Without renal {{replacement}} therapy, death from kidney failure will eventually result. Dialysis is an artificial method of replacing some kidney function to prolong life. Renal transplantation replaces kidney function by inserting into the body a healthier kidney from an organ donor and inducing <b>immunologic</b> tolerance of that organ with immunosuppression. At present, renal transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage kidney failure although its worldwide availability is limited by lack of availability of donor organs.|$|E
25|$|The cornea has unmyelinated {{nerve endings}} {{sensitive}} to touch, temperature and chemicals; {{a touch of}} the cornea causes an involuntary reflex to close the eyelid. Because transparency is of prime importance, the cornea does not have blood vessels. Instead, oxygen dissolves in tears and then diffuses throughout the cornea to keep it healthy. Similarly, nutrients are transported via diffusion from the tear fluid through the outside surface and the aqueous humour through the inside surface, and also from neurotrophins supplied by nerve fibres that innervate it. In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5mm and a thickness of 0.5–0.6mm in the center and 0.6–0.8mm at the periphery. Transparency, avascularity, the presence of immature resident immune cells, and <b>immunologic</b> privilege makes the cornea a very special tissue.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium {{compounds}} {{are used}} as <b>immunologic</b> adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of many vaccines. The aluminium apparently simulates or causes small amounts of tissue damage, driving the body to respond more powerfully to what it sees as a serious infection and promoting {{the development of a}} lasting immune response. In some cases these compounds have been associated with redness, itching, and low-grade fever, but the use of aluminium in vaccines has not been associated with serious adverse events. In some cases, aluminium-containing vaccines are associated with macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF), localized microscopic lesions containing aluminium salts that persist for up to 8 years. However, recent case-controlled studies have found no specific clinical symptoms in individuals with biopsies showing MMF, and {{there is no evidence that}} aluminium-containing vaccines are a serious health risk or justify changes to immunization practice.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmunity is {{possible}} cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In {{the case of}} an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression. Autoimmune disease may cause genetic abnormalities in embryos which in turn may lead to miscarriage. As an example, Celiac disease increases the risk of miscarriage by an odds ratio of approximately 1.4. A disruption in normal immune function can lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. This will effect the ability to continue the pregnancy and if a woman has repeated miscarriages, she can be tested for it. Approximately 15% of recurrent miscarriages are related to <b>immunologic</b> factors. The presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies is associated with an increased risk with an odds ratio of 3.73 and 95% confidence interval 1.8–7.6. Having Lupus also increases the risk for miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|Myasthenia gravis {{is another}} common {{autoimmune}} disease. This disease causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The disease occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human acetylcholine receptor. The receptor contains a seven {{amino acid sequence}} (Trp-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Gly-Thr-Lys) in the α-subunit that demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with a shared immunodominant domain of gpD of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Similar to HIV-1, gpD also aids in binding to chemokines on the cell surface of the host to gain entry into the host. Cross-reactivity of the self epitope (α-subunit of the receptor) with antibodies produced against HSV suggests that the virus {{is associated with the}} initiation of myasthenia gravis. Not only does HSV cause <b>immunologic</b> cross-reactivity, but the gpD peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of antibody made against the α-subunit to its corresponding peptide on the α-subunit. Despite this, an autoimmune response still occurs. This further shows an immunologically significant sequence homology to the biologically active site of the human acetylcholine receptor.|$|E
25|$|Normally {{metabolizing}} {{tooth root}} cells have an internal cell pressure (osmolality) of 280-300 mOs and a pH of 7.2. When {{there is an}} uninterrupted blood supply, all of the metabolites (calcium, phosphate, potassium) and glucose that the cells require are provided. When the tooth is knocked-out, this normal blood supply is cut off and within 15 minutes most of the stored metabolites have been depleted and the cells will begin to die. Within one to two hours, enough cells will die that rejection of the tooth by the body {{at a later time}} is the usual outcome. The method by which the body rejects the replanted tooth is a process called “replacement root resorption”. During this process, the tooth root cells become necrotic (dead) and will activate the <b>immunologic</b> mechanism of the body to attempt to remove this necrotic layer and literally eats away the tooth root. This is called “root resorption” It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by x-rays for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed ankylosis) attaches the tooth firmly to the jaw bone and stops normal tooth eruption and impedes normal jaw growth.|$|E
25|$|All {{individuals}} with A-T {{should have at}} least one comprehensive <b>immunologic</b> evaluation that measures the number and type of lymphocytes in the blood (T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes), the levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and antibody responses to T-dependent (e.g., tetanus, Hemophilus influenzae b) and T-independent (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide) vaccines. For the most part, the pattern of immunodeficiency seen in an A-T patient early in life (by age five) will be the same pattern seen throughout the lifetime of that individual. Therefore, the tests need not be repeated unless that individual develops more problems with infection. Problems with immunity sometimes can be overcome by immunization. Vaccines against common bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Hemophilus influenzae, pneumococci and influenza virus (the “flu”) are commercially available and often help to boost antibody responses, even in {{individuals with}} low immunoglobulin levels. If the vaccines do not work and the patient continues to have problems with infections, gamma globulin therapy (IV or subcutaneous infusions of antibodies collected from normal individuals) may be of benefit. A small number of people with A-T develop an abnormality in which one or more types of immunoglobulin are increased far beyond the normal range. In a few cases, the immunoglobulin levels can be increased so much that the blood becomes thick and does not flow properly. Therapy for this problem must be tailored to the specific abnormality found and its severity.|$|E
500|$|PFAPA {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} condition that tends to occur in children. The name stands for [...] "periodic fever, aphthae, pharyngitis (sore throat) and cervical adenitis" [...] (inflammation of the lymph nodes in the neck). The fevers occur periodically about every 3–5 weeks. The condition appears to improve with tonsillectomy or immunosuppression, suggesting an <b>immunologic</b> cause.|$|E

2500|$|To {{ensure that}} the person has lupus and not another {{autoimmune}} disease, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) established a list of clinical and <b>immunologic</b> criteria that, in any combination, point to SLE. [...] The criteria include symptoms that the person can identify (e.g. pain) and things that a physician can detect in a physical examination and through laboratory test results. [...] The list was originally compiled in 1971, initially revised in 1982, and further revised and improved in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Metal {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a well-established}} phenomenon and is common, affecting about 10–15% of the population. Contact with metals can cause immune reactions such as skin hives, eczema, redness and itching. Although {{little is known}} about the short- and long-term pharmacodynamics and bioavailability of circulating metal degradation products in vivo, there have been many reports of <b>immunologic</b> type responses temporally associated with implantation of metal components. [...] Individual case reports link hypersensitivity immune reactions with adverse performance of metallic clinical cardiovascular, orthopedic and plastic surgical and dental implants.|$|E
2500|$|An open-label Phase II {{clinical}} trial studying {{the use of}} red blood cells (erythrocytes) loaded with dexamethasone sodium phosphate found that this treatment improved symptoms {{and appeared to be}} well tolerated. This treatment uses a unique delivery system for medication by using the patient's own red blood cells as the delivery vehicle for the drug. Given the other <b>immunologic</b> deficits present in individuals with A-T, there remains a need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of steroids further, particularly with [...] respect to the duration of any benefit and its long-term safety.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the course}} of the past {{influenza}} pandemics and the current influenza epizootic there has been evidence of family clusters of disease. [...] Kandun, et al. found that family clusters in Indonesia in 2005 resulted in mild, severe and fatal cases among family members. [...] The findings from this study raise questions about genetic or other predispositions and how they affect a persons susceptibility to and severity of disease. [...] Continued research will be needed to determine the epidemiology of H5N1 infection and whether genetic, behavioral, <b>immunologic,</b> and environmental factors contribute to case clustering.|$|E
2500|$|MHC class II can be conditionally {{expressed}} by all cell types, but normally occurs only on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs): macrophages, B cells, and especially dendritic cells (DCs). An APC takes up an antigen, performs antigen processing, and returns a molecular fraction of it—a fraction termed the epitope—to the APC's surface, coupled within an MHC class II molecule mediating antigen presentation by displaying this epitope. [...] On the cell's surface, the epitope can contact its cognate region on <b>immunologic</b> structures recognizing that epitope. [...] That molecular region which binds to—or, in jargon, ligates—the epitope is the paratope.|$|E
2500|$|Anatomical {{pathology}} (Commonwealth) or anatomic pathology (United States) is {{a medical}} specialty that {{is concerned with the}} diagnosis of disease based on the gross, microscopic, chemical, <b>immunologic</b> and molecular examination of organs, tissues, and whole bodies (as in a general examination or an autopsy). [...] Anatomical pathology is itself divided into subfields, the main divisions being surgical pathology, cytopathology, and forensic pathology. Anatomical pathology is one of two main divisions of the medical practice of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids and tissues. Sometimes, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} vaccine {{overload}} is flawed on several levels. Despite {{the increase in}} the number of vaccines over recent decades, improvements in vaccine design have reduced the <b>immunologic</b> load from vaccines; the total number of immunological components in the 14 vaccines administered to US children in 2009 is less than 10% of what it was in the 7 vaccines given in 1980. A study published in 2013 found no correlation between autism and the antigen number in the vaccines the children were administered up to the age of two. Of the 1,008 children in the study, one quarter of those diagnosed with autism were born between 1994 and 1999, when the routine vaccine schedule could contain more than 3,000 antigens (in a single shot of DTP vaccine). The vaccine schedule in 2012 contains several more vaccines, but the number of antigens the child is exposed to by the age of two is 315. Vaccines pose a very small <b>immunologic</b> load compared to the pathogens naturally encountered by a child in a typical year; common childhood conditions such as fevers and middle-ear infections pose a much greater challenge to the immune system than vaccines, and studies have shown that vaccinations, even multiple concurrent vaccinations, do not weaken the immune system or compromise overall immunity. The lack of evidence supporting the vaccine overload hypothesis, combined with these findings directly contradicting it, has led to the conclusion that currently recommended vaccine programs do not [...] "overload" [...] or weaken the immune system.|$|E
