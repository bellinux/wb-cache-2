5|$|The {{aging of}} adult skeletons {{is not as}} {{straightforward}} as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached. One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton {{is to look at}} bone osteons under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones. The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.|$|E
25|$|For this viewpoint, {{one should}} {{consider}} how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where they are so far apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they are so far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> states in the Heisenberg picture that {{in the distant past}} had the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.|$|E
25|$|The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathele hochstetteri) {{is among}} New Zealand’s largest spiders, growing up to 20mm in body length, and is endemic to New Zealand. The {{easiest way to}} {{distinguish}} a banded tunnelweb spider <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the chevron design on its abdomen. The chevron pattern is described as being yellowish, whilst {{the rest of the}} abdomen is a darker brown colour. They also have an orange-brown carapace, and six spinnerets. It is these six spinnerets that ultimately distinguish Hexathele hochstetteri from other genera of Hexathelidae, such as Porrhothele, as they only have four spinnerets. Female banded tunnelweb spider eyes occupy around half their head space, whereas males differ, having slightly smaller lateral eyes.|$|E

2500|$|This {{has led to}} a lot of {{confusion}} regarding the identification of actual No. 5 Mk I [...] "Jungle Carbine" [...] rifles, as opposed to the post-war civilian sporting rifles marketed under the same name. The easiest way to identify a [...] "Jungle Carbine" [...] rifle <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the markings on the left hand side of the receiver; a genuine No. 5 will have [...] "Rifle No 5 Mk I" [...] electrostencilled there, while a post-war conversion will generally have either no markings or markings from manufacturers who did not make the No. 5 Mk I (for example, Savage or Long Branch). Santa Fe [...] "Jungle Carbine" [...] rifles are so marked on the barrel.|$|E
2500|$|Human embryos develop {{similarly}} for {{the first}} six weeks, regardless of genetic sex (46,XX or 46,XY karyotype); the only way {{to tell the difference between}} 46,XX or 46,XY embryos during this time period <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> Barr bodies or a Y chromosome. [...] The gonads begin as bulges of tissue called the genital ridges at the back of the abdominal cavity, near the midline. [...] By the fifth week, the genital ridges differentiate into an outer cortex and an inner , and are called indifferent gonads. [...] By the sixth week, the indifferent gonads begin to differentiate according to genetic sex. [...] If the karyotype is 46,XY, testes develop due to the influence of the Y chromosome’s SRY gene. [...] This process does not require the presence of androgen, nor a functional androgen receptor.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the attacks}} Abu Bakar Bashir, who {{is alleged to}} be JI's spiritual leader, {{released}} a statement from his prison cell, condemning the attack.

He said: [...] "I suggest the government bring themselves closer to God by implementing his rules and laws because these happenings are warnings from God for all of us." [...] In an interview with Scott Atran from his cell in Cipinang Prison, Jakarta, Bashir said: [...] "I call those who carried out these actions all mujahid. They all had a good intention, that is, Jihad in Allah’s way, the aim of the jihad <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> blessing from Allah.

2500|$|How then, are [...] "fictitious" [...] {{forces to}} be {{separated}} from [...] "real" [...] forces? It is hard to apply the Newtonian definition of an inertial frame without this separation. For example, consider a stationary object in an inertial frame. Being at rest, no net force is applied. But in a frame rotating about a fixed axis, the object appears to move in a circle, and is subject to centripetal force (which is made up of the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). How can we decide that the rotating frame is a non-inertial frame? There are two approaches to this resolution: one approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the origin of the fictitious forces (the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). We will find there are no sources for these forces, no associated force carriers, no originating bodies. A second approach is to look at a variety of frames of reference. For any inertial frame, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force disappear, so application of the principle of special relativity would identify these frames where the forces disappear as sharing the same and the simplest physical laws, and hence rule that the rotating frame is not an inertial frame.|$|E
2500|$|Astronomy is very {{sensitive}} to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what {{can be seen from}} dark skies. Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas. Some astronomers use narrow-band [...] "nebula filters" [...] which only allow specific wavelengths of light commonly seen in nebulae, or broad-band [...] "light pollution filters" [...] which are designed to reduce (but not eliminate) the effects of light pollution by filtering out spectral lines commonly emitted by sodium- and mercury-vapor lamps, thus enhancing contrast and improving the view of dim objects such as galaxies and nebulae. Unfortunately these light pollution reduction (LPR) filters are not a cure for light pollution. LPR filters reduce the brightness of the object under study and this limits the use of higher magnifications. LPR filters work by blocking light of certain wavelengths, which alters the color of the object, often creating a pronounced green cast. Furthermore, LPR filters only work on certain object types (mainly emission nebulae) and are of little use on galaxies and stars. No filter can match the effectiveness of a dark sky for visual or photographic purposes. Due to their low surface brightness, the visibility of diffuse sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies is affected by light pollution more than are stars. Most such objects are rendered invisible in heavily light polluted skies around major cities. A simple method for estimating the darkness of a location <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the Milky Way, which from truly dark skies appears bright enough to cast a shadow.|$|E

60|$|Consciously or unconsciously, men {{are proud}} of their firmness, steadfastness of purpose, {{directness}} of aim.

They walk the road of life, the road fenced in by their tastes, prejudices, disdains or enthusiasms, generally honest, invariably stupid, and {{are proud of}} never losing their way. If they do stop, it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a moment over the hedges that make them safe, to look at the misty valleys, at the distant peaks, at cliffs and morasses, at the dark forests and the hazy plains where other human beings grope their days painfully away, stumbling over the bones of the wise, over the unburied remains of their predecessors who died alone, in gloom or in sunshine, halfway from anywhere. The man of purpose does not understand, and goes on, full of contempt. He never loses his way. He knows where he is going and what he wants. Travelling on, he achieves great length without any breadth, and battered, besmirched, and weary, he touches the goal at last; he grasps the reward of his perseverance, of his virtue, of his healthy optimism: an untruthful tombstone over a dark and soon forgotten grave.|$|E
6000|$|... "At last I {{got down}} near the water. Just {{at the head of}} the bay was a {{shelving}} shore, and along at the sides, as far as I could see it was rocky, and there were plenty of seals here too. Along on the beach and on the rock and on the terraces were quantities of birds--penguins, as I knew from what I had heard of them. They did not try to get out of my way, but just made an angry sort of noise. 'I will talk to you presently, my hearties,' I said; 'what I have got to do now <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a shelter.' It was the end of April, and I knew that it would not be long before winter would be upon me, and if I was not out of it by that time I should soon be frozen stiff.

Underneath this the rock had crumbled away perhaps six feet in depth.|$|E
6000|$|The {{public had}} been alarmed this morning, by rumours of an {{intention}} {{on the part}} of government to declare Paris in a state of siege, which is tantamount to bringing us all under martial law. This savours more of the regime Napoleon, than of the promised liberty that was to emanate from the three days. The opposition are beginning to examine the charter, in order to ascertain what their rights are on paper: but what avails a written compact, or indeed any other compact, against the wants and wishes of those who have the power? The Cour de Cassation, however, is said to be composed of a majority of Carlists, and, by way of commentary on the wants of the last two years, the friends of liberty have some hopes yet from these nominees of the Bourbons! We live in a droll world, dear ----, and one scarcely knows on which side he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> protection, among the political weathercocks of the period. In order to comprehend the point, you will understand that a clause of the charter expressly stipulates that no one shall be condemned by any [...] "but his natural judges," [...] which clearly means that no extraordinary or unusual courts shall be established for the punishment of ordinary crimes. Now, while it is admitted that martial law brings with it military tribunals and military punishments, it is contended that there is no pretext for declaring martial law in the capital, at a moment when the power of the present government is better assured than it has been at any time since its organization. But the charter solemnly stipulates that the conscription shall be abolished, while conscripts are and have been regularly drafted yearly, ever since the signature of Louis XVIII. was affixed to the instrument.|$|E
