30|$|To {{verify the}} {{stability}} of radiolabelled AAZTA-MG, tests were performed in the following four different media: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) solutions in 1000 -fold excess over the peptide, human plasma and PBS as control. The labelling solution was diluted to 1  mL and 50  μL of that solution incubated with 150  μL of the challenging solution. After 60, 120 and 240  min, 5  μL of the sample were analysed by TLC with citrate buffer (0.21  g/mL, pH[*]=[*] 5) as mobile phase. The strips were cut into three evenly <b>divided</b> <b>pieces</b> and measured in a gamma counter to determine the free radioligand (solvent front) to labelled peptide (origin) ratio.|$|R

5|$|Hindman's edicts, however, {{raised the}} ire of the local citizenry, and his {{political}} enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent Theophilus H. Holmes. Hindman convinced Holmes {{to give him a}} field command in northern Arkansas, and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the <b>divided</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePeer-to-peer content {{distribution}} {{systems have}} been enjoying great popularity, and are now gaining momentum {{as a means of}} disseminating video streams over the Internet. In many of these protocols, including the popular BitTorrent, content is split into mostly fixed-size pieces, allowing a client to download data from many peers simultaneously. This makes piece size potentially critical for performance. However, previous research efforts have largely overlooked this parameter, opting to focus on others instead. This paper presents the results of real experiments with varying piece sizes on a controlled BitTorrent testbed. We demonstrate that this parameter is indeed critical, as it determines the degree of parallelism in the system, and we investigate optimal piece sizes for distributing small and large content. We also pinpoint a related design trade-off, and explain how BitTorrent's choice of <b>dividing</b> <b>pieces</b> into subpieces attempts to address it...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} kinds of {{partition}} which can be awarded by court: partition in kind, partition by allotment, and partition by sale. A partition in kind is {{a division of the}} property itself among the co-owners. Partition in kind is a default method of property partition. In a partition by allotment, which is not available in all jurisdictions, the court awards full ownership of the land to a single owner or subset of owners, and orders them to pay the person or persons divested of ownership for the interest awarded. Partition by sale constitutes a forced sale of the land, followed by division of the profits thus realized among the tenants. Generally, the court is supposed to order a partition sale only if the land cannot be physically divided, although this determination often rests on whether the economic value of the <b>divided</b> <b>pieces</b> is less in the aggregate than the value of the parcel as a single piece.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} some {{techniques for}} constructing panoramic image stitching from sequences of images captured by cameras from different angle in garment and textile research area. The image stitching representation associates a transformation matrix with each input image. In this paper, an improved SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm {{was used to}} locate the feature points in the scanned images targeting at the problem of automatically stitching of textile images which were scanned in <b>divided</b> <b>pieces.</b> RANSAC (random sample consensus) method is proposed to to estimate image transformation parameters and {{to find a solution}} that has the best consensus with the data. Techniques for estimating and rening camera focal lengths are also presented. In order to reduce accumulated registration errors, global alignment (block adjustment) method is proposed for the whole sequence of images, which results in an optimally registered image stitching. A local alignment technique is also developed which warps each image {{based on the results of}} pairwise local image registrations to compensate for small amounts of motion parallax introduced by translations of the camera and other unmodeled distortions...|$|R
40|$|Evidence-based {{software}} engineering {{has emerged as}} {{an important part of}} {{software engineering}}. The need for empirical evaluation and hence evidence has grown {{in the last couple of}} decades when developing new models, methods, techniques and tools in research. Furthermore, industrial decision-making ought to become more evidence-based. The objective here is to develop and present an evidence-based profile, which could be used to <b>divide</b> <b>pieces</b> of evidence into different types and hence creating an overall picture of evidence in a specific case. The evidence profile is developed in such a way that it allows evidence to be judged in context. The evidence profile consists of five types of evidence, and the profile is illustrated for perspective-based reading. It is shown how pieces of evidence can be classified into the different types. It is concluded that this type of approach may be useful to capture the evidence with respect to a specific topic and in a specific context. The further work includes applying the evidence profile for evidence collected from different type of studies and contexts...|$|R
