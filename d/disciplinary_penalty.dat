40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to more {{important}} legal instruments {{in the sphere of}} personnel policy towards academic teachers provided for by the Law of May 4, 1982, and especially by its amendment of July 25, 1985. The article is centered on the issues of qualification requirements, appointing to a university post, periodical evaluations of work results, promoting, transfering to another school or scientific institution, the termination of employment and the realization of some employée's rights. The authors indicate that with respect to the above issues, also the chief organs of state administration, especially Minister of Science and Schooling of Academic Rank and Ministers supervising particular types of schools, are the subjects of personnel policy. However, most of the powers are vested in bodies acting within a given school, primarily in one-person organs (Rector, Deans) or — to some extent — in collective bodies (Senate, Faculty Councils). By virtue of the amendment of 1985, the status of subjects of personnel policy is vested also in the school's appropriate political parties' instances. They are entitled to decide jointly with the rector in the matters of the school's personnel policy, yet the above cannot be identified with an individual decision to employ or to fire a given person. However, the amendment did nor reintroduce the powers as to the personnel policy which were vested in trade unions in years 1972 - 1982. The authors reach the conclusion that the powers of the subjects of personnel Policy are {{for the most part the}} object of their imperative legal duties. However, in the authors' opinion the provisions of the Law often leave too much discretion, especially with respect to termination of employment, which may occur either by way of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>penalty</b> imposed by a disciplinary board or by means of the minister's or rector's decision. In order to avoid the abuse of the said discretion and to use it for rationalizing the personnel policy, and especially for integrating the academic community, the purposes of the Law and the individual circumstances should be taken into account in the process of applying the Law, together with good academic customs, which must be considered the concretization of the Law's provisions.

50|$|Prior to 1864, {{there was}} no bar association. There were scriveners (стряпчии), {{who did not have}} to satisfy any {{requirements}} and had very limited powers. The aim of the bar (Корпорация присяжных поверенных; barrister: присяжный поверенный) was to guarantee that each defendant would have access to qualified legal assistance. Also, one of the tasks of the bar was to give free legal advice to the poor. The bar was an independent corporation which had its own administration in each guberniya (Council of Barristers - Совет присяжных поверенных), which dealt with various organizational matters, imposed various <b>disciplinary</b> <b>penalties</b> on its members (expulsion was common). In 1874 their powers were transferred to local courts, and the independence of the bar was reduced.

Toronto Mayor David Miller, contrary to pro-union inclinations of the past, introduced the idea of prosecuting the Amalgamated Transit Union; a strategic move that paralleled the opinions of his constituents.

This externalized approach to dealing with lost revenue was inspired by a similar event that erupted in New York City during the winter of 2005. New York’s transit strike ended with a union boss being given a short prison sentence, while the union itself was fined for the economic disruption it caused. Kinnear brushed off suggestions that he too was in line for incarceration. Instead, he embraced the idea, signifying his willingness to act as the union’s martyr.|$|R

In March Şahin was denied access to a written examination {{on one of the}} subjects she was studying because was wearing the Islamic headscarf. Subsequently the university authorities refused, on the same grounds, to allow her to enrol her in a course, or to admit her to various lectures and a written examination.

40|$|Despite {{our best}} efforts, {{plagiarism}} {{continues to be}} a major concern. For many, the response is to intensify <b>disciplinary</b> <b>penalties</b> and enhance the use of detection software and deterrents. Although these can help, they do not address the most common causes of plagiarism, namely poor academic practice. To address this, a different tactic is required in which educational development is promoted as the key to enhancing academic integrity. In response to this, the UK Open University created the Developing good academic practices website to enable its learners irrespective of prior educational experience, level and/or area of study to better understand issues around plagiarism and become more confident and competent learners. Using a constructivist approach, the site emphasises academic skills development rather than focusing on plagiarism, while interactive quizzes integrated throughout the site, allow learners to test their knowledge, understanding and application, in ways that best suit their needs. This session will consider key logistic and pedagogical difficulties encountered while creating a resource that operates effectively at the institutional level, while simultaneously addressing discipline-specific needs and maintaining a sense of relevance for all its potential users. Insights into the types of learner proactively using this resource will be used to identify ways of encouraging others to engage, before highlighting some innovative uses being made by learners to inform and adapt their academic practices. Final considerations will be given to how this study can inform the wider educational environment to help develop an honest and open culture of academic integrity for all...|$|R

Delbrück vigorously opposed the policy of the Prussian government in dealing with the Danes and the Poles, with the result that he was twice subjected to <b>disciplinary</b> <b>penalties</b> as a professor and therefore, in Prussia, a civil servant. But it was his main role as editor of Preussen Jahrbücher that provided a platform for a growing interest in Germany's diplomatic relationship with Russia. [...] This took the form of a roving commission to Herr Paul Rohrbacher to enquire about German opinion. The findings from the 1890s tours formed a racial policy of dismemberment of Russia by seizing Slavic territory that belonged to them. The controversialist Fritz Fischer argued that they were socialists forcing extremists into the hands of revolutionaries. At an early stage of World War I, he became pessimistic regarding the possibility of any real success for Germany except by military and political strategy and tactics of a purely defensive character. He was, on tactical rather than on moral grounds, a strenuous opponent of intensified submarine warfare, and did not conceal his conviction that the result of this method of warfare would ultimately be the intervention of America. He {{was a member of the}} German Delegation during the Versailles Peace Conference that ended World War I where he mainly endeavoured to prove that Germany could not be made solely responsible for the outbreak of war.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{of health care}} professionals who are incompetent, impaired, exploitative or have criminal intent is important for public safety. It is unclear whether psychiatrists {{are more likely to}} commit medical misconduct offences than non-psychiatrists, and if the nature of these offences is different. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the characteristics of psychiatrists disciplined in Canada and the nature of their offences and disciplinary sentences for the ten years from 2000 through 2009 to other physicians disciplined during that timeframe. Utilizing a retrospective cohort design, we constructed a database of all physicians disciplined by provincial licensing authorities in Canada for the ten years from 2000 through 2009. Demographic variables and information on type of misconduct violation and penalty imposed were also collected for each physician disciplined. We compared psychiatrists to non-psychiatrists for the various outcomes. There were 82 (14 %) psychiatrists of 606 physicians disciplined in Canada in the ten years from 2000 through 2009, double the national proportion of psychiatrists. Of those disciplined psychiatrists, 8 (9. 6 %) were women compared to 29 % in the national cohort. A total of 5 (6 %) psychiatrists committed at least two separate offenses, accounting for approximately 11 % of the total violations. A higher proportion of psychiatrists were disciplined for sexual misconduct (OR 3. 62 [95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 2. 45 - 5. 34]), fraudulent behavior (OR 2. 32 [95 % CI 1. 20 - 4. 40]) and unprofessional conduct (OR 3. 1 [95 % CI 1. 95 - 4. 95]). As a result, psychiatrists had between 1. 85 - 4. 35 greater risk of having <b>disciplinary</b> <b>penalties</b> in almost all categories in comparison to other physicians. Psychiatrists differ from non-psychiatrist physicians in the prevalence and nature of medical misconduct.

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} in {{the article}} {{the concept of a}} person equivalent to a public servant defined in paragraph 3 Article 230 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania, in order to determine if a physician who has improperly provided individual health care services through negligence {{is considered to be a}} person equivalent to a public servant for the purpose of Article 230 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania, i. e. if he can be the entity of failure to perform official duties (Article 229 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania). Introduction: The patient and the physician are linked by the obligation, the content of which includes the physician‘s duty to ensure that this obligation is carried out by adding the maximum effort, i. e. ensuring maximum degree of attention, diligence, prudence and proficiency. The physician who has breached that duty shall, inter alia, compensate for damages. In addition, the physician may be subject to disciplinary liability and/or to criminal liability as ultima ratio measure in the event of particularly grave violation of the duties causing serious consequences. Thus, although the physician‘s professional liability (compensation for damages caused) issue should be, first of all, resolved using civil law instruments, and only when it is found that results can not be achieved with other instruments (administrative, <b>disciplinary,</b> civil <b>penalties</b> and public exposure means) unrelated to application of criminal penalties, criminal liability should be applied. However, the cases where application of criminal liability to the physician as prima- or even solo ratio is sought regardless of the scale of the physician‘s failure to perform his duty and dangerousness of the act are becoming increasingly common in practice. Application of criminal liability as prima- or even solo ratio is extremely facilitated by Article 229 ―Failure to Perform Official Duties‖ 138 of the Criminal Code of the Republic...|$|R
40|$|The {{enactment}} of a disciplinary action in Saudi Arabia {{was aimed at}} protecting client interests and safeguarding {{the integrity of the}} legal profession. This, however, raises the question of the importance of disciplinary liability for lawyers in Saudi Arabia. The next fundamental questions are as follows: What are the procedures for disciplinary action? What authority is in charge of suing for disciplinary action? Which authority considers <b>disciplinary</b> action? What <b>penalties</b> are imposed during disciplinary action? In what ways can disciplinary-action decisions be appealed? The quintessence of this dissertation is to address the abovementioned issues. First, this dissertation focuses on the legal profession in Saudi Arabia by comparing it with that of Kuwait and the UAE. Second, the dissertation argues what disciplinary liability is and how it should be carried out. As a consequence, it asserts that disciplinary action ought to retain a vital role in regulating violations of the duties and obligations of the legal profession. After demonstrating the need for strengthening disciplinary liability in Saudi Arabia, the dissertation ventures into the explication of disciplinary-action articles in the Code of Law Practice that was issued in 2001. As such, its major focus is on Articles 29 – 37. These explicate the definition of disciplinary liability, disciplinary procedures, disciplinary-liability punishments, and how to appeal a disciplinary-liability decision. In view of the unique conclusions made in the dissertation, a few recommendations for the future are made...|$|R
40|$|Dans le présent article, l'auteur étudie le régime du règlement des conflits d'ordre disciplinaire au Québec. En analyse les sources, les principes généraux ainsi que les différentes techniques, arbitrales et judiciaires qui y ont cours présentement. Il fait, à l'occasion, les comparaisons qui s'imposent à l'égard du droit français du Travail en la matière. In Quebec, {{as in the}} Anglo Canadian provinces {{governed by}} British Common Law, there exists no {{specific}} provision concerning the disciplinary powers of the employer in labour relations. In Anglo Canadian Common Law {{as well as in}} Quebec Civil Law, the employer's disciplinary powers have been implicitly considered as naturally added to the individual labour contract. The present sources of the employer's disciplinary power are: the individual labour contract, the interior settlement policy of the firm, collective agreements and statutory labour laws. Whatever may be the theory, (contractual or statutory) adopted to analyse the disciplinary functions of business management, there remains in practice that wherever there is no collective agreement, the general principles governing these functions are reduced to what seems a trifle: it is the relations based on force, the « power » relations, that control in fact management's supremacy in a given field, under the benevolent protection of the laws concerning the traditional labour contract. Thus, {{in the vast majority of}} dismissal cases in the traditional organization, the matter of the necessary « cause » is not even contemplated. The real distinction between penalty dismissal and dismissal under the right of unilateral annulment was brought, so to speak, by unionism and collective bargaining. These requirements of collective bargaining relating to the employer's disciplinary powers have brought, as a result, the formulation and the application, by our arbitration tribunals, of a certain number of general principles that may be stated as follows. In the first place, the chief of a business is explicitely allowed the right to pass and to enforce rules of conduct, for the direction of his business, to which are submitted the employees, and to sanction such rules by means of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>penalties,</b> if necessary. In applying these penalties, the employer must however proceed « reasonnably » and according to equity. To this end, he cannot act but for a suqicient cause, taking the circumstances into consideration in each case. Consequently, this requires that the investigation of disciplinary faults be done under equity rather than under the rule of strict law. Thus, not only must there be fault or breach of duty on the employee's part, but moreover, the sanction must be appropriate to the gravity, somewhat like in penal law. It is thus principally concerning the notion of disciplinary fault, the possible corresponding sanctions, and the appraisal, the supervision and the revision of sanctions, that the general principles derived from arbitration practice in Quebec differ from and even are opposed to those of Common Law. The disciplinary fault is no longer considered as emanating from the labour contract. It may vary infinitely, but must, necessarily, be considered in relation with its effects on the common good of the labour society made up by the establishment or the business. Thus, to become the object of disciplinary sanctions, an employee's action, if it is done outside the place and the hours of work, must, directly affect the business in its technical, commercial, or simply social (in certain cases) efficiency. A whole gamut of possible sanctions are accepted by our arbitration system, the most important of which are the following: the transfer from one occupation or from one department to another; the reduction to a lower rank in the seniority list; the loss of certain social benefits such as accumulated sick leave, the choice of holiday periods, etc.; temporary suspension coupled or not with the loss of seniority and of certain other accumulated rights; finally, the dismissal with or without allowance. Finally, the author describes and analyses the following different settlement techniques:About the first technique, the author insists that there does not exist in Quebec, nor anywhere else in Canada or in the United States, any paritcular statutes legally applying to certain categories of employees, such as is the case in France, for example, about personnel representatives. No difference is made in our Labour laws between ordinary wage earners and personnel representatives affected by a particular legal status in the field of labour relations. This is due to the fundamental differences existing between the two systems of industrial relations. In Quebec, wage earners only have official representatives when they are unionized and when the union to which they belong is « recognized » by the Labour Relations Board through a certificat of recognition, certificate of a given bargaining unit and forces the employer to negotiate with it, or still if this union is recognized de facto by the employer and negociates with the latter on a contractual and somehow « private » voluntary basis...|$|R

Relevance of the selected issue {{is due to the}} fact that often a criminal crime, administrative and disciplinary offences are similar, and that?s why in some cases one type of legal liability without any reason is substituted by another one. In this regard, there is an increasing rate of people who are illegally brought to criminal, administrative and disciplinary liability through the shortcomings of the relevant legislation and the failure to distinguish one type of legal liability from another. There is a question how disciplinary guilt is different from a crime and administrative offence. The answer is of fundamental practical and theoretical importance. Based on the analysis of special literature and existing scientific research the author has made a comparative analysis of the characteristics and differences of various types of legal liability. Disciplinary liability is different from other types of legal liability according to the legal consequences of the offence. Disciplinary sanctions are different from criminal punishments, not only by the level of severity, a criminal record, but the way of setting. Disciplinary law, unlike the criminal one, does not carry out the distribution {{of disciplinary}} sanctions on the basic and additional. Nurturing, not punishment determines socio-legal content of disciplinary sanctions and distinguishes them from criminal and administrative <b>penalties.</b> <b>Disciplinary</b> sanctions and criminal penalties by the socio-legal content vary by the speed of their application to the offender. Procedural forms of disciplinary proceedings differ from procedural forms of other types of liability. Disciplinary liability differs from administrative one by the grounds, legal consequences of an offense, subjects of liability and other features. Disciplinary sanctions differ from administrative ones by the ways of their setting by the state.
