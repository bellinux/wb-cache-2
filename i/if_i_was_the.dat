500|$|In the {{run up to}} World Group {{play-off}} against Croatia, Tim Henman {{had announced}} he would retire after this match. Murray said [...] "I'm {{not going to want}} to let the team down or let Tim down, I'd feel terrible <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one that was responsible for losing Tim's last tie. This means a lot to me and it's definitely going to be the biggest Davis Cup match of my career." [...] "Everyone is going to want to win for Tim. I'm hoping the way I play will show him what his career meant to my development and me." [...] Great Britain beat Croatia 4–1 to qualify for the World Group in 2008.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Diamond Sea" [...] {{is notable}} for its 19:35 duration. Moore {{explained}} {{the length of}} some of the album's songs: [...] "We all have different aesthetics as to how songs should work. I generally push for a lot of abandon while some people in the group are more interested in truncating things. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> leader as much as people say I am, every song would be 20 minutes long". The unlisted ninth track, officially called [...] "Becuz Coda", was originally part of the song [...] "Becuz", but the record label felt they needed to cut the seven-and-a-half-minute track to make the album's opening more accessible. The album was produced by Sonic Youth and John Siket, who also engineered the band's previous two albums. Audio mixing took place at Greene Street Studios in New York City in June 1995.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed between October and November 2007 {{in the sixth}} {{production}} block of the series, alongside [...] "Exit Wounds". The sequence of Jack, Ianto and Owen leaving for Gwen's wedding was recorded at Roald Dahl Plass on 25 October 2007. A number of locations {{were used for the}} wedding venue. Producer Richard Stokes notes that [...] "it felt like we were organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues". Director Ashley Way states that in directing the wedding scenes, the production team had {{to make sure that the}} colour scheme co-ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns. Costume designer Ray Holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine-month baby bump worn by Eve Myles. He remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in Cardiff he was regarded [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> biggest sinner in the world" [...] and ended up designing the dress worn by Gwen himself.|$|E

2500|$|Fitzmorris adhered {{strictly}} to timetables. When he chaired meetings, he always started exactly {{on time and}} finished accordingly. One of his chamber of commerce associates recalled that Fitzmorris ran committee meetings [...] "railroad-style. When an agenda was scheduled for 9 a.m., he would look at his railroad watch and start the meeting at 9 a.m. sharp (not 9:01) - even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only member who had shown up on time. If the meeting was scheduled for one hour, Jimmy Fitz would look at his watch again at 10 a.m. sharp and summarily close the meeting, even if a pontificating member was in mid-sentence! When people came in late, he would give them the kind of look that only railroad men give late passengers sprinting after a moving train." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 27, 2010 it was {{announced}} by Hamilton during {{an interview that he}} had checked himself into a Psychiatric hospital stating: [...] "My stay here is like identical to my stay in the industry.

And music just became me, so I thought it be a good idea if I checked into the hospital just to get my mind right." ...|$|E
2500|$|The infamous {{exchange}} between McCartney and Harrison occurred on Monday, January 6. Around lunchtime on Friday, January 10, tensions {{came to a}} head and Harrison told the others that he was leaving the band. [...] This entire episode is omitted from the film. He later recalled: [...] "I thought, 'I'm quite capable of being happy on my own, and if I'm not able to be happy in this situation I'm getting out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'." [...] Rehearsals and filming continued for a few more sessions; the finished film only used a small amount of footage from this period, namely a boogie-woogie piano duet by McCartney and Starr, although it was included in a way such that Harrison's absence was not apparent. [...] While he was gone, the others considered replacing him with guitarist Eric Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to Lennon, who was captured on tape saying that if: [...] "George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play”, and that this would be congenial to Clapton in that the Beatles, unlike Clapton's previous band Cream, “would give him full scope to play his guitar.” [...] Years later, Clapton commented on the absurdity of this idea: “There may have been [...] The problem with that was I had bonded or was developing a relationship with George, exclusive of them. I think it fitted a need of his and mine, that he could elevate himself by having this guy that could be like a gunslinger to them. Lennon would use my name every now and then for clout, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fastest gun. So, I don’t think I could have been brought into the whole thing because I was too much a mate of George’s.” ...|$|E
