40|$|The {{spectrum}} of electronic states at 30 000 – 33 000 cm− 1 in <b>hafnium</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{has been studied}} using (1 + 1) resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) and (1 + 1 ′) REMPI. Six Ω′= 3 / 2 and ten Π 1 / 2 vibronic bands have been characterized. We report the molecular constants for these bands and estimate the electronic energies of the excited states using a correction derived from the observed isotope shifts. When either of two closely spaced Π 1 / 2 electronic states is used as an intermediate state to access autoionizing Rydberg levels, qualitatively distinct autoionization spectra are observed. The intermediate state-specificity of the autoionization spectra bodes well {{for the possibility of}} using a selected Π 1 / 2 state as an intermediate state to create ionic HfF+ in various selected quantum states, an important requirement for our electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) search in HfF+...|$|E
40|$|Over 200 {{different}} compositions {{of heavy}} metal fluoride glasses {{have been produced}} and evaluated as possible candidates for the active medium in homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters for high energy particles. Promising glasses, based on mixtures containing <b>hafnium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> have densities of 6 g/cm^ 3, radiation lengths of 1. 6 cm, and good optical transmission from the UV to the IR. Glasses containing the Ce 3 + ion are fast scintillators, with properties {{similar to those of}} pure cerium fluoride crystal. We have made glasses which have up to 14 % of the light yield of CeF 3, fast scintillation characterised by typical exponential decay constants of 10 ns and 25 ns, and a temperature dependence of light yield of - 0. 4 %/C over the range - 10 C to 60 C. We have carried out a detailed investigation of the effects of gamma irradiation (up to doses of 6 kGy) on the optical transmission, and systematic studies into the role of indium and other elements on radiation tolerance and light yield. Some glasses have shown complete optical annealing of radiation-induced absorbance when exposed to UV light. PPAR...|$|E
