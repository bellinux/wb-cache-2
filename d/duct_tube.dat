We report a 57 -year-old man with pancreatic pseudocyst who {{was admitted to}} our hospital complaining of prolonged abdominal pain. A pancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>tube</b> was placed into the main pancreatic duct, as the pseudocyst was communicated to the pancreatic duct. He fell into septic shock state two weeks later. An ultrasonography-guided percutaneous drainage of the pseudocyst was performed. The amylase level of drained pus was 80, 000 U/l. Pancreatic pseudocyst-portal vein fistula was demonstrated by fisterography. Symptoms disappeared immediately after drainage. No recurrence was observed afterward...|$|E
40|$|Tubular {{epithelial}} cells {{are one of}} the most abundant cell types in multicellular organisms. Tubular cells transport gases and liquids, and funnel harmful excretory waste from our bodies. It is clear that Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling is essential for the formation of many tubular organs such as our kidneys and blood vessels. However, which steps in tube development require RTK signaling is less well understood. The C. elegans excretory system is a primitive renal system with just three essential cells (duct, pore, and canal cells), providing a simple yet dynamic system to study tube specification and morphogenesis. In the C. elegans excretory system, we demonstrated that the EGF-Ras-Erk signaling pathway specified the excretory <b>duct</b> <b>tube</b> versus the pore tube fate. In addition, EGF-Ras-Erk signaling influenced the positions that the duct and pore cells adopted within the tubular network. And finally, after position and fate determination, EGF-Ras-Erk signaling had a continued role in maintaining organ architecture of the <b>duct</b> <b>tube.</b> Goals for future research will be to determine how EGF-Ras-ERK signaling controls these genetically distinct steps during tube development. ^ In a separate project, I studied the Nkx 5 homeodomain transcription factor, MLS- 2, which was identified in a mutagenesis screen by a former graduate student in the lab. I discovered a role for MLS- 2 in promoting proper cell shape of the duct and pore. mls- 2 cooperated with the EGF-Ras-Erk pathway to turn on lin- 48 /Ovo during duct morphogenesis. I speculate that MLS- 2 and other Nkx 5 family members have conserved functions in promoting shape acquisition in cells that adopt complex morphologies similar to the duct and pore. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{retained}} {{bile duct}} stone after operation for cholelithiasis still occurs and causes {{symptoms such as}} biliary colic and obstructive jaundice. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), followed by stone extraction, are usually an effective treatment for this condition. However, these procedures are associated with severe complications including pancreatitis, bleeding, and duodenal perforation. Nitrates such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) are known to relax the sphincter of Oddi. In 6 cases in which a retained stone was detected following cholecystectomy, topical nitrate drip infusion via cystic <b>duct</b> <b>tube</b> (C-tube) was carried out. Retained stones of 2 - 3 mm diameter and no dilated common bile duct in 3 patients were removed by drip infusion of 50 mg GTN or 10 mg ISDN, which was the regular dose of intravenous injection. Three other cases failed, and EST in 2 cases and endoscopic biliary balloon dilatation in 1 case were performed. One patient developed an adverse event of nausea. Severe complications were not observed. We consider the topical nitrate drip infusion via C-tube to be old but safe, easy, and inexpensive procedure for retained bile duct stone following cholecystectomy, inasmuch as removal rate was about 50 % in our cases...|$|E

40|$|Most {{epithelial}} cells secrete a glycoprotein-rich apical extracellular matrix {{that can have}} diverse but still poorly understood roles in development and physiology. Zona Pellucida (ZP) domain glycoproteins are common constituents of these matrices, and their loss in humans {{is associated with a}} number of diseases. Understanding of the functions, organization and regulation of apical matrices has been hampered by difficulties in imaging them both in vivo and ex vivo. We identified the PAN-Apple, mucin and ZP domain glycoprotein LET- 653 as an early and transient apical matrix component that shapes developing epithelia in C. elegans. LET- 653 has modest effects on shaping of the vulva and epidermis, but is essential to prevent lumen fragmentation in the very narrow, unicellular excretory <b>duct</b> <b>tube.</b> We were able to image the transient LET- 653 matrix by both live confocal imaging and transmission electron microscopy. Structure/function and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies revealed that LET- 653 exists in two separate luminal matrix pools, a loose fibrillar matrix in the central core of the lumen, to which it binds dynamically via its PAN domains, and an apical-membrane-associated matrix, to which it binds stably via its ZP domain. The PAN domains are both necessary and sufficient to confer a cyclic pattern of duct lumen localization that precedes each molt, while the ZP domain is required for lumen integrity. Ectopic expression of full-length LET- 653, but not the PAN domains alone, could expand lumen diameter in the developing gut tube, where LET- 653 is not normally expressed. Together, these data support a model in which the PAN domains regulate the ability of the LET- 653 ZP domain to interact with other factors at the apical membrane, and this ZP domain interaction promotes expansion and maintenance of lumen diameter. These data identify a transient apical matrix component present prior to cuticle secretion in C. elegans, demonstrate critical roles for this matrix component in supporting lumen integrity within narrow bore tubes such as those found in the mammalian microvasculature, and reveal functional importance of the evolutionarily conserved ZP domain in this tube protecting activity...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{multiscale}} scheme for simulating micro/nano flows of high aspect ratio in the flow direction, e. g. within long <b>ducts,</b> <b>tubes,</b> or channels, of varying section. The scheme couples conventional hydrodynamic conservation equations for mass and momentum-flux with molecular dynamics (MD) in a unified framework. The method is very much different from common ‘domain-decomposition’ hybrid methods, and is more related to micro-resolution methods, such as the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method. We optimise {{the use of the}} computationally-costly MD solvers by applying them only at a limited number of streamwise-distributed cross-sections of the macroscale geometry. The greater the streamwise scale of the geometry, the more significant is the computational speed-up when compared to a full MD simulation.

We validate the results from our simulations by comparing them to a full MD simulation of the same test case...|$|R

This {{process is}} best {{demonstrated in the}} organization of the ductal tree of the mammary gland and in 3 D models of morphogenesis in culture. Here, we asked a fundamental question: How do single adult epithelial cells generate polarized acini when placed in a surrogate basement membrane 3 D gel? Using human breast epithelial cells from either reduction mammoplasty or nonmalignant breast cell lines, we observed a unique cellular movement where single cells undergo multiple rotations and then maintain it cohesively as they divide to assemble into acini. This coherent angular motion (CAMo) was observed in both primary cells and breast cell lines. If CAMo was disrupted, the final geometry was not a sphere. The malignant counterparts of the human breast cell lines in 3 D were randomly motile, did not display CAMo, and did not form spheres. Upon “phenotypic reversion” of malignant cells, both CAMo and spherical architecture were restored. We show that cell-cell adhesion and tissue polarity are essential for the formation of acini and link the functional relevance of CAMo to the establishment of spherical architecture rather than to multicellular aggregation or growth. We propose that CAMo is an integral step {{in the formation of the}} tissue architecture and that its disruption is involved in malignant transformation...|$|R
