It is by saving costly labour alone that the prairie farmer pours his wheat into the markets of the East, and retains a small margin for himself, in spite of fifteen hundred miles railway haulage, and three thousand by sea.

The ability to perform these picking and put-away tasks {{in a timely fashion}} {{is a function of the}} distance the workers must travel within the warehouse. Two analytic methods for estimating the labor requirements associated with these activities are presented. The first method is a stochastic model in which demand at each location is described by a random variable. The second method is based on the assumption that demand is always equal to its expected value. 1 Introduction Multi-echelon inventory systems exist to provide excellent customer service in a timely manner without requiring each retailer or other stocking location to hold high levels of inventory.
