METHODS: We tested different inverted aortic prostheses with a prosthesis-annulus relationship in the mitral chamber of the Sheffield pulse duplicator (Department of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK), analyzed by comparing the prosthetic <b>housing</b> <b>diameter</b> and the predicted annulus diameter based on body surface area (0. 8 and 1 m(2) corresponding to an annulus diameter of 18. 8 - 20. 2 mm). The On-X 19 (On-X Life Technologies, Inc, Austin, Tex), SJM Regent 19 (St Jude Medical Inc, St Paul, Minn), Sorin Overline 18 (Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia, Italy), and Medtronic Advantage Supra 19 (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) valves with a <b>housing</b> <b>diameter</b> of 19 to 20 mm were hydrodynamically compared. The tests were carried out at increasing pulse rate of 72, 80, 100, and 120 beats/min for a stroke volume of 20 and 30 mL. Therefore, cardiac output ranged from 1. 44 to 3. 6 L/min. RESULTS: Regardless of the pulse rate and stroke volume, the Medtronic Advantage Supra valve showed the highest mean diastolic pressure difference at each cardiac output (P <. 05). The mean gradients were significantly lower for the Sorin Overline valve regardless of the cardiac output, stroke volume, and pulse rate (P <. 05). The effective orifice areas observed followed exactly the same behavior: the lowest for the Medtronic Advantage Supra valve and the highest for the Sorin Overline valve. The Sorin Overline valve showed the highest closure volumes (P <. 05), and the On-X prosthesis showed the highest leakage volumes (P <. 05). The Sorin Overline valve had the highest total regurgitant volume (P <. 05), and the Medtronic Advantage Supra valve had the lowest total regurgitant volume (P <. 05). The On-X valve showed the highest total energy loss regardless of the pulse rate at 20 mL of stroke volume, which was comparable to the SJM Regent and Sorin Overline valves at increased stroke volume. The Medtronic Advantage Supra valve showed the lowest total energy loss regardless of cardiac outputs (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: This hydrodynamic evaluation model allowed us to compare the efficiency of currently available valve prostheses suitable for atrioventricular replacement in children. Among these prostheses, the Sorin Overline valve showed the best diastolic performance.

The rotor has an expander impeller mounted {{at one end and}} a compressor impeller mounted at the other end. This unit had a long history of failures at the expander-end radial bearing. It was suspected that the frequent expander upsets were caused by unbalance degradation due to solid particle erosion on the aluminum expander-end impeller. The rotordynamics analysis of the expander with the original three lobe journal bearings predicted a high unbalance sensitivity at the expander-end of the rotor and a low logarithmic decrement for the third backward whirl mode near the design operating speed. The concern was that this mode might be excited by an unbalance initiated rub. The redesign analysis consisted of two phases. The purpose of Phase One was to determine the best bearing redesign that could be "directly substituted" for the original bearings without modifying the shaft or the bearing <b>housing</b> fit <b>diameters</b> and fit lengths. As a backup contingency plan, the Phase Two analysis was pursued while the Phase One retrofit was in operation. The purpose of Phase Two was to find the optimal redesign configuration that would even further improve upon the predicted Phase One retrofit achievements, without the "direct bearing substitution constraint.

However, fundamental information surrounding IL molecular properties is still lacking. With this in mind, the microinterface between two immiscible electrolytic solutions (micro-ITIES), for example, water| 1, 2 -dichloroethane, has been used to evaluate the hydrophobicity/lipophilicity of 10 alkylphosphonium ILs. By varying the architecture around the phosphonium core, chemical differences were induced, changing the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the cations. Ion transfer (IT) within the polarizable potential window (PPW) was measured to establish a structure–property relationship. The Gibbs free energy of IT and the solubility of their ILs were also calculated. For phosphonium cations bearing either three butyl or three hydroxypropyl groups with a tunable fourth arm, the latter displayed a wide variety of easily characterizable IT potentials. The tributylphosphonium ILs, however, were too hydrophobic to undergo IT within the PPW. Utilizing a micro-ITIES (25 μm <b>diameter)</b> <b>housed</b> at the tip of a capillary in a uniquely designed pipet holder, we were able to probe beyond the traditional potential window and observe ion transfer of these hydrophobic phosphonium ILs for the first time. A similar trend in lipophilicity was determined between the two subsets of ILs by means of derived solubility product constants. The above results serve as evidence of the validation of this technique for the evaluation of hydrophobic cations that appear beyond the conventional PPW and of the lipophilicity of their ILs...|$|R

To house such a large three-inch diameter sensor required the use of a steel 300 -psi rated 4 inch weld neck flange, which itself weighed already 29 pounds. The completed 1 st generation Acoustic Monitoring Package weighed almost 100 pounds. This was too cumbersome to mount in the field, on an access port at a pipeline shut-off valve.

50|$|The oldest {{evidence}} of neolithic settlement is dated to 8800-8600 BC. The first settlers were already agriculturalists (PPNB), {{but did not}} yet produce pottery (aceramic Neolithic). They introduced the dog, sheep, goats and maybe cattle and pigs as well as numerous wild animals like foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos, Tenta) and cultivated einkorn and emmer. Pig, sheep, goat and cattle were kept, but remained morphologically wild. Evidence for cattle (attested at Shillourokambos) is rare and when they apparently died out {{in the course of}} the 8th millennium they were not reintroduced until the early Bronze Age.In the 6th millennium BC, the aceramic Choirokoitia culture (Neolithic I) was characterized by round houses (tholoi), stone vessels and an economy based on sheep, goats and pigs. The daily life of the people in those Neolithic villages was spent in farming, hunting, animal husbandry and the lithic industry, while homesteaders (likely women) were engaged in spindling and weaving cloths, in addition to their probable participation in other activities. The lithic industry was the most individual feature of this aceramic culture and innumerable stone vessels made of grey andesite have been discovered during excavations. The houses had a foundation of river pebbles, the remainder of the building was constructed in mudbrick. Sometimes several round houses were joined together to form a kind of compound. Some of these <b>houses</b> reach a <b>diameter</b> of up to 10 m. Inhumation burials are located inside the houses.|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{equivalent}} proportional counters {{are frequently}} {{used to measure}} dose and dose equivalent in mixed radiation fields that include neutrons; however, detectors simulating sites 1 ?m in diameter underestimate the quality factor, Q, for low energy neutrons because the recoil protons do not cross the detectors. Proportional counters simulating different site-sizes {{can be used to}} get a better neutron dose equivalent measurement since the range and stopping power of protons generated by neutrons in the tissue-equivalent walls depend on the energy of the primary neutrons. The differences in the spectra measured by different size detectors will provide additional information on the incident neutron energy. Monte Carlo N-particle extended (MCNPX) code was used to simulate neutron transportation in proportional counters of different simulated tissue diameter. These Monte Carlo results were tested using two solid walled tissue equivalent proportional counters, 2 mm and 10 mm in diameter, simulating tissue volumes 0. 1 ?m and 0. 5 ?m in <b>diameter,</b> <b>housed</b> in a single vacuum chamber. Both detectors are built with 3 mm thick tissue equivalent plastic (A- 150) walls and propane gas inside for dose measurement. Using these two detectors, the spectra were compared to determine the underestimation of y for large detector, and thereby obtain more information of the incident neutron particles. Based on the MCNPX simulation and experimental results, we can see that the smaller detector produces a larger average lineal energy than the larger detector, which means the larger detector (0. 5 ?m diameter tissue equivalent size) underestimates the Q value for the low energy neutron, therefore underestimates the effective dose. These results confirm the results of the typical analysis of lineal energy as a function of site size...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveIn {{aortic valve}} {{regurgitation}} and aortic dilatation, {{preservation of the}} aortic valve is possible by means of root remodeling (Yacoub procedure) or valve reimplantation (David procedure). In vivo studies suggest that reimplantation might substantially influence aortic valve-motion characteristics. Evaluation of aortic valve movement in vivo, however, is technically limited and is difficult to standardize. We evaluated the aortic valve-motion pattern echocardiographically in vitro after reimplantation and remodeling. MethodsBy using aortic roots of <b>house</b> pigs (aortoventricular <b>diameter,</b> 22 mm) a Yacoub procedure (22 -mm graft; group Y, n = 5) or a David I procedure (24 -mm graft; group D, n = 5) was performed. Roots after supracommissural replacement (22 -mm graft; group C, n = 5) served as control valves. In an electrohydraulic, computer-controlled pulse duplicator the valves were tested at flows of 2, 4, 7, and 9 L/min. Echocardiographically assessed parameters were rapid valve-opening velocity, slow valve-closing velocity, rapid valve-closing velocity, rapid valve-opening time, rapid valve-closing time, ejection time, maximum valve opening, slow valve-closing displacement, and maximum flow velocity. ResultsMean rapid valve-opening velocity and mean rapid valve-closing velocity at a cardiac output of 2 to 9 L/min were fastest in group D (rapid valve-opening velocity: 69 ± 10 cm/s [group D] vs 39 ± 4 cm/s [group Y] vs 42 ± 4 cm/s [group C], P =. 0041; rapid valve-closing velocity: 22 ± 2 cm/s [group D] vs 16 ± 2 cm/s [group Y] vs 17 ± 1 cm/s [group C], P =. 0272), and slow valve-closing velocity was slowest in group D (0. 2 ± 0. 1 cm/s [group D] vs 1. 0 ± 0. 3 cm/s [group Y] vs 0. 6 ± 0. 1 cm/s [group C], P =. 0063). With increasing cardiac output, the difference in rapid valve-opening velocity between the groups increased, the difference in slow valve-closing velocity remained unchanged, and the difference in rapid valve-closing velocity decreased. ConclusionsIn this standardized experimental setting remodeling of the aortic valve provides significantly smoother valve movements. This might contribute to preservation of a better valve performance during long-term follow-up...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} a novel polymer based housing for power thyristor devices typically used in long distance high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission. Power thyristor devices used in HVDC power conversion stations are typically packaged in a hermetically sealed ceramic housing and have demonstrated an excellent history of reliability and performance. However, to avoid increasing the number of thyristors in future higher powered HVDC schemes thyristors having higher power ratings at 8. 5 kV and sizes at 125 mm and 150 mm diameters are sought for implementation to achieve higher transmission ratings of, for example, 4000 A at +/- 800 kV. The main disadvantages of such large ceramic-based packages are higher processing cost and weight whilst robustness is also a concern. To overcome these issues, replacing the current ceramic housing with a polymeric material has been investigated in this project. The advantages it is anticipated such packages will provide include lower cost, less weight, robustness, recyclability, etc. However, some challenges it will also offer are: non-hermeticity i. e. polymers are moisture and gas permeable, potentially more complex manufacturing routes, and different electrical, mechanical and thermal properties compared to ceramic materials. The work presented in this thesis {{was part of a larger}} project where these challenges have been addressed by developing and testing a prototype polymeric thyristor housing. The prototype is aimed at demonstrating that polymer packages can deliver performance and reliability comparable to, if not better than, current ceramic packages. In this thesis, it is the package development and reliability related studies that are discussed. Because the housings will experience severe electrical stresses and various thermal excursions during their service life, the electrical and thermo-mechanical behaviour of the polymer housing was studied using finite element analysis to gain an understanding of the effects of various design variables and materials properties on performance and the tradeoffs between performance and manufacturability. From these modelling studies, design guidelines have been established for the future development of polymer housings. On the other hand, to identify the physics-of-failure of the prototype that was manufactured as part of the project, accelerated life tests were performed to study its reliability. The knowledge gained from the polymer prototype development was then applied to the design of a larger 125 mm <b>diameter</b> <b>housing</b> using the Taguchi method of experimental design...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} program directed at the acoustics of advanced subsonic propulsion systems undertaken at NASA Langley, Duke University was funded to develop a boundary condition model for bulk-reacting nacelle liners. The overall objective of the Langley program was to understand and predict noise from advanced subsonic transport engines and to develop related noise control technology. The overall technical areas included: fan and propeller source noise, acoustics of ducts and duct liners, interior noise, subjective acoustics, and systems noise prediction. The Duke effort was directed toward duct liner acoustics {{for the development of}} analytical methods to characterize liner behavior in both frequency domain and time domain. A review of duct acoustics and liner technology can be found in Reference [1]. At that time, NASA Langley was investigating the propulsion concept of an advanced ducted fan, with a large <b>diameter</b> <b>housed</b> inside a relatively short duct. Fan diameters in excess of ten feet were proposed. The lengths of both the inlet and exhaust portions of the duct were to be short, probably less than half the fan diameter. The nacelle itself would be relatively thin-walled for reasons of aerodynamic efficiency. The blade-passage frequency was expected to be less than I kHz, and very likely in the 200 to 300 Hz range. Because of the design constraints of a short duct, a thin nacelle, and long acoustic wavelengths, the application of effective liner technology would be especially challenging. One of the needs of the NASA Langley program was the capability to accurately and efficiently predict the behavior of the acoustic liner. The traditional point impedance method was not an adequate model for proposed liner designs. The method was too restrictive to represent bulk reacting liners and to allow for the characterization of many possible innovative liner concepts. In the research effort at Duke, an alternative method, initially developed to handle bulk reacting layers as described in Reference [2], was extended to apply to a broad range of liner types. This method included the effect of local gradients along the liner surface, and was particularly appropriate for situations with flow over the liner and grazing incidence acoustic fields. In order to utilize time domain computational methods to solve for the propfan acoustic field, corresponding liner boundary conditions were developed for time domain solutions rather than frequency domain solutions...|$|R

The internal space of such a TV tower made from reinforced concrete is sufficient for installation of all the necessary equipment and addition of a viewing platform with a restaurant accessed via a high-speed lift. The height of the tower is such that it is capable of transmitting excellent radio and television signals to distances of up to 90 kilometres in ideal weather conditions.Several factors were taken into account when the location was being selected: the required distance from densely populated urban areas to ensure proper signal reception; geological features of the local soil; distance from the airport; impact on Tallinn’s skyline. The chosen spot was 8 kilometres from the city centre, in a rest and recreation zone not far from the botanical garden and a motor sports club. Location height above sea level: 23 metres. The TV Tower dominates the surrounding landscape and affects the local architecture. The TV Tower is clearly visible from the city and from the sea.The structure of the tower can be divided into three sections: the foundation, the tower itself from reinforced concrete (190 m) and the steel antenna (124 m). From 150-182 metres the tower contains a superstructure that is 38 metres in <b>diameter,</b> <b>housing</b> the viewing platform, the restaurant and the equipment room for commercial radio stations. The two-storey building that surrounds the base of the tower is also 38 metres in diameter and contains technical and auxiliary facilities.The foundation slab made from reinforced concrete is 38 metres in diameter, 2.5 metres thick and buried 8.5 metres below ground level. This slab supports the tower from reinforced concrete that is 15.2 metres in diameter at the base and only 8.2 metres in diameter at a height of 180 metres. The wall thickness in the lower part is 500 mm and in the upper part it is 350 mm, this is to ensure tower stability even in strong storm conditions. Before 1967 all tall structures had been built in Estonia in compliance with the safety requirements applicable to structures situated in areas with the second wind strength level. After the storm in 1967, with the wind speed reaching 42 metres per second, the TV tower was designed in compliance with the fourth wind strength level requirements.The mass total of the tower is over 20,000 tons. The centre of gravity of the structure is in the base of the tower, which is why it could not fall over even if the foundation slab was on the surface of the ground.The general contractor was the Tallinn Construction Trust and the subcontractors were the Reinforced Concrete Construction Trust, the Metal Structures Trust and the Radio Construction Trust. The work was commissioned by the TV Tower Construction Directorate of the Ministry of Communications of the Estonian SSR, with Vootele Tõsine as its director at the time.|$|R
