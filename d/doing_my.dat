500|$|Throughout {{his time}} at Bell Labs, Hamming avoided {{management}} responsibilities. He was promoted to management positions several times, but always managed to make these only temporary.

500|$|Stevens knew {{no one in}} Gettysburg, and {{initially}} had little success as a lawyer. [...] His breakthrough, in mid-1817, was {{a case in which}} a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of the constables who had arrested him. [...] His defense, although unsuccessful, impressed the local people, and he never lacked for business thereafter. In his legal career, he demonstrated the propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician, once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting contempt, [...] "Sir, I am <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to conceal it." ...|$|E
500|$|Chess Records Chicago artists, {{including}} Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, {{influenced the}} Rolling Stones, {{with the band}} taking their name from a Muddy Waters tune and playing from a repertoire of blues songs {{at the beginning of}} their career. [...] In 1962, before they had recorded as a group, Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, and Keith Richards, attended the first American Folk Blues Festival, whose performers included Howlin' Wolf. [...] Willie Dixon, another Festival player, later recalled [...] "When the Rolling Stones came to Chess studios, they had already met me and <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> songs, especially 'Little Red Rooster'". [...] When Dixon and Howlin' Wolf were in London, they met several local rock musicians. [...] Early Stones manager Giorgio Gomelsky described such a meeting: ...|$|E
500|$|While a {{freshman}} in high school, through mutual friends, Prakazrel [...] "Pras" [...] Michel approached Hill about a music group he was creating. Hill and Pras began {{under the name}} Tranzlator Crew, chosen {{because they wanted to}} rhyme in different languages. Another female vocalist was soon replaced by Michel's cousin, multi-instrumentalist Wyclef Jean. The group began performing in local showcases and high school talent shows. Hill was initially only a singer, but then learned to rap too; instead of modeling herself on female rappers like Salt-n-Pepa and MC Lyte, she preferred male rappers like Ice Cube and developed her flow from listening to them. Hill later said, [...] "I remember <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> homework in the bathroom stalls of hip-hop clubs." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} 2000s Pryce starred {{and participated in}} a variety of movies, such as The Affair of the Necklace (2001), Unconditional Love (2002), What a Girl Wants (2003), and Terry Gilliam's aborted project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. While the success of some of these films was variable, the 2001 London stage {{production}} of My Fair Lady and his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins was acclaimed by observers. This production turned out to be very stressful for Pryce because Martine McCutcheon, who portrayed Eliza Doolittle, was sick during much of the show's run. McCutcheon was replaced by her understudy Alexandra Jay, who would also fall sick hours before a performance, forcing her understudy, Kerry Ellis, to take the lead. Pryce was understandably upset and on her first night introduced Ellis to the audience before the show by saying [...] "This will be your first Eliza, my second today and my third this week. Any member of the audience interested in playing Eliza can find applications at the door. Wednesday and Saturday matinee available." [...] Pryce ended up dealing with four Elizas during the course of 14 months. Despite the difficulty, the show was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards on 2001: Best Actress in a Musical for Martine McCutcheon, Outstanding Musical Production, Best Theatre Choreographer and Best Actor in a Musical for Pryce. Pryce lost to Philip Quast, although ironically McCutcheon won in her category having played fewer performances than any of her understudies. Pryce did express interest in <b>doing</b> <b>My</b> Fair Lady in New York, but when asked if he would do it with McCutcheon he said that [...] "there's as much chance of me getting a date with Julia Roberts as <b>doing</b> <b>My</b> Fair Lady in New York with Martine McCutcheon." ...|$|E
500|$|The second commandant of Treblinka II, Franz Stangl, {{escaped with}} his wife and {{children}} from Austria to Brazil in 1951. Stangl found work at a Volkswagen factory in São Paulo. His role in the mass murder of Jews was known to the Austrian authorities, but Austria did not issue a warrant for his arrest until 1961. Stangl was registered under his real name at the Austrian consulate in Brazil. It took another six years before the famous Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal tracked him down and triggered his arrest. After his extradition from Brazil to West Germany Stangl was tried for the deaths of around 900,000 people. He admitted to the killings but argued: [...] "My conscience is clear. I was simply <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty." [...] Stangl was found guilty on 22 October 1970, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died of heart failure in prison in Düsseldorf on 28 June 1971.|$|E
500|$|In June 1872, Bizet {{informed}} Galabert: [...] "I {{have just}} been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [...] Meilhac and [...] Halévy are <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> piece". The subject chosen for this project was Prosper Mérimée's short novel, Carmen. Bizet began the music {{in the summer of}} 1873, but the Opéra-Comique's management was concerned about the suitability of this risqué story for a theatre that generally provided wholesome entertainment, and work was suspended. Bizet then began composing Don Rodrigue, an adaptation of the El Cid story by Louis Gallet and Édouard Blau. He played a piano version to a select audience that included the Opéra's principal baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure, hoping that the singer's approval might influence the directors of the Opéra to stage the work. However, on the night of 28–29 October, the Opéra burned to the ground; the directors, amid other pressing concerns, set Don Rodrigue aside. It was never completed; Bizet later adapted a theme from its final act as the basis of his 1875 overture, Patrie.|$|E

500|$|Former {{teammate}} Andy Russell called Greene [...] "unquestionably the NFL's {{best player}} in the seventies," [...] saying [...] "No player had a greater impact or did more for his team." [...] Greene and coach Noll are widely credited with turning the Steelers franchise around. The Steelers finished 1970 with a 5–9 record and went 6–8 in 1971. Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl in both seasons. In 1972, Pittsburgh finished 11–3 and won its first division title and its first playoff game—the [...] "Immaculate Reception" [...] game against the Oakland Raiders. [...] During the season, Greene tallied eleven quarterback sacks and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula lauded Greene, saying, [...] "He's just a super super star. It's hard to believe he isn't offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him." [...] By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. [...] "We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro," [...] said Greene in 1972. [...] "I'm just like all the other guys, <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best in a team effort." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
500|$|Scotland voted by a 10% margin against independence, but the {{referendum}} returned [...] "Yes" [...] votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader. Shortly after {{the referendum}}, a Daily Mail article claimed that Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was being {{lined up to}} take over from her, while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor. Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister's Questions, {{the first of the}} post-referendum era. [...] "When the First Minister is long gone I will still be <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> job on behalf of the people of Scotland." [...] Her position remained uncertain. Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership. In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as [...] "a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past". Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded [...] "enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily" [...] because its supporters no longer understood [...] "what the party stands for". Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its [...] "socialist principles".|$|E

In the weeks following the referendum, SNP membership increased fourfold, reaching more than 100,000 by mid-December. Labour's membership over the same period was less clear. Paul Hutcheon noted in the 9 November edition of the Sunday Herald that Labour had [...] "consistently declined" [...] to confirm the number of its members in Scotland, but quoted an [...] "informed source" [...] suggesting the figure was slightly short of 13,500. However, Peter Jones of The Scotsman subsequently quoted a less favourable figure of fewer than 10,000, with [...] "most of the existing constituency membership [...] the relatives and friends of councillors/MSPs/MPs [...] would not welcome ... an influx of new members who might try to oust second-rate post-holders in favour of somebody new and better".|$|E
