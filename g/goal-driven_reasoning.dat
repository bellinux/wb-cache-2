40|$|A complete, subformula-preserving proof {{system for}} <b>goal-driven</b> <b>reasoning</b> in first-order logic is pre-sented. The proof {{system is a}} {{transition}} system and its proofs are (linear and local) computations in the transistion system. Thus the proof system fits into a standard framework for modeling problem-solving in cognitive psychology...|$|E
40|$|A general {{framework}} of handling state information for logic programming languages {{on top of}} backtrackable assumptions (linear affine and intuitionistic implications ranging over the current continuation) is introduced, with emphasis on its high-level natural language processing abilities. Assumption Grammars (AGs), a variant of Extended DCGs particularly suitable for hypothetical reasoning, and which handles multiple streams without the need of a preprocessing technique, is specified within our framework. We examine three natural language uses of Assumption Grammars: free word order, anaphora and coordination. We also show two results which were surprising to us, namely: a) Assumption grammars allow a direct and efficient implementation of link grammars [...] - a context-free like formalism developed independently from logic grammars; and b) they offer the flexibility of switching between data-driven or <b>goal-driven</b> <b>reasoning,</b> at no overhead in terms of either syntax or implementation. Keyw [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine some {{knowledge}} base uses of a recently developed logic grammar formalism, Assumption Grammars, particularly suitable for hypothetical reasoning. They {{are based on}} intuitionistic and linear implications scoped over the current continuation, which allows us to follow given branches of the computation under hypotheses that disappear when and if backtracking takes place. In previous research on using Assumption Grammars [TDF 96] for processing natural language [DT 97], we showed that they allow abstracting time and consumer/producer relationships in complex natural language processing (relatives, anaphora), therefore resulting in more readable programs; and that they offer the flexibility of switching between data-driven or <b>goal-driven</b> <b>reasoning,</b> at no overhead in terms of either syntax or implementation. In this paper we argue that Assumption Grammars are also useful for knowledge-based systems, {{and that some of}} the techniques developed for natural language processi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As we {{move towards}} a richer model of {{computation}} based on interactions among autonomous agents {{in lieu of}} the more traditional numeric batch processing model, it is necessary to devise techniques and abstractions for the development of such autonomous agents. The abil-ity to generate, reason about, and select the means to achieve explicit goals is critical for autonomous agents, the so called <b>goal-driven</b> autonomy. <b>Reasoning</b> about goals demands a suitable abstraction for meta-level rea-soning, so that an agent not only reasons about the ac-tions it needs to take, but also about the viability of (and interaction among) such goals. In this paper we dis-cuss the use of motivations as an abstraction of meta-reasoning for goal-driven autonomous agents. We re-view recent developments in motivated agent architec-tures and discuss possible directions for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new AI task [...] Embodied Question Answering (EmbodiedQA) [...] where an agent is spawned at a random {{location}} in a 3 D environment and {{asked a question}} ("What color is the car?"). In order to answer, the agent must first intelligently navigate to explore the environment, gather information through first-person (egocentric) vision, and then answer the question ("orange"). This challenging task requires a range of AI skills [...] active perception, language understanding, <b>goal-driven</b> navigation, commonsense <b>reasoning,</b> and grounding of language into actions. In this work, we develop the environments, end-to-end-trained reinforcement learning agents, and evaluation protocols for EmbodiedQA. Comment: 20 pages, 13 figures, Webpage: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|EcoSys is an {{environmental}} decision support tool {{to assist in}} the design of green products and process. EcoSys consist of an information and expert system that contains input from experts in products, processes and the environment as well as a flexible, goal driven, rule based decision model that can accommodate many environmental management perspectives. This includes allowing specific users to specify weighting factors for the impact decision model. This tool is extensible in that it can be utilized within the boundaries of a company and migrated to include suppliers and customers until full life cycles are assessed. We discussed the details and use of the environmental models available for the experts. We also showed how interviews with manufacturing experts led to the design of a <b>goal-driven</b> rule based <b>reasoning</b> system to support the problem solving. Finally, we offered a number of examples that detailed the types of analysis possible with EcoSys. Our ongoing work is to increase the precision of the environmental attributes database and to extend the product-process database to support a wider set of product analyses. Based on user feedback, we are also continuing to improve the X-Window user interface...|$|R
40|$|Previous recent {{research}} on human wayfinding has {{focused primarily on}} mental representations rather than processes of wayfinding. This paper presents a formal model of {{some aspects of the}} process of wayfinding, where appropriate elements of human perception and cognition are formally realized using image schemata and affordances. The <b>goal-driven</b> <b>reasoning</b> chain that leads to action begins with incomplete and imprecise knowledge derived from imperfect observations of space. Actions result in further observations, derived knowledge and, recursively, further actions, until the goal is achieved or the wayfinder gives up. This paper gives a formalization of this process, using a modal extension to classical propositional logic to represent incomplete knowledge. Both knowledge and action are represented through a wayfinding graph. A special case of wayfinding in a building, that is finding one's way through an airport, is used to demonstrate the formal model. Keywords. Wayfind [...] ...|$|E
