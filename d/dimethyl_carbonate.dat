40|$|In this work, the {{electrochemical}} quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique {{was applied to}} the study of the charge-discharge cycling of lithium electrodes in a few important Li battery electrolyte solutions. These included ethyl-ene and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>carbonates</b> (EC-DMC) mixtures containing LiAsF 6 or LiPF 6 as the electrolyte, tetrahydrofuran (THF) -EC/LiAsF 6 solutions of two different solvent ratios, and 1 - 3 -dioxolane/LiAsF 6 solutions. The substrate electrode was nickel plated on the quartz crystal. All the experiments were conducted in potentiostatic mode. After an initial step in which the electrode was polarized from open-circuit potential to 0 V (Li/Li F), repeated deposition-dissolution steps were conducted within predetermined potential limits. These experiments proved the superiority of 1 - 3 -dioxolane/LiAsF 6 solutions as a selected electrolyte system for rechargeable Li batteries with Li metal anode. The EQCM studies revealed that in both EC-DMC or EC-THF solutions, Li deposition is accompanied by a pronounced corrosion and accumulation of surface species that further partially dissolve during the anodic steps. These studies also reflected the difference in the surface chemistry developed on lithium in EC-THF solutions of different EC concentrations. At low EC concentration the Li passivity is better, and thus cycling efficiency is higher.

The correlation between the surface chemistry, the morphology, and the performance of Li and graphite electrodes was explored using surface sensitive Fourier transform infrared and x-ray and photoelectron spectroscopies, impedance spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with standard electrochemical techniques. Synthetic graphite anodes could be cycled (Li inter-calation-deintercalation) hundreds of times at a capacity close to the optimal (x — 1 in LiC 6) in EC-DMC solutions due to the formation of highly stable and passivating surface films in which EC reduction products such as (CH 2 OCO 2 Li), are the major constituents. The cycling efficiency of Li metal anodes in these solutions, however, is lower than that obtained in ethereal solutions and seems to be too low for Li-metal liquid electrolyte, rechargeable battery application.

Also the temperature and the voltage applied on the capillary were optimized. The ILs were aged at room temperature and at 60 °C for 16 months each.
