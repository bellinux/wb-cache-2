40|$|We {{report the}} design and {{analysis}} of a high-power air-cooled heat exchanger capable of dissipating over 1000 W with 33 W of input electrical power and an overall thermal resistance of less than 0. 05 K/W. The novelty of the design combines the blower and heat sink into an <b>integrated</b> <b>compact</b> <b>unit</b> (4 " × 4 " × 4 ") to maximize the heat transfer area and reduce the required airflow rates and power. The device consists of multiple impeller blades interdigitated with parallel-plate condensers of a capillary-pumped loop heat pipe. The impellers are supported on a common shaft and powered with a low-profile permanent magnet synchronous motor, while a single flat-plate evaporator {{is connected to the}} heat load. United States.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{algorithm}} for solving continuous complex optimization {{problems with a}} relatively low memory consumption. The proposed approach, namely Composed compact Differential Evolution, consists {{of a set of}} <b>compact</b> Differential Evolution <b>units</b> which simultaneously search the decision space from various perspectives. A randomization in the virtual population allows the algorithm to behave, on one hand, as a multiple local search with a multi-start logic integrated within it. On the other hand, the <b>compact</b> <b>units</b> communicate among each other by means of a ring topology and propagation of information. More specifically, the most promising elite solutions and scale factor values of each <b>compact</b> <b>unit</b> are migrated to the neighbour unit so that the search of the global optimum is performed. In other words, while each single <b>compact</b> <b>unit</b> performs a local search by exploiting the direction suggested by each elite solution, the entire structure combines the achievement of each local search operation towards the direction of the global search. The proposed algorithm is characterized by a limited memory consumption and is memory-wise equivalent to a population-based algorithm with a small population. Numerical results show that the proposed approach outperforms other compact algorithms and various modern population-based structures...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{identify}} all <b>compact,</b> contiguous-chain, structural <b>units</b> in a globular protein from x-ray coordinates. These units are then used to describe {{a complete set of}} hierarchic folding pathways for the molecule. Our analysis shows that the larger units are combinations of smaller units, giving rise to a structural hierarchy ranging from the whole protein monomer through supersecondary structures down to individual helices and strands. It turns out that {{there is more than one}} way to assemble the protein by self-association of its <b>compact</b> <b>units.</b> However, the number of possible pathways is small [...] small enough to be exhaustively explored by a computer program. The hierarchic organization of <b>compact</b> <b>units</b> in protein molecules is consistent with a model for folding by hierarchic condensation.

40|$|NOVELTY - A heat {{exchanger}} (3) and pump (4) are incorporated in a <b>compact</b> <b>unit</b> (1) into which flow fresh air (9) and exhaust air (10) from the building. A solar air collector (5) can be switched {{to connect with}} the heating pump <b>compact</b> <b>unit</b> and with the heat accumulator by means of valve units, depending on the intensity of solar radiation. With low radiation intensity, the solar air collector is connected at the outlet side of the heating pump unit in the air current flowing into the building (11) which it heats. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - With average solar radiation intensity, external air (8) is introduced into the solar air collector and is heated and mixed with the exhaust air from the building in the heating pump unit between the {{heat exchanger}} and heating pump. With high solar energy radiation, the solar air collector is operated in a closed air circuit, and heats up the service water by means of an air-water heat exchanger (18). USE - Controls ventilation and heating energy supply for low-energy or passive houses ADVANTAGE - The use of solar energy increases the energy efficiency of ventilation and heating systems and reduces the use of primary energy for heating and heating up service water.

40|$|Compactness {{has been}} used to locate {{discontinuous}} structural units containing one or more polypeptide chains in proteins of known structure. Rather than exhaustively calculating the compactness of all possible units, our procedure uses a screening algorithm to find discontinuous regions that are potentially compact. Precise calculations of compactness are restricted only to units in these regions. With our procedure, compactness can be used to discover discontinuous domains with virtually any number of disjoint peptides. Small, single-domain proteins may contain several compact regions: thus, compact regions do not always correspond to folding domains. Because a domain is an independent folding unit and should contain a hydrophobic core, <b>compact</b> <b>units</b> were further examined for the presence of hydrophobic clusters (Zehfus MH, 1995, Protein Sci 4 : 1188 - 1202). This added constraint limits the number of acceptable units and helps greatly in the location of the true structural domains. The larger hydrophobically stabilized <b>compact</b> <b>units</b> correspond to domains, while the smaller units may correspond to folding intermediates...|$|R
