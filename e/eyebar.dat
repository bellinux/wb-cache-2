5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned <b>eyebar</b> connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the <b>eyebar</b> and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed by}} civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 by designing the first truss bridge with pinned <b>eyebar</b> connections. The design of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is West Virginia's oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge and its oldest extant metal truss bridge.|$|E

25|$|The main {{suspension}} cables {{in older}} bridges were often made from chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables {{are made from}} multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because {{the failure of a}} few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or <b>eyebar</b> can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single <b>eyebar</b> was found to be the cause of the collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River.) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.|$|E
2500|$|The trusses are conflictingly {{referred}} to in different sources as [...] "Bowstring", [...] "Pennsylvania" [...] or [...] "Pratt". Pratt {{is the most common}} name. Bowstring may refer to the shape of the bridge, it has some resemblance to a bow, with the roadway as the string (in this particular truss design instance, the members at the road level are <b>eyebar,</b> {{as can be seen in}} the belowdeck illustration, above, and thus are in tension only, which also may be why it's named that way) This tension only, pin joint construction is the major factor making the move difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{replacement}} span {{was going to}} be 1.6 times heavier than the bridge it replaced, as well as four lanes instead of two, modification and partial demolition was necessary to begin construction on the newer, and much more massive, cable anchorages {{at each end of the}} bridge. The center of the old anchorages were kept as cores, and a newer <b>eyebar</b> system set at [...] apart (versus [...] for the previous bridge) were constructed. They would support a much larger cable load from the original [...] to a much heavier , and consisted of steel eyebars [...] long, with [...] diameter shoes, embedded into new concrete. Each new anchor would weigh [...] and would be embedded deep into compacted soil. Construction of the new cable anchorages was started during the summer of 1948 and continued into 1949.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eyebars</b> may be cast, forged, or {{cut from}} rolled plate. If round stock is used the eyes will usually be forged.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eyebars</b> {{are used}} in {{portions}} of pin-jointed trusses {{where it can be}} established by engineering procedures that the bar will not be imposed with any stress other than tension under all expected conditions.|$|R

2500|$|High {{strength}} wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge {{galvanized steel}} wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed {{over an open}} anchor <b>eyebar.</b> Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a [...] "cable strand" [...] is completed, and temporarily bundled using stainless steel wire. This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, {{the shape of the}} main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1920, Holton D. Robinson (b. 1863, Massena, NY, d. 1945, {{engineer}} of the Williamsburg Bridge) contacted Steinman {{and requested}} that they join forces {{to create a}} design for the Florianópolis Bridge (or Hercilio Luz Bridge, 1926) in Florianópolis, Brazil. After getting advice from Charles Fowler, Steinman agreed and they formed the firm of [...] in 1921, a partnership that lasted until the 1940s. They did not win the contract immediately but continued to collaborate on it and other projects. The early 1920s were considered a tough time for bridge construction, so Steinman tried to design his bridges to be economically pleasing rather than artistic, without sacrificing the structural integrity of the bridge. For example, Robinson and Steinman changed the original plans for the Florianopolis bridge, using <b>eyebar</b> chains as the upper chord of the stiffening truss instead of the conventional wire-cable. The new design produced a very stiff bridge with much less material than the original plan. Other bridge engineers {{would also have to}} take this new economical design into account when competing with Steinman. Steinman was well regarded in the profession and had a reputation for good presentations and for being politically astute.|$|E
50|$|SCC {{caused the}} catastrophic {{collapse}} of the Silver Bridge in December 1967, when an <b>eyebar</b> suspension bridge across the Ohio river at Point Pleasant, West Virginia, suddenly failed. The main chain joint failed and the whole structure fell into the river, killing 46 people in vehicles on the bridge at the time. Rust in the <b>eyebar</b> joint had caused a stress corrosion crack, which went critical {{as a result of}} high bridge loading and low temperature. The failure was exacerbated by a high level of residual stress in the <b>eyebar.</b> The disaster led to a nationwide reappraisal of bridges.|$|E
50|$|Open <b>eyebars</b> are {{not used}} in the cable {{anchorages}} of modern wire-cable suspension bridges. This does not allow the wires to be looped over the eye, rather than requiring threading through a closed eye.|$|R
50|$|As in a {{traditional}} suspension bridge, the primary cable type may be multiple parallel independent cables as in the image at right of the Hutsonville Bridge (no longer extant), or <b>eyebars,</b> or a more conventional composite cable.|$|R
2500|$|The diagonals {{and lower}} chord have {{rectangular}} <b>eyebars</b> [...] wide. Round bars {{are used for}} the counters and sway braces. The ties are on iron s riveted to transverse iron floor beams. Both portals are decorated with quatrefoil brackets and finials.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eyebar</b> links {{have long}} been used in {{suspension}} bridges {{with a number of}} <b>eyebar</b> links combed together to form a highly redundant structure; however, more modern low-redundancy chain link suspension spans fell into general disfavor {{as a result of the}} collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1967, which led to the deaths of 46 people.|$|E

50|$|When {{the lower}} {{side of the}} <b>eyebar</b> failed, all the load was {{transferred}} {{to the other side of}} the <b>eyebar,</b> which then failed by ductile overload. The joint was then held together only by three eyebars, and another slipped off the pin at the center of the bearing, so the chain was completely severed. Collapse of the entire structure was inevitable since all parts of a suspension bridge are in equilibrium with one another. Witnesses afterward estimated that it took only about a minute for the whole bridge to fall.|$|E
50|$|The bridge has two spans of 33 m {{each and}} a total length of 68 m. On either side, there are two strands of wrought iron <b>eyebars,</b> {{originally}} supported by three wooden towers standing {{on the banks of}} the river and on the small island, and anchored in solid masonry blocks on either side. The wooden deck was suspended from the chains by hangers, also of wrought iron.|$|R
50|$|The Dodd Ford Bridge {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{surviving}} bridges known to have been built by Johnson while he operated as a contractor under his own name. In its design and engineering it is a conventional, pin-connected, nine-panel, 148.5 ft, steel truss of the overhead Pratt variety. During {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, this general type of truss was commonly used throughout the United States for highway crossings of approximately 90 to 150 feet in length. Reflecting the prevailing bridge-engineering practices of its time, this bridge has relatively light construction by later automobile-inspired standards. The bridge employs laced channel sections for vertical compression members, paired <b>eyebars</b> for horizontal tension members and lower chord members, angle sections for overhead sway bracing and portal bracing, and crossed <b>eyebars</b> for top-lateral and bottom-lateral bracing. The bridge further evokes its period by virtue of its narrow 15 ft roadway with a plank deck supported on wood stringers. Such design was later prohibited by the Minnesota Highway Commission (established in 1905). The Commission advocated a 16-foot minimum roadway, steel stringers, and preferred a reinforced-concrete deck.|$|R
25|$|The tower saddle {{includes}} <b>eyebars</b> for {{the attachment}} of temporary cables that supported four walkways, each a simple suspension bridge (called a catwalk) that allowed {{access to the}} cable spinning mechanism and the main cable during construction. In several ways similar to a ski lift, additional superior cables carried {{one or more of}} these travelers, wheeled devices that shuttled from one end of the span to the other, pulled by drafting cables manipulated by several winches.|$|R
50|$|Pitting {{corrosion}} {{can also}} help initiate stress corrosion cracking, as happened when a single <b>eyebar</b> on the Silver Bridge, West Virginia failed and ended up killing 46 people on the bridge in December, 1967.|$|E

50|$|Castings {{may also}} have large {{residual}} stresses due to uneven cooling. Residual stress is often a cause of premature failure of critical components, and was probably {{a factor in the}} collapse of the Silver Bridge in West Virginia, United States in December 1967. The <b>eyebar</b> links were castings which showed high levels of residual stress, which in one <b>eyebar,</b> encouraged crack growth. When the crack reached a critical size, it grew catastrophically, and from that moment, the whole structure started to fail in a chain reaction. Because the structure failed in less than a minute, 46 drivers and passengers in cars on the bridge at the time were killed as the suspended roadway fell into the river below.|$|E
25|$|While earlier {{bridges of}} this type use chain <b>eyebars,</b> the long span needed here uses wire cable, like other modern {{suspension}} bridges. Uniquely, this is a single loop of cable rather than the usual pair of cables, and, rather than being spun in place above the catwalks, substantial bundles of strands were dragged into place with temporary support above the catwalks, eventually suspended by tensioning the strand. These strand bundles were then arranged to be finally compacted to form the completed main cable.|$|R
50|$|The Main Avenue (or Gregory Avenue) Bridge {{was built}} in 1906 by the Oswego Bridge Company. It is a swing bridge thru truss rim-bearing swing bridge that rests on ashlar abutments, and carries two {{vehicular}} lanes and two sidewalks. Most of the bridge is riveted together, but the center tower uses <b>eyebars</b> in its construction. In 1985 both the operator's house on the bridge and the machinery below it were removed. The bridge deck was also replaced at the same time.|$|R
