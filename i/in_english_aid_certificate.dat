40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to examine the phonological and {{spelling}} errors made by dyslexic and non-dyslexic children in two different languages, one (Greek, L 1) much more transparent than the other (English, L 2).

Our results showed that dyslexics gener-ally made statistically significant (p <. 05) more mistakes in both languages in comparison to non-dyslexics and statistically significant more phonological mistakes <b>in</b> <b>English</b> than <b>in</b> Greek. In addition, dyslexics made a great number of spelling mistakes in both languages, though of different nature depending on the language in which they occurred. Thus, the dyslexics in our study presented different error profiles <b>in</b> <b>English</b> and <b>in</b> Greek and implications are made that instruction methods should be language specific...|$|R

2500|$|Another game {{studied in}} the context of {{combinatorial}} game theory is chess. In 1953 Alan Turing wrote of the game, [...] "If one can explain quite unambiguously <b>in</b> <b>English,</b> with the <b>aid</b> of mathematical symbols if required, how a calculation is to be done, then it is always possible to programme any digital computer to do that calculation, provided the storage capacity is adequate." [...] In a 1950 paper, Claude Shannon estimated the lower bound of the game-tree complexity of chess to be 10120, and today this {{is referred to as the}} Shannon number. Chess remains unsolved, although extensive study, including work involving the use of supercomputers has created chess end-game tablebases, which shows the result of perfect play for all end-games with seven pieces or less. Infinite chess has an even greater combinatorial complexity than chess (unless only limited end-games, or composed positions with a small number of pieces are being studied).|$|R
