The most important aspect of this impact was decline of investment funds' net asset value (from 139, 0 billion PLN to 77, 2 billion PLN). It was due to decreasing value of securities in funds' investment portfolios and negative balance of payments and amortizations (investors withdrew from funds 25, 4 billion PLN more than they paid in). Declining value of net assets value caused decrease of value of investment <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> companies' management fees and decreasing payments were a reason of falling distribution fees.

Traditionally, {{there has been}} little guidance for post construction management of these sites. Post-construction management has largely been left to the discretion of the permit holder. There were no methods in place to effectively determine when regulatory requirements were achieved, or a standard to certify that the site was considered complete. Over the last decade, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has developed standardized mechanisms and processes for site management, reporting, and closeout procedures. These include establishment of site <b>management</b> crews, predictable <b>funding</b> sources for <b>management</b> <b>activities,</b> monitoring and reporting methods, and inter-disciplinary adaptive management teams that develop strategies for short and long-term site management.

In Ghana, it {{has been a}}n annual tragedy occurrence, particularly in the capital city, Accra resulting in loss of lives and property. Regardless of the many suggested solutions in mitigating these floods, Ghana still experience excessive flooding.

The study revealed that the single dimensional approach to flood management, lack of adequate funding, poor attitude of residence (Ghanaians) towards the environment and sanitation and finally the ad-hoc management solution to flood posed a major challenge in addressing flood situations. It is recommended that a more sustainable strategy for flood management, holistically addressing flood challenges, intensifying education and prompt prediction of flood occurrence and timely and adequate <b>funding</b> for flood <b>management</b> <b>activities</b> would help address flood challenges.
