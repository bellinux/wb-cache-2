5|$|Another wealthy family, the Eccles, {{commissioned}} Arrington {{to write}} a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan {{part of the family}} originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only positive things about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent business dealings. To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.|$|E
500|$|The lawsuit {{missed the}} filing {{deadline}} of January 1, 1993. The {{speaker of the}} Florida House of Representatives commissioned a group to research and provide a report by which the equitable claim bill could be evaluated. It took them nearly a year to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>research,</b> including interviews, and writing. On December 22, 1993, historians from Florida State University, Florida A University, and the University of Florida delivered a 100-page report (with 400 pages of attached documentation) on the Rosewood massacre. It was based on available primary documents, and interviews mostly with black survivors of the incident. Due to the media attention received by residents of Cedar Key and Sumner following filing of the claim by survivors, white participants were discouraged from offering interviews to the historians. The report used a taped description of the events by Jason McElveen, a Cedar Key resident who had since died, and an interview with Ernest Parham, who {{was in high school}} in 1923 and happened upon the lynching of Sam Carter. Parham said he had never spoken of the incident because he was never asked. [...] The report was titled [...] "Documented History of the Incident which Occurred at Rosewood, Florida in January 1923". Gary Moore, the investigative journalist who wrote the 1982 story in The St. Petersburg Times that reopened the Rosewood case, criticized demonstrable errors in the report. The commissioned group retracted the most serious of these, without public discussion. They delivered the final report to the Florida Board of Regents and it became part of the legislative record.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2006, Rowe was {{featured}} in an article admitting to the inaccuracy found in Loose Change, such as inaccurately stating a B-52 flew into the Empire State Building (it was actually a B-25 in the 1940s). [...] "We don't ever {{come out and say}} that everything we say is 100 percent. We know there are errors in the documentary, and we've actually left them in there so that people discredit us and <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> for themselves." [...] In 2007, media entrepreneur Mark Cuban was going to distribute Loose Change, and Charlie Sheen was going to narrate.

2500|$|The MAUD Committee {{was founded}} in {{response}} to Rudolf Peierls and Otto Robert Frisch's memorandum, in March 1940. The Frisch-Peierls memorandum was {{a discussion of the}} potential military feasibility a nuclear bomb. It was purely theoretical, so the purpose of the MAUD committee was to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> required to determine if applying nuclear technology to make a bomb was, in reality, feasible. The chair of the committee was George Thomson. Each university where research was being done had a director as well. All the research finally culminated, after fifteen months, in two reports, [...] "Use of Uranium for a Bomb" [...] and [...] "Use of Uranium as a source of power", known collectively as the MAUD report. These reports discussed the necessity of a super-bomb for the war effort. In order to research this further, the British created their own nuclear program officially named Tube Alloys.|$|E
