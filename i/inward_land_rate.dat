40|$|In its Digital Single Market (DSM) strategy, the European Commission has rightly {{noted the}} {{importance}} of lowering the price paid for basic cross-border delivery by consumers and by small and medium size retail shippers. Consumers and SMEs may have few alternatives to the National Postal Operators (NPOs), or may be unaware of the options that they have. These concerns led to the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal in May 2016. 3 With its legislative proposal, the Commission has sought (1) to strengthen the data gathering powers of Member State postal regulatory authorities, and to oblige them to collect data at both retail and wholesale levels; (2) to increase transparency into pricing for those who use cross-border parcel delivery services; (3) to oblige Member State postal regulatory authorities to assess annually the affordability of these services; and (4) to open cross-border Terminal Dues (TD) and <b>Inward</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Rates</b> (ILR) arrangements to competitors There are parallels that can be drawn between the payment flows for cross-border parcel delivery and those of telecommunications, especially those of international mobile roaming. As with roaming, {{it is clear that}} the linkages between wholesale payments between and corresponding retail prices need to be properly understood in order to craft good policy. Another useful lesson is that Member State postal regulatory authorities are unlikely to address cross-border problems not only because of limitations in their respective mandates, but also because they have no incentive to take challenging measures to benefit residents of other countries. There are, however, also important differences between roaming versus parcel delivery. Where high wholesale charges were a major driver of high retail prices for international mobile roaming, the wholesale payments for cross-border parcel delivery appear instead to be below cost. This implies that it is the 2 ̆ 01 cspread 2 ̆ 01 d between retail price and the wholesale payment that is inflated, at least for small retail shippers and for consumers. Reviewing the Commission's proposed Regulation with all of this in mind, it appears to be on target. The main question that remains open is whether NPOs will be able to adjust TD and ILR rates upward to reflect true costs, as they will be strongly motivated to do; here as well, however, there are grounds for cautious optimism...|$|R

40|$|Stockholm TMA handles {{traffic to}} Sweden’s two biggest {{airports}} movement wise: Stockholm Arlanda and Stockholm Bromma. The airports {{are located in}} close proximity to each other, meaning traffic {{in and out of the}} airports is likely to conflict, depending on the runway configurations. Stockholm TMA capacity will depend on how complex the traffic is, especially in the arrival sector (sector East), as well as weather, wind and other capacity factors. The thesis focuses on arriving traffic to Stockholm Arlanda. The number of arrivals for any given hour is restricted by a <b>landing</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>landing</b> <b>rate</b> is set depending on a number of factors.

40|$|The role of {{olfactory}} cues for host {{search is}} much less investigated in day-active butterflies than in their relatives, the nocturnal moths. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate whether host-plant volatiles from foliar extracts of hop, Humulus lupulus L. (Cannabaceae), evoke electroantennographic (EAG) responses, increase <b>landing</b> <b>rates,</b> and stimulate egg-laying behavior of gravid Polygonia c-album L. (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) females. Eighty-nine volatile compounds were detected in a non-concentrated methanol extract of hop by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 11 of which elicited an EAG response. Concentration of the crude extract significantly reduced <b>landing</b> <b>rates</b> on artificial leaves treated with the sample due to loss of volatile compounds, but after landing the oviposition response of gravid females was not affected. A mixture of eight commercially available EAG-active volatiles increased the <b>landing</b> <b>rate</b> of gravid females to their source but did not act as oviposition stimulants. Dividing the volatile compounds into two groups - consisting of (1) hexanal, (E) - 2 -hexenal, octanal, nonanal, and decanal, and (2) sulcatone, humulene, and benzyl alcohol - obliterated effectiveness, revealing synergism between compounds.

40|$|The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) {{oil spill}} damaged {{thousands}} of km 2 of intertidal marsh along shorelines that had been experiencing elevated rates of erosion for decades. Yet, the contribution of marsh oiling to landscape-scale degradation and subsequent land loss {{has been difficult to}} quantify. Here, we applied advanced remote sensing techniques to map changes in marsh land cover and open water before and after oiling. We segmented the marsh shorelines into non-oiled and oiled reaches and calculated the <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> for each 10 % increase in oil cover (e. g. 0 % to > 70 %), to determine if <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> for each reach oiling category were significantly different before and after oiling. Finally, we calculated background land-loss rates to separate natural and oil-related erosion and land loss. Oiling caused significant increases in land losses, particularly along reaches of heavy oiling (> 20 % oil cover). For reaches with ≥ 20 % oiling, <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> increased abruptly during the 2010 - 2013 period, and the loss rates during this period are significantly different from both the pre-oiling (p < 0. 0001) and 2013 - 2016 post-oiling periods (p < 0. 0001). The pre-oiling and 2013 - 2016 post-oiling periods exhibit no significant differences in <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> across oiled and non-oiled reaches (p = 0. 557). We conclude that oiling increased land loss by more than 50 %, but that <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> returned to background levels within 3 - 6 years after oiling, suggesting that oiling results in a large but temporary increase in <b>land</b> loss <b>rates</b> along the shoreline...|$|R

Targeted transport by kinesin motors can be correlated with posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of the tubulin subunits in specific microtubules. To directly examine the influence of specific PTMs on kinesin- 1 motility, we generated tubulin subunits that were either enriched in or lacking acetylation of α-tubulin lysine 40 (K 40) or detyrosination of the α-tubulin C-terminal tail. We show that K 40 acetylation does not result in significant changes in kinesin- 1 ’s <b>landing</b> <b>rate</b> or motility parameters (velocity and run length) across experimental conditions. In contrast, detyrosination causes a moderate increase in kinesin- 1 ’s <b>landing</b> <b>rate.</b> The fact {{that the effects of}} detyrosination are dampened by prior K 40 acetylation indicates that the combination of PTMs may be an important aspect of the functional output of microtubule heterogeneity. Importantly, our results indicate that the moderate influences that single PTMs have on kinesin- 1 in vitro do not explain the strong correlation between specific PTMs and kinesin- 1 transport in cells. Thus, additional mechanisms for regulating kinesin- 1 transport in cells must be explored in future work...|$|R
