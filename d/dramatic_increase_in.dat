5|$|During September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual {{increases}} in seismic activity near the Arenas crater.

Chemical {{analysis of the}} volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight {{times as many as}} had been recorded from 2009–2010. 2010 marked the beginning of {{increases in}} sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, Voorhis's first {{legislative}} initiative was {{to propose a}} <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> spending for the Works Progress Administration {{in order to increase}} employment. While this effort was unsuccessful, Congress, faced with an economic downturn the following year, increased WPA spending beyond the level which Voorhis had sought. While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing government expenditures and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House Banking Committee chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most of the interest they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank stockholders.|$|E

5|$|In mid-May, a monsoon trough {{situated}} {{over the}} Bay of Bengal began {{showing signs of}} cyclonic development. By May20, synoptic data indicated {{the presence of a}} weak circulation; however, the system remained disorganized. Following a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> convection and organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on May23 and subsequently began monitoring the system as a tropical depression hours later. Initially, the depression tracked slowly towards the north-northwest before abruptly turning westward and slowing due to weak mid-level steering currents. During this time, the storm gradually intensified and was limited by northwesterly wind shear. By May26, the storm turned northward and accelerated. Later that day, 01B attained its peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) shortly before making landfall in eastern India. The system quickly weakened once inland and was last noted on May 27 as a dissipating low.|$|E

5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , {{it is the most}} discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E

5|$|Stanley {{called the}} General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt {{unjustly}} burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was {{in better shape}} financially than many of its peers, Stanley still sought to balance the budget. The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed {{of many of the}} bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by M. M. Logan. Additional taxes were passed on distilled spirits, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> funds yielded by the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.|$|E
5|$|The Labour Party {{came into}} {{government}} {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a working majority of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E
