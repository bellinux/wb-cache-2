50|$|Dowel Bar Retrofit (DBR) is {{a process}} that re-establishes load {{transfer}} capability on <b>doweled</b> joints and cracks by installing epoxy-coated, round steel dowels into existing concrete pavement across transverse joints and/or cracks. Slots are cut using diamond-tipped saw blades; the existing concrete is removed and the dowels are placed in the slots across the joints or cracks. The slots are then backfilled with a non-shrink grout and the pavement is diamond ground to restore smoothness. The diamond grinding removes excess grout and any displacement of panels. The entire road is often diamond ground to remove bumps or dips and provide a safe, quiet riding surface. In Wisconsin, researchers found that the overall accident rate for diamond ground surfaces was only 60 percent of the rate for the non-ground surfaces.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the in vitro fracture resistance of roots with glass-fiber and metal <b>dowels</b> with different designs. METHODS: Fifty-endodontically treated maxillary central incisors were embedded in acrylic resin. Ten of them received only the coronary preparation, {{and the remaining}} forty were embedded (except for 4 mm of the cervical area) after removing the clinical crowns. Specimens were divided into five groups (n= 10) : control (teeth with only coronary preparation), cylindrical cast <b>dowel,</b> conical cast <b>dowel,</b> cylindrical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> and conical glass-fiber <b>dowel.</b> Specimens were subjected to an increasing compressive load (N) until fracture. RESULTS: ANOVA indicated significant difference (P<. 05) among the groups, and the Tukey-KramerÂ´s test identified these differences. The control group (867 Â± 243 N) presented the highest values and was statistically similar to cylindrical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> group (711 Â± 180 N). There is no significant difference among the metal <b>dowel</b> cylindrical (435 Â± 245 N) or conical (585 Â± 164 N) group and conical glass-fiber <b>dowel</b> (453 Â± 112 N).

To avoid this erosion problem, alternative dowers bars are developed. METHODS: In this study, the bearing stresses between the FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bar and concrete slab are calculated and compared with its allowable bearing stress to check its structural stability in the concrete pavement. These comparisons are conducted with several cross-sections of FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bars. Comprehensive laboratory tests including the shear load-deflection test on a full-scale specimen and the full-scale accelerated joint concrete pavement test are conducted {{and the results were}} compared with those from the steel <b>dowel</b> bar.

50|$|Brettstapel {{was invented}} in the 1970s by the German {{engineer}} Julius Natterer and is now commonly used across Austria, Switzerland and Germany, whilst slowly emerging in the UK. Originally it consisted of low grade timber posts continuously nailed together to form panels strong enough to support mines and railways. In 1999 a German company developed a <b>doweled</b> system which relied on the varying moisture content to form solid structural panels however many companies introduced glue to the system to strengthen it. In 2001, a new variant of Brettstapel was developed where diagonal dowels replaced the perpendicular ones thus resolving separation issues and allowing for longer spans. Presently only one company uses the diagonal dowel system whilst all except for two (who still use nails) use perpendicular dowels, mostly without glue. There are now a range of companies producing CLT cross laminated timber (rotating layers of boards) using timber dowels based upon Brettstapel.|$|E

The <b>doweled</b> joints in the vertical loop had holes drilled into them to reduce noise and oscillation. Modification of the track connections was also done. The lift had a cover installed that would slide over the saw-tooth profile of the anti-rollbacks, making the surface smooth and eliminating noise created as the anti-rollbacks jumped between teeth. The change in the safety system required a control system to ensure rides safety. The train's speed is controlled, and any variance in the speed causes the cover to be pulled aside to expose the saw-tooth, causing the anti-rollbacks to engage. Should the system fail, springs would push the cover aside to ensure the anti-rollbacks would engage in case an emergency would arise.|$|E

This mechanism depends mainly on a parameter known as the modulus of <b>dowel</b> support (K), the value {{of which can be}} determined by load testing.

The first project evaluated the performance of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical shaped <b>dowel</b> bars at different spacing intervals using full <b>dowel</b> baskets. The performance potential of standard 1. 5 inch round and elliptical <b>dowels</b> placed in the wheel paths only was also evaluated on the same project. The second project compared corrosion resistant <b>dowel</b> bar (stainless steel and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) <b>dowel</b> bars) performance to round 1. 5 inch epoxy-coated steel <b>dowel</b> bars. The stainless steel and GFRP bars are for possible use in environments where steel corrosion may be an issue. Performance data was measured on both projects in terms of deflections, using falling weight deflectometer (FWD) data collected biannually. Joint faulting data was collected over the five-year test period for both projects. Roughness data was collected for only the elliptical <b>dowel</b> bar project over the five-year test period. Resilient modulus values were found by triaxial testing of the pavement subgrade samples. Performance criteria graphed verses resilient modulus allowed for the comparison of different <b>dowels</b> as the subgrade resilient modulus changed. The elliptical <b>dowel</b> bar study indicated medium elliptical <b>dowel</b> bars at 12 inch or 15 inch spacing perform equally to the standard 1. 5 inch round <b>dowel</b> bars at 12 inch spacing. The elliptical study also indicated the potential use of medium elliptical <b>dowel</b> bars in wheel paths only.
