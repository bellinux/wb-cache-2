High specific radioactivity 14 C- and 3 H-labelled forms of <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> and 5, 6 -trans-cholecalciferol and its 25 -hydroxy derivative were synthesized and their metabolism was studied in chicks and rats.

Marquette University, 2013 Six-membered carbocycles are {{abundant}} in natural products. This structural feature {{is present in}} terpenes, secosteroids, antibiotics, and even imbedded in the polycyclic framework of complex alkaloids. A wide variety of methodologies have been utilized for the preparation of six-membered carbocycles including Robinson annulation, Diels-Alder cycloaddition, Dieckmann condensation, ring closing metathesis, photochemical carbonylation of alkenylcyclopropanes, addition of soft nucleophiles to acyclic (ç 5 -pentadienyl) iron cations, etc. Acyclic (ç 5 -pentadienyl) iron(+ 1) cations were first prepared about 50 years ago. The reactivity of these complexes is of continuing interest, particularly for the synthesis of conjugated polyenes and 2 -cyclohexenones. These types of cationic complexes are powerful electrophiles and the site of nucleophilic attack is dependent on substituents on the pentadienyl ligand, {{the nature of the}} nucleophile, counter ion and 2 ̆ 2 spectator 2 ̆ 2 ligands on the complex. Tricarbonyl(ç 5 - 1 -methylpentadienyl) iron(+ 1), tricarbonyl(ç 5 - 1 -phenylpentadienyl) iron(+ 1), tricarbonyl(ç 5 - 3 -methylpentadienyl) iron(+ 1), and tricarbonyl(ç 5 - 1, 5 -dimethylpentadienyl) iron(+ 1) cations were prepared following literature procedures. The reactivity of these substituted acyclic (pentadienyl) iron cations with malonate, nitroacetate, sulfonate and phosphonoacetate nucleophiles were examined as potential routes to synthesis of natural product possessing six-membered carbocycles. Addition of stabilized/soft carbon nucleophiles occurs preferentially at the internal positions to afford cyclohexenones via (pentenediyl) iron intermediates. Nucleophilic addition at the terminal positions affords (2, 4 -dienoate) iron complexes mostly as minor products. This observed regioselectivity was explained mainly on the basis of FMO vs charge control. In order to synthesize the oxygenated terpene (±) - 10 -Hydroxycarvone a ketoester was synthesized in five steps starting from commercially available 2, 4 -hexadienal. Deprotonation of the keteoester followed by DIBAL-reduction gave (±) - 10 -Hydroxycarvone. Alternatively, saponification of the ketoester afforded (±) -carvonic acid. Furthermore to synthesize the <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> A-ring fragment, a cyclohexenone was synthesized in five steps from commercially available ethyl 3 -methyl- 4 -oxocrotonate. Luche and catalytic reductions of the cyclohexenone gave diastereomeric mixture of cyclohexanols.

40|$|Increased endothelin- 1 {{expression}} in the kidney in hypercalcemic rats. BackgroundAlthough hypercalcemia causes diuresis and natriuresis, the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not well established. Recently, {{the important role of}} the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) in hypercalcemia-induced polyuria was reported. Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) that is locally produced in the nephron has been suggested to have the natriuretic and/or diuretic effects in the kidney. Therefore, we hypothesized that ET- 1 expression could be increased through the activation of CaR in the kidney in hypercalcemia. MethodsRats were made hypercalcemic by <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> (DHT) treatment. The urinary concentration of ET- 1 and the mRNA expression of ET- 1 in the kidney were determined. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine types of the cells that produce ET- 1. CaR and ET- 1 promoter luciferase constructs were co-expressed in COS- 7 cells and the ET- 1 promoter activity following the addition of extracellular calcium was measured by the luciferase assay. ResultsIn hypercalcemic rat, urinary ET- 1 excretion was increased by twofold, and ET- 1 mRNA expression was increased in the kidney cortex by threefold. In cortical collecting duct (CCD), both principal cells and intercalated cells synthesized ET- 1. In cells that express CaR, ET- 1 promoter was activated in a dose-dependent manner by extracellular calcium over the range of 0. 5 to 3. 0 mmol/L. ConclusionsFirst, activation of CaR increases ET- 1 transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Second, hypercalcemia increases ET- 1 production in the kidney cortex. These data suggest the possibility that CaR might {{play an important role in}} hypercalcemia-induced increase in ET- 1 production...|$|E
40|$|Acute hypercalcaemia {{increases}} urinary {{sodium and}} water excretion; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Because vitamin D-induced hypercalcaemia increases the renal expression of endothelin (ET) - 1, {{we hypothesized that}} ET- 1 mediates the effects of hypercalcaemia on renal sodium and water handling. Hypercalcaemia was induced in 8 -week-old, parathyroid hormone-supplemented, male mice by oral administration of <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> (DHT) for 3 days. DHT-treated mice became hypercalcaemic and displayed increased urinary water and sodium excretion compared to controls. mRNA levels of ET- 1 and the transcription factors CCAAT-enhancer binding protein β and δ were specifically increased in the distal convoluted tubule and downstream segments in DHT-treated mice. To examine {{the role of the}} ET system in hypercalcaemia-induced natriuresis and polyuria, mice were treated with the ET- 1 receptor antagonist macitentan, with or without DHT. Mice treated with both macitentan and DHT displayed hypercalcaemia and polyuria similar to that in mice treated with DHT alone; however, no increase in urinary sodium excretion was observed. To identify the affected sodium transport mechanism, we assessed the response to various diuretics in control and DHT-treated hypercalcaemic mice. Amiloride, an inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), increased sodium excretion to a lesser extent in DHT-treated mice compared to control mice. Mice treated with either macitentan+DHT or macitentan alone had a similar response to amiloride. In summary, vitamin D-induced hypercalcaemia increases the renal production of ET- 1 and decreases ENaC activity, which is probably responsible for the rise in urinary sodium excretion but not for polyuria...|$|E

In rats fed <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> to induce hypercalcemia, Western blot analysis revealed significant upregulation of both cPLA 2 and PGHS- 2 in the kidney cortex and {{the inner and outer}} medulla. Immunofluorescence localized intrarenal cPLA 2 and PGHS- 2 to interstitial cells of the inner and outer medulla, and to macula densa and cortical thick ascending limbs in both control and hypercalcemic rats. Hypercalcemia had no effect on intrarenal expression of PGHS- 1. To determine if AT 1 angiotensin II receptor activation was involved in the stimulation of cPLA 2 and PGHS- 2 in hypercalcemia, we treated rats with the AT 1 receptor antagonist, losartan. Losartan abolished the polydipsia associated with hypercalcemia, prevented the increase in cPLA 2 protein in all regions of the kidney, and diminished PGHS- 2 expression in the inner medulla. In addition, losartan completely prevented the increase in urinary PGE 2 excretion in hypercalcemic rats. Intrarenal levels of angiotensin II were unchanged in hypercalcemia. These data indicate that hypercalcemia stimulates intrarenal cPLA 2 and PGHS- 2 protein expression. Our results further support a role for angiotensin II, acting on AT 1 receptors, in mediating this stimulation...|$|E

Following a sudden death due to pulmonary calcinosis in an adolescent after renal transplantation, we retrospectively reviewed clinical, biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients with uremia, on dialysis, or following renal transplantation cared for at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 1983. Soft tissue calcification was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). Forty-three patients (36 percent) had systemic calcinosis (Group A); the most frequent sites of mineral deposition were blood vessels, lung, kidney, myocardium, coronary artery, central nervous system, and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification was uniformly accompanied by deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had small amounts of focal calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue calcification (Group C). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of vitamin D or its analogues, the form of vitamin D medication prescribed, the peak calcium × phosphorus product, the age at onset of renal failure, and male sex were jointly associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> and vitamin D 2 or D 3. The duration of renal failure, peak serum calcium, serum calcium at death, serum phosphorus at death, and primary renal diagnosis, were not statistically associated with calcinosis. The data from this series confirm that soft tissue calcification is a significant problem in young patients with advanced renal disease. Lung, myocardium, and coronary arteries were frequent sites of calcium deposition, with clinically significant, and in some cases fatal consequences...|$|E
40|$|Experimentally induced {{calcification}} within mitochondria {{has been}} studied electron microscopically. Cells investigated comprise hepatic cells damaged by CC 1 4 intoxication, myocardial cells damaged by prolonged <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> (DHT) administration, and cells from skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) damaged by DHT sensibilization and local injury. Cells from a human bowel carcinoma were studied too. Two types of intramitochondrial inorganic inclusion have been found. The first consists of clusters of apatite-like, needle-shaped crystals (crystalline aggregates), the second of clusters of very fine granules (granular aggregates). The former have been found mainly in mitochondria in apparently normal myocardial and muscular cells, the latter in mitochondria of degenerated hepatic, neoplastic, and myocardial cells. Crystalline aggregates {{are closely related to}} the membranes of cristae at first, but they later spread to occupy the whole mitochondrial matrix. Granular aggregates are initially found in the mitochondrial matrix near, but perhaps not touching, cristae; by growing they come into close contact with cristal membranes. Both types of aggregate show intrinsic electron opacity, which disappears after formic acid decalcification. Only the crystalline aggregates give an electron diffraction pattern of crystallinity. Uranium and lead staining of decalcified sections shows that both types of aggregate are intimately connected with an organic substrate. The substrate of crystalline aggregates consists of very thin, elongated structures shaped like the inorganic crystals. The substrate of granular aggregates consists of amorphous material gathered in clusters, with the same roundish shape and intercristal position as the inorganic granules. Both types of substrate are stained by phosphotungstic acid at low pH and by silver nitrate-methenamine after periodic acid oxidation. These results show that the organic content of the substrates includes glycoproteins; they have been confirmed by the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) method under the optical microscope. These findings have been discussed in relation to the recent discovery of organic Cat+-binding sites in mitochondria and to the general problems of soft tissue calcification...|$|E
40|$|The cAMP {{system in}} vasopressin–sensitive nephron {{segments}} of the vitamin D-treated rat. The present study was undertaken to investigate the cAMP system in isolated vasopressin (AVP) -sensitive {{segments of the}} hypercalcemie rat. Hypercalcemia was produced by supplementation of diet with <b>dihydrotachysterol,</b> achieving a mean serum calcium of 12. 6 mg%. Maximal urinary concentration was only 1982 ± 119 mOsm/kg H 2 O in pair, watered hypercalcemie rats when compared to 2478 ± 93 mOsm/kg H 2 O in controls (N = 7) (P < 0. 01). Vasopressin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at concentrations of vasopressin between 10 - 9 and 10 - 7 M was indistinguishable in the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) of tubules dissected from hypercalcemie rats or normocalcemic rats. Likewise, in situ cAMP accumulation in response to 10 - 7 M AVP was not significantly different in either OMCD or IMCD of hypercalcemie or normocalcemic rats at either isotonic or hypertonic media conditions. In contrast, while 10 - 7 M AVP significantly (P < 0. 05) increased cAMP accumulation in the medullary ascending limb (MAL) of normocalcemic rats it {{failed to do so}} in the MAL of hypercalcemie rats. This failure to accumulate cAMP appears to be due to impairment in AVP-stimulated adenylate cyclase rather than to enhanced phosphodiesterase activity. A similar decrement in glucagon stimulated adenylate cyclase occurred with 10 - 6 M glucagon. The results demonstrate that in chronic hypercalcemia the cAMP system in the OMCT and IMCD of the rat is intact, but the MAL demonstrates abnormal AVP responsiveness due to impaired adenylate cyclase. Such an effect in the MAL may explain the decreased medullary-solute content in hypercalcemia and thereby contribute to the concentrating defect seen in the vitamin D treated rat...|$|E
40|$|Calcification {{complicates the}} use of the polymer {{polyurethane}} in cardiovascular implants. To date only costly experimental circulatory animal models have been useful for investigating this disease process. In this paper we report that polyurethane calcification in rat subdermal implants is enhanced by overdosing with a vitamin-D analog. The calcification-prone state, known as calciphylaxis, was induced in 4 -week old rats by oral administration of a vitamin-D analog, <b>dihydrotachysterol.</b> We studied two commercially available polyurethanes (Biomer® and Mitrathane®) and two proprietary polyurethanes (PEU- 2000 and PEU- 100). PEU- 100 is unique because it is derivatized with ethanehydroxy-bisphosphonate (EHBP) for calcification resistance. Polyurethane calcium and phosphate levels and morphological changes due to calciphylaxis were compared with those of control rat subdermal explants in 60 -day studies. Increased polyurethane mineralization was observed due to calciphylaxis with 60 -day rat subdermal explants of Biomer®, Mitrathane®, and PEU- 2000 (calcium levels, respectively, 4. 13 ± 0. 56, 18. 61 ± 2. 73, and 3. 37 ± 0. 22 μg/mg, mean ± standard error) as compared to control explants (calcium levels, respectively, 1. 22 ± 0. 1, 12. 57 ± 0. 86, and 0. 20 ± 0. 86 μg/mg). The study also demonstrated that with 60 -day implants calciphylaxis had no side effects on somatic growth and serum calcium levels. Explant surface morphology of these polyurethane explants examined by scanning electron microscopy, back scattering electron imaging coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and light microscopy demonstrated the presence of predominantly surface-oriented calcification. PEU- 100, derivatized with 100 n. moles/mg of EHBP, resisted calcification with explant calcium levels 0. 51 ± 0. 01 (calciphylaxis) and 0. 38 ± 0. 01 (control) μg/mg. It is concluded that calciphylaxis enhances superficial polyurethane calcification in rat subdermal implants and that an EHBP-modified polyurethane resists calcification despite calciphylaxis. Rat subdermal implants using calciphylaxis may be generally useful for evaluating the calcification potential of various biomedical polymers. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E
40|$|In chronic hypercalcemia, {{inhibition}} of medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) NaCl reabsorption is mediated by elevated intrarenal prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). The study presented here demonstrates that basolateral Na+-K+-ATPase activity is {{not affected by}} hypercalcemia. We also show that increased extracellular Ca 2 + and PGE 2 directly inhibit activity of the Na+-K+- 2 Cl- cotransporter. The mechanisms and source of elevated (PGE 2) in hypercalcemia are not understood. In rats fed <b>dihydrotachysterol</b> (DHT) to induce hypercalcemia, we measured the intrarenal expression of enzymes important in prostaglandin production, namely, cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2), prostaglandin H synthase- 1 (PGHS- 1) and prostaglandin H synthase- 2 (PGHS- 2). The rate limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis in the PLA 2 -mediated release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Using Western blot analysis, we have shown expression of cPLA 2 in normal rat kidney tissue, with significant up-regulation after 3 days of hypercalcemia. PGHS- 1 is expressed constitutively in almost all tissues including kidney {{and we found that}} PGHS- 1 protein levels remained unchanged with hypercalcemia. Induction of PGHS- 2, the other critical enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis, is generally associated with inflammation, mitogenesis and ovulation. PGHS- 2 has also been shown to exist under unstimulated conditions in the kidney, and we have provided further support for this. In addition, we have demonstrated that PGHS- 2 protein expression is significantly and maximally increased in hypercalcemic animals after 3 days of ingestion of DHT-containing diet, and displays a similar cellular pattern of distribution to cPLA 2. However, unlike cPLA 2, after the initial stimulation on day 3, PGHS- 2 protein levels in the inner and outer medulla return to baseline levels. Urinary PGE 2 excretion was significantly elevated in hypercalcemia rats after 5 days of DHT-containing diet. Angiotensin II has been reported to stimulate PGE 2 production in kidney tubular epithelial cells, mesangial cells and interstitial cells. We investigated the possibility that Ang II AT 1 receptor activation occurs in hypercalcemia, and mediates the increase in intrarenal cPLA 2 and PGHS- 2 protein expression. Our data strongly support this hypothesis. Taken together, these data indicate that in chronic hypercalcemia, {{inhibition of}} NaCl reabsorption is not due to inhibition of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump. Both increased Ca 2 + o and PGE 2 inhibit the Na+-K+- 2 Cl- cotransporter, and we propose that these factors may be involved in the inhibition of NaCl transport in hypercalcemia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hypercalcemia stimulates intrarenal cPLA 2 and PGHS- 2 protein expression. Our data suggest that stimulation of cPLA 2 expression, through Ang II activation of the AT 1 receptor in the inner medulla, largely mediates increased PGE 2 excretion in hypercalcemic animals.
