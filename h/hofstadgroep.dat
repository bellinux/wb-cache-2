5|$|On 10 November 2004, two {{suspected}} attackers {{were captured}} after an hour-long siege {{of a building}} in The Hague. They were in possession of three grenades and were accused of planning to murder Wilders {{as well as a}} fellow MP, Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The suspects were presumed to be members of what the Dutch intelligence agency, the General Intelligence and Security Service, has termed the Hofstad Network (<b>Hofstadgroep).</b> Since this incident Wilders has been under constant security protection because of frequent threats to his life. In September 2007, a Dutch woman was sentenced to a one-year prison term for sending more than 100 threatening emails to Wilders. In 2009, a rapper from Rotterdam was sentenced to 80 hours community service and a two-month suspended jail term for threatening Wilders in a rap song. Wilders was listed as the most threatened politician in the Netherlands in 2008.|$|E

50|$|He was {{the oldest}} member of the Dutch-based {{terrorist}} group, <b>Hofstadgroep</b> or Hofstad Network. He {{is considered to be}} the spiritual leader of the group.|$|E
5000|$|The Hofstad Network (Dutch: Hofstadnetwerk or <b>Hofstadgroep,</b> [...] or [...] ) is a {{group of}} mostly young Dutch persons, mainly North African ancestry, which Interpol has {{described}} as a terrorist organization. The name [...] "Hofstad" [...] was originally the codename the Dutch secret service AIVD used for the network and leaked to the media. The name likely refers to the nickname of the city of The Hague, where some of the suspected terrorists live.|$|E
5000|$|There, {{she worked}} on several {{political}} cases. These are cases in which, according to Böhler, the case [...] "is about more than the hearing the trial of a crime, where political aspect, the history and the motivation of the client matter. Böhler defended PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan since 1998 and Volkert van der Graaf, the murderer of Pim Fortuyn, since 2002. She represented {{people who did not}} want Jorge Zorreguieta to attend the marriage of his daughter Máxima Zorreguieta and crown prince Willem-Alexander. In 2005 she defended Samir Azzouz, member of the <b>Hofstadgroep.</b> She also was legal counsel for Ayaan Hirsi Ali during the crisis about her nationality.|$|E

50|$|Marco Hughes, former activist {{director}} of MDI (Meldpunt Discriminatie op Internet), a centre that monitors racism on the internet, has also {{fallen victim to}} Gregorius Nekschot, when his organization incarnated as a rat copulating with would-be Dutch fundamentalist terrorists (<b>Hofstadgroep)</b> in one of Nekschots cartoons in Misselijke grappen 1(pag 138). In a Turkish journal Hughes complained in 2006 that Dutch authorities {{turned a blind eye}} to racist internet sites, naming both an apparently no longer existing site which visitors called for setting fire to mosques and a site in support of Ayaan Hirsi Ali publishing online shirts poking fun at the prophet. Hughs said Dutch authorities failed to take action about Muslim complaints. In a news release on their website MDI said it would take a special interest in monitoring developments in the case. A surge of 80 reports about cartoons and text on the website of the cartoonist at the beginning of 2005 was passed on by them to the public prosecutor. It was denied that they had filed a complaint in the name of Dutch convert Van de Ven, as was reported by others. The timing of the surge of complaints follows shortly the murder of Theo van Gogh in November 2004, perhaps providing a foundation for suggestions by Opheffer and Sylvain Ephimenco in Trouw (see press reactions) that prosecution of Van Gogh smells of a posthumous reckoning with the murdered filmmaker.|$|E
40|$|Criminal law on {{hate speech}} {{has become a}} hotly debated topic in the past decade. In the Netherlands and in England and Wales {{legislative}} changes and proposals abound, while cases such as the prosecution of MP Geert Wilders have received considerable attention. How to deal with hate speech in an increasingly pluralist society has become a pressing question. Moreover, with the attacks in New York, London and Madrid {{and the appearance of}} radical groups and individuals, such as Abu Hamza Al-Masri in England and the <b>Hofstadgroep</b> in the Netherlands, public debate has been dominated by the problems of terrorism and radicalisation. As a result, extreme speech – presumed to encourage radicalisation and terrorism – is a major issue. This comparative study deals with how ideas behind the law on hate speech and extreme speech in the Netherlands and England and Wales – including the influence of European and international law – have developed since 2001 and how this can be explained by reference to their historical origins. The aim of this research is to discover how Dutch, English/Welsh and international law have developed over time, but more importantly: why it has developed in that way...|$|E
