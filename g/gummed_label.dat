40|$|Significant {{problems}} for the transfer of information in the complex medical environment include the requirements for machine reading {{of a variety of}} documents, linking the patient and services with certainty and in the clinical laboratory linking the sample identity with instrumental data output. A system has been developed to solve these problems. Alpha numeric including bar coded patient identity is prepared readily at patient admission in negative form for patient wrist bracelet and nursing station use. All information on the negatives can be transferred by flash illumination to an ultraviolet light sensitive <b>gummed</b> <b>label</b> which may be affixed to documents, drugs, patient sample or service. Light pen scanning of the bar code identity provides a facile entry of bar coded patient, document, service, sample or result information into a computer. In the clinical laboratory automated laser reading of the sample accession number has been coupled with on line analytical instrument output. Overall this system eliminates most manual data transcription from patient arrival to report generation. It is especially applicable to minicomputers and distributed networks...|$|E
50|$|Shepard {{also began}} {{printing}} <b>gummed</b> <b>labels</b> for each case, listing {{the cases that}} cited it. To help the lawyers quickly learn why one case had been cited by another, Shepard’s started including one-letter codes {{to show that the}} citing case had overruled, criticized, modified, or applied some other treatment to the cited case. The stickers, or “Adhesive Annotations,” became very popular. While sitting on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, future United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote “I regard Shepard’s Massachusetts Annotations as the most thorough labor-saving device that has even been brought to my attention. No one owning a set of reports can afford to be without one.” The books became so popular that the name became a verb—to Shepardize.|$|R
50|$|Knife is {{the cutting}} die for {{envelope}} or wrapper blanks. It {{is called a}} knife rather than a die because the latter is an object that makes an embossed printed impression of the stamp or indicium on the envelope. Traditionally, a knife would normally be made of forged steel. It was placed on a stack of paper with the sharp edge against the paper. The press head forced the cutting edge {{all the way through}} the stack of paper. The cut blanks were removed from the knife and the process repeated. Not only could it cut out the odd shape of an envelope, but a knife could be used to cut out shapes of airmail stickers or <b>gummed</b> <b>labels</b> in the shape of stars or circles. The variety of shapes a knife could cut would be infinite.|$|R

60|$|Then came {{a period}} when one was going about {{receiving}} and giving congratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy who has returned to school with the first batch after the holidays. The London world reeked with the General Election; it had invaded the nurseries. All the children of one's friends had got big maps of England cut up into squares to represent constituencies and were busy sticking <b>gummed</b> blue <b>labels</b> over the conquered red of Unionism that had hitherto submerged the country. And there were also orange labels, if I remember rightly, to represent the new Labour party, and green for the Irish. I engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched at the Reform, which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards midnight as {{the results of the}} counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed up {{at one end of the}} large smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was there.|$|R
