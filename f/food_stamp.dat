5|$|Food stamps {{have been}} issued in the United States since World War II, but the program did not include Puerto Rico until the early 1970s, when U.S. Public Laws 91-671 of January 11, 1971 and 93-86 of November 1, 1974 {{partially}} extended the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program to U.S. territories. The <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> program was later expanded to provide full coverage and benefits to Puerto Rico and other territories under Section 19 of the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act of 1977.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} a gradual decline in {{participation}} in the nutrition assistance program. Participation in the previous <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> program was estimated at 56%, more than 1.5 million island residents, before the creation of the block grant. By 1994, participation in the NAP program had decreased to 1.3 million, and by 2006 it had decreased to just over 1 million. While the Puerto Rican population has steadily increased throughout those periods, the percentage of the population participating in the nutrition assistance program has significantly declined. With Puerto Rico's current population estimated at 3,944,000 residents and a current estimated NAP participation of 1 million beneficiaries, the program's participation rate is roughly 26%, almost half of the participation under the original <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> program in 1981.|$|E

5|$|By 1977, the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program in Puerto Rico was larger, {{in terms}} of both the {{percentage}} of the population participating and expenditures, than any of the programs operating in the 50 U.S. States, with 56% of the Puerto Rican population participating in the program. In total, it accounted for approximately 8 percent of the national program's beneficiaries, and its operations and benefits awarded accounted for 8 percent of the national program's total federal expenditures.|$|E
5|$|To {{address these}} issues, the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) {{eliminated}} Puerto Rico {{from the national}} <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> program and created the Nutrition Assistance Program for Puerto Rico as a block grant to provide more administrative flexibility to the Commonwealth while reducing Federal expenditures. After a year of studies and design, it commenced operations on July 1, 1982 with an annual appropriation of $825 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
5|$|President Bush also {{declared}} Washington, D.C., as {{a disaster}} area {{two days after}} Isabel passed through the area. The United States Department of Agriculture approved a request for an emergency <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> program for two weeks {{for the city to}} ensure those who lost food {{as a result of the}} hurricane would not go hungry. By eight days after the hurricane, the Department of Employment Services created disaster unemployment benefits for those who lost their work as a direct result of Isabel. By 11days after Isabel, the government approved $5.21million in disaster assistance (2003USD, $ USD). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered nearly 800,000pounds (363,000kg) of dry ice to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the District suffering from power outages. Various groups joined to provide more than 15,000meals for residents who lost stored food due to spoilage resulting from the power outages. Volunteers assisted in distributing 515tons (467t) of ice, along with 21,000 sandbags throughout the district. Officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district. Ultimately, nearly 1,500residents in the district applied for federal assistance, with FEMA providing the residents more than $600,000 in aid (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E

5|$|The new {{block grant}} program {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} former <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> program in three major ways. First, the new NAP program was designed to distribute the benefits through physical cheques, ensuring that the benefit would be payable only to the beneficiary {{while at the same}} time reducing administrative costs, since the former physical vouchers (cupones in Spanish) were subject to storage and accountability problems, theft, counterfeiting and even trafficking. Second, the benefits were no longer restricted to vouchers redeemable only for food, but were provided in cash. The beneficiary could then elect to purchase a product or select services other than food. Third, the overall assistance provided to Puerto Rico was limited to an annual block appropriation, requiring the Puerto Rican government to adjust its program management to allocate the funds. Between 1982 and 1986, the U.S. Congress awarded $825 million annually in block grants for NAP program, and since then the appropriations have steadily increased by an estimated 3% to 4% to compensate for inflation. It has surpassed $1 billion annually since the early 1990s, and increased 30% from 1993 to 2002. Since fiscal year 2006, the appropriation has reached over $1.5 billion annually.|$|E

25|$|The Capital Area Food Bank {{was officially}} {{incorporated}} on October 24, 1979, but it considers its founding date to be January 15, 1980 coinciding with Martin Luther King, Jr.'s fifty-first birthday. Prior to that time, the United States government's <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program {{had been the}} city's primary source of assisting hungry residents. However, cutbacks in the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program planned for the early 1980s led to the food bank's inception by two local organizations, the United Planning Organization and the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington. In its first year of operation, the food bank managed to offer food to almost one hundred organizations and deliver 1,540 pounds (700 kilograms) of food each month. Throughout {{the rest of the}} 1980s, the Capital Area Food Bank proceeded to prosper as it partnered with nearby corporations, such as The Washington Post.|$|E

This paper further seeks to examine the affect of cutbacks on welfare allotments on “mixed status ” families and whether any such changes in <b>Food</b> <b>Stamps</b> receipt and allotments led to higher levels of food insecurity among children of non-citizens. Results indicate that food insecurity was higher for children of non-citizens who never naturalized immediately following welfare reform, but food insecurity levels declined and evened out across all groups by 2001. Reductions in allotments rather than reductions in <b>Food</b> <b>Stamps</b> receipt appear to explain the higher food insecurity levels of children of noncitizen parents.

Helms' position was upheld in 1988, when the United States Supreme Court decreed 5-3 that a law denying <b>food</b> <b>stamps</b> to strikers was constitutional unless the worker otherwise qualified for <b>food</b> <b>stamps</b> before going on strike.
