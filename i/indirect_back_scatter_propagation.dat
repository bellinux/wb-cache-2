40|$|This paper {{reports the}} Rayleigh {{scattering}} effects in ultra-long Raman fibre laser. It {{has been found}} that in a long fibre cavity (- 100 km) the distributed feedback due to Rayleigh <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> at <b>propagation</b> of light between fibre Bragg grating reflectors may be comparable with the lumped feedback provided by the FBG itself. As a result, Raman lasing in the fibre span limited by lumped (FBG) reflector at one side only appears possible due to significant reflection from the RS-based "random" distributed mirror at the other side. Thus, it concludes that a distributed Rayleigh scattering "random" mirror can form a cavity together with a single FBG spliced to the opposite cavity end...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} if 3  year treatment of hypercholesterolaemia with simvastatin causes {{an increase of}} lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  METHODS— 160 patients with hypercholesterolaemia in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4 S) were followed for 3  years. Half (80) of the patients took simvastatin and half (80) received placebo. The lens was photographed with a Topcon SL- 45 slit lamp camera {{at the beginning and}} at 1  year intervals. A common lens nuclear area was used for measuring lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  RESULTS—Nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased with age and there was more pronounced scattering in women than in men. Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> did not differ significantly between the simvastatin and placebo groups, but the power was low (0. 2). Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased during the study period independently of baseline <b>back</b> <b>scattering,</b> age, and sex for both groups.  CONCLUSION—Although no significant difference was found between the simvastatin and placebo groups, the currently available data are insufficient for exclusion of the possibility that taking simvastatin during a 3  year period increases nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b> However, a possible minor increase of nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> is clinically irrelevant considering known beneficial effects of simvastatin on coronary heart disease. ...|$|R

This was achieved by adding the gradient of a subgrid stress only when its sign agreed with that of the corresponding viscous term. In the present work, this idea is used the other way around as forcing in hybrid large eddy simulation-Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes: only the part of a subgrid stress term that corresponds to <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> is added to the momentum equations. The forcing triggers resolved turbulence in the transition region between the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large eddy simulation regions. The new approach is evaluated for fully developed channel flow at Re(tau) = 4000. It is found that the forcing indeed does increase the resolved turbulence in the transition region. The magnitude of the production (i. e. <b>back</b> <b>scatter)</b> due to forcing in the equation for resolved kinetic energy is of the order of that due to the usual strain-rate production term.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper Mishchenko asserts that soil {{particles}} are strongly forward scattering, whereas particles on {{the surfaces of}} objects {{in the solar system}} have been inferred to be <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b> Mishchenko suggests that this apparent discrepancy is an artifact caused by using an approximate light scattering model to analyse the data, and that planetary regolith particles are actually strong forward scatterers. The purpose of the present paper is to point out the errors in Mishchenko's paper and to show from both theoretical arguments and experimental data that inhomogencous composite particles which are large compared to the wavelength of visible light, such as rock fragments and agglutinates, can be strongly <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> and are the fundamental scatterers in media composed of them. Such particles appear to be abundant in planetary regoliths and can account for the <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> character of the surfaces of many bodies in the solar system. If the range of phase angles covered by a data set is insufficient, serious errors in retrieving the particle scattering properties can result whether an exact or approximate scattering model is used. However, if the data set includes both large and small phase angles, approximate regolith scattering models can correctly retrieve the sign of the particle scattering asymmetry...|$|R
