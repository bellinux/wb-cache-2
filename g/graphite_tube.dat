With this technique liquid/dissolved, solid and gaseous samples may be analyzed directly. A measured volume (typically 10-50 μL) or a weighed mass (typically around 1 mg) of a solid sample are introduced into the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube</b> and subject to a temperature program. This typically consists of stages, such as drying - the solvent is evaporated; pyrolysis - the majority of the matrix constituents are removed; atomization - the analyte element is released to the gaseous phase; and cleaning - eventual residues in the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube</b> are removed at high temperature.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} analyze a sample for its atomic constituents, {{it has to}} be atomized. The atomizers most {{commonly}} used nowadays are flames and electrothermal (<b>graphite</b> <b>tube)</b> atomizers. The atoms should then be irradiated by optical radiation, and the radiation source could be an element-specific line radiation source or a continuum radiation source. The radiation then passes through a monochromator in order to separate the element-specific radiation from any other radiation emitted by the radiation source, which is finally measured by a detector.|$|E
50|$|GFAA {{spectrometry}} instruments {{have the}} following basic features: 1. {{a source of}} light (lamp) that emits resonance line radiation; 2. an atomization chamber (<b>graphite</b> <b>tube)</b> in which the sample is vaporized; 3. a monochromator for selecting {{only one of the}} characteristic wavelengths (visible or ultraviolet) of the element of interest; 4. a detector, generally a photomultiplier tube (light detectors that are useful in low-intensity applications), that measures the amount of absorption; 5. a signal processor-computer system (strip chart recorder, digital display, meter, or printer).|$|E
50|$|In ET AAS a {{transient}} signal is generated, {{the area of}} which is directly proportional to the mass of analyte (not its concentration) introduced into the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube.</b> This technique has the advantage that any kind of sample, solid, liquid or gaseous, can be analyzed directly. Its sensitivity is 2-3 orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} flame AAS, so that determinations in the low μg L−1 range (for a typical sample volume of 20 µL) and ng g−1 range (for a typical sample mass of 1 mg) can be carried out. It shows a very high degree of freedom from interferences, so that ET AAS might be considered the most robust technique available nowadays for the determination of trace elements in complex matrices.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} predict the failure strength response of IG- 100 nuclear grade graphite exposed to multiaxial stresses. As part of this effort, a review of failure criteria accounting for the stochastic strength response is provided. The experimental work was performed in the early 1990 s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on hollow <b>graphite</b> <b>tubes</b> under the action of axial tensile loading and internal pressurization. As part of the investigation, finite-element analysis (FEA) was performed and compared with results of FEA from the original ORNL report. The new analysis generally compared well with the original analysis, although some discrepancies in the location of peak stresses was noted. The Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures Life prediction code (CARES/Life) was used with the FEA results to predict the quadrants I (tensile-tensile) and quadrant IV (compression-tension) strength response of the <b>graphite</b> <b>tubes</b> for the principle of independent action (PIA), the Weibull normal stress averaging (NSA), and the Batdorf multiaxial failure theories. The CARES/Life reliability analysis showed that all three failure theories gave similar results in quadrant I but that in quadrant IV, the PIA and Weibull normal stress-averaging theories were not conservative, whereas the Batdorf theory was able to correlate well with experimental results.

50|$|Most {{currently}} available GFAAs are fully controlled {{from a personal}} computer that has Windows-compatible software. The software easily optimizes run parameters, such as ramping cycles or calibration dilutions. Aqueous samples should be acidified (typically with nitric acid, HNO3) to a pH of 2.0 or less. GFAAs are more sensitive than flame atomic absorption spectrometers, and have a smaller dynamic range. This makes it necessary to dilute aqueous samples into the dynamic range of the specific analyte. GFAAS with automatic software can also pre-dilute samples before analysis. After the instrument has warmed up and been calibrated, a small aliquot (usually less than 100 microliters (µL) and typically 20 µL) is placed, either manually or through an automated sampler, into the opening in the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube.</b> The sample is vaporized in the heated graphite tube; the amount of light energy absorbed in the vapor is proportional to atomic concentrations. Analysis of each sample takes from 1 to 5 minutes, and the results for a sample is the average of triplicate analysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{graphite}} {{tubes are}} heated via their ohmic resistance using a low-voltage high-current power supply; {{the temperature in}} the individual stages can be controlled very closely, and temperature ramps between the individual stages facilitate separation of sample components. Tubes may be heated transversely or longitudinally, where the former ones have the advantage of a more homogeneous temperature distribution over their length. The so-called stabilized temperature platform furnace (STPF) concept, proposed by Walter Slavin, based on research of Boris L’vov, makes ET AAS essentially free from interference. The major components of this concept are atomization of the sample from a graphite platform inserted into the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube</b> (L’vov platform) instead of from the tube wall in order to delay atomization until the gas phase in the atomizer has reached a stable temperature; use of a chemical modifier in order to stabilize the analyte to a pyrolysis temperature that is sufficient to remove the majority of the matrix components; and integration of the absorbance over the time of the transient absorption signal instead of using peak height absorbance for quantification.|$|E
5000|$|Graphite furnace atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy (GFAAS) (also known as Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (ETAAS)) {{is a type of}} spectrometry that uses a graphite-coated furnace to vaporize the sample. Briefly, the technique is {{based on the fact that}} free atoms will absorb light at frequencies or wavelengths characteristic of the element of interest (hence the name {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry). Within certain limits, the amount of light absorbed can be linearly correlated to the concentration of analyte present. Free atoms of most elements can be produced from samples by the application of high temperatures. In GFAAS, samples are deposited in a small graphite or pyrolytic carbon coated <b>graphite</b> <b>tube,</b> which can then be heated to vaporize and atomize the analyte. The atoms absorb ultraviolet or visible light and make transitions to higher electronic energy levels. Applying the Beer-Lambert law directly in AA spectroscopy is difficult due to variations in the atomization efficiency from the sample matrix, and nonuniformity of concentration and path length of analyte atoms (in graphite furnace AA). Concentration measurements are usually determined from a working curve after calibrating the instrument with standards of known concentration.The main advantages of the graphite furnace comparing to aspiration atomic absorption are the following: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{distributions}} of atomic and molecular species of boron inside a graphite furnace were investigated with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Extensive spatial nonuniformity of the distributions at high temperatures was observed for both species. Digital imaging by the CCD camera showed that molecular boron species are preferentially formed {{at the top}} of the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube</b> at 1800 - 20000 C and their concentrations increase toward the center of the tube. The lowest concentrations of molecular boron species occur at the furnace walls and especially at the bottom of the graphite furnace. The highest concentrations of boron atoms occur along the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube</b> walls, at the bottom. The absence of significant concentrations of molecular species desorbing from the initial site of analyte deposition suggests that the analyte boron species, which do not absorb light at 254 nm, are vaporized. Since the highest concentrations of the molecular boron species were detected away from the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube</b> wall, desorption of molecular boron species is not likely. A gas-phase thermal dissociation of boron oxide species, resulting in the formation of BO (g), is suggested at temperatures below the atomization temperature. Pre-atomization loss of boron as molecular boron species is clearly evident from the CCD images. The high appearance temperature (23000 C) and high concentrations of atomic boron at the <b>graphite</b> <b>tube</b> wall suggest that much of the atomic boron signal is probably the result of desorption of boron atoms from the decomposition of boron carbide (solid).
