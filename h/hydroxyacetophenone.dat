40|$|The aim of {{the project}} as {{presented}} in this thesis concerns on the preparation, characterization and biological evaluation of Schiff bases derived from 3, 5 - dihyroxybenzohydrazide and their Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes. The Schiff bases were synthesized by the condensation of 3, 5 -dihyroxybenzohydrazide and <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> (BzyHAP-H), 5 -bromo <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> (BzyHAP-Br), 5 - chloro <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> (BzyHAP-Cl), salicylaldehyde (BzySAL-H), 5 -bromo salicylaldehyde (BzySAL-Br), and 5 -chloro salicylaldehyde (BzySAL-Cl). The BzyHAP series ligands were subsequently reacted with the acetate of Zn(II) whereas the BzySAL series ligands were reacted with Cu(II) and Zn(II) acetate in a 1 : 2 metal to ligand ratio. The chemical structures of the compounds were characterized by means of elemental analyses,, and spectroscopy methods including IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and UV-Vis. The determination of metal content was carried out using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Single X-ray diffraction data collection is carried out for ligand BzySAL-Br. From the structural analysis, the ligand {{is found to be}} planar with an r. m. s. deviation for the non-H atoms of 0. 16 Å. In the crystal structure, the Schiff base molecules and the water molecules are linked together by intermolecular N-H [...] O and O-H [...] O hydrogen bonds, leading to layers parallel to the bc plane. An intramolecular O-H [...] N hydrogen bond involving the imine N atom and a hydroxyl substituent is also observed. The synthesized Schiff base and their metal complexes are screened for the in vitro cytotoxicity towards prostate cancer cell line (PC- 3), colon cancer cell line (HT- 29) lung cancer cell line (A 549), and normal cell line (WRL- 68). All Zn (II) complex Schiff bases show relatively low cytotoxicity against all tested cell line. Complexes labeled as CuBzySAL-H, CuBzySAL-Br, and CuBzySALCl show encouraging value of EC 50 against colon cancer cell line (HT- 29), lung cancer cell line (A 549), and normal cell line (WRL- 68). On contrary, the cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell line (PC- 3) is recorded negative.

At the higher system pressures, the competition between the n-type and the π-type nucleophilic centers of the ambident substrates is kinetically controlled and biased in favor of O-acetylation, as demonstrated by the predominant (from ∼ 80 to ∼ 97 %) formation of aryl acetates with respect to the isomeric <b>hydroxyacetophenones.</b> The isomeric compn. of the ring-acetylated products reflects the electrophilic character and the remarkable positional selectivity of the CH 3 CO+ ion, which yields predominantly o- and p-hydroxyacetophenones, in proportions depending on the total pressure and on the presence of NH 3. In fact, O- as well as o-acetylated substrates, are more stable than the other isomeric ionic intermediates, as indicated by their increased yields at the lowest total pressure used (380 Torr), under conditions of increased thermodn. control of products. The results of competition expts., carried out in the presence of mesitylene as the ref. substrate, allow detn. of a gas-phase acetylation reactivity scale from p-xylene to 2, 6 -xylenol, this scale is characterized by values ranging over 3 orders of magnitude. Comparison of the gas-phase acetylation of CH 3 CO+ ions with related reactions occurring in soln. reveals no basic mechanistic differences, the gas-phase reactivity and selectivity of free acetylium ions displaying significant analogies with those of acetylating reactants generated in low-polarity media by the action of poorly co-ordinating Friedel-Crafts catalysts on suitable precursors...|$|R

The ligands were coordinated to Zn(II), Cu(II) and Ni(II) by the reaction of metal acetates with the corresponding ligand in a 1 : 2 metal to ligand ratio. The solid products formed were collected, washed with ethanol and recrystallized from a suitable solvent. All the ligands and complexes prepared have been characterized by spectroscopic methods using IR, 1 H and 13 C 1 H NMR spectroscopies, and UV-Visible spectrophotomerty. Single crystal X-ray structure analysis was carried out for TNS, (TS) 2 Zn complex, (TS) 2 Ni complex, (TCS) 2 Zn complex, (TTET) 2 Zn complex and (THAP) 2 Zn complex. Metal content was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction crystallography for (TNS) shows that it was exists in the zwitterionic form with the phenol H atom transferred to the imine group. Adjacent zwitterions are linked into a linear chain running along the axis by an indole–hydroxy N—H···O hydrogen bond. For zinc complexes the zinc atom is N, O-chelated by two deprotonated Schiff base monoanionic ligands in tetrahedral coordination geometry.

It is N, O-chelated by the deprotonated Schiff base in a square-planar coordination environment. The molecule is linked to a solvent molecule by an indole– dimethylformamide NH···O hydrogen bond. Anti-ulcerogenic activities of the ligands and complexes have been investigated with Cimetidine as a standard drug. The screening was done on high and low doses (60 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) respectively on six albino Sprague-Dawley rats in which ulcer was induced after dosing by absolute ethanol. The ulcer lesion of the stomachs were identified and counted, and then correlation between the different compound effects has been made.

Individually, AS appeared to be utilized as a typical peroxidase substrate to scavenge hydrogen peroxide, while HAP was utilized {{at a much lower}} rate. However, when added together the rate of utilization of both phenolics increased and surprisingly resulted in the production of hydrogen peroxide.

In this study, we focused on expanding the series of phenol derivatives synthesized previously. The main reason of our effort was the fact, that pKa of the previous compounds (12. 5 - 12. 7) did not fall into physiologically useful range. Two different strategies to synthesis of precursors were developed. Synthesis of the precursor with two phenols started by benzoin condensation of p-anisaldehyde to obtain corresponding acyloin, which was oxidized to diketone and dealkylated. Subsequently, the substituted pyrazine was obtained by condensation of this diketone with diaminomaleonitrile (DAMN).

30|$|The {{hydroquinone}} dioxygenases (HQDO) can {{be divided}} into two subtypes that have few similarities. Members of type I are phylogenetically related to the well-described extradiol catechol dioxygenases, (Eltis and Bolin 1996) and are monomeric (Xu et al. 1999). Moreover, they are involved in the degradation of HQ and chlorinated HQ formed during degradation of pentachlorophenol and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane by several members of the Sphingomonas genus (Cai and Xun 2002; Miyauchi et al. 1999; Lal et al. 2010). Supposedly, more homologs exist as DNA sequences with similarities of 99 % and higher to the PcpA encoding sequence have been attributed to γ-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation in other sphingomonads, i.e. strains of the genus Sphingomonas sensu latu (Dogra et al. 2004; Manickam et al. 2008; Yamamoto et al. 2009; Lal et al. 2010) and nitrophenol degradation in Cupriavidus necator Jmp 134 (Yin and Zhou 2010). Type II dioxygenases consist of two different subunits forming an α 2 β 2 heterotetramer. These enzymes are responsible for ring cleavage of HQ formed during degradation in the degradation pathway of <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> (Moonen et al. 2008 b) and in the degradation pathway of p-nitrophenol (Wei et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2009; Shen et al. 2010).

40|$|Background: In {{search of}} a {{suitable}} GSH-depleting agent, a novel copper complex viz., copper N-(2 - <b>hydroxyacetophenone)</b> glycinate (CuNG) has been synthesized, which was initially {{found to be a}} potential resistance modifying agent and later found to be an immunomodulator in mice model in different doses. The objective of the present work was to decipher the effect of CuNG on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant enzymes in normal and doxorubicin-resistant Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC/ Dox) -bearing Swiss albino mice. Methods: The effect of CuNG has been studied on ROS generation, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP 1) expression and on activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Results: CuNG increased ROS generation and reduced MRP 1 expression in EAC/Dox cells while only temporarily depleted glutathione (GSH) within 2 h in heart, kidney, liver and lung of EAC/Dox bearing mice, which were restored within 24 h. The level of liver Cu was observed to be inversely proportional to the level of GSH. Moreover, CuNG modulated SOD, CAT and GPx in different organs and thereby reduced oxidative stress. Thus nontoxic dose of CuNG may be utilized to reduce MRP 1 expression and thus sensitize EAC/Dox cells to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, CuNG modulated SOD, CAT and and GPx activities to reduce oxidative stress in some vital organs of EAC/Dox bearing mice. CuNG treatment also helped to recover liver and renal function in EAC/Dox bearing mice. Conclusion: Based on our studies, we conclude that CuNG may be a promising candidate to sensitize drug resistant cancers in the clinic...|$|E
40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) form a {{superfamily}} of multifunctional proteins with essential {{roles in}} cellular detoxification processes. Anew fungal specific class of GST has been highlighted by genomic approaches. The biochemical and structural characterization of one isoform of this class in Phanerochaete chrysosporium revealed original properties. The three-dimensional structure showed a new dimerization mode and specific features {{by comparison with}} the canonical GST structure. An additional beta-hairpin motif in the N-terminal domain prevents {{the formation of the}} regular GST dimer and acts as a lid, which closes upon glutathione binding. Moreover, this isoform is the first described GST that contains all secondary structural elements, including helix alpha 4 ' in the C-terminal domain, of the pre-sumed common ancestor of cytosolic GSTs (i. e. glutaredoxin 2). A sulfate binding site has been identified close to the glutathione binding site and allows the binding of 8 -anilino- 1 -naphtalene sulfonic acid. Competition experiments between 8 -anilino- 1 -naphtalene sulfonic acid, which has fluorescent properties, and various molecules showed that this GST binds glutathionylated and sulfated compounds but also wood extractive molecules, such as vanillin, chloronitrobenzoic acid, <b>hydroxyacetophenone,</b> catechins, and aldehydes, in the glutathione pocket. This enzyme could thus function as a classical GST through the addition of glutathione mainly to phenethyl isothiocyanate, but alternatively and in a competitive way, it could also act as a ligandin of wood extractive compounds.

However, these compounds frequently are toxins and there are concerns about environmental safety. Many primary repellents are toxicologically and environmentally safer, but these chemicals are not as effective when traditional delivery methods are used. We set out {{to determine whether the}} difference in efficacy of primary vs. secondary repellents was due to differences in potency of the chemical classes or site of action within the animal. We hypothesized that the efficacy of primary repellents could be enhanced if they could be delivered directly to the gastrointestinal system, thus by-passing the peripheral senses. Our experiments were conducted on captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). We showed that by-pass of the peripheral senses via oral gavage enhanced the efficacy of 2 <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> (2 HAP), a primary repellent. However, we found that starlings were sensitive to changes in their visual environment, and that learned avoidance to a colored food cup could be mitigated by changing the cage door of the test system. Topical application of repellents to foods allowed starlings to selfmediate their exposure to the repellents. We found that methiocarb and methyl anthranilate (MA), a primary repellent, both induced food aversion learning, but 2 HAP did not. Detailed analyses of feeding behavior elucidated the mechanistic differences between Methiocarb, MA, and 2 HAP. Methiocarb induced gastrointestinal illness in starlings, which resulted in post-ingestive suppression of food intake, and subsequent food aversion learning. Some starlings with MA in their food also developed gastrointestinal illness, and food aversion learning. Starlings with 2 HAP in their feed did exhibit reduced feeding efficiency, but these starlings did not develop gastrointestinal illness or food aversion learning. These experiments demonstrate that the location and intensity of illness are of paramount importance to induce food aversion learning...|$|E

In the present study, several polyhydroxylated flavonoids namely, 3, 4 -bis(benzyloxy) - 3 -hydroxyflavone, 3, 4, 5, 7 -tetrahydroxyflavanone, 4, 5, 7 -trihydroxyflavanone and 4, 5, 7 -trihydroxy- 3 -prenylflavanone have been synthesised. These target compounds were synthesised via its chalcones as the key precursor. The initial step in the synthesis was to prepare various derivatives of 2 - <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> and benzaldehyde by protection of the phenolic hydroxyl groups. The approach for the synthesis of chalcones is by the Claisen-Schmidt condensation of the respective 2 -hydroxyacetophenones and benzaldehydes under basic condition to give the corresponding 2 -hydroxychalcones. 3, 4 -Bisbenzyloxy- 3 -hydroxyflavone was synthesised from 3, 4 -bis(benzyloxy) - 2 -hydroxychalcone by the Algar-Flynn-Olyamada (AFO) oxidative method. The natural occurring flavanones, 3, 4, 5, 7 -tetrahydroxyflavanone and 4, 5, 7 -trihydroxyflavanone were prepared from 2 -hydroxy- 3, 4, 4, 6 -tetrakis (methoxymethyloxy) chalcone and 2 - hydroxy- 4, 4, 6 -tris(methoxymethyloxy) chalcone respectively, by acid hydrolysis and subsequent treatment with sodium acetate. The last feature in the synthesis was the preparation of 4, 5, 7 -trihydroxy- 3 -prenylflavanone starting from the prenylation of 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, protection of the phenolic group, formation of 2 - hydroxy- 4, 4, 6 -tris(methoxymethyloxy) - 3 -prenylchalcone and followed by acid hydrolysis and cyclisation of the chalcone led to the production 4, 5, 7 -trihydroxy- 3 - prenylflavanone in 89. 3 % yield. The antibacterial activity of the targeted compounds and its chalcone precursor were demonstrated by the filter paper disc diffusion method. The antioxidant activity were evaluated based on the free radical scavenging activity of the flavonoids against 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical by using UV and Electron Spin Resonance techniques.

Here we show that an RpoA hybrid containing the N-terminal 247 residues from E. coli and the C-terminal 89 residues from A. tumefaciens was able to significantly express virBp::lacZ in E. coli in a VirG(Con) -dependent manner. Utilization of lac promoter-driven virA and virG in combination with the A. tumefaciens rpoA construct resulted in significant inducer-mediated expression of the virBp::lacZ fusion, and the level of virBp::lacZ expression was positively correlated to the copy number of the rpoA construct. This expression was dependent on VirA, VirG, temperature, and, to a lesser extent, pH, which is similar to what is observed in A. tumefaciens. Furthermore, the effect of sugars on vir gene expression was observed only {{in the presence of the}} chvE gene, suggesting that the glucose-binding protein of E. coli, a homologue of ChvE, does not interact with the VirA molecule. We also evaluated other phenolic compounds in induction assays and observed significant expression with syringealdehyde, a low level of expression with acetovanillone, and no expression with <b>hydroxyacetophenone,</b> similar to what occurs in A. tumefaciens strain A 348 from which the virA clone was derived. These data support the notion that VirA directly senses the phenolic inducer. However, the overall level of expression of the vir genes in E. coli is less than what is observed in A. tumefaciens, suggesting that additional gene(s) from A. tumefaciens may be required for the full expression of virulence genes in E. coli...|$|E

In contrast, microbial biomass, basal respiration and catabolic diversity were higher in pine soil. As compared to pine litter: 1) lignin concentration was higher in black locust litter in the late stage of decomposition, 2) the percentage of aromatic substances (110 – 165 ppm) in 13 C CPMAS NMR spectra was higher both in fresh and in decomposed black locust litter. Living tissues of black locust {{are known to have}} allelopathic effects. Using the hypothesis that black locust allelochemicals occur in tree litter and may inhibit soil biological activity, we performed laboratory and field trials. In laboratory experiments, we added water extracts of fresh and of decomposed litter to pine and black locust soils. Microbial activity in pine soil amended with aqueous extracts of fresh litter was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than in control soil, whereas no effect was observed in black locust soil, likely because in this soil microbial populations were adapted to the presence of allelochemicals. 1 H NMR spectra of litter water exctracts showed in the decomposed litter extract more abundant sugars; in the fresh litter extract more abundant aromatic or unsaturated compounds. In particular, 4 – <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> was isolated and identified from the fresh litter extract. In field experiments, we incorporated a known amount of fresh and decomposed black locust litter on pine soil, after removing needle litter, and we found a lower microbial and fungal biomass in the soil under fresh black locust litter.

30|$|Genetic {{characterization}} of gene(s) and regulatory elements involved in degradation of xenobiotic compounds {{is extremely important}} for successful development of bioremediation technologies {{as well as for}} basic understanding of biochemical and molecular mechanisms of degradation process. Hitherto, {{a number of studies have}} reported cloning and {{characterization of}} PNP degradation gene clusters. During present study, we cloned, sequenced and characterized a PNP degrading DNA fragment from Burkholderia sp. strain SJ 98. The sequence analyses and annotation of this fragment indicated that the organization of pnp gene cluster in strain SJ 98 is very similar to that of the nph gene cluster of Arthrobacter sp. strain JS 443 (Perry and Zylstra 2007). However, the only striking difference is the presence of two orfs within pnp cluster of strain SJ 98 that share strong sequence similarity with genes encode for cognate subunits of HqD. During earlier studies, we detected HQ as a transient metabolite in PNP degradation by strain SJ 98; however, in absence of genetic information, HQ could not be ascertained as a true degradation intermediate. Instead, it was suggested that strain SJ 98 may non- specifically transform PNP into HQ as a dead end product which does not contribute to the active catabolism of PNP. Similar observation has also been reported with PNP degradation by strain JS 443 (Jain et al. 1994; Perry and Zylstra 2007). Results obtained during the present study and previous study with strain SJ 98 clearly establish presence of a functional genes encoding for enzymes involved in both the branches of PNP degradation (viz., HqD and BtD) within the PNP degradation gene cluster of strain SJ 98. Characterization of HqD carried out during present study established that this enzyme catalyzes Fe(II) dependent transformation of HQ to 4 -HMS. This observation indicates that HqD from strain SJ 98 belongs to ‘Ferrous ion dependent type II hydroquinone dioxygenase. Also, the active reconstituted HqD complex as predicted on the basis of the molecular weights of complex, PnpE 1 and PnpE 2 was found to be a heterotetrameric complex consisting of 2 molecules of both subunits. These observations are in agreement with earlier reports of HqD from other microorganisms. Ferrous ion dependent, heterotetrameric HqD complex has been previously reported to catalyze ring cleavage of HQ formed during degradation of <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> (Moonen et al. 2008) and PNP (Shen et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2009). The apparent molecular weight of reconstituted HqD from strain SJ 98 (~ 120 [*]kDa) is also within the range of molecular weights (112 [*]kDa – 120 [*]kDa) of other reported HqDs (Shen et al. 2010; Spain and Gibson 1991; Moonen et al. 2008; Kolvenbach et al. 2011). Noticeably, HqD from strain SJ 98 also showed stringent substrate specificity in the activity assay and is selectively induced during growth of strain SJ 98 on PNP; these observations clearly indicate it to be involved in transformation of HQ produced during PNP catabolism by strain SJ 98. Conspicuously, stringent substrate specificity has not been observed with HqDs characterized from Sphingomonas sp. strain TTNP- 3, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain ABC, Cupriavidus necator JMP 134 and Pseudomonas sp. strain NyZ 402 (Moonen et al. 2008; Kolvenbach et al. 2011; Yin and Zhou 2010; Wei et al. 2010 b). The reason and molecular mechanism for such different behavior is unclear and is still under investigation.|$|E
40|$|The {{naturally}} occurring phytoalexin trans-Resveratrol (RES) {{is known to}} be a powerful antioxidant and is used as a nutraceutical. It is considered {{to be one of the}} factors contributing to the beneficial effects of red wine. The phenolic hydroxycinnamic acids caffeic acid (CAF), ferulic acid (FA), p-coumaric acid (PCA) and sinapic acid (SA) are found in a wide variety of plants and also have antioxidant activity. The acetophenone derivatives paeonol (2 H 4 M) and vanillin (4 H 3 M) display antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activity. The use of these compounds as food fortifiers and nutraceuticals is limited as they exhibit adverse physical properties such as low aqueous solubility and low bioavailability. These properties may be improved by inclusion complex formation with cyclodextrins (CDs) and by cocrystallisation with generally regarded as safe (GRAS) coformers. A study of the CD complexation of RES, CAF, FA, PCA, SA, 2 H 4 M and 4 H 3 M was carried out both in solution and in the solid state. The solubility enhancement of the nutraceuticals by CD inclusion and by cocrystallisation was evaluated. The compounds hydrocaffeic acid (HCA), hydroferulic acid (FA), 2 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxy acetophenone (2 H 5 M) and 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxy acetophenone (2 H 6 M) have little or no known bioactivity but were included in the study as structural analogues for comparative purposes. Inclusion complexes were formed with the nutraceuticals and the native CDs (β- and γ-CD) by kneading and coprecipitation, as well as with methylated CDs by coprecipitation. The resulting inclusion complexes were characterised using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hot stage microscopy (HSM). Single crystal X-ray diffraction was used to elucidate inclusion complex structures. Three novel RES inclusion complexes were formed with methylated CDs having common modes of inclusion and hydrogen bonding motifs. Inclusion complex formation with the methylated CDs also produced six new hydroxycinnamic acid complexes and five new <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> complexes. While attempting to produce native CD inclusion complexes with the hydroxycinnamic acid compounds, crystals of SA were isolated, the structure of which had not been reported previously. The results of phase solubility studies revealed that, in general, CD inclusion complex formation improves the aqueous solubility of RES [randomly methylated CD (RAMEB) effecting a maximum increase of 63 times that of free RES] and hydroxycinnamic acids. The thermodynamic parameters and association constants for complexation between hydroxycinnamic acids and both β- and γ-CD were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). For β-CD a 1 : 1 host-guest ratio was found with association constants in the range 246 - 774 M⁻¹. The interactions between the guests and β-CD were found to be enthalpy-driven, except for that of SA and β-CD which was entropy-driven. With γ-CD a 1 : 1 host to CAF ratio was found while PCA, FA and SA interact with γ-CD in a 2 : 1 molar ratio. The association constants were in the range 228 - 543 M⁻¹. The formation of 2 : 1 complexes in solution was found to be enthalpy-driven while that of 1 : 1 complexes was entropydriven. ¹H NMR spectroscopy was used to study the interaction of the acetophenone derivatives with β- and γ-CD in solution. Job plot analyses confirmed 1 : 1 host-guest complex ratios. The association constants spanned the range 145 - 336 M⁻¹. Similarly for γ-CD, complex stoichiometries were confirmed to be 1 : 1 with 2 H 6 M and 4 H 3 M with association constants 67 and 125 M⁻¹, respectively. Eight cocrystals were prepared with hydroxycinnamic acids and the GRAS compounds nicotinamide (NIC) and isonicotinamide (ISO) by coprecipitation, and were fully characterised. Single crystal X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of cocrystals rather than salts. Analysis using ¹H NMR spectroscopy for quantitation revealed that the aqueous solubilities of FA and PCA were enhanced approximately ten-fold when tested in the form of their cocrystals with the coformer NIC...|$|E
40|$|At {{present the}} field of {{molecular}} electronics - also known as molecular semiconductors, organic semiconductors, plastic electronics or organic electronics - is dominated by organic materials, both polymeric and molecular, with much less attention being focused on transition metal based complexes despite the advantages they can offer. Such advantages include tuneable frontier orbitals through the ligand/metal interaction {{and the ability to}} generate stable paramagnetic species. Devices containing radical materials are particularly interesting in order to examine the interplay between conduction and spin - an effect which is not yet properly understood but can give rise to exotic behaviour. A series of homoleptic, bis-ligand Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes were prepared using three structurally related phenolic oxime ligands, 2 -hydroxy- 5 -t-octylacetophenone oxime (t-OctsaoH), 2 -hydroxy- 5 -n-propylacetophenone oxime (n-PrsaoH) and 2 - <b>hydroxyacetophenone</b> oxime (HsaoH). The complexes were characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, field-effect-transistor measurements, DFT/TD-DFT calculations {{and in the case of}} the paramagnetic species, EPR and magnetic susceptibility. Variation of the substituent on the ligand from t-octyl to n-propyl to H enabled electronic isolation of the complexes in the crystal structures of M(t-OctsaoH) 2, which contrasted with π-stacking interactions observed in the crystal packing of M(n-PrsaoH) 2 and of M(HsaoH) (M = Ni, Cu). This was further evidenced by comparing the antiferromagnetic interactions observed in samples of Cu(n-PrsaoH) 2 and Cu(HsaoH) 2 with the ideal paramagnetic behaviour for Cu(t-OctsaoH) 2 down to 1. 8 K. Despite isostructural single crystal structures for M(n-PrsaoH) 2, thin-film X-ray diffraction and SEM revealed different morphologies depending on the metal and the deposition method employed. However, the complexes of M(n-PrsaoH) 2 and M(HsaoH) failed to demonstrate significant charge transport in an FET device despite displaying the ability to form π- stacking structures. A series of planar Ni(II), Cu(II) and Co(II) dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (dbtaa) and dinapthotetraaza[14]annulenes (dntaa) were synthesised and studied crystallographically, optically, electrochemically and magnetically. Thin films of each of these complexes have been prepared by vacuum deposition to evaluate the field-effect transistor (FET) performance as well as the morphology and crystallinity of the film formed. Single crystal data revealed that Ni(dbtaa) and Cu(dbtaa) are isomorphous to each other, with Co(dbtaa) displaying a different crystallographic packing. The electrochemistry and UV/Vis absorption studies indicate the materials are redox active and highly coloured, with molar extinction coefficients as large as 80, 000 M- 1 cm- 1 in the visible region. The paramagnetic Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes display weak 1 -dimensional antiferromagnetic interactions and were fit to the Bonner-Fisher chain model. The data revealed that the Co(II) species possesses much stronger magnetic exchange interactions compared with the Cu(II) complex. Each of the materials formed polycrystalline films when vacuum deposited and all showed ptype field-effect transistor behaviour, with modest charge carrier mobilities in the range of 10 - 5 to 10 - 9 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1. SEM imaging of the substrates indicates that the central metal ion, and its sublimation temperature, has a crucial role in defining the morphology of the resulting film. Structurally related Cu(II) and Ni(II) dithiadiazoletetraaza[14]annulene (dttaa) macrocycles were synthesised and studied in the context of their thin film electrochemical, conducting and morphological properties. Both the Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes were found to be volatile under reduced pressure, which allowed crystals of both materials to be grown and the single crystal structures solved. Interestingly, the crystal packing of these heterocyclic macrocycles varies depending on whether the central metal ion is Cu(II) or Ni(II), which is in contrast to the analogous dibenzotetrazaannulenes complexes. Soluble Ni(II) analogues containing benzoyl groups on the meso- positions of the macrocycle (dttaaBzOR) were also prepared and contrasted with the insoluble Ni(dttaa) complexes in terms of their solution optical and electrochemical properties. Thin film electrochemical studies of Cu(dttaa) and Ni(dttaa) showed chemically reversible oxidative processes but on scanning to reductive potentials the films disintegrated almost immediately as the bulky counter tetrabutylammonium cation entered the thin film. FET studies undertaken on polycrystalline films of both complexes, using various device configurations and surface treatments, failed to realise any gate effect. Thin film XRD measurements indicate that films of both complexes formed by vacuum deposition are crystalline and contain a mixture of molecular alignments, with molecules aligning “edge on” and “face down” to the substrate. SEM imaging failed to effectively resolve the morphology of the films implying the sizes of the crystallites are small, which may help to explain the lack of FET effect. A series of bis-ligand diimine Ni, Cu and Pd complexes have been synthesised from the ligand 4, 5 -bis(dodecyloxy) benzene- 1, 2 -diamine (dbdaH 2). The same ligand was also used to prepare a series of soluble Cu(II) and Ni(II) tetraaza[14]annulene macrocycles. All the bis-ligand diimine complexes were found to suffer from instability in air due to the ease at which the complexes are oxidised. The Ni complex, Ni(dbda) 2, was found to display a NIR transition in the region of 971 to 1024 nm depending on the polarity of the solvent that the molecule is dissolved in. Solution electrochemistry studies of Ni(dbda) 2 reaffirmed the facile nature of the first oxidative process, with the HOMO energy calculated at - 4 eV by hybrid-DFT. This compound failed to yield semiconducting behaviour in an FET device despite the use of surface treatments aimed at promoting suitable molecular alignment across the conducting channel...|$|E
