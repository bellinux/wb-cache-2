In the present study we take advantage of a droplet microfluidics platform combined with a novel and user-friendly biosensor for revealing the main malaria-causing agent, the Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) parasite. Detection of the parasite is achieved through detection of the activity of a parasite-produced DNA-modifying enzyme, topoisomerase I (pfTopoI), in the blood from malaria patients. The assay presented has three steps: (1) droplet microfluidics-enabled extraction of active pfTopoI from a patient blood sample; (2) pfTopoI-mediated modification of a specialized DNA biosensor; (3) readout.

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} is {{a statistical}} {{treatment of a}} dataset derived from a literature review. Meta-analysis {{appears to be a}} promising approach in agricultural and environmental sciences, but its implementation requires special care. We assessed the quality of the meta-analyses carried out in agronomy, with the intent to formulate recommendations, and we illustrate these recommendations with a case study relative to the estimation of nitrous oxide emission in legume crops. Eight criteria were defined for evaluating the quality of 73 meta-analyses from major scientific journals in the domain of agronomy. Most of these meta-analyses focused on production aspects and the impact of agriculture activities on the environment or biodiversity. None of the 73 meta-analyses reviewed satisfied all eight quality criteria and only three satisfied six criteria. Based on this quality assessment, we formulated the following recommendations: (<b>i)</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> used to select papers from scientific databases should be explained, (ii) individual data should be weighted according to their level of precision when possible, (iii) the heterogeneity of data should be analyzed with random-effect models, (iv) sensitivity analysis should be carried out and (v) the possibility of publication bias should be investigated. Our case study showed that meta-analysis techniques would be beneficial to the assessment of environmental impacts because they make it possible to study between site-year variability, to assess uncertainty and to identify the factors with a potential environmental impact. The quality criteria and recommendations presented in this paper could serve as a guide to improve future meta-analyses made in this area. (c) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the speech per-formance of four types of alaryngeal {{phonation}} [...] electrolaryngeal (EL), pneu-matic artificial laryngeal (PA), tracheoesophageal (TE), and standard esopha-geal (SE) speech [...] by adult Cantonese-speaking laryngectomees. Subjective ratings of(l) voice quality, (2) articulation proficiency, (3) quietness of speech, (4) pitch variability, and (5) overall speech intelligibility were given by eight naive individuals who had no prior experience with any form of alaryngeal speech. Results indicated that SE and TE speech was perceived to be more hoarse than PA and EL speech. EL speech was associated with significantly less pitch variability, and PA speakers produced speech with the least amount of perceived noise. However, articulation proficiency and overall speech in-telligibility were found to be comparable inall four types of alaryngeal speak-ers. Key Words: Laryngectomy [...] Electrolarynx [...] Pneumatic artific al larynx [...] Tracheoesophageal [...] Standard esophageal. Laryngectomy is a procedure used to remove a pathological larynx, usually as a result of laryngeal cancer. After the larynx is removed, the upper por-tion of the trachea is attached to the anterior of the lower neck, where a permanent opening, the trache-ostoma, is created. The tracheostoma serves mainly for respiration purposes (<b>I).</b> <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> results in a total loss of the ability for normal laryngeal phonation due to the removal of the entire laryngeal structure including the vocal folds. Therefore, an important part of rehabilitation after laryngectomy is to seek alternative ways to regain phonation. Cur-rently, there are four methods of regaining phona-tion after laryngectomy: (i) electrolaryngeal (EL) speech, (ii) pneumatic artificial laryngeal (PA...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the {{discrete}} choice modeling of labor supply decisions has become increasingly popular. Within the literature adopting this approach, however, there are two potentially important issues that so far have not been given the attention they might deserve. A first issue concerns the procedure by which the discrete alternatives are selected to enter the choice set. Most authors choose (not probabilistically) a set of fixed points identical for every individual. Some authors adopt instead a sampling procedure and also assume that the choice set may differ across households. A second issue concerns {{the availability of the}} alternatives. Most authors assume all the values of hours of work within some range are equally available. At the other extreme, some authors assume only two or three alternatives (for example, nonparticipation, part-time and full-time) are available for everyone. Some studies account instead for the fact that not all the hour opportunities are equally available to everyone specifying a probability density function of opportunities for each individual. In this paper we explore by simulation the implications of (<b>i)</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> used to build the choice set (fixed alternatives versus sampled alternatives); (ii) accounting or not accounting for a different availability of alternatives. The results of the evaluation performed in this paper show that the way the choice set is represented has little impact on the fitting of observed values, but a more significant and important impact on the out-of-sample prediction performance.

40|$|We are {{reporting}} a procedure for the purification of herpes simplex enveloped nucleocapsids (virions), {{an evaluation of}} the purification procedure and the results of analyses of the virion proteins by high-resolution acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The data may be summarized as follows. (<b>i)</b> <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> for the purification of virions consists of careful extraction of cytoplasm to prevent nuclear breakage, separation of enveloped nucleocapsids from soluble proteins and membrane vesicles by rate zonal centrifugation of cytoplasmic extracts through dextran 10 gradients, treatment with urea to dissociate virus-debris aggregates, and, lastly, separation of virions from naked nucleocapsids and free membranes by isopycnic flotation in discontinuous sucrose gradients. (ii) Purity was evaluated in three ways, i. e., electron microscopic examination, analysis of purified virions produced in cells labeled with amino acids before infection, and analysis of purified virions from artificial mixtures of infected and labeled, uninfected cells. The extent of purification was 120 -to 200 -fold with respect to host proteins. Residual contaminants were identified as host and viral constituents of membrane vesicles. Residual host proteins are very likely contaminants and not structural components of the virion. (iii) Analyses by staining and autoradiography of structural proteins of purified virions in 6, 7, 8. 5, 9, and 14 % acrylamide gels revealed 24 bands of proteins and glycoproteins made and labeled after infection. Co-electrophoresis of viral proteins with six known standards ranging from 25, 700 to 220, 000 daltons in molecular weight in 6, 7, 8. 5, and 9 % acrylamide gels indicate that viral proteins range from 25, 000 to 275, 000 daltons. The sum of the molecular weights of viral proteins is 2, 580, 000 daltons. Assuming that messenger transcription is asymmetric and noncomplementary, this corresponds to 47 % of the genetic information of the virus.

40|$|In this research, a Web-based {{system called}} DESIGNER {{for the design}} of {{integrated}} material handling systems is developed. DESIGNER models the material handling system design processes including the material handling equipment (MHE) selection and employs information on the most common MHE types used in material movement, storage, and positioning.;The system designs the material handling system for an application through three phases. In Phase <b>I,</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> identifies the most appropriate MHE type among the alternatives that are suitable for the application. Knowledge-based rules are employed to identify alternative handling equipment for each material flow link. To select the final suitable MHE type for each material flow link, not only does the system consider the economic aspect of the equipment but also their applicability, adaptability and integratability, maintenance and safety, and other factors that a user may deem worthy of consideration. To compare the aggregate effect of the multiple design attributes considered for the alternatives, fuzzy evaluation matrices and normalized evaluation values are employed. To reduce the overall system cost, in Phase II, the system checks for excess capacity for each type of equipment recommended. It also checks if operating systems for automatic equipment suggested can be combined to reduce the total number of the operating systems. Any excess capacity identified is eliminated whenever it is considered possible without introducing design infeasibility. Excess capacity is eliminated by assigning a unit of each equipment to multiple flow links and thereby reducing the total number of units of the equipment that is recommended. This reduction in equipment capacity does not apply to conveyors and storage devices because of their immobile feature. The reduction process is applicable to mobile equipment that enjoy flexible routing. In Phase III, the set of material handling equipment selected is adjusted to satisfy budget constraints if the total cost of the initial set of the selected equipment exceeds the budget.;After identifying the most appropriate MHE, the modules for economic analysis, performance measure analysis, AS/RS design analysis, and system integration analysis for automatic MHE are invoked. The results of the analyses provide system users with useful data for the material handling system design and decision on investment in MHE.
