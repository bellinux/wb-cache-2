2500|$|Confident in his skill, Mannock {{arrived in}} France on 31 March 1917 at 40 Squadron {{headquarters}} near Aire, Lens. He {{did not give}} his new squadron-mates a good first impression. On his first night he inadvertently sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> of a popular pilot killed that day and proceeded to ask pilots about their personal scores and offer, without invitation, his own views on air combat. Lieutenant Lionel Blaxland recalled; [...] "He seemed a boorish know-all, we all felt the quicker he got amongst the Huns the better; that would show him how little he knew." [...] Mannock flew the squadrons Nieuport 17 scout the following day. As the days passed, he preferred to remain airborne {{by virtue of his}} squadron's hostility. The public school boy-dominated squadron detested his [...] "gutter politics" [...] and mannerisms although Mannock was befriended by Irishman Lieutenant de Burgh, of the same ilk. Mannock would forge friendships with new pilots. George McElroy arrived in September and became Mannock's protégé.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand up and look around, you will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.|$|E

60|$|Freddy {{bows and}} sits <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elizabethan <b>chair,</b> infatuated.|$|R
60|$|LINA. Yes. [She sits <b>down</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> Lord Summerhays {{has just}} left].|$|R
60|$|He did not {{immediately}} answer her. He sat <b>down</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> by her side, {{and pointed to the}} letter.|$|R
60|$|She sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> by the fire, {{where in}} the old days she had nursed them.|$|E
60|$|Kirk sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> she {{had left}} and looked at Bill. He felt choked. There was a mist before his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. March had judged it decorous {{for her to}} say nothing, but she now {{went and}} sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> next her husband.|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{the tender}} womanly sympathy we had expected, {{the old lady}} sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> easy <b>chair</b> and burst out laughing.|$|R
60|$|Hector sits <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> draughtsman's <b>chair,</b> {{turning it}} to face Randall, who remains standing, leaning at his ease against the carpenter's bench.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} lightly {{in his arms}} {{for a moment and}} kissed her. Then she threw herself <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> easy <b>chair</b> and began to laugh softly.|$|R
60|$|And she sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> It {{was evident}} {{she had come}} for a last talk. Ursula, not knowing what she wanted, waited in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' she said. Then {{she turned}} her wonderful, {{forget-me-not}} blue eyes up to her son, as she slowly sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> he had brought her.|$|E
60|$|Dan sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as he spoke, and {{his sister}} Jessie, who entered at the moment, pushed him all about {{the room with the}} {{greatest}} ease.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you're {{saying all}} those things to me," [...] replied Trot, [...] "you may as well save your breath. I'm no slave." [...] And she cuddled <b>down</b> closer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|The girl {{stared at}} him in return, as if stupified. Then she sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearest <b>chair</b> and {{continued}} to stare. Finding her determined on silence, Mr. Conant spoke again.|$|R
60|$|Uttering these {{expressions}} of good-will with extreme gravity, Mr Swiveller sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> client's <b>chair</b> and pondered; {{then took a}} few turns {{up and down the}} room and fell into <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Agatha sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that he {{drew out}} for her near the stove. He noticed that {{she glanced at the}} papers on the table, and he laughed.|$|E
60|$|Arthur's hands {{pressed him}} <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{from which he}} sought to rise. His fingers were clenched on the old man's {{shoulders}} {{so that he could}} hardly bear the pain.|$|E
6000|$|... "He shook ’is ’ead at ’em, {{and telling}} {{his wife to}} give the ’Dook o’ Wellington’ a mug of water, sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> agin and wiped the sweat off ’is brow.|$|E
6000|$|Enter DOCTOR GRIMTHORPE with {{a rather}} careworn air, and a [...] {{medicine}} bottle in his hand. He {{puts it on}} the table, and sits <b>down</b> [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as if keeping a vigil.|$|R
60|$|She turned back, indecisively, and sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big <b>chair</b> {{just beyond}} <b>the</b> table, handing me the cup, and helping me to cream and sugar. I plunged at once in medias res.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy Silver {{was more}} curious. He took Kennedy off to tea in his study, sat him <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> fire, and {{proceeded}} to urge him to confess everything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom," [...] she said, [...] "I come to--" [...] and {{stopping}} suddenly, and regarding the silent group, she sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and, covering {{her face with}} her handkerchief, began to sob.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner, as Mr. Merrick {{sat alone in}} the hotel lobby, the girls having gone to watch the Major bowl tenpins, Mr. Jones {{approached}} and sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> beside him.|$|E
60|$|BURGE [talking him down] Never {{mind the}} Federation: I will answer for the Federation. Go on, Barnabas: go on. Never mind Lubin [he sits <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> from which Lubin first {{displaced}} him].|$|E
60|$|She {{stared at}} him as if she thought that he was mad, though doubtless she had heard {{something}} of that story, then swept up the steps and sat herself <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal <b>chair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been feeling}} rather unsubstantial of late, {{as the result}} of a {{restricted}} diet," [...] he answered with a smile, and sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearest <b>chair,</b> while Nairn regarded him with carefully suppressed curiosity.|$|R
60|$|Low, stifled, {{momentary}} as it was, that cry proclaimed {{him to be}} the man. He was self-denounced by it {{even before}} he cowered <b>down,</b> shuddering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> with both his hands pressed convulsively over his face.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{came in and}} {{was told}} to sit <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> Ritter had just vacated. Then Captain Putnam asked him to tell his story, and he related {{everything}} {{just as it had}} occurred.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Well {{for your}} souls," [...] he said, wiping his brow. Next, shrill like a woman: [...] "Oh, come to me!" [...] and Hugh ran forward to hold Harold, that had slidden <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|The girl, who sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> he offered, {{smiled when}} he flung his half-smoked cigar away, and Nasmyth laughed {{as he saw}} the twinkle in her eyes, for he had stopped smoking with a half-conscious reluctance.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} Agatha, who turned away, and sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearest <b>chair.</b> She made no comment, {{and there was}} an oppressive silence, through which the beat of hoofs and rattle of wheels rang more distinctly.|$|R
6000|$|LADY BRITOMART. Stuff! A man can't make cannons any {{the better}} for being his own cousin instead of his proper self [she sits <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deck <b>chair</b> with a bounce that expresses her downright {{contempt}} for their casuistry.] ...|$|R
60|$|Ethel {{returned}} {{through the}} folding doors. She glanced at Lewisham, remained standing for awhile, sat <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basket <b>chair</b> {{as if to}} resume some domestic needlework that lay upon the table, then rose and {{went back into the}} bedroom.|$|R
