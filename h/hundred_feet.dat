5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> had but little undulation. However, when out about eight <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
5|$|East of {{this station}} on the BMT side, the planned track {{connections}} to the Second Avenue Subway curved slightly north. After the tracks ended, the roadbed {{went on for a}} few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> before ending. With the Second Avenue Subway connection, these tunnels now merge into the tunnels of Phase 1 of the IND Second Avenue Line.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{divide the}} iron-bearing rocks {{of the eastern}} Mesabi Iron Range into several layers. The four main divisions, from the top down, are the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty and Lower Cherty. Below these are {{quartzite}} and granite, and Virginia Slate and Duluth gabbro lie above. The slate is from 50 to several <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> thick, and the four iron-bearing layers are from 400 to 600 feet thick.|$|E

This service was discontinued in 2010, but the tracks and station remain in place.|$|E
5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle {{each side of the}} Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only a few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> to the north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY28 in the village.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several <b>hundred</b> <b>feet.</b> It took workers several days to clean the buildings and remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The Sky Harbor Expressway {{was a small}} {{remnant of}} the old {{northern}} alignment of Route 143. Beginning at Washington St., the former expressway headed south, under the Union Pacific Railroad, to an interchange with the airport entrance, before a bridge over the Salt River parallel to {{and just a few}} <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> away from the bridge on Route 143. The former expressway then ended at University Avenue with no further planned extension to Interstate 10.|$|E
5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, two dams {{had been}} {{constructed}} on Glen Brook (a subtributary of Briar Creek) in Briar Creek Township two {{miles north of}} Berwick. In 1911, the first dam, known as Number One, had a capacity of 15 million gallons. The second dam, known as Number Two, had a capacity of 7.5 million gallons. In 1911, a third dam was under construction several <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> downstream of the two aforementioned dams. It was intended to have a capacity of 23.8 million gallons.|$|E

The historical marker {{placed by}} the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission in 1963 {{in the vicinity}} of Derby, Perry County, Indiana, to memorialize Hines' entry into Indiana states that Hines invaded Indiana in 1862, although he actually did so in 1863. In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before he could go to the dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> away.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> in the air, with wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident. He {{apparently}} lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> before. A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.|$|E

5000|$|The Madsen {{majority}} {{sustained the}} constitutionality of the Clinic's thirty-six foot buffer zone and the noise-level provision, finding that they burdened no more speech than necessary to serve the injunction's goals. However, the Court struck down the thirty-six foot buffer zone as applied to the private property north and west of the Clinic, [...]the 'images observable' provision, the three <b>hundred</b> <b>foot</b> no-approach zone around the Clinic, and the three <b>hundred</b> <b>foot</b> buffer zone around residences. The Court found that these provisions [...] " [...] swept more broadly than necessary" [...] to protect the state's interests. Thus, the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court was affirmed in part and reversed in part.|$|R
5|$|O'Neill founded O'Neill Communications in Princeton in 1986. He {{introduced}} his Local Area Wireless Networking, or LAWN, {{system at the}} PC Expo in New York in 1989. The LAWN system allowed two computers to exchange messages over a range of a couple <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> {{at a cost of}} about $500 per node. O'Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O'Neill's LAWN system.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} motor {{was equipped with}} several <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When the engine was tested, it gave very good results, {{and is now in}} use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in Ampere, New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric fire engine of the same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient.|$|E
5|$|The land {{upon which}} Avery Point Light was {{constructed}} {{was owned by}} Morton F. Plant's estate; his Branford Manor is located several <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> away. Twenty four years after Plant's death the estate was sold {{to the state of}} Connecticut before being transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's deed required the construction and maintenance of beacon lights or other navigational aids as part of the Coast Guard's new training facility.

5|$|Upon leaving Sullivan County, West Branch Fishing Creek enters Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. Immediately after {{entering}} Columbia County, the creek {{flows through the}} community of Elk Grove. It flows east-southeast for a short distance before reaching the communities of Central and Jamison City. The creek then makes a sharp turn south and flows between Central Mountain and Huckleberry Mountain and into a plain. After some distance, it turns southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 118. Several <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> downstream, it and East Branch Fishing Creek merge to form Fishing Creek.|$|E
5|$|At 8:24a.m. MDT, Reid's {{aircraft}} {{began its}} takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence. According to witnesses, the plane lifted off and climbed slowly, with its nose high and its wings wobbling. It began a gradual right turn, and after reaching {{an altitude of}} a few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet,</b> the plane rolled out of its turn, then descended rapidly, crashing at a near-vertical angle into Kornegay Court, a street in a residential neighborhood. Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid, who was legally the pilot in command for all of Dubroff's flights, was allegedly manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of New York City installed Wi-Fi routers at 10 payphones in the city (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, and one in Queens) {{as part of a}} pilot project. The Wi-Fi was free of charge and available for use at all times. The Wi-Fi signal was detectable from a radius of a few <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> (about 100m). Two of New York City's largest advertising companies—Van Wagner and Titan, who collectively owned more than 9,000 of New York City's 12,000 payphones at the time—paid $2,000 per router, with no monetary input from either the city or taxpayers. While the payphones participating in the Wi-Fi pilot project were poorly marked, the Wi-Fi offered at these payphones was significantly faster than some of the other free public Wi-Fi networks offered elsewhere.|$|E
