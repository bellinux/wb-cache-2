5|$|The brewing giant Bass {{acquired}} William Stones in the 1960s, {{and began}} to heavily promote the keg variant of Stones Bitter, which eventually became the highest selling bitter in the country. However the keg version was promoted {{at the expense of}} the traditional unpasteurised and unfiltered cask conditioned version. In the 1990s, the ABV of Stones was gradually reduced, and, as ale sales declined, Stones reverted <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> into a regional brand. Following the closure of the Cannon Brewery, Stones has been brewed at a number of different breweries. When Bass exited its brewing business, Stones became a Coors brand (later Molson Coors).|$|E

The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If NOCs are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.|$|E

Once the {{new owners}} were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel {{submitted}} the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005. Unfortunately, despite significant {{public support for the}} new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from California and New York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.|$|E

Sixteen station staff had died in the bombing.

25|$|Dissatisfied {{with their}} role as brokers, in October 1812 the Lafitte {{brothers}} purchased a schooner and hired a Captain Trey Cook to sail it. As the schooner {{did not have an}} official commission <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> government, its captain was considered a pirate operating illegally. In January 1813 they took their first prize, a Spanish hermaphrodite brig loaded with 77slaves. Sale of the slaves and additional cargo generated $18,000 in profits and the brothers adapted the captured ship for use in piracy, naming it Dorada. Within weeks, Dorada captured a schooner loaded with over $9,000 in goods. The captured schooner was not considered useful for piracy so, after unloading its cargo, the Lafittes returned the ship to its former captain and crew. The Lafittes gained a reputation for treating captive crew members well, and often returned captured ships to their original crew.|$|E
25|$|Spatial ability may be {{responsible}} in part for facilitating gender differences in math aptitude. In 1995, Casey et al. looked at the relationship of mental rotation ability and the SAT-M among four samples. The four samples were: (1) undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the Northeast that were tested on their mental rotation ability in groups of 10-20; (2) a group of mathematically talented preteens participating in a summer math and science training in the Midwest, which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> talent search program or statewide teacher selection program; (3) a high-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban {{high school in the}} Northeast and elected to take the SAT; and (4) a low-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT. The data used were SAT math and verbal scores and mental rotation scores. Mental rotation was assessed using the Vandenberg Test of Mental Rotation. Students were asked to match two out of four choices to a standard figure.|$|E
