5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era,</b> the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.|$|E
5|$|The American {{occupation}} in 1898 {{introduced a new}} breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila. Part of the Burnham's plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture. In Iloilo, a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American {{occupation in}} the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real.|$|E

5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of the}} Midwestern states (national elections <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
5|$|His {{two most}} {{important}} works are The Lives of the Saints (Żywoty świętych, 1579) and Sejm Sermons (Kazania Sejmowe, 1597). The former, a hagiography, won him fame in his lifetime, while the Sermons gained recognition only in subsequent centuries, during the Partitions of Poland. Tazbir describes the Lives as Skarga's chief work and as a major attack on the religious tolerance promoted by the Warsaw Confederation. The book was immensely popular, the first edition selling out by 1583. A second edition was published in 1585, and by the mid-17th century twelve editions had been printed, {{making it one of}} the most popular books published in Poland and Lithuania <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> (rivaled by the Kronika Polska—Polish Chronicles—of Marcin Bielski). It was Skarga's most popular work and continued to rank highly with Polish readers until the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was eclipsed by his Sermons.|$|E
5|$|Stengel often rotated infielders between positions, {{with the}} Yankees having no real regular second baseman or shortstop between 1954 and 1958. Despite this, the Yankees {{had a strong}} {{defensive}} infield throughout. Stengel gave great attention to the double play, both defensively and in planning his lineup, and the Yankees responded by being first {{in the league in}} double plays as a defense six times in his twelve-year tenure, and the batters hit into the fewest double plays as a team eight times <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> Having had few players he could rely upon while managing Brooklyn and Boston, Stengel treated his Yankee roster with little sentimentality, trading players quickly when their performance seemed to decline, regardless of past accomplishments. Assured of quality replacements secured by the Yankee front office, the technique worked well, but was not a success with the Mets, where no quality replacements were available, and the technique caused confusion and apathy among the players.|$|E

It was the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> The Harrier was developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s. It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A, for use by the US Marine Corps (USMC), in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{began his}} junior career {{playing for the}} Calgary Monarchs in 1919 {{at the age of}} 16. He competed for the Memorial Cup, awarded to the Canadian junior hockey champions that year, playing in two games and {{surrendering}} 11 goals, a respectable amount <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> After spending the 1920–21 season playing for Calgary Alberta Grain, Thompson played three seasons in Bellevue, Alberta. In the 1924–25 season, he joined the Duluth Hornets, playing 40 games, recording a shutout in 11 of them. The following season, Thompson joined the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association (AHA). In his three seasons with the Millers, he appeared in 118games, recording 33shutouts with a 1.37goals against average (average of goals surrendered in a span of sixty minutes).|$|E
5|$|While {{working at}} the {{hardware}} store, Gardiner first played organised sports {{as a member of}} the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight-years-old, he couldn't skate very fast and was forced to play as the goaltender. He had tried to play as a forward and defenceman, but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era,</b> to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.|$|E

The contest was generally considered the most prestigious <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era.</b> From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played {{an integral part of the}} four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917. The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won.|$|E
5|$|Between 2015 and 2017, {{upgrades}} from K185 to K200 {{were also}} completed in Kulm, Planica, and Oberstdorf. All are now equipped for jumps exceeding 240m (previous hill records were broken at each opening event), {{as well as}} having improved facilities for athletes and spectators; Harrachov remains the only hill (at K185) to have not been upgraded since the 1990s. Although the new hills are much larger than ever before, most of them feature longer and less steeply angled slopes, designed purely for the V-style and {{with the knowledge of}} 80 years' worth of world record progression. Inrun tables have also been placed further back from the knoll and flight curves made shallower in order to allow athletes to glide more efficiently along the contour of the slope. This has significantly reduced such precarious heights over the knoll {{as was the case in}} the early 1990s and prior: <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era,</b> athletes using the parallel style would jump in a more upward trajectory off the table, reaching vast heights but at the expense of distance. Furthermore, rather than glide, they instead plummeted towards the slope. However, Planica remains extremely steep in the flight phase; Vikersund, by comparison, has a longer slope and does not enable as much height over the knoll.|$|E
5|$|Charles Diehl {{regarded}} early 7th-century Byzantine Africa to {{have undergone}} {{an economic and}} demographic decline, being under constant threat by hostile Berbers. Later historians, however, have had to revise this picture in light of archaeological evidence: the Exarchate {{was among the most}} affluent areas of the Byzantine Empire, though of lesser wealth and significance than Egypt. It seems to have seen much less warfare than the Balkans, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus did <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era,</b> thus allowing its residents a safer way of life. There is evidence of ongoing trade between Byzantine Africa and Frankish Gaul during the 7th century. Agriculture was thriving, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} Medjerda River. The production of grain, olive oil and wine kept the local population well-fed and probably supplied their maritime trade. Fishing seems to have been another thriving field. The local elite seems to have invested in the building of churches. The main testaments to their existence and activities are examples of funerary art, particularly mosaics. Heraclius the Elder seems to have established ties with this elite. His son, Heraclius the Younger, married his first wife Eudokia during the 7th century. Her father was Rogas, a landowner in the Exarchate.|$|E

5|$|In the club's {{early history}} the {{appearance}} record {{was held by}} goalkeeper Arthur Cartlidge, who played in 258 Southern League games between 1901 and 1909. His record stood until it was broken by another goalkeeper, Jesse Whatley, who played 14 times in the Southern League and a further 372 in The Football League, making a total of 386 overall. Following the Second World War the Bristol Rovers board introduced a no-buy/no-sell policy, which remained in force until {{the abolition of the}} maximum wage in football in 1961; as a result some players <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era</b> had a high number of appearances for the club. Eight of the top nine most-used players played during this time, each making over 400 appearances. These eight were Bobby Jones (421 appearances), Alfie Biggs (424), Ray Warren (450), Harold Jarman (452), George Petherbridge (457), Geoff Bradford (462), Jack Pitt (466), and Harry Bamford (486). The club's all-time leading appearance maker, Stuart Taylor, played in 546 League games between 1965 and 1980. The club's highest scorer by a wide margin is Geoff Bradford, who scored 242 times in The Football League, exceeding the next-highest scorer Alfie Biggs by 64 goals.|$|E

5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>era's</b> architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district to show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|R
