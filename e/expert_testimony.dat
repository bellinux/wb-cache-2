40|$|The {{propriety of}} <b>expert</b> ethics <b>testimony</b> in the {{courtroom}} is as contentious in academic scholarship as any typical ethical debate could be. Some of the main objections to <b>expert</b> ethics <b>testimony</b> stem partly from fears that it could unduly influence judicial thinking or judgments, or foist prejudicial or idiosyncratic moral views or opinions on judicial decisions. This prospect is perceived as contrary to the tenets of a liberal, pluralistic democratic society, where moral and ethical values should ideally be shared and not dictated. Another crucial argument against <b>expert</b> ethics <b>testimony</b> is the ethicists' propensity to assume the stance of 'moral advocates' bent on pitching clients' agenda, without regards to any merits in the opponents' moral judgments. Yet another anti-expert ethics testimony posits that reliance on it will foster moral laziness. This paper joins the debate by critically analyzing the arguments for and against <b>expert</b> ethics <b>testimony</b> {{in the context of}} relevant literature and standard evidentiary rules governing judicial evaluation and admissibility of expert ethics evidence. With a discourse on the nature of moral expertise and the dynamics of <b>expert</b> ethics <b>testimony</b> as a backgrounder, the paper evaluates the validity of the hypothesis that <b>expert</b> ethics <b>testimony</b> could encourage moral tardiness, unduly influence judicial proceedings or imprint narrow, elitist, or prejudicial moral viewpoints on judicial reasoning and judgments...|$|R

25|$|In {{another case}} in which the {{defendant}} was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude <b>expert</b> <b>testimony</b> one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own voir dire of the expert in question before he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant's motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed <b>expert</b> <b>testimony,</b> and ultimately failed in its appeal.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., the Daubert Standard {{is a legal}} {{precedent}} set in 1993 by the Supreme Court {{regarding the}} admissibility of expert witness testimony during legal proceedings, set in place to ensure that <b>expert</b> <b>testimony</b> is based on sufficient facts or data, derived from proper application of reliable principles and methods. When multiple forensic artists produce approximations for {{the same set of}} skeletal remains, no two reconstructions are ever the same and the data from which approximations are created are largely incomplete.
