Results show <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> for initial hydrogen contents in the 0. 03 - 1 ppm range, and none below contents of 0. 03.

40|$|Partially solid {{commercial}} Al-Si and Mg-Al alloys {{have been}} deformed in shear during solidification using vane rheometry. The dendritic mush was deformed {{for a short}} period at 29 % solid and allowed to cool naturally after deformation. Both alloys exhibited yield point behaviour and deformation was highly localised at the surface of maximum shear stress. The short period of deformation was found to have a distinct impact on the as-cast microstructure leading to fragmented dendrites in the deformation region of both alloys. In the case of the Mg-Al alloy, a concentrated region of <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> was also observed in the deformation region. Concentrated porosity was not observed in the Al-Si alloy.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} solidification defects, such as cracking and porosity, on dross formation during the remelting of aluminum 5182 alloy RSI. Remelting experiments were carried out to measure the dross formation. Optical and electron scanning microscopy were employed to characterize the solidification defects. It was found that {{a huge amount of}} dross was formed during the remelting of certain types of RSI which contained severe internal cavities such as <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> and hot tears. These cavities provided continuous channels that exposed the internal interdendritic surfaces to the atmosphere outside of the RSI. As a result, an oxide layer was formed on the surfaces of the interdendritic pores. Aluminum grains were entrained in the oxide shell, resulting in a large amount of dross formation during the re-melting of 5182 aluminum RSI...|$|E

The industrial-scale high-gradient plant of UVNS- 6 type and some benefits of its use are shown here as well. Some test specimens manufactured on the UVNS- 6 are studied with measurement of the interdendritic distance. The temperature gradient is estimated by experimental method...|$|R
40|$|Titanium {{aluminide}} alloys {{are prone}} to extensive shrinkage <b>porosity,</b> particularly <b>interdendritic</b> layer <b>porosity.</b> This research aims to develop {{a better understanding of}} shrinkage porosity in Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb alloy and how to minimize it. Practical measurements in conjunction with computer simulations were carried out in order to study the effects of cooling rate and temperature gradient on shrinkage porosity in Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb investment castings, through investigating the influence of casting geometry, specifically mould taper on cylindrical bars, and preheating mould temperature on the macrostructure and the formation of shrinkage porosity. The interface heat-transfer coefficient of the ceramic shell/surroundings was determined using measured cooling curves obtained in 200 mbar of Argon and in vacuum. Furthermore, the alloy/mould interfacial heat transfer coefficient was estimated and was verified by comparing measured and predicted cooling curves of Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb. The Niyama criterion function was validated to predict shrinkage-related porosity in Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb castings, through either thermal or tilt-filling ProCastTM simulation models. Positions in a casting with Niyama values above 4 (°C. min) 0. 5 cm- 1; (3 (K. s) 0. 5 mm- 1); could be considered completely sound. The critical value of the Niyama function was 2 (°C. min) 0. 5 cm- 1; (1. 5 (K. s) 0. 5 mm- 1); below which the position tested was susceptible to macroshrinkage porosity...|$|R
40|$|Iron {{has been}} shown to have a {{significant}} effect on the formation of porosity and shrinkage defects in Al-Si-Cu-based foundry alloys. This is not simply a direct consequence of the physical presence of the β-Al 5 FeSi platelets in the microstructure, but is also due to the effect that these platelets have on the nucleation and growth of eutectic silicon. The alloy-dependent critical iron content determines when the β phase first solidifies and, hence, when it can participate in the silicon nucleation event. At critical iron contents, the β phase solidifies as the initial component of the ternary eutectic. However, at supercritical iron contents, the β phase is already well developed when ternary eutectic solidification begins, while, at subcritical iron contents, the β phase forms as a component of the ternary eutectic only after the binary Al-Si eutectic is well established. Each of these paths of microstructural evolution leads to different variations in microstructural permeability and, hence, <b>interdendritic</b> feedability and <b>porosity</b> formation. The actual porosity-forming response to these alloy-induced microstructural changes is influenced by the solidification conditions in the casting...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{studies on}} disc and blade nickel based {{superalloys}} {{by the author}} and co-workers are reviewed. Crack initiation in single crystal turbine blade alloys is dominated by <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> with oxidation processes affecting initiation position. Lifetime trends can be modelled using a multipart Paris type lifing approach. Orientation, loading state, temperature and environment determine stage I/II crack growth mechanisms and the resulting crack path and {{should be considered in}} lifing. Mechanistic insights on how complex stress states, subsurface failures and different temperatures/environments affect fatigue processes can thus improve turbine blade lifing, and direct alloy development programmes. In polycrystalline disc alloys cracks at high temperature may initiate at oxidised subsurface carbides or porosity. Grain size controls cycle and time dependent crack growth: the benefits of increased grain size in resisting grain boundary attack mechanisms predominate over those of gamma' distribution variation. Optimising grain boundary character and gamma' distribution should yield the best alloy design strategy for high temperature fatigue performance in turbine discs...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} {{of nickel}} base single crystal CMSX 4 at 650 °C in air and vacuum {{has been investigated}} for two orientations with differing nominal crack propagation orientations but the same (001) tensile axis. The orientation containing a 110 crack growth direction shows better fatigue crack propagation resistance. This {{has been linked to}} differing orientations and amounts of <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> (giving increased crack path roughness and shielding) increased stiffness along the crack growth direction (with implications for shear band decohesion) and lower resolved shear stresses along active slip systems, limiting faster Stage I crack growth. Faster crack growth rates are generally seen in vacuum compared with air, indicating the homogeneising effect of oxidation on slip, suppressing faster Stage I crack growth and possibly increasing oxidation-induced closure. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the effect of secondary orientation and environment in single crystal components will affect both failure mode and fatigue crack propagation rates...|$|E
40|$|The scatter in {{notch fatigue}} lifetimes of CMSX 4 at 650 ?C and 725 ?C in air and vacuum and with Rene N 5 in air at 650 ?C is {{compared}} {{under the same}} (plastic) notch strain range levels. Rene N 5 shows shorter lifetimes under equivalent conditions and always exhibits multiple initiation sites. The role of <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> in initiating fatigue in both alloys is identified, {{and the number of}} initiation sites is found to directly affect fatigue life. In air in CMSX 4 and Rene N 5, subsurface pores initiate fatigue, and this is believed to be due to the repeated in-filling of surface pores by oxidation product, reducing their associated stress concentration and effectively deactivating them as a fatigue initiation site. Tests in vacuum support this hypothesis as cracks do initiate at surface porosity under vacuum conditions. An attempt to evaluate initiating porosity distributions, has indicated a correlation between total area of initiating porosity and fatigue lifetime, which to some extent may allow for crack coalescence behaviour. A deterministic fracture mechanics based model has been proposed to allow for the effect of pore shape, size and position in determining subsequent fatigue life (and hence scatter). The predictions of the model have been assessed using full factorial design of experiments, assessing the effects of variability in pore shape, size and distance below the notch root, as well as the materials parameters (crack growth laws and Kmax) used in the lifing calculation. The model successfully explains some, but not all of the observed scatter in lifetimes...|$|E
40|$|The directional/single-crystal {{solidification}} (DS/SC) of {{turbine blades}} made of superalloys {{is a key}} technology on a high scientific and technical level. Industrial DS/SC turbine blades are traditionally produced by using the expensive Bridgman process, which {{is characterized by a}} relatively inefficient heat dissipation and a low thermal gradient. In this thesis a Thin Shell Casting (TSC) process for downwards directional solidification is developed. This novel technique is a combination of the Czochralski, dynamical baffle and GCC technologies, which is characterized by a thin shell mould (~ 1 mm), a complete isolation between the heating and cooling zone as well as a gas cooling. By pulling up the shell mould through the floating baffle from the melt bath, a directional solidification is performed downwards. Application of gas cooling enables a significantly increased heat extraction. Thus the specific disadvantage of the Bridgman process, i. e. the low temperature gradient and the consequent casting defects could be generally overcome by this new technique. Using a Cu alloy in the first work phase, the feasibility of this novel process was successfully confirmed. With simplified shell moulds, DS/SC components were cast. The second work phase dealt with the directional solidification of Al alloys, in order to fundamentally investigate the solidification condition and to systematically analyze the resultant microstructure in the TSC process. Thereafter DS/SC turbine blades of Al alloys were also successfully cast. In the third part, some DS rods of the Ni-base superalloy CMSX- 6 were cast under inert gas. According to the metallographic examination, an extremely high temperature gradient G of about 24 K/mm was evaluated, which is a considerable increase by an order of magnitude over that of the conventional Bridgman process. As a consequence, the primary dendrite arm spacing lambda 1 is reduced by a factor of three. The reduction of the size and volume fraction of gamma/gamma'-eutectic is even more pronounced. Due to the strongly shortened interdendritic feeding path, the <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> is almost completely eliminated. The result is a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of DS/SC components...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{foundries}} {{have observed}} porosity primarily as <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity</b> in large freezing range alloys such as Ni-Hard I and hypoeutectic high Cr alloys or pinholes and fissure defects in gray and ductile irons. For most iron foundries, porosity problems occur sporadically, but even occasional outbreaks {{can be costly}} since even a very small amount of porosity can significantly reduce the mechanical properties of the castings. As a result when porosity is detected, the castings are scrapped and remelted, or when the porosity is undetected, defective parts are shipped to the consumer. Neither case is desirable. This project was designed to examine various factors contributing to the porosity formation in iron castings. Factors such as solubility of gases in liquid and solid iron alloys, surface tension of liquid iron alloys, and permeability of dendritic structures were investigated {{in terms of their}} effect on the porosity formation. A method was developed to predict how much nitrogen the molten alloy picks up from air after a given amount of holding time for a given melting practice. It was shown that small batches of iron melts in an induction furnace can end up with very high concentration of nitrogen (near solubility limit). Surface tension of liquid iron alloys was measured as a function of temperature. Effect of minor additions of S, Ti, and Al on the surface tension of liquid iron alloys was investigated. Up to 18 % change in surface tension was detected by minor element additions. This translates to the same amount of change in gas pressure required in a bubble of a given size to keep the bubble stable. A new method was developed to measure the permeability of dendritic structures in situ. The innovative aspect of these experiments, with respect to previous interdendritic permeability measurements, {{was the fact that the}} dendritic structure was allowed to form in situ and was not cooled and re-heated for permeability tests. A permeability model was developed and tested using the results of the permeability experiments. The permeability model for flow parallel to the columnar dendrites predicted the experimental permeability results closely when the liquid volume fraction data from equilibrium calculations were used. The permeability gradient model was constructed in order to test the impact of interdendritic channel constriction on the flow of liquid through the mushy zone of a casting. The model examines two different regimes: (i) Dendritic solidification regime where the permeability is dominated by changes in liquid volume fraction and dendrite arm spacing, and (ii) Eutectic solidification regime where the permeability is dominated by changes in viscosity of eutectic mixture. It is assumed that the eutectic mixture behaves like a slurry whose viscosity increases with increasing solid fraction. It is envisioned that this model can be developed into a tool that can be very useful for metal casters...|$|E
40|$|Electroslag {{remelted}} (ESR) ingots of INCOLOY alloys 800 and 825 {{are particularly}} prone to macroscale slag inclusions and microscale cleanliness issues. Formation of these structures near the ingot surface can cause significant production yield losses (∼ 10 %) {{due to the}} necessity of extensive surface grinding. Slag inclusions from near the outer radius of the toe end of alloy 800 and 825 ingots {{were found to be}} approximately 1 to 3 mm in size and have a multiphase microstructure consisting of CaF 2, CaTiO 3, MgAl 2 O 4, MgO and some combination of Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 and/or Ca 12 Al 14 O 33. These inclusions were often surrounded by fields of 1 to 10 μm cuboidal TiN particles. A large number of TiN cuboids were observed in the ESR electrode with similar size and morphology to those observed surrounding slag inclusions in the ESR ingots, suggesting that the TiN particles are relics from ESR electrode production process. Samples taken sequentially throughout the EAF-AOD processes showed that the TiN cuboidals that are found in ESR ingots form between tapping the AOD vessel into the AOD ladle and the casting of ESR electrodes. ^ Analysis of slag skin at various heights of alloy 825 ingots revealed that the phase fraction of CaF 2 decreased, whereas TiCaO 3 and Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 increased, from toe to head. The observed increase in TiO 2 content suggests that at most a two-fold increase in viscosity of the slag would be expected. Similar analysis of alloy 800 ingots did not reveal significant trends in slag skin composition, possibly due to differences in ingot geometry or the presence of Al toe additions during the remelting of alloy 800. Directional solidification experiments were conducted to determine the solidification sequences of two common ESR slags: Code 316 (33 % CaF 2, 33 % CaO, and 33 % Al 2 O 3) and Code 59 (50 % CaF 2, 20 % CaO, 22 % Al 2 O 3, 5 % MgO, and 3 % TiO 2). In both cases the changes in slag phase fraction as a function of solidification time were not as significant as predicted. This suggests substantial solute concentrations within each phase, significant gas phase reactions or insufficient imposed temperature gradient for directional planer solidification. Optical microscopy and SEM analysis revealed a dendritic structure with Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 as the primary phase and significant <b>interdendritic</b> <b>porosity.</b> EDS analysis showed that Al segregates to the primary phase while F segregates to the interdendritic regions. Parametric studies using a numerical model of ESR suggests that the ESR process is quite sensitive to changes in slag electrical conductivity and not very sensitive to changes in slag viscosity. ...|$|E
