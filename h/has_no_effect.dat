5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E

Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the growth on Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on platelet function).|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are {{to be removed from}} any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E

40|$|Mice vaccinated with mycobacterial {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) {{produced}} a high immune response {{and did not}} develop delayed hypersensitivity to purified protein derivative (PPD), and rifampin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the immune response. Mice vaccinated with viable H 37 Ra cells produced a high immune response and did develop delayed hypersensitivity to PPD. Rifampin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on this immune response, but reduced the footpad reactions to PPD. Both mycobacterial RNA and poly(A:U) served as adjuvants for induction of hypersensitivity to PPD. This hypersensitivity was reduced by the administration of rifampin. Rifampin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the production of mycobacterial growth inhibitory factor, which is produced following vaccination of mice with mycobacterial RNA or viable H 37 Ra cells. Rifampin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the nonspecific phase of the granulomatous response, but did inhibit the secondary allergic phase of this response. The action, therefore, of rifampin that inhibits the induction of delayed hypersensitivity but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the immune responses against tuberculosis leads to a separation of tuberculin hypersensitivity from cellular immunity to tuberculosis...|$|R
