This allowed handed engines to be made in pairs, when needed. It also allowed contra-rotating engines, where gas generator core and power turbine revolved in opposite directions, reducing the overall moment of inertia.

40|$|Above-The-Road (AbTR) radar is a {{new type}} of speed {{measurement}} device used in China for traffic speed enforcement. The antenna beamwidths in vertical and horizontal directions are critical parameters for AbTR radar because speed measurement accuracy partly depends on vertical beamwidth and speed measurement interference from adjacent lanes can be effectively minimized by appropriate choice of horizontal beamwidth. In this paper, the speed measurement principle of AbTR radar is introduced and the reason for field speed measurement error is presented. The speed measurement error is theoretically calculated in various combinations of different vertical beamwidths and possible <b>installation</b> <b>angles.</b> The requirement for horizontal beamwidth to operate with less interference from adjacent lanes is also theoretically laid down with different <b>installation</b> heights and <b>angles.</b> Field tests with three equal-distanced piezosensors each lane as triggering references have been performed on an AbTR radar sample with vertical beamwidth 5. 1 ° and horizontal beamwidth 5. 2 °.

50|$|Awnings became common {{during the}} first half of the 19th century. At that time they {{consisted}} of timber or cast iron posts set along the sidewalk edge and linked by a front cross bar. To lend support to larger <b>installations,</b> <b>angled</b> rafters linked the front cross bar to the building facade. The upper end of the canvas was connected to the facade with nails, with grommets and hooks, or by lacing the canvas to a head rod bolted to the facade. The other (projecting) end of the canvas was draped over or laced to a front bar with the edge often hanging down to form a valance. On ornate examples, metal posts were adorned with filigree and the tops decorated with spear ends, balls or other embellishments. On overcast days or when rain did not threaten, the covering was often rolled up against the building facade; during the winter months proper maintenance called for the removal and storage of awnings. Photographs from the mid-19th century often show the bare framework, suggesting that the covering was extended only when necessary.

The optimum angles at which a solar collector should be fixed are often debated. Similar publications on this topic often rely on mathematical models of solar resource rather than measured data. Measured data is preferred since the effects of pollution and weather are included. In this work, recently measured data from nine measuring stations in the Southern African Universities Radiometric Network (SAURAN) equipped with pyranometers and pyrheliometers are considered. The data is used to calculate the annual solar insolation on fixed collectors at all possible <b>installation</b> <b>angles.</b> SolTrace, a ray-tracing software, is used for validation. Relative to horizontally-fixed collectors, the annual solar insolation is 10 % more for optimally-fixed collectors and 45 % more for solartracking collectors. The effects of tilt and azimuth angles are presented on contour plots, which are convenient for cost analysis and the determination of the annual insolation on building surfaces. The optimum azimuth angle is a function of the longitude angle minus the absolute latitude angle, which suggests that frontal and convective precipitation effects influence the optimum azimuth angle.

Secondly, we construct an on-orbit geometric calibration model by selecting and optimizing parameters of the rigorous geometric imaging model. On this basis, the calibration parameters are divided into two groups: external and internal calibration parameters. The external parameters are <b>installation</b> <b>angles</b> between the area-array camera and the star tracker, and we propose a two-dimensional direction angle model as internal parameters to describe the distortion of the areaarray camera.

Experiments based on the real data of GF- 4 shows that after on-orbit geometric calibration, the geometric accuracy of the images without ground control points is significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} approach which utilizes an isotropic porous medium {{model has been}} widely adopted for modeling the flow through a compact heat exchanger. With respect to situations where the compact heat exchangers are partially installed inside a channel, such as the application of recuperators in an intercooled recuperative engine, {{the use of an}} isotropic porous medium model needs to be carefully assessed because the flow passing through the heat exchanger is very complicated. For this purpose, in this study the isotropic porous medium model is assessed together with specific pressure–velocity relationships for flow field modeling inside a rectangular channel with a built-in double-U-shaped tube bundle heat exchanger. Firstly, experiments were conducted using models to investigate the relationship between the pressure drop and the inlet velocity for a specific heat exchanger with different <b>installation</b> <b>angles</b> inside a rectangular channel. Secondly, a series of numerical computations were carried out using the isotropic porous medium model and the pressure–velocity relationship was then modified by introducing correction coefficients empirically. Finally, a three-dimensional (3 -D) direct computation was made using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method for the comparison of detailed flow fields. The results suggest that the isotropic porous medium model is capable of making precise pressure drop predictions given the reasonable pressure–velocity relationship but is unable to precisely simulate the detailed flow features...|$|R
40|$|While {{crosswind}} has {{a negative}} influence on natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) of all sizes, the influence may be fatal for short towers (height < 30 m) proposed for geothermal or solar thermal power plants. In a previous paper, the authors demonstrated the potential for tri-blade-like windbreak walls not to only maintain but significantly improve the short tower cooling performance. The effect of crosswind attack angle (windbreak walls orientation) was not examined in that paper. The present paper investigates that effect for a 15 m-high small-size NDDCT with horizontally-arranged heat exchangers. 3 D CFD models with different wind attack angles (0 °, 10 °, 20 °, 30 °, 40 °, 50 °, and 60 °) are set up and computed at different crosswind speeds. The {{results indicate that the}} way the cooling tower performance varies with the crosswind speed is highly sensitive to the wind attack angles. At attack angles of 0 ° and 60 ° the cooling performance is improved by windbreaks over the entire crosswind speed range investigated. Other attack angles lead to unfavourable effects at certain wind speeds. The differences are related to the turbulent airflow field in the tower bottom. The results suggest that the tri-blade-like windbreaks placements always with one symmetry axis alignment with the dominant crosswind direction. The findings could be used to determine the windbreak <b>installation</b> <b>angles</b> with respect to the most frequent direction(s) of the ambient wind in a given district...|$|R
