5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly during the day, {{and on its}} winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation. The flocks break up during {{the day when the}} birds feed on <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> in smaller groups. During the summer, the American robin defends a {{breeding}} territory and is less social.|$|E
5|$|Cacambo and Candide are {{captured}} by Oreillons, or Orejones; {{members of the}} Inca nobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a Jesuit by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), <b>fruits,</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E
50|$|Locally grown <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> (moderately).|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} flying insects, small <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> small lizards.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{polyphenol}} rich beverages (vitamin enhanced waters (VEWs), <b>fruit</b> juices <b>and</b> <b>berry</b> juices) to determine free polyphenol concentrations and free polyphenols per Calorie based on a serving size. The Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was used in a colorimetric assay based on a catechin standard. <b>Fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berry</b> juices contained, on average, more than eight-times the concentration of free polyphenols when compared to VEWs. When Calories per serving were taken into consideration, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berry</b> juices contained more than twice the free polyphenols per Calorie...|$|R
5|$|The American robin's diet {{generally}} {{consists of}} around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> Their ability {{to switch to}} berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented Pyracantha berries, and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily {{on the ground for}} soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and sometimes by hearing), pouncing on them and then pulling them up. Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus, will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.|$|E
25|$|Tree bats feed on papayas {{and other}} <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|E
25|$|It also occurs {{naturally}} in many stone <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> from {{trees of the}} genus Sorbus.|$|E
50|$|Yan Yean also {{contains}} a cemetery, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berry</b> farm, stock feed and a tin shop.|$|R
50|$|The black guan is frugivorous, eating <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> while {{travelling}} {{through the}} tree canopy. It is mostly silent.|$|R
50|$|The red-cockaded {{woodpecker}} feeds {{primarily on}} ants, beetles, cockroaches, caterpillars, wood-boring insects, and spiders, <b>and</b> occasionally <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|R
25|$|Vodka is most {{well-known}} of Russia's alcoholic products and is produced, with some variation, throughout the country. Vodka {{can be either}} grain or potato based and is frequently flavored with {{a great variety of}} ingredients ranging from hot-pepper and horseradish to <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|E
25|$|When canning or {{preserving}} food at home, {{attention should}} be paid to hygiene, pressure, temperature, refrigeration and storage. When making home preserves, only acidic fruit such as apples, pears, stone <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> should be bottled. Tropical fruit and tomatoes are low in acidity and must have some acidity added before they are bottled.|$|E
25|$|UVS is also {{demonstrated}} to serve functions in foraging, prey identification, and frugivory. Similar advantages afforded to trichromatic primates over dichromatic primates in frugivory are {{generally considered to}} exist in birds. The waxy surfaces of many <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> reﬂect UV light that advertise their presence to UVS birds. Common kestrels be able to locate the trails of voles with vision; these small rodents lay scent trails of urine and feces that reﬂect UV light, making them visible to the kestrels. However, this view has been challenged by the finding of low UV sensitivity in raptors and weak UV reflection of mammal urine.|$|E
50|$|Golden-olive {{woodpeckers}} mainly eat insects, including ants and beetle larvae, {{with some}} <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> The call of this bird is a loud wheep.|$|R
50|$|The {{black-headed bulbul}} mainly feeds on small <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> {{but will also}} take insects. It {{commonly}} occurs in small flocks, comprising 6-8 individuals.|$|R
50|$|This dove {{feeds on}} figs, small <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> {{in the upper}} canopy of the forest, where it is well-camouflaged amongst the green foliage.|$|R
25|$|Kvass was {{reported}} to be consumed in excess by peasants, low-class citizens, and monks; in fact, it is sometimes said that it was usual for them to drink more kvass than water. In the 19th century, the kvass industry was created and less natural versions of the drink became increasingly widespread. On the other hand, the popularity of kvass and the market competition led to the emergence of many varieties, which included herbs, <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> At that time kvass vendors called kvasnik (pl. kvasniki) were on the streets in almost every city. They often specialized in particular kinds of kvass: strawberry kvass, apple kvass, etc.|$|E
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{serving as a}} shelter (presumably for several related families totaling 15 to 30 individuals), the cave would have provided {{a constant source of}} water {{due to the lack of}} freezing temperatures in the cavern.The cave housed 15-30 individuals because it was limited by the need for mobility and by how much the actual land could house people. The surrounding hardwood forest and nearby Tennessee River served as sources of food throughout the year. The food sources would have included aquatic animals (fish, turtles, shellfish), birds (including turkey), small mammals (squirrels, raccoons, rabbits, gray foxes, skunks, bobcats, porcupines, peccaries), nuts (including acorns), seeds, and roots. Larger animals such as deer and black bears were also commonly hunted when the seasons permitted. Griffin has stated that the dominant animal food sources for these occupants were deer and turkey. As gatherers, these occupants also would have consumed <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> although these plant foods may have been scarce or unavailable during the seasons of cave occupancy. Generally speaking, hunter-gathers relied more heavily on plant foods than they did animals. Indirect evidence of gathering includes pits for storage of nuts and seeds, mortars and pestles, and nut stones.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The fast {{freezing}} of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> their further storage in frozen state {{is one of}} the best ways to keep the quality and the utile properties of initial raw. Freezing will help protect the harvest and process it in longer terms, reduce the seasonality in procession of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> because frozen raw materials can be used in production of preserved foodstuffs. We conducted the research with a help of differential scanning calorimetric method that would give a great deal of information about both the state of water inside the cells and the correlation between free and constrained water in researched materials. The received data allowed us defining the temperature intervals for the most efficient freezing of different raw materials from the viewpoint of maximal storage of all the precious biologically active components in raw <b>and</b> keeping the <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> undamaged...|$|R
50|$|The birds forage {{through the}} forest in the trees and on the ground. The diet is largely vegetarian, mainly <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> though insects are also taken.|$|R
50|$|These {{arboreal}} bellbirds feeds {{entirely on}} <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> mainly {{taken on the}} wing. Lauraceae and Burseraceae are particularly favoured, and the young are fed regurgitated Lauraceae by the female.|$|R
500|$|Natural ice became {{essential}} to the transportation of perishable foods over the railroads; slaughtering and dressing meat, then transporting it, was much more efficient in terms of freight costs and opened up the industries of the Mid-West, while, as the industrialist Jonathan Armour argued, ice and refrigerator cars [...] "changed the growing of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> from a gamble...to a national industry".|$|E
500|$|Juices, {{as well as}} wines, of a {{multitude}} of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> had been known at least since Roman antiquity and were still consumed in the Middle Ages: [...] pomegranate, mulberry and blackberry wines, perry, and cider which was especially popular in the north where both apples and pears were plentiful. Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include prunellé from wild plums (modern-day slivovitz), mulberry gin and blackberry wine. Many variants of mead {{have been found in}} medieval recipes, with or without alcoholic content. However, the honey-based drink became less common as a table beverage {{towards the end of the}} period and was eventually relegated to medicinal use. Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the Slavs. This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions. When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state, mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift. It was also common at weddings and baptismal parties, though in limited quantity due to its high price. In medieval Poland, mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries, such as spices and wines. Kumis, the fermented milk of mares or camels, was known in Europe, but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians.|$|E
2500|$|This {{species is}} highly social, often forming very large flocks of 250 or more birds, and several birds {{always seem to}} act as [...] for the flock, {{watching}} out for predators while their companions are feeding. The seed of the pinyon pine is the staple food but they supplement their diet with <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b> Insects of many types are also eaten and sometimes caught with its feet.|$|E
50|$|The chestnut-headed oropendola inhabits forest canopy, {{edges and}} old plantations. It is a quite common bird {{in parts of}} its range, seen in small flocks {{foraging}} in trees for large insects, <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is {{a social}} bird, often seen in family groups of 6-12. It walks along {{branches}} seeking the <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> on which it feeds, or flies off with an ani-like flap and glide.|$|R
50|$|They are forest birds, and {{the nest}} is {{built in a}} tree. Three large white eggs are laid, the female alone incubating. This {{arboreal}} species feeds on <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> as well as flowers and leaves.|$|R
60|$|Hidden {{amidst the}} plant {{life from the}} sight of any who might chance to pass along the well-beaten trail that skirted the river Pan-at-lee sought rest and food, the latter growing in {{abundance}} all about her {{in the form of}} <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> and succulent tubers which she scooped from the earth with the knife of the dead Es-sat.|$|E
60|$|When Tarzan awoke {{early the}} {{following}} morning he dropped lightly {{to the ground and}} {{made his way to the}} stream. Removing his weapons and loin cloth he entered the cold waters of the little pool, and after his refreshing bath returned to the tree to breakfast upon another portion of Bara, the deer, adding to his repast some <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> which grew in abundance nearby.|$|E

I am known to all the {{inhabitants}} of this country, who look upon me as mad, and respect me accordingly. None ever interfere with me, or with the two or three other hermits, the remains of what was once almost an army, who now alone survive. I can offer you no hospitality beyond that of a refuge; but there is water in the river below, <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries</b> in abundance on the shrubs. What would you have more?" ...|$|E
50|$|Like other sapsuckers, {{these birds}} drill holes in trees {{and eat the}} sap and insects drawn to it. They may also pick insects from tree trunks or catch them in flight. They also eat <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like other {{starling}}s, Fischer's starling is an omnivore, <b>and</b> sometimes takes <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>berries,</b> but its diet {{is mainly}} insects, {{taken from the}} ground. It normally forages alone or in pairs, but will form mixed flocks with wattled starlings.|$|R
50|$|A year later, the International-Great Northern Railroad {{extended}} its line through Lindale, and the town's fledgling canning <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> packing industries took off.
