Linnaeus described three species within the genus: the cultivated radish (Raphanus sativus), the wild radish or <b>jointed</b> <b>charlock</b> (Raphanus raphanistrum), and the rat-tail radish (Raphanus caudatus). Various other {{species have been}} proposed (particularly related to the East Asian daikon varieties) and the rat-tail radish is sometimes considered a variety of R. sativus, but no clear consensus has emerged.|$|E
50|$|Raphanus raphanistrum, {{the wild}} radish or <b>jointed</b> <b>charlock,</b> is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Brassicaceae. It is sometimes {{claimed to be the}} ancestor of the edible radish, Raphanus sativus. Native to Asia (or, according to some authorities, the Mediterranean), it has been introduced into most parts of the world, and is regarded as a damagingly invasive species in many areas, for example Australia. It spreads rapidly, and is often found growing on roadsides or in other places where the ground has been disturbed.|$|E
