25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
500|$|Davis said, [...] "It {{was a huge}} thrill. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> to {{be picked}} by New York." [...] He {{received}} fatherly advice from his dad, and recalled: [...] He just said they've got the best fans, and it's a blast because every game is live or die for them. It's a great environment to grow up playing baseball, {{and learning how to}} play under pressure in front of all those people. He loved it, and I'm looking forward to it, too.|$|E
500|$|After his {{departure}} from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante became more serious about his longtime dream to make electronic music. As he explained on his blog, [...] "I started {{to learn how to}} program all the instruments we associate with Acid House music and some other hardware. [...] Then I started recording, playing 10 or so synced machines through a small mixer into a CD burner. This was all experimental Acid House, my skills at making rock music playing no part in it whatsoever. I had lost interest in traditional songwriting and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> about finding new methods for creating music." [...] During that time Frusciante began an electronic trio with Aaron Funk and Chris McDonald under the name Speed Dealer Moms. Their first EP was released in December 2010 on Planet Mu Records.|$|E

5000|$|In {{regards to}} the signing, Berrigan said [...] "I have had a fantastic career at the Broncos, winning premierships, playing for Queensland and of course for Australia. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> really <b>excited</b> to <b>be</b> joining Hull and playing in the Super League and Challenge Cup. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>excited</b> by their plans, I believe the club has a fantastic future and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{looking forward to being}} a part of it for the next 4 years".|$|R
500|$|This {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by [...] "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". Manson {{said that the}} recording of the album [...] "just became a rhythm. This was something <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> to do." [...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it. I didn't even know where the music was going to go and I just went with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up a whole different part of my mind." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> {{about is}} with B, I had no ego. Neither {{of us had}} an ego. It wasn't about competition. It was about, like, 'Man let's give the world what they want. Let's do a real girl-power {{collaboration}} where we support one another.' I said, 'I want to do you in your video, and I want to tribute you. I want to dress up like you'. And Hype Williams ... was so excited. He was like, 'Gaga I want no makeup on your face.' It was really stripped down — real Beyoncé hair, and we wore the same outfit in the video, and I [...] her. [...] I wanted to [...] because this was an era for her in her career where she defined herself aesthetically. And that should be applauded that a woman did that. She's so great at what she does." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{believe that}} {{this has got to}} be the most unique and most varied voice group so far. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>excited</b> at how they can go in terms of musical mileage," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good God--why?" [...] he cried. [...] "Stop! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>exciting</b> myself. <b>I</b> mustn't do that. I {{must have}} all my wits about me; I mustn't wander. The thing is too serious. Wait a minute!" ...|$|R

500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> for [...] I love to see the creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [...] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Shanahan {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} the NHL to become the NHL's vice president of hockey and business development. [...] "In a broad sense, I think obviously, I {{am going to be}} another voice in the hockey ops, {{but at the same time}} people like [...] John Collins and [...] Gary [...] and [...] Bill [...] are going to allow me and teach me the business of hockey," [...] Shanahan told NHL.com. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> about in their offer to bring me on board is that it was wide open for me. There was not going to be any room with a closed door and I would be given an opportunity to see and learn. As time goes by there will be some days where my role is more hockey specific and some days where my role is more business or marketing specific." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dettori commented [...] "What an {{unbelievable}} day. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> {{at the big}} job ahead of me, but it all went like clockwork from start to finish. When you're young, you don't really appreciate the full importance of this Derby, so it means {{a great deal to}} win it for a second time. I've had a colourful life, but I'm not finished". Before the race Dettori had requested some [...] "lucky white tape" [...] for his stirrup: the tape had previously been used to repair Willie Carson's saddle before his win on Nashwan and had been applied to Dettori's stirrup when he won on Authorized in 2007. Gosden, who was winning the race for the second time, after Benny the Dip's success in 1997, commented [...] "The last thing I said to Frankie was ride a cool race and he rode a cool race—he waited and waited. He's a proper horse." [...] On the following day Gosden indicated that the Eclipse Stakes would be the colt's most likely next target.|$|E
6000|$|... "A future prima donna," [...] she retorted, [...] "can't do {{always what}} she likes. If I {{go to bed}} too early I cannot sleep. To-night <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>excited</b> and nervous. There isn't {{anything}} likely to bring trouble upon--them, is there?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Work on Lightning {{was done}} between January 1 and July 2012, in Matt and Kim's old {{apartment}} on Grand Street in Brooklyn, New York. The album was written and recorded using the music production software Logic Pro. The 10 tracks of Lightning were pared from 25-26 songs originally {{written for the}} album, which Matt Johnson said that [...] "it gave us [...] {{a lot more to}} choose from, which let Kim and I really broaden this album out." [...] He {{said in an interview that}} the group [...] "felt there was a lot going on in the songs" [...] on their album Sidewalks. [...] "In a way, the safest thing you can do with a song is to make it have a lot of stuff. The more you put on, the less the actual songwriting is exposed. For the new album , <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> to do as little possible to the songs production-wise and still have them be strong." [...] He also said that the album's recording location [...] "was a nice farewell" [...] to the apartment.|$|E
2500|$|At King's College, Wilkins pursued, {{among other}} things, X-ray {{diffraction}} work on ram sperm and DNA {{that had been}} obtained from calf thymus by the Swiss scientist Rudolf Signer. The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered {{that it was possible}} to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns. Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said [...] "When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!" [...] This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson’s interest in DNA causing him to write [...] "suddenly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be possible for me to join Wilkins in working on DNA". At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins [...] "what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein". Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.|$|E

60|$|The {{night was}} dark and overcast. Two yellow {{pinpoints}} far away showed the passing of a ship, and nearer was a red glare that came and went.

60|$|I {{went on to}} the Cob, where I sat down. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited.</b> Deeds {{of great}} import must shortly be done. I felt a little nervous. It would never do to bungle the thing.

These things did not bear thinking of.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2016, it was {{announced}} that Coronation Street would be extending the Barlow family be reintroducing Adam along with Peter Barlow and Daniel Osbourne.

Addressing the plans, producer Kate Oates told Digital Spy: [...] "One of the things <b>I</b> <b>am</b> most <b>excited</b> about and something I consider a real privilege <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> lucky enough to work on the longest-running soap.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited,</b> feverish. The {{beautiful}} Leah's {{silence and}} tranquillity grated upon my nerves. I {{could not understand}} how she could remain there so placid when her whole life's happiness had so suddenly, so unexpectedly, been assured. I {{became more and more}} fidgety as time went on. Soon I felt that I could no longer hold myself in proper control. Being of an impulsive disposition, this tranquil acceptance of so great a joy became presently intolerable, and, unable to restrain my ardour any longer, I seized that passive bundle of loveliness in my arms.|$|E
60|$|The worthy woman bustled off, and I {{crouched}} {{nearer the}} fire; my head felt hot, {{and the rest}} of me chill: moreover, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>excited,</b> almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to find me so companionable.|$|E

On the other hand, if he was beaten he took it with complete good-humour. He was a bad winner and a good loser. Those who think that a man betrays his character nowhere more clearly than when he is playing a game might on this draw subtle inferences.|$|E
