40|$|Recently, by the {{development}} of computer technology, the system of computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) is being utilized and is being popularized in many enterprises, and it is a necessary for design or drafting in many industrial fields such as machine design. Under these back ground, 4 engineering work stations for CAD/CAM was introduced at Tsuyama National College of Technology in 1990. Therefore, {{the development}} and investigation on many educational system or soft ware of CAD/CAM that enable to utilize for machine design and drafting, engineering experimentation, engineering work and so on will be necessary. This investigation was performed as a objection to draw up a model for <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> bolt and to practice the parametric component graphic analysis (PCM), Results obtained are follows; 1) A program for PCM was developed and practiced. 2) A model of <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> bolt was drawn up...|$|E
40|$|This review {{considers}} the various components which determine the total energy requirement of a product. A method {{which may be}} used by a designer to calculate the total energy requirement of a product, in a more appropriate manner than methods previously published, is described. With the proposed method the advantage of recycling materials from discarded products results in a lower energy requirement. Two examples are given to illustrate the calculation method. The first is {{a comparison of the}} energy used, in manufacturing <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> bolts by extrusion and cutting whilst the second concerns the energy commitments involved in substituting aluminium alloys for steel and cast iron parts in automobiles. ...|$|E
5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a <b>hexagon</b> socket <b>head</b> hollow set screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|R
40|$|As {{authorized}} by purchase order No. 11 - 2532 dated March 11, 1949 of the Kellex Corp., the first sample of a 4 inch three jaw type connector for Job 11 was fabricated. The {{design of the}} connector was per Crane Co. drawing DR- 25126 -D except vertical mounting. The materials were per Crane Co. drawing A- 24491 -C. As instructed in verbal conversation with Dr. D. D. Jacobus and as requested in Mr. J. J. Cuniffe`s letter of May 6, 1949, and Ingersoll-Rand Company`s 1 1 / 4 inch 534 impact wrench with suitable socket to fit the <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> of the operating screw of the 4 inch connector was procured on loan to make some preliminary tests.

40|$|The metal {{injection}} moulding technique (MIM) is already established for serial production of complex, mostly stainless steel parts. However for other materials, especially for titanium parts, {{there is still the}} need for superior purity and enhanced surface quality. Facing the challenge of obtaining suitable medical titanium MIM parts, advances have been made at Fraunhofer IFAM over the last few years. Investigations show the effect of very fine powders and different surface finishes of the mould: with polished moulds a very low surface roughness of less than 0. 8 m of the sintered part was obtainable. Chemical and mechanical properties of the sintered parts show the complexity of interactions between sintering conditions, purity, particle size and binder components. Additionally tests concerning feasibility of moulding high aspect ratios, wall-thicknesses of less than 200 m and special features like a fine internal thread and <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> set structures were performed as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the present}} biomechanical study, the {{torsional}} stability of different interference screws, made of bovine bone, was tested. Interference screws derived from bovine bone are a possible biological alternative to conventional metallic or bioabsorbable polymer interference screws. Methods In {{the first part}} of the study we compared the torsional stability of self-made 8 mm Interference screws (BC) and a commercial 8 mm interference screw (Tutofix ®). Furthermore, we compared the torsional strength of BC screws with different diameters. For screwing in, a <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> and an octagon head were tested. Maximum breaking torques in polymethyl methacrylate resin were recorded by means of an electronic torque screw driver. In the second part of the study the tibial part of a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was fixed in porcine test specimens using an 8 mm BC screw and the maximum insertion torques were recorded. Each interference screw type was tested 5 times. Results There was no statistically significant difference between the different 8 mm interference screws (p = 0. 121). Pairwise comparisons did not reveal statistically significant differences, either. It was demonstrated for the BC screws, that a larger screw diameter significantly leads to higher torsional stability (p = 9. 779 × 10 - 5). Pairwise comparisons showed a significantly lower torsional stability for the 7 mm BC screw than for the 8 mm BC screw (p = 0. 0079) and the 9 mm BC screw (p = 0. 0079). Statistically significant differences between the 8 mm and the 9 mm BC screw could not be found (p = 0. 15). During screwing into the tibial graft channel of the porcine specimens, insertion torques between 0. 5 Nm and 3. 2 Nm were recorded. In one case the <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> of a BC screw broke off during the last turn. Conclusions The BC screws show comparable torsional stability to Tutofix ® interference screws. As expected the torsional strength of the screws increases significantly with the diameter. The safety and in vivo performance of products derived from xenogeneic bone should be the focus of further investigations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Clathrin triskelia {{and carbon}} atoms alike self-assemble into a limited {{selection}} of fullerene cages (with n three connected vertices, 3 n/ 2 edges, 12 pentagonal faces, and (n− 20) / 2 hexagonal faces). We {{show that a}} geometric constraint—exclusion of head-to-tail dihedral angle discrepancies (DADs) —explains this limited selection as well as successful assembly into such closed cages in the first place. An edge running from a pentagon to a hexagon has a DAD, since the dihedral angles about the edge broaden from its pentagon (tail) end to its <b>hexagon</b> (<b>head)</b> end. Of the 21 configurations of a central face and surrounding faces, six have such DAD vectors arranged head-to-tail. Of the 5770 mathematically possible fullerene cages for n ≤  60, excluding those {{with any of the}} six configurations leaves just 15 cages plus buckminsterfullerene (n =  60), among them the known clathrin cages. Of the 216, 739 mathematically possible cages for 60  < n ≤  84, just the 50 that obey the isolated-pentagon rule, among them known carbon cages, pass. The absence of likely fullerenes for some n (30, 34, 46, 48, 52 – 58, 62 – 68) explains the abundance of certain cages, including buckminsterfullerene. These principles also suggest a “probable roads” path to self-assembly in place of pentagon-road and fullerene-road hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign aimed to evaluate the performance of timber beams strengthened in bending using GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) plates mechanically attached with high-strength metal screws. Modest ratios of GFRP composite reinforcement can increase beam load-carrying capacity and manipulate failure mode from the brittle tensile in the unreinforced beams to a more extensible failure in the strengthened timber beams. Application of mechanical reinforcement presents a solution of reversibility, compatibility and durability for reinforced timber. The experimental campaign focused on load-deflection relationship and failure modes in order to increase the bending capacity and stiffness of the timber beam. Oak beams with dimensions 145 x 145 x 2450 mm were reinforced with un-bonded pultruded GFRP plates. <b>Hexagon</b> <b>head</b> coach screws 16 mm diameter, 130 mm length, grade 8. 8, were used to mechanically attach the reinforcement along with 34 mm outer diameter fender washers, distributing the fastening load away from the screw’s position. All beams were tested until failure under the four-point bending configuration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reinforcement method and ability to reversibly repair the timber, representing a capability to be utilised in the new constructions or restoration of timber structures...|$|E
