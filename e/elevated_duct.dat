In this thesis, more than 13000 vertical profiles from GPS-enabled dropsondes, recorded from 1996 through 2010, were analyzed {{to determine the}} characteristics of electromagnetic and electro-optical ducting in the boundary layer, an environmental condition that significantly affects the propagation of radio waves. A radio wave propagation duct is formed when there are significant gradients in the humidity and temperature profiles of the atmosphere. In this study, the frequency of occurrence and the characteristics (height, depth, and strength) of a duct are identified using the temperature and humidity profiles measured by dropsondes.

40|$|In {{coastal regions}} the {{presence}} of the marine boundary layer can significantly affect RF propagation. The relatively high specific humidity of the underlying "marine layer" creates elevated trapping layers in the radio refractivity structure. While direct sensing techniques provide good data, they are limited in their temporal and spatial scope. There is a need for assessing the three-dimensional (3 -D) time-varying refractivity structure. Recently published results (Gingras et al. [1]) indicate that matched-field processing methods hold promise for remotely sensing the refractive profile structure between an emitter and receive array. This paper is aimed at precisely quantifying the performance one can expect with matched-field processing methods for remote sensing of the refractivity structure using signal strength measurements from a single emitter to an array of radio receivers. The performance is determined via simulation and is evaluated as a function of: 1) the aperture of the receive array; 2) the refractivity profile model; and 3) the objective function used in the optimization. Refractivity profile estimation results are provided for a surface-based duct example, an <b>elevated</b> <b>duct</b> example, and a sequence of time-varying refractivity profiles.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{presence}} of elevated ducts in the lower atmosphere has an adverse effect on the inversion of GPS radio occultation data. The problem arises because the microwave refractivity within and below an <b>elevated</b> <b>duct</b> is no longer uniquely determined by the bending angle profile. Applying Abel inversion without a priori knowledge of the duct will introduce a negative bias in the retrieved refractivity profile within and below the duct. In this work, high vertical resolution radiosonde data are used to give a quantitative assessment of the characteristics and effects of ducts, including their frequency of occurrences, heights, and thicknesses at different latitudes and seasons. The negative bias from the Abel-retrieved refractivity profiles resulting from these ducts is also computed. The results give a strong indication that ducting in the lower troposphere is a frequent phenomenon over the tropics and midlatitudes. The ducts are shown to be predominantly caused by sharp changes in the vertical structure of water vapor. The majority of the ducts are found to be below 2 km, with a median duct layer thickness of about 100 m. The negative refractivity bias is shown to be largest below 2 km, with a median value of about 0. 5 - 1 % in the tropics and 0. 2 - 0. 5 % in midlatitudes. The bias is about a factor of 2 - 3 smaller between 2 to 3 km and is negligible above 4 km...|$|E

Oral and poster presentation: Seasonal variations of Shamal wind in the Arabian Gulf (A. Almehrezi, G. Shapiro, R. Thain, D. Priestley); HTC conference, Abu Dhabi, UAE, February 2013. Oral presentation: General synoptic situation over the Arabian Gulf (A. Almehrezi, D. Priestley) and the European Geosciences Union, Vienna, Austria, 27 April – 02 May 2014. Poster presentation: Seasonal variations of Summer Shamal days in the southern Arabian Gulf (A. Almehrezi, G. Shapiro, R. Thain). The propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves of frequencies above 100 MHz {{is affected by the}} existence and properties of the atmospheric duct, i. e. a horizontal layer in the lower atmosphere in which radio signals propagate more efficiently. Atmospheric ducts can be found {{in many parts of the}} world ocean including the Arabian Gulf. Ambient winds blowing from different directions bring air masses of different properties into the area and hence have a significant impact on the formation and strength of the atmospheric duct. However, little information is available on the long-term and intra-annual variability of wind and its effect on the ducting phenomenon in the Arabian Gulf region. This study addresses this gap by characterising the local meteorology, with a special emphasis on its effect on electromagnetic wave propagation. This study uses a new methodology to measure the persistence of Shamal wind, by considering the number of days associated with the specific wind pattern in addition to commonly used parameters such as the wind speed. In this study, thirty years (1981 - 2010) of observations and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data have been analyzed to identify a long-term trend and the intra-annual variability of various wind systems. Results clearly indicate that the Shamal (the northwesterly wind) is the most frequent meteorological feature over the region; therefore it has been investigated in greater detail. The Suhaili (southerly wind) is the second important wind which can occur any time of the year but it is less frequent than the Shamal. The Al-Nashi (cold and dry northeasterly wind) wind occurs only in December, January and February. The analysis shows that the wind strength and the frequency of Shamal days over the region have decreased over the last thirty years. Variations in the occurrence of summer and winter Shamal days were studied in relation to global atmospheric phenomena, and relationships have been established, synoptically and statistically between the frequency of Shamal days and large-scale atmospheric fluctuations. These links include atmospheric fluctuations over the Caspian Sea (a correlation coefficient of 0. 66) and Siberia (0. 69) in summer and Greenland (0. 51) and Western Europe (0. 65) in winter. The frequency of winter Shamal days during December, January and February are shown to be statistically related (a correlation coefficient of 0. 41) to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and (0. 49) the Arctic Oscillation (AO), as they influence the pathway of the westerly depression over the north Atlantic Ocean during the winter season. It is also shown that the decline in the number of Shamal days is linked to a decrease in the number of westerly depressions. The EM wave propagation has been examined using the Advanced Refraction Effects Prediction System (AREPS) model for different representative air masses. The radiosonde data from Abu Dhabi airport used in AREPS provided evidence of the general influence of each air mass. It was found that atmospheric ducting conditions and characteristics (height, thickness, and type) were variable in the lower part of the atmosphere (surface to 6000 m) as a result of changing air masses. The influence of the Shamal conditions develop an <b>elevated</b> <b>duct</b> at approximately 850 mb level. The Suhaili increases the thickness of the evaporation duct. In regards to the surface based and <b>elevated</b> <b>duct,</b> Suhaili and Al-Nashi provide standard atmospheric conditions. Land and sea breezes were mostly associated with the surface based duct and sometimes elevated the duct. Atmospheric ducting could extend the range of electromagnetic wave propagation above the usual range. Good knowledge of atmospheric duct characteristics enables the efficient assessment of the range of EM propagation, which is important for a number of practical applications, for example air traffic control and rescue operations. This could include the selection of the appropriate frequency and altitude of the electromagnetic wave device (e. g. radar and/or communication systems) operating with a frequency above 100 MHz to be trapped in the duct to cover long distances.

40|$|Ducting of {{microwave}} radiation {{is a common}} phenomenon over the oceans. The height and strength of the duct are controlling factors for radar propagation and must be determined accurately to assess propagation ranges. A surface evaporation duct commonly forms due to the large gradient in specific humidity just above the sea surface; a deeper surface-based or <b>elevated</b> <b>duct</b> frequently {{is associated with the}} sudden change in temperature and humidity across the boundary layer inversion. In April 1996 the U. K. Meteorological Office C- 130 Hercules research aircraft took part in the U. S. Navy Ship Antisubmarine Warfare Readiness/Effectiveness Measuring exercise (SHAREM- 115) in the Persian Gulf by providing meteorological support and making measurements for the study of electromagnetic and electro-optical propagation. The boundary layer structure over the Gulf is influenced strongly by the surrounding desert landmass. Warm dry air flows from the desert over the cooler waters of the Gulf. Heat loss to the surface results in the formation of a stable internal boundary layer. The layer evolves continuously along wind, eventually forming a new marine atmospheric boundary layer. The stable stratification suppresses vertical mixing, trapping moisture within the layer and leading to an increase in refractive index and the formation of a strong boundary layer duct. A surface evaporation duct coexists with the boundary layer duct. In this paper the authors present aircraft-and ship-based observations of both the surface evaporation and boundary layer ducts. A series of sawtooth aircraft profiles map the boundary layer structure and provide spatially distributed estimates of the duct depth. The boundary layer duct is found to have considerable spatial variability in both depth and strength, and to evolve along wind over distances significant to naval operations (∼ 100 km). The depth of the evaporation duct is derived from a bulk parameterization based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory using near-surface data taken by the C- 130 during low-level (30 m) flight legs and by ship-based instrumentation. Good agreement is found between the two datasets. The estimated evaporation ducts are found to be generally uniform in depth; however, localized regions of greatly increased depth are observed on one day, and a marked change in boundary layer structure resulting in merging of the surface evaporation duct with the deeper boundary layer duct was observed on another. Both of these cases occurred within exceptionally shallow boundary layers (≤ 100 m), where the mean evaporation duct depths were estimated to be between 12 and 17 m. On the remaining three days the boundary layer depth was between 200 and 300 m, and evaporation duct depths were estimated to be between 20 and 35 m, varying by just a few meters over ranges of up to 200 km. The one-way radar propagation factor is modeled for a case with a pronounced change in duct depth. The case is modeled first with a series of measured profiles to define as accurately as possible the refractivity structure of the boundary layer, then with a single profile collocated with the radar antenna and assuming homogeneity. The results reveal large errors in the propagation factor when derived from a single profile...|$|E

The three case studies examined are: warm air advection over dense pack ice causing strong <b>elevated</b> <b>ducting</b> and subrefraction, cold air advection over relatively open water causing shallow convection and normal refraction condi­tions, large scale subsidence in the western quadrants of an anticyclone leading to super-refraction and weak ducting. Developing synoptic scale cyclones adjacent to the MIZEX- 83 area often determined the airflow over the region. The observed large horizontal SST gradients were the dominant forcing mechanisms on surface layer stability. Trapping layers associated with subsidence inversions can be located on satellite imagery by assuming that stratiform clouds form immediately below the inversion. Uniform cloud and refraction layers were not common during MIZEX- 83 due to strong mesoscale variability. Factors affecting inversion height include subsidence and entrainment mixing.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{environmental}} impact on radio wave propagation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and coastal radar systems in the operational area of the Netherlands Coastguard, i. e., the exclusive economical zone (EEZ) of the Netherlands. In {{this part of the}} North Sea, the coastguard monitors marine traffic to maintain a safe and secure environment. For their situation awareness, they are depending on (Class A) AIS and (X-band) radar. However, the operators of these sensor systems often experience abnormal effects such as coverage gaps and different detection ranges for AIS and radar. An important and strongly fluctuating cause of these effects is {{the environmental impact}} on radio wave propagation. Therefore, the weather conditions on the North Sea and the impact of these different conditions are analysed and modelled. In general, five common propagation conditions are known: standard atmosphere, evaporation ducts, standard surface ducts, surface-based <b>ducts,</b> and <b>elevated</b> <b>ducts.</b> The effects of these conditions and their occurrences on the North Sea were studied for AIS and radar. It was found that <b>elevated</b> and surface <b>ducts</b> - most prominent during spring and summer - extend both AIS and radar detection ranges, whereas evaporation ducts - strongest at the end of summer - were found to only extend radar detection ranges. Standard atmospheric conditions lead, for both systems, to minimum detection ranges. The modelling in this thesis is a proof of concept for the coastguard to make a forecast of the coverage of their systems on a daily basis, by using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data. Such a daily forecast will support the coastguard in the deployment of mobile detection units, such as ships and aircraft. The modelling also enables operators to understand why targets appear either on AIS or radar, thus preventing that signals are wrongly considered false or suspicious...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a new time-domain wave propagator (TDWP) {{that was}} {{recently}} introduced, is compared against a frequency-domain {{one that has}} been in use for more than a decade. The new time-domain wave propagator is built by a two-dimensional (2 D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. The frequency-domain wave propagator is the Split-step Parabolic Equation (SSPE), which is the solution of (one-way) wave equation in parabolic form. These two techniques can be both used for different kinds of 2 D propagation problems. In this paper, ground wave problems, which are difficult to solve, have been taken into consideration in order to compare the methods and show their power. Assuming an azimuthal symmetry, ground wave propagation and surface and/or <b>elevated</b> <b>ducts</b> may be represented via transverse and/or longitudinal refractivity and boundary perturbations in 2 D space. The 2 D propagation space extends from x= 0 (bottom) to x→ ∞ (top), vertically and from z →- ∞ (left) to z → ∞ (right), horizontally. Pulse propagation is simulated in TDWP and while a moving window escorts the transmitted waveform {{from one end to the}} other end within the FDTD computation space, time histories are accumulated at chosen observation points. Any vertical and/or horizontal field profile at a desired frequency is extracted by applying off-line discrete Fourier transformation (DFT). On the other hand, a given vertical field profile is longitudinally propagated by moving back and forth between the transverse spatial and wavenumber domains in SSPE. The results of TDWP and SSPE are compared on different ducting and anti-ducting refractivity profiles and their agreement is presented. I...|$|R

Assessment of real-time propagation conditions is needed to accurately perform these radar, communication and electronic warfare functions. Anomalous propagation mechanisms, such as ducting, have a strong influence on the directional distribution and strength of EM waves. Many techniques have been employed to estimate the propagation environment, such as (1) using radar clutter return, (2) point to point transmission loss and phase measurements, (3) collection of meteorological data (temperature, humidity, etc.), and (4) GPS signal occultation. Rather than sensing the meteorological properties of the environment, signal transmission to and from a number of sources and receivers are used to build a picture of the electromagnetic environment and the propagation conditions. The sources and receivers can be distributed on UAVs to obtain a detailed EM “map” over large distances and a wide frequency band. The EM data {{can be used}} in parallel with meteorological data to enhance the real-time propagation model. Recent developments in commercially available small transmitters and receivers make the concept of outfitting large numbers of UAVs with EM sensors feasible and affordable. Propagation simulations were conducted using state-of-the-art commercial computational EM software. Various meteorological conditions were reproduced, and the loss characteristics for transmissions between networks of UAVs and ships simulated. Using the loss data, the gross real-time propagation conditions are estimated. It is shown that the presence of surface and <b>elevated</b> <b>ducts</b> can be identified using this method. Several operational issues (e. g., number of UAVs required, flight patterns, altitudes, data collection times, etc.) are also discussed. NPS CRUSE...|$|R

Endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting is a minimally invasive way of reducing this pressure and may be a useful adjunct to surgery in these patients. Methods: We prospectively reviewed a series of nine symptomatic patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis and relative contraindications to open surgery, who were managed by attempted endoscopic placement of a pancreatic stent. Results: Stents were successfully inserted endoscopically into the main or accessory duct in six patients and into a pseudocyst, transduodenally, in one patient. Of the two unsuccessful insertions, one proceeded to longitudinal pancreato-jejunostomy {{and in the other}} a stent was inserted at distal pancreatic cyst-jejunostomy. Median follow up was 21 months (range 14 – 43). In all eight cases with stent insertion there was rapid pain resolution, pain scores falling from 9 / 10 (8 – 10) to 2 (1 – 5) after 2 days (1 – 7). Associated symptoms of weight loss, nausea and vomiting settled in all eight cases. In one patient with a persistent pancreatic fistula, the fistula resolved. In the three with pseudocysts, the cysts resolved on computed tomography (CT) (one recurred). Five patients subsequently proceeded to stent removal after 6 months (5 – 23). In three of these, the stent was removed endoscopically, and replaced endoscopically in two cases, with pain resolution. Two patients underwent transduodenal pancreatic duct septectomy (one had stent change prior) and one proceeded to pseudocyst-gastrostomy, with pain resolution. The remaining three patients with stents in situ remain symptom-free. No patient suffered acute pancreatitis. Conclusions: In selected patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis, insertion of a pancreatic stent is a safe procedure, which can lead to rapid symptomatic control over the intermediate period. A significant proportion will need further intervention. P. J. Treacy and C. S. Worthle...|$|R

With unilateral ureteral obstruction in rabbits as the experimental model, {{the time course of}} alterations in renal function, clusterin mRNA accumulation, and concentrations of clusterin protein in serum, urine, and renal tissue were investigated. RBF, GFR, and renal concentrating ability (percent sodium reabsorption and urine osmolarity) all decreased (P < 0. 05) in the obstructed kidney from control values within 1 day of ureteral obstruction. Clusterin mRNA levels started to rise in the ipsilateral kidney within 12 h of ureteral obstruction and increased up to 10 -fold above control levels after 3 days of obstruction. Hybridization histochemistry showed that clusterin mRNA was initially detectable in collecting ducts and distal tubules within 12 h of ureteral obstruction. After 7 days of obstruction, increased accumulation of clusterin mRNA was also detectable in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Clusterin gene expression remained <b>elevated</b> in collecting <b>ducts</b> after 60 days of obstruction. Clusterin expression in the contralateral kidney was increased twofold over control values after 12 h of obstruction. No increase in clusterin mRNA accumulation was detectable after 24 h in the contralateral kidney. Total clusterin protein in the obstructed kidney increased from 0. 59 +/- 0. 66 (mean +/- 1 SD) to 2. 5 +/- 1. 3 micrograms after 7 days of ureteral obstruction (P < 0. 05).

40|$|In a {{companion}} study [Layton AT. A mathematical {{model of the}} urine concentrating mechanism in the rat renal medulla. I. Formulation and base-case results. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. (First published November 10, 2010). 10. 1152 /ajprenal. 00203. 2010] a region-based mathematical model was formulated for the urine concentrating mechanism in the renal medulla of the rat kidney. In the present study, we investigated model sensitivity {{to some of the}} fundamental structural assumptions. An unexpected finding is that the concentrating capability of this region-based model falls short of the capability of models that have radially homogeneous interstitial fluid at each level of only the inner medulla (IM) or of both the outer medulla and IM, but are otherwise analogous to the region-based model. Nonetheless, model results reveal the functional significance of several aspects of tubular segmentation and heterogeneity: 1) the exclusion of ascending thin limbs that reach into the deep IM from the collecting duct clusters in the upper IM promotes urea cycling within the IM; 2) the high urea permeability of the lower IM thin limb segments allows their tubular fluid urea content to equilibrate with the surrounding interstitium; 3) the aquaporin- 1 -null terminal descending limb segments prevent water entry and maintain the transepithelial NaCl concentration gradient; 4) a higher thick ascending limb Na+ active transport rate in the inner stripe augments concentrating capability without a corresponding increase in energy expenditure for transport; 5) active Na+ reabsorption from the collecting <b>duct</b> <b>elevates</b> its tubular fluid urea concentration. Model calculations predict that these aspects of tubular segmentation and heterogeneity promote effective urine concentrating functions...|$|R
