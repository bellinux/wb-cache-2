50|$|The wheat weevil (Sitophilus granarius), {{also known}} as the grain weevil or <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> occurs {{all over the world and}} is a common pest in many places. It can cause {{significant}} damage to harvested stored grains and may drastically decrease crop yields. The females lay many eggs and the larvae eat the inside of the grain kernels.|$|E
50|$|Early {{detection}} of infestation is difficult. As S. zeamais larvae {{feed on the}} interior of individual grains, often leaving only the hulls, a flour-like grain dust, mixed with frass is evident. Infested grains contain holes through which adults have emerged. A possible indication of infestation is grain, when placed in water, floating to the surface. Ragged holes in individual grains, similar to damage caused by the rice weevil and <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> may indicate infestation. In large stores of grain, an increase in temperature may be detected. The most obvious sign of infestation {{is the emergence of}} adults. One study recorded, 5 weeks after infestation, the emergence of 100 adults per kg per day.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{the first part of}} the study was to develop a {{simplified}} near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy method for detecting insect larvae in individual wheat kernels. Discriminant analysis, based on Mahalanobis distances calculated from log 1 /R data at only four discrete wavelengths, yielded better results for classification of sound and insect infested wheat kernels than principal component analysis (PCA) using the spectral region from 1100 to 1900 nm. This simplified technique was then used to detect 3 - and 4 -week-old larvae of <b>granary</b> and maize <b>weevils</b> in wheat kernels.

40|$|Graduation date: 1959 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the performance of four species of stored grain beetles in competition at three levels of moisture and temperature. The insects used in these tests were the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> the rice weevil, the saw-toothed grain beetle and the red flour beetle. The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 90, 80, and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and at moisture levels of 15, 12, and 9 percent moisture content in two varieties of commercial wheat. Redmond variety commercial feed wheat was used for the majority of these tests. Several of the tests were duplicated using Idaed variety seed wheat. The competition studies were designed to test the performance of one species of grain beetle when reared in the presence of one or two other species. The procedure used was to obtain 50 adult insects of each species from stock cultures. These insects were picked at random and introduced into 250 gram samples of wheat in one pint containers and allowed to remain for one week. The initial adult population was then removed and the adult progeny were counted periodically to determine the size and time of appearance of the first generation. The following combinations of insects were tested: 1. <b>Granary</b> <b>weevil</b> and saw-toothed grain beetle 2. <b>Granary</b> <b>weevil</b> and red flour beetle 3. Saw-toothed grain beetle and red flour beetle 4. <b>Granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> saw-toothed grain beetle and red flour beetle 5. Rice weevil and saw-toothed grain beetle 6. Rice weevil and red flour beetle In addition to these combinations, all species of insects were reared alone in each test in order to compare the performance of the insects when in pure culture and when in competitive situations with the other species. The rice weevil was the best competitor of the four species and was less influenced by the presence of other species of beetles. The rice weevil has a wide range of temperature and moisture tolerance and, though considered a tropical species, it is a common and successful pest of stored grain in the Pacific Northwest. The <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> was a good competitor because of its capacity to attack whole grains but did riot do as well as the rice weevil, probably because of its lower reproductive rate and longer life cycle. The <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> and the rice weevil were well adjusted to the conditions of these tests because of their ability as primary feeders in whole grain. Competition between weevils and bran bugs (the sawtoothed grain beetle and the red flour beetle) usually favored the bran bugs since the weevils chewed up the grain and made food material available to the bran bugs. In competition with weevils, the bran bugs usually appeared earlier than the former but ordinarily had smaller populations. In competition between bran bugs, the red flour beetle was almost always the dominant species. This was because of the ability of the red flour beetle to attack whole wheat grains and because of its extensive predation of the eggs and pupae of the saw-toothed grain beetle. The saw-toothed grain beetle and the red flour beetle usually produced larger populations {{in the presence of the}} rice weevil than when with the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil.</b> Where conditions of high temperature and moisture were present in the grain, mold often formed. The presence of the mold may have been favorable to the two species of bran bugs. It has been observed that when the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> or the rice weevil is reared alone under high moisture conditions, there is considerable mold growth. When, however, the weevils are reared in the presence of one or two species of bran bugs, little or no mold is found. It is not known if the bran buns actually feed ori the mold but the results of these tests indicate that both species of bran bugs either feed on the mold or in some way inhibit its formation in grain at high moisture and. temperature levels. This work was performed as part of regional project WM- 16 (maintaining marketability of stored wheat through the control of insects) and was conducted under an assistantship granted by Oregon State College, Department of Entomology, Corvallis, Oregon...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} damage, insect infestation and storage conditions on seed viability of spring wheat were studied by three known tests, laboratory germination, greenhouse growth, and tetrazolium staining, {{so that the}} relationship of these tests could be discerned to facilitate seed testing work. Mechanical damage was induced by threshing, insect infestation was accomplished by inoculation of <b>granary</b> <b>weevils,</b> and storage conditions were provided by simulated climatic zones around the world, i. e. tropical (hot-wet), arctic (coId-wet), desert (hot-dry) and temperate, Seed moisture content reached an equilibrium under tropical conditions with three weeks to 18 percent and desert conditions within three months to six percent. Under temperate conditions, seed gained moisture gradually to 12 percent {{at the end of}} six months, while under arctic conditions, seed took up moisture rapidly in the first month and then only gradually to 19 percent in six months. Seed moisture was not greatly affected by mechanical damage and insect infestation. Seed viability was reduced rapidly under tropical conditions, gradually under arctic conditions, and slightly under temperate and desert conditions for six months. Mechanical damage and insect infestation caused a substantial decrease under all the conditions studied. Both mechanical damage and insect infestation increased abnormal seedlings and internal injuries, and decreased seedling vigor. Results from laboratory germination and greenhouse growth tests were comparable for all the treatments. The results of tetrazolium and germination tests in the laboratory or greenhouse were highly correlated. Regression equations for predicting germination percentages from results of tetrazolium tests were calculated for each storage condition and treatment...|$|R

Weevil-infested kernels were X-rayed for {{detection}} of hidden endosperm damage which is connected with the repro-ductive cycle of the studied insect pest. Digital analysis of infested grain roentgenograms was used to determine the mass loss in wheat kernels. Infestation rate was tested in five periods: zero (control), 5, 10, 15 and 20 days from the moment of infestation. A parabolic dependence of the mass loss on infestation time was found. To determine the mass losses connected with insect growth, a new algorithm was developed, consisting of two steps. In the first step, the volume of a single loss was calculated using the grey scale.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} insect infestation on areas of heating in stored grain, and to demonstrate the ability of four species of insects to initiate or promote the spread of these heating areas. The four insects used were the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> Sitophilus granarius (L.), the lesser grain borer Rhizopertha dominica (F.), the saw-toothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Hbst.). All four of these insects are common pests of stored grain. Heating was initiated by adding moisture to a small portion of a confined mass of wheat. The term hot spot was used in reference to areas of the grain mass that showed a rise in temperature above that of the surrounding grain. Hot spots due to the growth of fungi on the moistened grain were referred to as fungus hot spots. A device was designed and constructed in which a small hot spot could be started and observed visually and electronically. It consisted of a wooden box of about one cubic foot capacity with two glass sides and an internal system of thermocouples and humidity indicators. Ten of these boxes were in operation during a period of two years in 18 laboratory experiments. A larger system of thermocouples and humidity indicators was installed in a Butler bin at the Oregon State University Entomology Farm in which 600 bushels of wheat were utilized in four different experiments. Hard white wheat was used in all experiments, and test insects were obtained from laboratory cultures. It was observed that fungus hot spots reached a peak of heating at room temperature about two weeks after moisture was added. Heating was confined to the small mass of grain that was moistened by the addition of water when no insects were present, and did not spread to the surrounding grain mass. The temperature declined rapidly unless additional moisture was forced into adjacent areas of the grain mass to start a second area of heating. Effects of insects on fungus hot spots varied according to the species of insect present. The <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> demonstrated the greatest ability, of the four insects tested, to promote the spread of a fungus hot spot. Hot spots involving the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> either by itself or in combination with other insects, expanded until most of the wheat in the laboratory boxes was involved. The lesser grain borer demonstrated an ability to promote the spread of a fungus hot spot almost equal to that of the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> but required a longer period of time. The red flour beetle and the saw-toothed grain beetle failed to promote the spread of a fungus hot spot, and heating declined as rapidly in their presence as without them. Field experiments on a larger scale likewise showed the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> to be superior to the saw-toothed grain beetle in promoting the spread of fungus hot spots. Higher temperatures were recorded in the field experiments than in the laboratory experiments but heating was confined to the small mass of moistened grain when granary weevils were not present...|$|E

40|$|The acetone, ethanol, {{methanol}} {{and water}} extracts of bitter gourd, karanja, mehedi, and urmoi, leaf and seed/bark were evaluated for their growth inhibition, and grain protection effect against <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sitophilus granarius L. The highest reduction {{in number of}} adults was in urmoi followed by karanja, bitter gourd and mehedi extracts. Extracts of all the four plants showed grain protective effects up to 30 DAT, though the effects of different plant extracts lost gradually {{with the increase in}} duration. In most of the cases the extracts of ethanol were more effective than those of other three solvents. The seed extracts were more effective than leaf. Efficacy of the extracts increased proportionally with the increase in doses and decreases proportionally with the increase in time. The extracts did not show any adverse effect on germination capability of wheat seeds even after 3 months of treatments...|$|E
40|$|The larval and pupal {{parasitoid}} Lariophagus distinguendus Forster (Pteromalidae) is {{a potential}} candidate for the biological control of the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> Sitophilus granarius L. and other stored product pests that mostly prefer the dry conditions of a storage environment. To predict whether parasitoids will remain within the dry storage environment after release, experiments with L. distinguendus were performed in a humidity gradient chamber. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} time that humidity preference was examined directly for a parasitoid species. Regardless of experience, parasitoids significantly preferred drier areas in the order 32. 5 % (most preferred), 53 %, 75. 5 %, and 97. 5 % r. h. (least preferred). This indicates that humidity is used as cue for host habitat preference. When used as natural enemy against stored product pests this preference probably will retain L. distinguendus within the storage environment after their release...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{generally}} accepted that stored grain insects are food opportunists and, when originally {{made the transition}} to manmade storage facilities, came from natural reservoirs like bird or rodent nests. This {{may not be true}} for Sitophilus granarius. Among all stored-product insects, the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> S. granarius is the only species never recorded outside of storage facilities. Anatomical, physiological, and behavioural aspects of recent and hypothetical ancestral species in the genus Sitophilus are presented and discussed in terms of adaptation to the anthropogenic storage of grain. Full development inside the host kernel, endosymbioses with bacteria, and the reduction in flight activity to prevent water loss in a dry environment can be regarded as pre-adaptations for the evolution of a full synanthropic grain pest of cosmopolitan distribution. Faunistic, archaeological, and historical evidences of the pestâs origin and spread in conjunction with early agriculture are reviewed to support a hypothesis of a co-evolutionary event with the dawn of Neolithic agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{automatic}} recognition algorithm {{was developed}} and tested for detection of certain defects or contaminants in X-ray images of agricultural commodities. Testing of the algorithm on wheat kernels infested with larvae of the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sitophilus granarius (L.) yielded comparable results to those obtained by human subjects evaluating digitized X-ray film images (14. 4 % overall error vs. 15. 6 % for human subjects). Further tests on X-ray images of olives infested with the Olive Fly, Bactrocera oleae (L.), yielded a total error of 12 % for large infestations and over 50 % for the smallest infestations with false positive results below 10 %. Testing of alternate training strategies showed that {{for this type of}} algorithm, which uses a form of discriminant analysis with a generally ââfuzzyâ â decision boundary, best results are obtained when training with samples that map far away from the bound-ary, then applying the derived decision function to all samples to be classified...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oil (EO) from Hyptis suaveolens L. (Lamiaceae) was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and by gas chromatography/ electron impact mass spectroscopy (GC/EIMS), and sixty-six constituents were identified. The H. suaveolens EO contains sabinene (34 %), Î²-caryophyllene (11. 2 %), terpinolene (10. 7 %) Î²-pinene (8. 2 %), limonene (5. 8 %), and 4 -terpineol (2. 5 %) as major constituents. Moreover, H. suaveolens EO and its major constituents were evaluated for their repellent activity against adults of the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> Sitophilus granarius (L.) (Coleoptera Dryophthoridae) in Petri dish tests and in pitfall bioassays. Data showed that H. suaveolens EO possess a noticeable repellent activity against S. granarius in both testing methods. Furthermore, in all trials good repellence rates of terpinolene, Î²-pinene and sabinene were found, in particular at lower dosages. The possibility to incorporate these compounds into packaging materials of foodstuffs, {{as well as}} to increase their repellence activity in appropriate formulations, is discusse...|$|E
40|$|Many stored product {{insect pests}} are termed "freeze-intolerant" because they cannot survive ice {{formation}} in their extracellular body fluid. In grain silos, the progressive decrease in temperature permits the acclimation of insects and enhances their cold tolerance. The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the influence of the concentration of the ice-nucleating-active bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (10, 100 and 1000 ppm), temperature and duration of sub-zero exposure on the cold tolerance of the <b>granary</b> <b>weevil</b> Sitophilus granarius (L.) and the saw-toothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.). After an application of 1000 ppm of powdered P. syringae to grain, the mortality of S. granarius and O. surinamensis was increased after 24 -h exposure to - 4 degrees C. Higher mortality was observed after exposure to colder temperatures and a dose-response relationship was evident. At near-zero (- 4 to 0 degrees C) negative temperatures, no dose response was observed, and the mortality in treated grain was the same as that in untreated grain. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In the {{laboratory}} of the Institute preliminery investigations of Yugoslav pyrethrum preparation âEmulcidâwere carried out. âEmulcidâ contains 7. 11 % the active matter of pyrethrum and, 35, 7 % of piperonyl butoxide. For these investigations the following insects were used: Sitophilus granarius L.; <b>granary</b> <b>weevil,</b> S. oryzae L., - rice weevil, Tribolium confusum Duv. - confused flour beetle, Gnathocerus cornutus Fabr. - the broad horned flour beetle and Rhizopertha, dominica F. - the lesser grain borer. Test insects were reared through 12 - 20 generations in our laboratory {{and during that}} time they had no contact with any chemicals used to control insects. We applied âEmulcidâ in doses of 5 ppm and 10 ppm directly upon wheat containing 14, 9 % humidity, upon barley containing 14, 55 % humidity, and upon maize containing 20, 46 % humidity. The efficacy of âEmulcidâ is shown in Table 1. The achieved results in Table 1. show an excellent action of âEmulcidâ upon test insects. On the treated cereals too no progeny of test insects was developed even 29 weeks after the experiment had been arranged...|$|E
