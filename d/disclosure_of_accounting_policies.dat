40|$|Although the {{intention}} of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is not to permit choices in the accounting treatment of similar transactions and events, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) still contain various choices of accounting treatment. Different accounting alternatives for similar transactions limit the comparability of financial information.

There are two general views mentioned in the article. The view of banks, which can refine their conditions, and, above all, adapt themselves to potential risks, which leads to an improvement of their own risk management and their refinancing conditions. The view of companies, whose good ratings, no matter whether arranged by banks or by external rating agencies, imply appropriate interest terms. The influencing factors for the rating are known by many companies. Hence, in practice it is often a target to influence these factors and key figures positively. A successful implementation of the findings of the conducted survey would help companies to improve their rating. The main part of the article describes the results extracted for this purpose from the survey which was carried out between 28 November. 2008 and 28 February 2009. The analysis of the survey identified contemporary allocation of documents, completeness of documents, actual financial + profit planning, <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> and extensive company documentation as the five best possibilities for companies to improve their ratings.

The primary objective {{of the study is}} to analyse the financial characteristics of firms that provide extensive disclosures, and assess the financial impact of their motives, such as for example the need to raise equity finance. The study examines the financial attributes of firms that disclose information about key accounting issues including risk exposure, changes in <b>accounting</b> <b>policies,</b> use <b>of</b> international financial reporting standards and hedging practices. Firms are inclined to disclose accounting information in order to assure the market participants that their <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> are consistent with the accounting regulation and meet the information needs of their stakeholders. The study shows that in order to raise finance in the capital and debt markets, firms tend to provide extensive accounting disclosures. Firms that provide informative accounting disclosures appear to display higher size, growth and leverage measures. The findings also show that the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> sensitive <b>accounting</b> information has not adversely affected firms' profitability. In fact, firms that provide detailed accounting disclosures tend to exhibit higher profitability. The implementation of international financial reporting standards enhances the quality and the comparability of financial statements; hence it promotes consistency and reliability in financial reporting and facilitates companies in raising capital internationally. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.
