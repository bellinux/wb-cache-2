25|$|The port of Las Palmas {{is first}} in freight {{traffic in the}} islands, while the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port with {{approximately}} 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Spanish government publication Statistical Yearbook of State Ports. Similarly, {{it is the second}} port in Spain as regards ship traffic, only surpassed by the Port of Algeciras Bay. The port's facilities include a border inspection post (BIP) approved by the European Union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> or exports to countries outside the European Economic Area. The port of Los Cristianos (Tenerife) has the greatest number of passengers recorded in the Canary Islands, followed by the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The Port of Las Palmas is the third port in the islands in passengers and first in number of vehicles transported.|$|E
25|$|Besides air transport, Tenerife has two {{principal}} maritime ports: the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Puerto de Santa Cruz), which serves the various capitals of the Canary Islands, {{especially those in}} the west; and the Port of Los Cristianos (Puerto de Los Cristianos), which serves the various island capitals of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The first port also has passenger services, which connect with the mainland port of Cádiz (and vice versa). There are plans to build a new port in the south of the island, in Granadilla de Abona, and in another in the west, at Fonsalía. The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port in the Canary Islands with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Statistical Yearbook of the State Ports 2006 (the latest of which is changing). Following this report is the largest port number of passengers recorded. Similarly, the second port of Spain moving ship and loaded into cars, only surpassed by the Port of Algeciras Bay. In the port's facilities include a border inspection post (BIP) approved by the European Union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> or exports to countries outside the European Economic Area.|$|E
30|$|T-test {{comparisons}} between excluded and included observations revealed that more male than female respondents had been excluded. Furthermore, {{children of immigrants}} <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>country</b> were also disproportionately excluded while {{a higher proportion of}} non-immigrant students were kept. As boys and students <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>country</b> tend to be disadvantaged in school, there may exist a correlation between marginalization and exclusion from the data set.|$|R
30|$|Children of {{immigrants}} were in turn separated {{on whether the}} student was born outside of the country of survey or not. Students born {{in the country of}} survey were categorized as having immigrant background if both their parents were foreign born. If both parents were born outside of Europe, they were classified as having TC-parents (foreign background, parents <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>country),</b> otherwise as EU-parents (foreign background, parents from Europe). Finally, children {{of immigrants}} born outside of the country of survey were classified as TC-born (foreign born, <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>country)</b> or EU-born (foreign born, from Europe) depending on their regions of birth.|$|R

2500|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that bilateral agreements like the FTA will lead to trade creation between the parties directly involved, but will also cause trade diversion <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> offsetting any benefits. Bilateral agreements may also undermine multilateral agreements such as those associated with the [...] World Trade Organization. Partly {{as a result of}} these factors, the estimates of benefits produced by the CIE and relied on by the government were disputed by most economists who made submissions to the Senate Committees inquiring into the topic, some of whom concluded that the agreement would reduce Australia's economic welfare.|$|E
2500|$|With Congress {{blocking}} further contra aid, the Reagan administration {{sought to}} arrange funding and military supplies {{by means of}} third countries and private sources. Between 1984 and 1986, $34 million <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> and $2.7 million from private sources were raised this way. The secret contra assistance was run by the National Security Council, with officer Lt. Col. Oliver North in charge. With the third-party funds, North created an organization called The Enterprise, which served as the secret arm of the NSC staff and had its own airplanes, pilots, airfield, ship, operatives, and secret Swiss bank accounts. It also received assistance from personnel from other government agencies, especially from CIA personnel in Central America. This operation functioned, however, {{without any of the}} accountability required of U.S. government activities. The Enterprise's efforts culminated in the Iran–Contra Affair of 1986–1987, which facilitated contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to Iran.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 {{report to}} the U.N. Secretary-General, Cuba {{acknowledged}} the authorization of medicines, though stated that they were subject to severe restrictions and complicated procedures. Cuba is obliged to make payments in cash and in advance, and is precluded from obtaining credit funding, even from private sources. The sale and transportation of the goods require licenses to be obtained for each transaction. Cuba cannot use its own merchant fleet for transporting these goods, but has {{to make use of}} vessels <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> primarily the United States. Payments are made through banks in third countries, since direct banking relationships are prohibited. The Cuban delegation concluded that restrictions on importing medical products were [...] "so extensive that they make such imports virtually impossible". The World Health organization/PAHO and UNFPA concurred that it was impossible for Cuba to purchase equipment, medicines and laboratory materials produced by the United States or covered by United States patents, even though those products were purchased through multilateral cooperation. Cuba was not able to purchase the isotope I-125 that is used to treat eye cancer in children. The companies manufacturing reagents and equipment are 70 per cent United States owned, which makes it difficult to purchase necessary medical equipment and other items.|$|E
