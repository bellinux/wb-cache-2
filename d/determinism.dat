5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and <b>determinism</b> are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and <b>determinism,</b> whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, <b>determinism,</b> and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, <b>determinism,</b> and space and time).|$|E

At an epistemological level coevolution offers a powerful logic for transcending {{environmental and social}} <b>determinisms</b> and developing a cross-disciplinary approach {{in the study of}} socio-ecological systems. We identify four consistent stories emerging out of coevolutionary studies in ecological economics, concerning: environmental degradation and development failure in peripheral regions; the lock-in of unsustainable production-consumption patterns; the vicious cycle between human efforts to control undesirable micro-organisms and the evolution of these organisms; and the adaptive advantages of other-regarding, cooperative behaviors and institutions. We identify challenges in the conceptualization of coevolutionary relationships in relation to: the interaction between different hierarchical levels of evolution; the role of space and social power; uneven rates of change and crises. We conclude with the political implications of a coevolutionary perspective based on the premises of pragmatism. Evolution Coevolution Socio-ecological systems Development...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{academic}} research on the developments of EU Justice and Home Affairs (EU JHA) tends to overlook {{the role played by}} technologies in their relations with classical ‘human’ and institutional actors. This is particularly problematic because in official discourses, technologies are requested, designed, and built as cornerstones of European security and its external dimension. Still, apart from ‘technicalities’, their use and design are generally assumed as politics-free. On the contrary, this contribution brings technologies to the forefront of the research and reframes them in terms of socio-technical assemblages. From this perspective, it analyses the role of the 2011 EU Passenger Name Record project in the making of European security and its external dimension. The lesson learned is that human institutions are neither the only players nor the passive victims of technological <b>determinisms.</b> Rather, focusing on a socio-technical assemblage means to inquire the effective participation of different actors and thus critically discuss the making of European security in terms of politics...|$|R

5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic <b>determinism).</b> Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E

5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative <b>determinism</b> is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative <b>determinism</b> is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Recent careful {{examinations}} of American quarantines placed on incoming migrants {{have found that}} health officials were potent carries of bigotries rooted in the larger society; but usually historians have not paid sufficient attention to the complex challenges facing quarantine units in action. By examining the work of quarantine health officials dealing with migrating Jews from East Central Europe this analytical narrative seeks to show in detail important structural circumstances within which acts of bigotry manifested themselves between the 1890 s and 1920 s. The narrative also has a larger agenda. Connections between public health quarantines and bio-cultural <b>determinisms</b> have long participated {{in the construction of}} public enemies. For instance in the 1980 s, {{during the early years of}} the AIDS panic in the United States, public health officials could take for granted a citizenry that had long trusted in abstract empirical scientific knowledge and, for half a century, in the disease curing power of pharmacology 2 ̆ 7 s sulfa drugs and other antibiotics. Even so, in the first moments of panic all sorts of calls for screens and quarantine impacted on public policy discussions in ways reminiscent of the years between the 1890 s and 1920 s. During those years biological <b>determinisms</b> from the past had remained in the saddle. Even as modern public health programmes were becoming dramatically successful in fighting disease, they remained affected by hierarchies of bio-cultural notions, especially in apprehensions about immigrants as agents of dangerous contagious diseases. That is one reason why this article focuses on Jews. The other reason derives from the evidence about Jews and disease in the places and times covered by this study. To be sure, there were other quarantines, involving, for example, resident Chinese and Italians; and in the months after the First World War potential incomers from Italy were at least as much an object of concern among American advocates of immigration restriction as were the Jews in Poland. But, in part, because of a typhus epidemic in that war-torn country, the association between disease and bio-cultural assumptions about Jews retained its traditional particularity in Western Europe and in the United States...|$|R
40|$|In La {{condition}} postmoderne, Jean-Francois Lyotard {{explains how}} science {{has shifted from}} a representational to a non-representational epistemology without losing cognitive value: {{the purpose of a}} scientific work is no longer to produce an adequate model of some exterior referent, but rather to generate new 2 ̆ 2 moves 2 ̆ 2 that may destabilize knowledge, but also promote new ideas. The purpose of this dissertation is to map 2 ̆ 2 the postmodern condition 2 ̆ 2 in the fictional works of two writers, Georges Perec and Italo Calvino, who consistently produced open systems similar to the 2 ̆ 2 antimodels 2 ̆ 2 which Lyotard argues have been made available by the new scientific epistemology. Their texts are examined as explorations of logical possibilities consequent to new spatial orderings. They make manifest cultural modes of ordering and imply that our perceptual grids, like the worlds which they construe, are culturally contingent. ^ My analysis shows how Calvino and Perec organize their narrative works either as combinatory structures restlessly pursuing unrealized possibilities or as rigid grids suddenly subverted by the injection of the aleatory (the Lucretian device of the 2 ̆ 2 clinamen 2 ̆ 2 is an epistemological tool integral to their literary systems). Whenever attempting to describe 2 ̆ 2 the real, 2 ̆ 2 the space of their pages is either fragmented in islands of local <b>determinisms,</b> or saturated by aporetical descriptions which attempt to grasp infinities within infinities. The paradoxes of open series, heterotopias and rhizomatic taxonomies bring the two writers to reconsider those spatial categories which constitute the basis of our epistemology. ^ Like sand through a screen, the empirical world escapes the grid of even the most diaphanous poetic taxonomies by Perec and Calvino. Yet, despite the constant failure of their hermeneutical projects, the two authors never give up weaving their literary topographies. In so doing, their narrative is symptomatic of the postmodern condition, as described by Lyotard. The notion of system, the possibility of arranging data according to a master-narrative, must be reconsidered in order to accommodate phenomena such as entropy and local <b>determinisms.</b> ...|$|R
