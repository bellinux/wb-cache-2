The disparity in wages between primary and secondary workers, according to labour market segmentation theory, is not provided by workers characteristics, but rather by job characteristics. A standard way to <b>assess</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> is by looking at the estimated coefficients in a standard regression for comparable workers across different labour market segments. In an attempt to avoid arbitrary modeling choices, we deploy mixture regression methods which allow for endogenous determination of the number of existing labour market segments.

Firewood extraction pressure was remarkably greater in the LF near the major settlement than in the UF. Local conservation initiatives and the interventions of an ecotourism project have had visible impacts on firewood use by the community and on tourism enterprises. Although alarming, the rate of woody biomass extraction was nonetheless lower than the annual productivity rate of the stands.

40|$|Despite {{the success}} of antivirals in {{preventing}} clinically overt CMV disease in cardiac allograft recipients, sub-clinical active CMV infection remains a major concern because of its association with allograft rejection and vasculopathy. The measurement of CMV specific T-cell responses is a promising approach to <b>assessing</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b> For simplicity, class-I MHC/peptide-multimers staining CD 8 T-cells directly are often used but this ignores a much wider range of responses including the whole CD 4 T-cell compartment. CD 4 T-cells, however, were recently shown to be critical to reducing CMV load early after transplantation. To determine how extensive T-cell responses to CMV are, the responses to two dominant CMV proteins, IE- 1 and pp 65, were dissected in detail accounting for T-cell lineage, frequencies, epitope recognition and changes over {{time in more than}} 25 heart transplant recipients. Cross-sectional results from over 30 healthy CMV-carriers were analyzed for comparison. Responses were unexpectedly complex, with considerable inter-individual variation in terms of dominance, breadth, and recognized epitopes. Whereas the use of MHC/peptide-multimers for clinical CD 8 T-cell response monitoring alone can be justified in some situations, short term T-cell activation combined with intracellular cytokine staining was clearly found to be of more general usefulness. The performance of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL- 2 as single read-outs in identifying activated T-cells was examined and confirmed that the frequently used IFN-gamma was best suited. These results should be used to inform the design of clinically applicable and diagnostically useful approaches to monitoring CMV specific responses in heart transplant recipients...|$|R

It was also found that agency was not properly grafted into real estate profession while issues relating to ethics, misconduct and conflicts are rife among practitioners. In addition, it was found that institutions’ intervention mechanism in ethics and misconduct among practicing surveyors is weak and ineffective.

Even though producers are implementing these strategies, they are still missing target weights and receiving substantial discounts. To <b>assess</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> we must first determine the accuracy of sampling methods producers use to estimate the mean weight of the population. The standard sampling procedure that has been adapted by many producers is to weigh a subsample of pigs in multiple pens (i. e., 5 pigs from 6 pens). Using a computer program developed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), {{we were able to}} generate 10, 000 sample means for different sampling procedures on 3 different datasets. Using this program we evalu- ated taking: (1) a completely random sample of 10 to 200 pigs from the barn, (2) an increasing number of pigs per pen from 1 to 15 or the entire pen, and (3) increasing the number of pens until all pens had been sampled in the 3 separate datasets. This allowed us to provide tables for producers to decide on the sampling method and size necessary to achieve an acceptable estimation of pig weight in the barn. The analysis indicated that the number of pigs can be decreased by increasing the number of pens; however, the confidence interval (range in which 95 % of weight estimates would fall) was still as high as 23 lb (242 to 265 lb) when only 30 pigs were sampled. Increasing the number of pens reduced the range between the upper and lower confidence interval, but not enough to make increasing pen sample size a practical means of estimating mean pig weight of the barn. Other methods of analysis must be designed to improve the accuracy of estimating pig mean weight in a facility other than random sampling of pigs within the barn...|$|R
40|$|Variability of {{transgene}} expression levels {{resulting from}} gene silencing is considered as ahindrance {{to the successful}} application of plant genetic engineering. Towards alleviatinggene silencing, I decided to screen for novel genes involved in transgene silencing and toinvestigate how these genes regulate plant development. Genes encoding putative chromatinremodeling factors, especially those including a SET domain, were selected as candidatetargets. A bioinformatic analysis of the Arabidopsis SET genes (AtSET) was performed andthese genes were classified into 6 groups based on the domain architecture. RNA interference (RNAi) vectors were constructed for ~ 20 AtSET genes and wereintroduced into both wild type lines and transgenic lines silenced for a GFP reporter gene. Surprisingly, altered developmental phenotypes were only observed for three constructs,raising questions as {{to the effectiveness of}} the RNAi approach for the chosen Arabidopsissystem. To <b>assess</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> I targeted a phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene using the sameRNAi approach. Inactivation of PDS renders plant a readily identifiable phenotype. Whereasthe RNAi penetrance in Arabidopsis can be very high, the expressivity of RNAi in varioustissues and among different plants can vary dramatically. Contradictory to previous reports,I found that there is correlation between transcript level and silencing phenotype. Possiblereasons for this discrepancy are discussed. No apparent correlation between transgene copynumber and RNAi phenotypes was observed. Among the three RNAi constructs that caused an abnormal development inArabidopsis, K- 23 which targets SuvR 3 has the highest expressivity and could reactivate asilenced GFP locus. SuvR 3 RNAi lines were selfed for six generations and were screenedfor morphological phenotypes. Abnormal number of flower organs, loss of viability of malegametophytes, and decreased seedling germination percentage were found in SuvR 3 RNAilines. A progressive increase in both severity and frequency of abnormal phenotypes wereseen in subsequent generations, suggesting an epigenetic regulatory mechanism involvedwith SuvR 3. Alternative splicing of SuvR 3 was also observed in most of Arabidopsis tissues. One of the protein isoforms, SuvR 3, lacks 16 amino acids within the highly conserved SETdomain.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{life-cycle}} cost {{is a primary}} concern during the development, construction, operation, and decommissioning of DOE systems and facilities. An effective tool {{that can be used}} to control these costs, beginning with the design stage, is called a reliability, availability, maintainability, and inspectability analysis or, simply, RAMI for short. In 1997, RAMI technology was introduced to the Savannah River Site with applications at the conceptual design stage beginning with the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) Project and later extended to the Commercial Light Water Reactor (CLWR) Tritium Extraction Facility (TEF) Project. More recently it has been applied to the as-build Water Treatment Facilities designed for ground water environmental restoration. This new technology and database was applied to the assessment of balance-of-plant systems for the APT Conceptual Design Report. Initial results from the Heat Removal System Assessment revealed that the system conceptual design would cause the APT to fall short of its annual production goal. Using RAM technology to immediately <b>assess</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> it was demonstrated that the product loss could be gained back by upgrading the system's chiller unit capacity at a cost of less than $ 1. 3 million. The reclaimed production is worth approximately $ 100 million. The RAM technology has now been extended to assess the conceptual design for the CLWR-TEF Project. More specifically, this technology and database is being used to translate high level availability goals into lower level system design requirements that will ensure the TEF meets its production goal. Results, from the limited number of system assessments performed to date, have already been used to modify the conceptual design for a remote handling system, improving its availability to the point that a redundant system, with its associated costs of installation and operation may no longer be required. RAMI results were also used to justify the elimination of a metal uranium bed in the design of a water cracker system, producing a significant reduction in the estimated construction and operating costs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the tensionless contact problem of an Euler–Bernoulli beam of finite length {{resting on a}} two-parameter Pasternak-type {{foundation}} is investigated. Owing to the tensionless character of the contact, the beam may lift-off the foundation and the point where contact ceases and detachment begins, named contact locus, needs be <b>assessed.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> a one-dimensional free boundary problem is dealt with. An extra condition, {{in the form of}} a homogeneous second-order equation in the displacement and its derivatives, is demanded to set the contact locus and it gives the problem its nonlinear feature. Conversely, the loading and the beam length may be such that the beam rests entirely supported on the foundation, which situation is governed by a classical linear boundary value problem. In this work, contact evolution is discussed for a continuously varying loading condition, starting from a symmetric layout and at a given beam length, until overturning is eventually reached. In particular, stability is numerically assessed through the energy criterion, which is shown to stand for the free boundary situation as well. At overturning, a descending pathway in the system energy appears and stability loss is confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{design speed}} of the new high speed lines and the stringent requirements on track alignment parameters are leading to a sustained increase {{of the number of}} railway viaducts. The relevant standards impose limiting values on lateral vibrations. Both the Spanish and European standards establish a minimum value for the first natural frequency of lateral vibration of a span, that should not be lower than fh 0 = 1, 2 Hz. This limit was originally proposed by ERRI committee D 181, which assessed the lateral forces in railway bridges. This limit was proposed in order to avoid lateral resonance in railway vehicles going across the structure, taking into account that the frequencies of lateral vibration of railway vehicles are, in general, not greater than 1, 0 Hz. In the case of large continuous viaducts with high piers, the lateral deformations occurring during a train pass-by can be significant and the natural frequencies of the first mode of vibration of the deck can be very low. In these cases {{it is not clear whether}} the required verifications must be applied to spans considered independently, to several successive spans or to the whole viaduct. There is currently no analysis methodology allowing to <b>assess</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> and check the viaduct design against the requirements of ride safety and passenger comfort. This paper analyzes the lateral deformations of a large continuous viaduct and the infrastructure vehicle interaction effects due to the circulation of freight trains and several types of high speed train sat different speeds. The application of this methodology will allow an optimized design of viaducts with significant lateral deformations that cannot be justified only by using the simplified criteria of the current applicable standards. In such cases, the compliance with standards may lead to over dimensioning or in other cases to neglect the limits without the adequate verification of the proper infrastructure behavior once it has been commissioned. As it is the case for vertical deformations, for which the European standards require the assessment of dynamic effects, we stress the need for a dynamic analysis of the effects of lateral deformations in large railway viaducts...|$|R

40|$|This review {{explains}} the context and past experience of public finance reform {{and its effects}} on governance in remote Indigenous communities. Preamble The poor development standards experienced by Indigenous Australians, especially in places remote from urban areas, are regularly characterised in public and academic discourse as a crisis, with calls for ‘new approaches, new thinking and new commitment’. This paper focuses on the modalities used to manage the conversion of public financing of Indigenous organisations into activities designed to impact on these standards. By modalities we mean the policies and instruments that structure and govern how funding is delivered and aligned with government priorities, including administrative, financing and accountability mechanisms. In this review, block funding was identified for its potential to reform the public finance system to create enabling conditions for enhanced Indigenous governance. Building a devolved accountability framework around the organisation, rather than the centralised grant program, is a sensible alternative to multiple grants and ineffective cycles of grant risk management and attendant accountability measures. As block funding has never been explicitly trialled in Australia, {{there is a lack of}} evaluations and other evidence for its efficacy in remote Indigenous contexts. In comparison, the international development literature documents a wealth of experience of the success and shortcoming of generically similar financing modalities. The paper therefore considers the circumstances under which block funding could be usefully adapted to the unique context of remote Indigenous communities in Australia. This review examines the literature and evidence from two principal sources. First and foremost, lessons are distilled and the context defined from a wide array of experience over the past two decades across remote Australia. This is then compared with the evidence from similar contexts abroad; that is, countries and regions that are remote from centres of economic wealth and political power, where populations are generally relatively isolated, scattered and highly diverse. These are often poorly served by administrative and service delivery arrangements due to the impost of great distances and high costs. In these settings, whether abroad or in Australia, local authorities are often referred to as being ‘fragile’ and ‘weak’. Two quite different approaches to handling public finances can be found in these contexts: 	One is to centralise responsibilities to govern public finances and to institute a host of compliance and reporting obligations on local authorities to manage perceived risks to fiduciary standards. This approach can be an effective way to respond to crises in the short term, but over time, this response tends to corrode local capability and introduce perverse incentives to ‘break the rules’ and ‘game the system’ to respond to local needs and demands. 	A second, contending approach has developed, particularly in the past decade. This approach shifts responsibility in the direction of local authorities and organisations for a specific range of services and functions. It also negotiates mutually acceptable agreements about the conditions under which public monies can be used and how performance will be <b>jointly</b> <b>assessed.</b> <b>This</b> paper synthesises Australian and international experiences, then suggests avenues for future engagement, including both new experimentation and upscaling of already promising precedents...|$|R

It has been hypothesized that the distribution of hair cell resting membrane potentials overlaps the equilibrium potential dictated by the nicotinic-gated channels on the hair cells. Nicotinic mediated increases in EPSP frequency would then be due to depolarization of hair cells that were more hyperpolarized at rest, while decreases in EPSP frequency would be due to hyperpolarization of hair cells more depolarized at rest. In order to test this hypothesis, while recording from afferents which showed an increase in EPSP frequency due to bath application of the nicotinic agonist DMPP (1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenylpiperizinium iodide), hair cells were depolarized with 10 mM K+ in the bath, and then the effects of DMPP on EPSP frequency were <b>assessed.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> DMPP still increased EPSP frequency, suggesting that the equilibrium potential for the nicotinic-gated channel was much more positive than the resting potentials of the hair cells.

For the nonpregnant dog clear evidence has been obtained that physiological luteal regression is devoid of a functional role of the PGF 2 alpha-system and seems to depend on the provision of StAR. Yet in pregnant dogs the rapid prepartal luteal regression, coinciding with an increase of PGF 2 alpha, may be indicative for different regulatory mechanisms. To <b>assess</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> and by applying semi-quantitative Real Time (Taq Man) RT-PCR, expression patterns were determined for the following factors in CL of pregnant and prepartal dogs and of mid-pregnant dogs treated with the antiprogestin Aglepristone: cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox 2), prostaglandin E 2 synthase (PGES), prostaglandin F 2 alpha synthase (PGFS), its receptors (EP 2, EP 4 an FP), the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (3 betaHSD) and the progesterone receptor (PR). Peripheral plasma P 4 concentrations were determined by RIA. CL were collected via ovariohysterectomy from pregnant bitches (n= 3 - 5) on days 8 - 12 (Group 1, pre-implantation period), days 18 - 25 (Group 2, post-implantation period), days 35 - 40 (Group 3, mid-gestation period) and during the prepartal progesterone decline (Group 4). Additionally, CL were obtained from groups of 5 mid-pregnant dogs (days 40 - 45) 24 h, respectively 72 h after the second treatment with Aglepristone. Expression of Cox 2 and PGES was highest during the pre-implantation period, that of PGFS and FP during the post-implantation period. EP 4 and EP 2 revealed a constant expression pattern throughout pregnancy with a prepartal upregulation of EP 2. 3 betaHSD and StAR decreased significantly from the pre-implatation period to prepartal luteolysis, it was matched by the course of P 4 concentrations. Expression of the PR was higher during mid-gestation and prepartal luteolysis than in the two preceding periods. After application of Aglepristone the overall mRNA-expression resembled the situation during prepartal luteolysis except for EP 2, which remained unchanged. These data suggest that - as in the nonpregnant bitch - also in the pregnant bitch luteal production of prostaglandins is associated with luteal support rather than luteolysis. On the other hand induction of luteolysis by the PR blocker Aglepristone points to a role of luteal P 4 as an autocrine factor in a positive loop feedback system controlling the availability of P 4, StAR and 3 betaHSD...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} based on an ethnographical, phenomenological field study I {{undertook}} in Rio de Janeiro in September 2012 concentrated on the favelas in the city. In this project I ask: how can we understand and discuss the favelasʼ current socio-spatial position and future in Rio de Janeiro by means of normative and utopian perspectives on urban development? My theoretical approach {{is based on}} the ideas of critical realism and I seek to address the everyday life, the systems and the societal structures, where economical, social and cultural factors all play an important part. Furthermore, throughout the project I reflect on my own approach to the field of research and myself in the field, which allows me to investigate how a critical and productive approach to my own subjectivity and my pre-understandings can give rise to new and meaningful discussions. I will analyse how the favelas have impacted the urban development in Rio de Janeiro {{from the middle of the}} 20 th century until today. I discuss the aggressive political strategy and marginalisation which those settlements have been exposed to, which, on the surface, seems to have changed character concurrent with the fact that the city has become an increasingly important player on the global scene. The upcoming mega-events in Rio de Janeiro provide an important context in which to <b>assess</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b> Through analysis of my empirical data I explore the severe consequences that the construction of a cable car has for the residents in Rio de Janeiroʼs oldest favela, Providência. This case also demonstrates the way that the municipality uses culture strategically in the planning of the favela. I then investigate the impact that categorisations such as class and race have on the everyday life in Rio de Janeiro. Through discussion of different positions in the class hierarchy – from the bottom, the middle and the top of the class system – I examine how the perceptions of “the other” are ambivalent, ambiguous and affect both everyday life and the societal, economical structures. Finally, I discuss the utopian idea of ʻthe favela as a sustainable modelʼ, which I find to be a productive but at the same time problematic perspective, because it holds the potential to shield the social inequality that exists in Rio de Janeiro. I warn against a romanticisation of life in the favelas, but also emphasise that we need normative and utopian perspectives in order to challenge “the given” structures and dominating discourses, and in order to progress towards a better future. An urbanisation of the favelas, which is based in the lived life, is crucial if a more inclusive city is to be created. I endeavour to maintain an open, engaged and critical approach to the projectʼs problem definition and reflect on the way we, instead of seeking blueprints and perfect solutions, must use utopian ideas and the experiences of the everyday life to challenge capitalistic urban development and try to work towards better solutions and better dialogues in order to create a more equal city...|$|R

Having <b>assessed</b> that <b>situation,</b> <b>this</b> paper turns to broader policy issues of the limited effectiveness of the law in remedying discrimination by State schools and the need to upskill, educate and support educators to realise the promise of equal education...|$|R
40|$|EXTRACT (SEE PDF FOR FULL ABSTRACT) : Since 1986, the U. S. Geological Survey and National Weather Service have {{operated}} a warning system for debris flows triggered by severe rainstorms in the San Francisco Bay region. The NWS tracks storm systems {{as they approach}} the region, forecasts precipitation, and observes rainfall with a network of radiotelemetered rain gauges (ALERT). The USGS also monitors ALERT data and compares the observed and forecast rainfall to thresholds for debris-flow initiation. Both groups <b>jointly</b> <b>assess</b> debris-flow hazards and issue public advisories when rainfall conditions reach or approach critical levels...|$|R

Due to the diversity of this region, a practical approach towards monetary integration would be to start with smaller clusters. The hierarchical cluster technique permits us to <b>jointly</b> <b>assess</b> a set of macroeconomic indicators, {{as a basis for}} identifying convergent groups of economies for monetary integration. In addition, this paper uses the discriminant analysis technique to establish what distinguishes the various clusters of economies from each other...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe human {{perception}} of the external world appears as a natural, immediate and effortless task. It is achieved {{through a number of}} "low-level" sensory-motor processes that provide a high-level representation adapted to complex reasoning and decision. Compared to these representations, mobile robots usually provide only low-level obstacle maps that lack such high- level information. We present a mobile robot whose goal is to autonomously explore an unknown indoor environment and to build a semantic map containing high-level information similar to those extracted by humans and that will be rapidly and easily interpreted by users to <b>assess</b> the <b>situation.</b> <b>This</b> robot was developed under the 1 Panoramic and Active Camera for Object Mapping (PACOM) project whose goal is to participate 2 in a French exploration and mapping contest called CAROTTE. We will detail in particular how we integrated visual object recognition, room detection, semantic mapping, and exploration. We demonstrate the performances of our system in an indoor environment...|$|R

This study leads to a training model which can be improved by AI machine learning technology. This AI model can be then used to predict shale reservoir properties, such as porosity, fracture density, TOC content, brittleness, pressure, stress and other geological and engineering sweet spot-related attributes. Furthermore, this model is controlled by production histories, which give a comprehensive index to allow characterization of shale sweet spot development.|$|R

To claim the full credit of €810, the carer must earn less than €5,080. The credit is decreased by €1 for every €2 the carer earns above that amount, so that a carer earning over €6,700 cannot claim the credit, but once granted the credit will still be claimable in future years, as long as the couple does not claim the increase in standard-rate band for dual-income couples.|$|R
