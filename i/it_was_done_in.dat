5|$|The film {{received}} favorable reviews by critics. The Morning Telegraph {{said the}} story was too far-fetched to be believable, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> an amusing way. The Moving Picture World stated that the acting and camerawork was satisfactory. The film was advertised in numerous states, sometimes as a comedy, by theaters in Indiana, Kansas, New York, and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity {{with the use of}} scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{judge is}} empowered to exempt {{from being an}} illegal practice any particular act or omission by a candidate, his or her election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum, incurring an expense or entering into a contract if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> good faith and was due to inadvertence, accidental miscalculation or the like. Similarly, the judge may make an order allowing an authorized excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to election expenses if the candidate or his or her principal election agent shows {{that he or she}} acted in good faith {{and that there is a}} reasonable explanation for the shortcoming such as inadvertence or illness, or the absence, death, illness or misconduct of some other agent, clerk or officer. In particular, the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an act or omission by his or her principal election agent if he or she did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it.|$|E

25|$|The second {{doctrine}} of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, {{insisted that the}} Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balance—that slavery could be excluded in a territory as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 {{at the discretion of}} Congress, thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it. The Wilmot Proviso announced this position in 1846.|$|E

25|$|In 644, Umar {{was assassinated}} by a Persian slave named Abu Lulu by later accounts. His {{motivation}} for the assassination is not clear. One possible explanation was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> response to the Muslim conquest of Persia. The assassination was planned several months earlier. In October 644, Umar undertook a Hajj to Mecca, during which the assassins pronounced Umar's imminent death that year, and the massive crowd of the congregation {{was used by the}} conspirators as a veil to hide themselves.|$|E
25|$|Türr recalled, and Von Suttner later published, some horrors {{that he had}} {{witnessed}} during the Expedition of the Thousand, which had not been published in 1860 itself. For example, entering a village and discovering the bodies of Bourbon soldiers who had been burned to death by the inhabitants. When Garibaldi became extremely furious with the villagers for having perpetrated such an act, they responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> retaliation for the soldiers having earlier set houses on fire {{in the village and}} prevented their inhabitants from escaping.|$|E
25|$|Operation Lam Son II (Vietnamese: chiến dịch Lam Sơn II) was a {{combined}} United States and South Vietnamese military {{and public relations}} operation {{in the village of}} Tân Phước Khánh, Tân Uyên District, in III Corps around 40km north of the capital Saigon staged from June 2 to June 5, 1966 during the Vietnam War. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> order to simultaneously win public support (hearts and minds) for the government of South Vietnam by holding a village fair and providing social services while simultaneously screening the congregated area to arrest and remove Viet Cong guerrillas operating in the area.|$|E

25|$|As {{the first}} of the Orders to be laid before Parliament, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> two stages. The Cleveland (Structural Change) Order 1995 had the main effect of abolishing the County Council, whilst The Cleveland (Further Provision) Order 1995 {{abolished}} the actual county, creating four new (non-metropolitan) unitary authorities coterminous with each of the boroughs. A division was forced by the Opposition, on the first Order, with 310 in favour and 223 in opposition. Of Cleveland's 6 MPs, Mo Mowlam and Frank Cook (both Labour) voted against, with Tim Devlin and Michael Bates (both Conservative) voted for. Stuart Bell and Peter Mandelson (both Labour) were present at the debate but did not vote.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, scourging preceded crucifixion, {{which would}} cause the {{condemned}} to lose {{a large amount of}} blood, and approach a state of shock. The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam (patibulum in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross. Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers. When <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> an established place of execution, the vertical beam (stipes) could even be permanently embedded in the ground. It's claimed by certain religious texts that the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked before being put on the cross—all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The Economist also campaigned {{against the}} Corn Laws that {{protected}} landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. A rigid belief in laissez faire guided the government response in 1846–1849 to the Great Famine in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible {{for economic and}} financial affairs, Charles Wood, expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine. The Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high. However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> stages over three years.|$|E

25|$|The railway was {{the largest}} civil {{engineering}} project in the Palestine region at the time, and {{is considered to be}} one of the largest such projects completed to this day. It is largely responsible for opening up Jerusalem to modern tourism, and assisted in the growth of the city beyond the Old City walls. Selah Merrill, in Scribner's Magazine, notes that the real significance of the railway's construction wasn't the 86.5km of track laid, but the fact that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the Ottoman Empire, which according to him had been attempting at all costs to keep out Western civilization. Land value increased dramatically near the route of the railway, even before its completion. Despite this, the actual area around the Jerusalem Railway Station did not develop quickly, partly because flat and high areas were preferred for construction.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{judge is}} empowered to exempt {{from being an}} illegal practice any particular act or omission by a candidate, his election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum, incurring an expense or entering into a contract if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> good faith and was due to inadvertence, accidental miscalculation or the like.

25|$|Although the Blount Report of July 17, 1893, {{upon which}} the Apology Resolution was based, was an {{official}} report of the U.S. government, {{it was followed by}} the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894, which after public hearings and testimony under oath found the Blount Report to be mistaken on many of the facts reported. Some of the criticisms of the Blount Report included the fact that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> secrecy, with no opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses and no witnesses placed under oath. Opponents of the Apology Resolution point to this official repudiation of the Blount Report as sufficient reason to dismiss any conclusions based on it. Despite being staunchly in favor of reinstating the monarchy, President Grover Cleveland also reversed himself upon receipt of the Morgan Report, refusing requests from the queen for further aid in her restoration, and acknowledging both the Provisional Government and Republic of Hawaii as the legitimate successors to the Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The agro-food {{industry}} {{is one of}} the main pillars of industry of Campania. The organisation of the sector is improving and leading to higher levels of quality and salaries. Campania mainly produces fruit and vegetables, but has also expanded its production of flowers grown in greenhouses, becoming one of the leading regions of the sector in Italy. The value added of this sector represents around 6.5% of the total value added of the region, equalling €213.7 million. Campania produces over 50% of Italy's nuts and is also the leader in the production of tomatoes, which reaches 1.5 million tonnes a year. A weak point, however, for the region's agriculture is the very reduced size of farms, equal to 3.53 hectares. Animal breeding is widespread (<b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> 70,278 farms in 2000) and the milk produced is used to process typical products, such as mozzarella. Olive trees cover over 74,604 hectares of the agricultural land and contribute by €620.6 million to the value added of agriculture, together with the production of fruit. Wine production has increased, together with the quality of the wine.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done {{everything in my power}} to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E
25|$|For {{even more}} serious offences, {{students}} may be suspended or even expelled from Hogwarts. Harry and Ron are threatened with expulsion after crashing Ron's car into the Whomping Willow {{at the start of}} their second year, and Harry is expelled before the start of his fifth year (although the sentence is quickly changed to a disciplinary hearing) after he is detected using magic in the presence of Muggles, a serious offence among the wizarding community. Dumbledore argued in Harry's defence, stating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> self-defence, and that the Ministry has no authority to expel students– such powers are invested in the Headmaster and the Board of Governors. Snape has attempted to have Harry expelled, and he attempted to have Harry's father, James Potter, expelled when they were at Hogwarts together. The only student known to have been expelled is Hagrid, for the murder of Myrtle with an acromantula believed to be the Monster of Slytherin and for opening the Chamber of Secrets– crimes for which Tom Riddle had framed him.|$|E
