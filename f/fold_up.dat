5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually <b>fold</b> <b>up</b> into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E

25|$|A {{bifold door}} is {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels <b>fold</b> <b>up</b> against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|E
500|$|As {{recently}} as the 1950s, hatches had wooden covers that would be broken apart and rebuilt by hand, rather than opened and closed. [...] Newer vessels have hydraulic-operated metal hatch covers that can often be operated by one person. [...] Hatch covers can slide forwards, backwards, or to the side, lift up or <b>fold</b> <b>up.</b> It is essential that the hatch covers be watertight: unsealed hatches lead to accidental cargo hold flooding, which has caused many bulkers to sink.|$|E
500|$|The {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} was Michael J. McAlister (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Willow) with Mark Stetson (Superman Returns, Peter Pan) as miniatures supervisor. Peter Chesney, mechanical effects designer on many Coen brothers films, created {{a pair of}} 16-foot angel wings for actor Charles Durning, who portrayed Waring Hudsucker. [...] "I made a complicated steel armature {{with a lot of}} electric motors to time everything so he can <b>fold</b> <b>up</b> his wings, unfold them and flap them about. Then we covered them with real duck and turkey feathers," [...] says Chesney. [...] "We modeled them after photographs of a hovering dove landing in slow motion." [...] The buildings in the background (designed by McAlister and Stetson) were 1:24 scale models, shot separately and merged in post-production. To lengthen the sequence, the model of the Hudsucker building was the equivalent of 90 stories, not 45.|$|E

500|$|Ten {{thousand}} {{copies of}} The Story of Miss Moppet were released in a panorama format priced at a shilling in November 1906, and another 10,000 copies in December 1906. There were no subsequent printings in the panorama format. The strip folded accordion-fashion into a grey cloth wallet measuring [...] When opened, the panorama strip measured [...] As Lear writes, Potter [...] "experimented with a panorama format of fourteen pictures on one long {{strip of paper}} which folded into a wallet tied with a ribbon". Lear explains that the format [...] "although popular with readers was ultimately unsuccessful, because shopkeepers found them difficult to keep folded". Potter referred to this fact late in life when she said, [...] "Bad Rabbit and Moppet were originally printed on long strips—The shops sensibly refused to stock them because they got unrolled and so bad to <b>fold</b> <b>up</b> again". MacDonald {{points out that the}} fragile panorama format was inappropriate for very young children.|$|E
500|$|The Mansion Of Happiness was {{designed}} by George Fox, a children's author and game designer in England. The first edition, printed in gold ink [...] "containing real gold" [...] using one copper plate engraving and black ink using a second copper plate engraving, produced a few hundred copies. Water coloring was used to complete the game board, making a brilliant, colorful, and expensive product fit for the nobility. Later in 1800, a second edition was printed, probably for rich but common folk. Only one copper plate was used to print black ink and no water coloring was used. The game must have become quite popular in England as a third edition was printed using two copper plates, one for black, and the second for green lines to indicate blank spaces. Water colors were added to make a beautiful product. Laurie and Whittle published all three editions in 1800. On all three editions George Fox was listed as the inventor and the game honored the Duchess of York. In the first edition, gold not only added color and price but homage to royalty. In all three editions, the paper was glued to linen so it could <b>fold</b> <b>up</b> and be inserted into a heavy attractively labeled cardboard case.|$|E
500|$|The {{veins of}} insect wings are {{characterized}} by a convex-concave placement, such as those seen in mayflies (i.e., concave is [...] "down" [...] and convex is [...] "up") which alternate regularly and by its triadic type of branching; whenever a vein forks there is always an interpolated vein of the opposite position between the two branches. A concave vein will fork into two concave veins (with the interpolated vein being convex) and the regular alteration of the veins is preserved. The veins of the wing appear to fall into an undulating pattern according to whether they {{have a tendency to}} <b>fold</b> <b>up</b> or down when the wing is relaxed. The basal shafts of the veins are convex, but each vein forks distally into an anterior convex branch and a posterior concave branch. Thus the costa and subcosta are regarded as convex and concave branches of a primary first vein, Rs is the concave branch of the radius, posterior media the concave branch of the media, Cu1 and Cu2 are respectively convex and concave, while the primitive Postcubitus and the first vannal have each an anterior convex branch and a posterior concave branch. The convex or concave nature of the veins has been used as evidence in determining the identities of the persisting distal branches of the veins of modern insects, but it has not been demonstrated to be consistent for all wings.|$|E

2500|$|The 2CV was {{produced}} for 42 years, the model finally succumbing to customer demands for speed, {{in which this}} ancient design had fallen significantly behind modern cars, and safety. Although {{the front of the}} chassis was designed to <b>fold</b> <b>up,</b> to form a crumple zone according to a 1984 Citroën brochure, in common with other small cars of its era its crashworthiness was very poor by modern standards.

Its advanced underlying engineering was ignored or misunderstood by the public, being clothed in an anachronistic body. It was the butt of many a joke, especially by Jasper Carrott in the UK.|$|E
