The battle was intense at the Small Gate, which was guarded by commander Yazid and his men. Yazid <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> troops but Dharar came to Yazid's aid with his 2,000 cavalry of the Mobile Guard. The cavalry attacked the flank of the Byzantine sortie force and repulsed the sally.|$|E
5|$|At quarterback, Nebraska had Scott Frost, a {{transfer}} player from Stanford who had 1,440 passing yards, 13 passing touchdowns, three interceptions, and 578 rushing yards {{in his first}} season with the team. Frost's three interceptions were the third-least in Division I-A; only Army and Ohio University <b>had</b> <b>fewer.</b> Overall, Nebraska totaled 5,069 yards of offense and 42.7 points per game, the most in the Big 12.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending.

5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state {{to the point that}} they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license. Just four days before the murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.|$|E

5|$|In taking {{leadership}} of the diocese, Archbishop Le Hunsec noted that the island of Carabane, heavily populated when trading was concentrated there, had lost its influence and now <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> than 500inhabitants. He considered transferring the mission to Oussouye, which became a reality in 1927. Starting in 1937, the mission in Oussouye also performed baptisms and funerals in Carabane.|$|E

Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time, Saunders <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> rights as a citizen than the white Australians he led.

5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E

In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> {{effective}} leg-side shots.

His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he}} did not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, Comfort and Comfort Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track, overhead wires and signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Carter won the election, {{receiving}} 50.1% of {{the popular}} vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford. The election was close enough that <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> than 25,000 votes shifted in Ohio and Wisconsin – both of which neighbored his home state – Ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for Carter. Though he lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford had managed to close what was once an alleged 33-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin. Ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by Carter.|$|E
5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> storms than in 1868, and seven had {{the same number of}} storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‑day span. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has no true song, but its vocalisations include an excited series of tschip calls given by {{unpaired}} or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps {{are used in}} social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh teck. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from {{the small size of}} the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|The former Oxford University {{historian}} Adrian Goldsworthy {{has argued}} that the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West should not be blamed on barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent civil wars, which led to its ability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers to be seriously weakened. The East Roman or Byzantine empire on the other hand <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> civil wars to contend with in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, or in the years from 383-432 A.D.|$|E

Bermuda had, prior to Beijing, earned one medal, when Clarence Hill won bronze in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 2008 Bermudian delegation <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> people than it usually sent abroad, prompting {{the president of the}} Bermudian Olympic Association Austin Woods to complain publicly that the year's Olympic team lacked access to quality coaches, administrators, and facilities, and with the exception of several athletes, lacked the skill to be competitive.|$|E
