These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan {{and his friends were}} more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E

5|$|Eusèbe Jaojoby {{was born}} on 29 July 1955, {{in the village of}} Anboahangibe, near Sambava in the northeastern coastal Sava Region of Madagascar. Jaojoby and his twelve younger {{brothers}} and sisters were raised Catholic; early experiences singing hymns in the local church choir and traditional folk songs at local Betsimisaraka moonlight village festivals made him realize he possessed vocal talent. At the age of 15, Jaojoby's father sent him to continue his studies in Diego-Suarez, one of the six regional capitals at the time. The town was home to a large contingent of French soldiers and expatriates, and contemporary Western genres were commonly <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> and in the town's many nightclubs. Jaojoby was inspired by these styles and particularly by Freddy Ranarison, who in the 1960s became the first Malagasy musician to use an electric guitar to perform coastal musical styles.|$|E
25|$|Falco {{began to}} show signs of unusual musical talent very early.

At age five, he auditioned for the Vienna Music Academy, where it was confirmed that he had absolute pitch.|$|E

25|$|Edith Shain {{wrote to}} Eisenstaedt {{in the late}} 1970s {{claiming}} to be {{the woman in the}} picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she thought she might as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Harvick {{would spend}} the season concentrating on running the Cup Series and would only start four races in the Busch Series. He would only have one Top 10 in those four starts. Harvick began the 2002 season making his first Daytona 500 {{starting}} on the outside pole next to Jimmie Johnson, but his day ended after triggering an 18-car crash on lap 148, allowing him to finish 36th. Later in the season, he made a fine for a post-race incident with Greg Biffle at Bristol Motor Speedway. He was suspended for rough driving in a Truck race at Martinsville, in which he intentionally spun out driver Coy Gibbs, allowing NASCAR to immediately take {{him out of the}} race. Even though it was <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> that he actually did, Harvick lied in a post-race interview saying that he didn't purposely wreck Gibbs. Harvick was banned from the Cup Series race the next day, which meant that Kenny Wallace would replace him. Harvick scored his first career Winston Cup pole position in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. Later in the season, he scored his third Winston Cup Victory at Chicagoland Speedway. He finished 21st in the 2002 points standings with one win, one pole, five Top 5's and eight Top 10's. Harvick became the 2002 IROC Champion in his first season in the Series, winning at California Speedway. In Trucks, Harvick began fielding his own No. 6 truck, driving himself in five races and winning at Phoenix.|$|E

500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). But {{to me it was}} so much bullshit.

But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we on the front line were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E

500|$|As a teenager, Ochs was {{recognized}} as a talented clarinet player; in an evaluation, one music instructor wrote: [...] "You have exceptional musical feeling {{and the ability to}} transfer it on your instrument is abundant." [...] His musical skills allowed him to play clarinet with the orchestra at the Capital University Conservatory of Music in Ohio, where he rose to the status of principal soloist before he was 16. Although Ochs played classical music, he soon became interested in other sounds he <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio,</b> such as early rock icons Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley and country music artists including Faron Young, Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams, Sr., and Johnny Cash. Ochs also {{spent a lot of time}} at the movies. He especially liked big screen heroes such as John Wayne and Audie Murphy. Later on, he developed an interest in movie rebels, including Marlon Brando and James Dean.|$|E
500|$|Later that morning, Jennings' family <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> that [...] "Buddy Holly and {{his band}} had been killed."

The General Artists Corporation promised to pay a {{first-class}} ticket for Jennings and the band to assist Holly's funeral in Lubbock, in exchange for them playing that night in Moorhead. After the first show, they were initially denied their payment by the venue, but after Jennings's persistence, they were paid. The flights were never paid, and Jennings and Allsup continued the tour for two more weeks, featuring Jennings as the lead singer. They were paid less than half of the original agreed salary, and upon returning to New York, Jennings put Holly's guitar and amplifier in a locker in Grand Central Terminal and mailed the keys to Maria Elena Holly. Then, he returned to Lubbock.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews regard The Downward Spiral {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} albums of the 1990s and Reznor's greatest work. The 2004 edition of The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album five out of five stars and called it [...] "a powerful statement, and one of the landmark albums of the Nineties." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson remembered watching the music video of [...] "Closer" [...] on MTV as an adolescent and expressed that the album changed his perception of popular music from that of songs <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> to albums with cover art. Stereogums Tom Breihan remains favorable toward the album since it is [...] "the one that most fully inhabits" [...] Nine Inch Nails' characteristics and influenced youth culture, with teenagers wearing ripped fish nets on their arms. [...] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

500|$|A mammoth hit, South Pacific sparked huge {{media and}} public attention. [...] South Pacific {{was one of the}} first shows for which a variety of souvenirs were available: fans could buy South Pacific neckties, or for women, {{lipstick}} and scarves. [...] Fake ticket stubs could be purchased for use as status symbols. There were South Pacific music boxes, dolls, fashion accessories, and even hairbrushes for use after washing men from hair. Martin's on-stage shower prompted an immediate fashion craze for short hair that could be managed through once-a-day washing at home, rather than in a beauty salon, and for the products which would allow for such care. The songs of South Pacific could be <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio,</b> and they were popular among dance bands and in piano lounges. Mordden comments that South Pacific contained nothing but hit songs; Rodgers and Hammerstein's other successful works always included at least one song which did not become popular.|$|E
500|$|Tippett {{completed}} his Jungian psychoanalysis on 31 August 1939. Three days later, {{on the day}} that Britain declared war on Germany, he began composing A Child of Our Time. His grounding in the traditions of European music guided him instinctively towards the Passions of Bach as his basic musical model. Thus the building blocks of the work are familiar: recitatives, arias, choruses and ensembles, with a male soloist acting as a narrator and the chorus as full participants in the action. Tippett also introduced two other formal number types: the operatic scena and the orchestral interlude, the latter allowing [...] time for reflection on significant events. Tippett [...] wished to punctuate his work with an equivalent to the congregation chorales which recur in Bach's Passions; however, he [...] wanted his work to speak to atheists, agnostics and Jews as well as to Christians. He considered briefly whether folk-songs, or even Jewish hymns, could provide an alternative, but rejected these because he felt that, like the chorales, they lacked universality. A solution was suggested to him when he <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> a rendering of the spiritual [...] "Steal away". In particular he was struck by the power of the words [...] "The trumpet sounds within-a my soul". This led him to recognise spirituals as carrying an emotional significance far beyond their origin as slave songs in 19th-century America and as representing the oppressed everywhere.|$|E
500|$|Brian {{picks up}} Stewie from a play date. On the drive home, Stewie listens to [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] by Carrie Underwood on the radio. He decides {{to stay in}} the car by himself to {{continue}} listening after they reach home and accidentally hits the gear shift, causing the car to move forward. Thinking he can drive, Stewie takes the car for a ride and is thrilled by the experience. He hears on the car radio a contest to win Justin Bieber concert tickets. Stewie calls the radio station on his cell phone but loses control of the car and crashes into a lamppost. (Herbert is <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> winning the tickets.) Stewie takes the car home with the front of the vehicle completely destroyed. Brian discovers the damage and immediately blames Stewie, who tries to deny his involvement, but Brian points out that Stewie left Rupert in the car. Brian says he'll tell Peter and Lois, and Stewie cries. Afraid of being punished, Stewie runs away. He leaves a CD-ROM for Brian that details his plans. Stewie takes the bus to the airport, but disembarks in the wrong neighborhood. Consuela, the Griffin family's former maid, finds him and takes him home. Brian finds Stewie, and tells him that he did not tell anyone about the accident. They attempt to leave Consuela's home, but she insists on keeping Stewie as her own baby. Stewie steals a gun and shoots her in the foot, but says that he didn't want to hurt her because she had shown kindness to him in the past. Brian and Stewie return home.|$|E
