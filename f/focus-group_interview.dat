40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a survey {{instrument}} on college academic stressors. A review of extant literature and a <b>focus-group</b> <b>interview</b> among 20 college students were done. Based on the review of extant literature and <b>focus-group</b> <b>interview,</b> an initial survey instrument was developed. The initial survey instrument was further reviewed by 11 college students. After the review, a trial-run of the survey instrument was conducted among 17 college students. The comments from the trial-run participants became the bases {{for the development of}} the main-try-out survey instrument. The main-try-out survey instrument was used in the final test administration with 1, 210 college students as participants. Responses from the final test administration participants served as bases in determining the descriptive statistics of items, evaluation of validity, and evaluation of reliability of the survey instrument. Based on information gathered, the final survey instrument was developed and was named “Survey of College Academic Stressors. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} <b>focus-group</b> <b>interviews,</b> {{as a means}} of {{qualitative}} data collection, have gained popularity amongst professionals within the health and social care arena. Despite this popularity, analysing qualitative data, particularly <b>focus-group</b> <b>interviews,</b> poses a challenge to most practitioner researchers. The present paper responds to the needs expressed by public health nutritionists, community dietitians and health development specialists following two training sessions organised collaboratively by the Health Development Agency, the Nutrition Society and the British Dietetic Association in 2003. The focus of the present paper is on the concepts and application of framework analysis, especially the use of Krueger’s framework. It provides some practical steps for the analysis of individual data, as well as focus-group data using examples from the author’s own research, {{in such a way as}} to assist the newcomer to qualitative research to engage with the methodology. Thus, it complements the papers by Draper (2004) and Fade (2004) that discuss in detail the complementary role of qualitative data in researching human behaviours, feelings and attitudes. Draper (2004) has provided theoretical and philosophical bases for qualitative data analysis. Fade (2004) has described interpretative phenomenology analysis as a method of analysing individual interview data. The present paper, using framework analysis concentrating on <b>focus-group</b> <b>interviews,</b> provides another approach to qualitative data analysis. Focus-group interviews: Qualitative data analysis <b>Focus-group</b> <b>interviews</b> are becoming increasingly popular in health research for exploring what individuals believe or feel as well as why they behave in the way they do.

40|$|The {{health hazards}} of tobacco use are well-known, {{and it is}} {{considered}} particularly important to prevent tobacco use among teenagers. New generations of teenagers still start using tobacco. To develop a more profound understanding of tobacco use among teenagers, {{the purpose of this}} study is to explore representations of tobacco use, smoking as well as snuffing, at the age when young people often start using tobacco. <b>Focus-group</b> <b>interviews</b> were carried out with 14 - 15 year olds in two schools in the Stockholm area. The analysis reveals that teenagers are well informed about the health-hazards of tobacco use. At the same time they hold complex and conflicting ideas concerning the relationship between tobacco use, risk, the body and "human nature". At the most general level of "social thinking" there is a dynamic relation between the three main representations of tobacco use related to: (1) notions of risk, (2) "human nature" and; (3) society's efforts to discipline its citizens, which together can be seen as the social representation of tobacco use. These representations of tobacco use are discussed as related to the teenagers' identity-work and gender identities.

This study was intended {{to find out the}} values of the use of Genre-based approach synthesised with Project-based Learning in helping students develop their ability to write biographical recount text. This study employed a qualitative research design, embracing characteristics of a case study. The study was carried out within seventeen meetings. It covered eleven meetings of the first teaching cycle, five meetings of the second teaching cycle, and one meeting of <b>focus-group</b> <b>interview.</b> The study involved three types of instruments, including classroom observations, students’ biographical recounttexts, and <b>focus-group</b> <b>interview.</b> This study revealed that, to most extent, genre-project based approach was found to be helpful to develop students’ ability to write biographical recount text. In addition, from the interview, it was shown that the teaching program has motivated the learners to produce more texts and to perform in another English project. However, it was identified that the teaching and learning process should be continued, the editing process should be conducted in a longer period, and the students needed to be guided more in English biographical writing.

40|$|Objectives: To explore {{significant}} {{experiences of}} adolescents as {{next of kin}} that the general practitioner (GP) should identify and recognize. Design: Qualitative study with <b>focus-group</b> <b>interviews.</b> Subjects and setting: Three <b>focus-group</b> <b>interviews</b> were conducted {{with a total of}} 15 Norwegian adolescents each with an ill or substance-abusing parent. The participants were recruited from existing support groups. Results: The adolescents’ days were dominated by unpredictability in their family situation and their own exhausting efforts to keep up an ordinary youth life. Mostly, they consulted GPs for somatic complaints. In encounters with the GP, they wanted to be met both as a unique person and {{as a member of a}} family with burdens. Their expectations from the GP were partly negatively formed by their experiences. Some had experienced that both their own and their parent’s health problems were not addressed properly. Others reported that the GP did not act when he or she should have been concerned about their adverse life situation. The GP may contribute to better long-term psychosocial outcomes by ensuring that the adolescents receive information about the parent’s illness and have someone to talk to about their feelings and experiences. In addition, the GP may help by supporting their participation in relieving activities. Conclusion: Burdened adolescents seek a GP most often for somatic complaints. The GP has a potential to support them by taking the initiative to talk about their life situation, and by recognizing their special efforts. </p...|$|R

40|$|Often, the {{research}} process is hidden under the dominant product, making all decisions, from {{the research}} question to the chosen method and theory, seem obvious in retrospect. Consequently, this paper has two tightly intertwined aims: to elucidate {{the research process}} of the study on which it is based; and to explore and discuss what this process temporally produced, namely, a focus group interview seen in a post-qualitative perspective. The post-qualitative mind-set not only challenges the pre-arranged research process, but also suppresses distinctions, offering applicable tools when dealing with the traditionally used <b>focus-group</b> <b>interview</b> in a different light. Recalling the thinking of Deleuze and Guattari, and some central concepts, this paper show how the focus group creates a field in which the construction of subjectivities can take place {{in relation to the}} not-yet-seen, or to the becoming-coming. This is done both theoretically and through empirical examples from focus group interviews...|$|E

To effectively prepare students for this challenging role, simulated learning and assessment is increasingly being built into the ODP curriculum.

Methods A phenomenological qualitative approach using a semistructured <b>focus-group</b> <b>interview,</b> using a purposive sample (n = 5) of ODP students, was conducted and followed up by a questionnaire. Analysis was informed by Braun and Clarke's thematic approach. Results Key findings identified included: emotional responses, learning styles, authenticity, and assessment preparation. Conclusion ODP students responded positively to simulated learning strategies with emphasis to increase the frequency and their exposure to normalize simulated assessment. It is essential, however, to ensure simulation has clinical relevance and authenticity...|$|E
