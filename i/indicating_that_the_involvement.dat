40|$|The {{involvement}} of local communities has increasingly been recognised {{for the conservation}} and sustainable use of natural resources. The management of forests by communities {{has been at the}} forefront of a shift in focus from state and private management. There are, however, limited studies <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of local communities has improved the condition of forests, or this has translated into sustainable forest utilisation. This paper examines the experience of forest conservation and utilisation by three Forest Users Groups in Nepalese community forestry. Data were collected by using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, generating information from 72 households, 21 key respondents, 6 focus group discussions and 3 vegetation assessments. The study demonstrates that compared with the highly degraded forests from which most community forests started, the conditions of forests has improved, but community forestry is not ideal for biodiversity conservation. Further, the forests are found to be underutilised, largely because the powerful actors highlight the protection-oriented approach of management to ensure forest conservation. As a result, the local communities, particularly the poorer groups, gain little benefits. It is concluded that achieving sustainable conservation and utilisation of forests managed by local communities is a major challenge. Thi...|$|E
40|$|The RecQ 4 protein shows {{homology}} to {{both the}} S. cerevisiae DNA replication protein Sld 2 and the DNA repair related RecQ helicases. Experimental data also suggest replication and repair functions for RecQ 4, but the precise details of its involvement remain to be clarified. Here we show that depletion of DmRecQ 4 by dsRNA interference in S 2 cells causes defects consistent with a replication function for the protein. The cells show reduced proliferation associated with an S phase block, reduced BrdU incorporation, {{and an increase in}} cells with a subG 1 DNA content. At the molecular level we observe reduced chromatin association of DNA polymerase-alpha and PCNA. We also observe increased chromatin association of phosphorylated H 2 AvD- consistent with the presence of DNA damage and increased apoptosis. Analysis of DmRecQ 4 repair function suggests a direct role in NER, as the protein shows rapid but transient nuclear localisation after UV treatment. Re-localisation is not observed after etoposide or H 2 O 2 treatment, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of DmRecQ 4 in repair is likely to be pathway specific. Deletion analysis of DmRecQ 4 suggests that the SLD 2 domain was essential, but not sufficient, for replication function. In addition a DmRecQ 4 N-terminal deletion could efficiently re-localise on UV treatment, suggesting that the determinants for this response are contained in the C terminus of the protein. Finally several deletions show differential rescue of dsRNA generated replication and proliferation phenotypes. These will be useful for...|$|E

40|$|Noonan {{syndrome}} (NS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, short stature and congenital heart defects. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous and shows clinical overlap with other RASopathies. These syndromes {{are caused by}} mutations {{in a variety of}} genes leading to dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway: PTPN 11, KRAS, SOS 1, RAF 1, CBL, SHOC 2, NRAS, BRAF, MAP 2 K 1, MAP 2 K 2, HRAS, NF 1 and SPRED 1. In this study, we conduct a genotype-phenotype analysis of 33 patients with a clinical diagnosis of NS without a PTPN 11 mutation. Mutation analysis of the genes involved in RASopathies was performed, except for NF 1 and SPRED 1. In 14 (42 %) NS patients, a mutation was found, 7 (21 %) had a mutation in SOS 1, 3 (9 %) in RAF 1 and 1 (3 %) in KRAS, MAP 2 K 2, BRAF and SHOC 2 each. The phenotype of these mutation-positive cases corresponded to that described in the literature. In the cases with a BRAF and MAP 2 K 2 mutation, the diagnosis cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome was made. The patient with the SHOC 2 mutation had features compatible with 'Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair'. Three major clinical features of NS - a typical face, short stature and a pulmonary valve stenosis - were less frequently present in the group without a mutation. Missense mutations in genes encoding proteins of the RAS-MAPK pathway cause NS. The 3 major clinical features of NS were less frequently present in the mutation-negative patients, which stresses the importance of the syndrome-specific symptoms of the face, heart and short stature in NS. However, all mutation-negative cases met the NS criteria, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of novel genes is to be expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the chemotherapy drug cisplatin is often limited due to resistance of the tumors to the drug, and increasing the potency of cisplatin without increasing its concentration could prove beneficial. A previously characterized Dictyostelium discoideum mutant with increased resistance to cisplatin was defective in the gene encoding sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S- 1 -P) lyase, which catalyzes the breakdown of S- 1 -P, an important regulatory molecule in cell function and development and in the regulation of cell fate. We hypothesized that the increased resistance to cisplatin was due to an elevation of S- 1 -P and predicted that lowering levels of S- 1 -P should increase sensitivity to the drug. We generated three strains that stably overexpress different levels of the S- 1 -P lyase. The overexpressor strains have reduced growth rate and, confirming the hypothesis, showed an expression-dependent increase in sensitivity to cisplatin. Consistently, treating the cells with d-erythro-N,N,-dimethylsphingosine, a known inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, increased the sensitivity of mutant and parent cells to cisplatin, while addition of exogenous S- 1 -P or 8 -Br-cyclic AMP made the cells more resistant to cisplatin. The increased sensitivity of the overexpressors to cisplatin was also observed with the cisplatin analog carboplatin. In contrast, the response to doxorubicin, 5 -flurouracil, or etoposide was unaffected, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in modulating the response to cisplatin {{is not part of}} a global genotoxic stress response. The augmented sensitivity to cisplatin appears {{to be the result of}} an intracellular signaling function of S- 1 -P, because D. discoideum does not appear to have endothelial differentiation growth (EDG/S 1 P) receptors. Overall, the results show that modulation of the sphingolipid pathway at multiple points can result in increased sensitivity to cisplatin and has the potential for increasing the clinical usefulness of this important drug...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFibronectin (FN) is a multi-functional, {{adhesion}} {{protein and}} involved in multi-steps of the wound healing process. Strong evidence suggests that FN protein diversity is controlled by alternative RNA splicing; a coordinated transcription and RNA processing that is development-, age-, and tissue/cell type-regulated. We previously demonstrated that fetal rabbit airway mucosal healing is regenerative and scarless. Expression, regulation, and biological function of the FN gene and various spliced forms in this model are unknown. Airway and skin incisional wounds were made in fetal (gestation days 21 – 23), weanling (4 – 6 weeks) and adult (> 6 months) rabbits. Non-wounded and wounded tissues were collected at 12 h (all age groups), 24 h and 48 h (weanling only) post-wounding. Expression profiles were obtained using mRNA differential display and cDNAs of interest were cloned, sequenced and validated by real-time PCR. Here, we report two rabbit cDNAs that showed similar expression patterns after wounding. One encodes a rabbit fibronectin gene, Fn 1, and another shares a high sequence homology to a human pre-mRNA splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 3 (Sfrs 3), coding for a RNA binding protein, SRp 20. Both Fn 1 and Sfrs 3 mRNAs were suppressed in fetal wounds but induced in postnatal wounds 12 h post-wounding. The increased levels of both Fn 1 and Sfrs 3 transcripts were sustained up to 48 h in weanling airway mucosal wounds. The augmentations of the two genes in postnatal airway mucosal wounds were more prominent than that in skin wounds, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of Sfrs 3 and Fn 1 genes in postnatal airway mucosal wounds is tissue-specific. Literature provides evidence that SRp 20 is indeed involved in the alternative splicing of FN and that the embryonic FN variants reappear during adult wound healing. A connection between the enhanced molecular activity of Sfrs 3 and the regulation of the FN gene expression through alternative splicing during the early events of postnatal airway mucosal wound repair was proposed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Rotenone is an {{inhibitor}} of mitochondrial complex I {{that produces}} a model of Parkinson’s disease (PD), in which neurons undergo dopamine release dysfunction and other features. In neurons, exocytosis {{is one of the}} processes associated with dopamine release and is dependent on Ca 2 + dynamic changes of the cell. In the present study, we have investigated the exocytosis of dopamine and <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of Ca 2 + in dopamine release in PC 12 cells administrated with rotenone. Results demonstrated that rotenone led to an elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + through Ca 2 + influx by opening of the voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel and influenced the soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins expression (including syntaxin, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP 2) and synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP- 25)); pretreatment with a blocker of L-type voltage-activated Ca 2 + chan-nels (nifedipine) decreased the intracellular dopamine levels and ROS formation, increased the cell viability and enhanced the neurite outgrowth and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles.

Thirty DM 1 patients underwent neuropsychological investigation and 3 T-MRI protocol. GM and WM changes were evaluated calculating brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), voxel-based morphometry (VBM), white matter lesion load (LL% and Fazekas scale) and tract based spatial statistical (TBSS). Patients showed main impairment in tests exploring executive and mnesic domains with visuo-spatial involvement, significantly related to BPF. VBM revealed clusters of widespread GM reduction and TBSS revealed areas of decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in patients compared to a group of matched healthy controls. Multiple regression analyses showed areas of significant negative relationship between left temporal atrophy and verbal memory, between RD and mnesic and visuo-spatial cognitive domains, and between AD and verbal memory. TBSS results <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of normal appearance WM, beyond the signal changes detected with conventional MR imaging (Fazekas scale and LL%), was associated with neuropsychological deficit. These data suggest that disrupted complex neuronal networks can underlie cognitive-behavioural dysfunctions in DM 1...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) {{has been observed}} in all stages of liver disease. Thus far all information about the physical state of HBV in mononuclear blood cells comes from Southern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. In this study we focused our attention on the presence of HBV DNA sequences in PBMCs of 30 patients with acute type B hepatitis and 6 patients with chronic active hepatitis by utilizing both Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Southern blot analysis showed no HBV DNA sequences in PBMCs of the acute hepatitis patients, although the sensitivity of our method enabled us to detect as little as 1 pg of cloned HBV insert. As far as the chronic hepatitis patients are concerned Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of HBV DNA sequences in 5 out of 6 patients but intermittently at successive follow-up times. On the other hand we were able to demonstrate the presence of HBV related sequences in 14 out of 30 acute hepatitis patients (5 HBeAg positive, 9 antiHBe positive) and in all 6 chronic hepatitis patients by PCR. Our results <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of PBMCs with HBV during acute HBV infection occurs at a very low level, often below the detection limit of the Southern blot technique...|$|R
40|$|We have {{characterized}} Schizosaccharomyces pombe open reading frames encoding potential orthologues of {{constituents of}} the evolutionarily conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup 84 vertebrate Nup 107 - 160 nuclear pore subcomplex, namely Nup 133 a, Nup 133 b, Nup 120, Nup 107, Nup 85, and Seh 1. In spite of rather weak sequence conservation, in vivo analyses demonstrated that these S. pombe proteins are localized at the nuclear envelope. Biochemical data confirmed {{the organization of}} these nucleoporins within conserved complexes. Although examination of the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe deletion mutants revealed different viability phenotypes, functional studies <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of this complex in nuclear pore distribution and mRNA export has been conserved between these highly divergent yeasts. Unexpectedly, microscopic analyses {{of some of the}} S. pombe mutants revealed cell division defects at the restrictive temperature (abnormal septa and mitotic spindles and chromosome missegregation) that were reminiscent of defects occurring in several S. pombe GTPase Ran (RanSp) /Spi 1 cycle mutants. Furthermore, deletion of nup 120 moderately altered the nuclear location of RanSp/Spi 1, whereas overexpression of a nonfunctional RanSp/Spi 1 -GFP allele was specifically toxic in the Δnup 120 and Δnup 133 b mutant strains, indicating a functional and genetic link between constituents of the S. pombe Nup 107 - 120 complex and of the RanSp/Spi 1 pathway...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Proper {{maintenance}} management ensures a long-term investment {{and provides a}} support function in business continuity to achieve organisational goal. However, inadequate involvement and participation of key stakeholders in {{maintenance management}} limit the continuous improvement of maintenance performance. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of studies about the influence of key stakeholders' involvement in maintenance. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to deal with enhancement of maintenance management through <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of key stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - This research adopted a mixed method approach to determine <b>the</b> relationship between <b>involvement</b> of key stakeholders in maintenance management and maintenance effectiveness. The approach comprised of literature review, questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews. Findings - This research suggests a positive correlation between involvement of maintenance manager (MM), maintenance staff, organisation, user and maintenance service provider (SP) in improving the effectiveness of maintenance management. The logistic regression analysis <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of MM and SP are significant predictors of maintenance effectiveness. The research further identified that there was a lack of <b>involvement</b> of <b>the</b> user and SP in maintenance management. Originality/value - <b>The</b> research demonstrated <b>that</b> all key stakeholders should value the important roles of their participation in maintenance management to ensure an optimum return on a long-term investment. To create the awareness for <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of key stakeholders in building maintenance, studies on the advantages of participating in building maintenance and the impacts of ignorant towards building maintenance can be beneficial to the industry...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recombination {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{mechanisms}} underlying the generation of HIV- 1 variability. Currently 61 circulating recombinant forms of HIV- 1 have been identified. With the development of recombination detection techniques and accumulation of HIV- 1 reference stains, more accurate mosaic structures of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), like CRF 04 and CRF 06, have undergone repeated analysis and upgrades. Such revisions may also be necessary for other CRFs. Unlike previous studies, whose results are based primarily on a single recombination detection program, the current study was based on multiple recombination analysis, which may have produced more impartial results. Methods: Representative references of 3 categories of intersubtype recombinants were selected, including BC recombinants (CRF 07 and CRF 08), BG recombinants (CRF 23 and CRF 24), and BF recombinants (CRF 38 and CRF 44). They were reanalyzed in detail using both the jumping profile hidden Markov model and RDP 3. Results: <b>The</b> results <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> revisions and upgrades are very necessary and the entire re-analysis suggested 2 types of revision: (i) length of inserted fragments; and (ii) number of inserted fragments. <b>The</b> reanalysis also <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> determination of small regions of about 200 bases or fewer should be performed with more caution. Conclusion: Results <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of multiple recombination detection programs is very necessary. Additionally, results suggested two major challenges, one involving the difficulty of accurately determining the locations o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Dalbergia sissoo DC. (Family: Fabaceae) is {{a medium}} to large {{deciduous}} tree, is locally called 2 ̆ 01 cshishu 2 ̆ 01 d in Bangladesh. It {{is used to}} treat sore throats, dysentery, syphilis, bronchitis, inflammations, infections, hernia, skin diseases, and gonorrhea. This study evaluated the antinociceptive effect of the methanol extract of D. sissoo leaves (MEDS) in mice. Methods The extract was assessed for antinociceptive activity using chemical and heat induced pain models such as hot plate, tail immersion, acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin, glutamate, and cinnamaldehyde test models in mice at the doses of 100, 200, and 4000 mg/kg (p. o.) respectively. Morphine sulphate (50 mg/kg, i. p.) and diclofenac sodium (100 mg/kg, i. p.) were used as reference analgesic drugs. To confirm <b>the</b> possible <b>involvement</b> of opioid receptor in the central antinociceptive effect of MEDS, naloxone was used to antagonize the effect. Results MEDS demonstrated potent and dose-dependent antinociceptive activity in all the chemical and heat induced mice models (p 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 0090. 001). The {{findings of this study}} <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>involvement</b> of both peripheral and central antinociceptive mechanisms. The use of naloxone verified the association of opioid receptors in the central antinociceptive effect. Conclusions This study indicated the peripheral and central antinociceptive activity of the leaves of D. sissoo. These results support the traditional use of this plant in different painful conditions...|$|R
