60|$|My bunk was {{an upper}} one; and {{right over the}} head of it was a bull's- eye, or {{circular}} piece of thick <b>ground</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>inserted</b> into the deck to give light. It was a dull, dubious light, though; and I often found myself looking up anxiously to see whether the bull's-eye had not suddenly been put out; for whenever any one trod on it, in walking the deck, it was momentarily quenched; and what was still worse, sometimes a coil of rope would be thrown down on it, and stay there till I dressed myself and went up to remove it--a kind of interruption to my studies which annoyed me very much, when diligently occupied in reading.|$|R

50|$|Crude {{versions}} of conically tapered <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> joints {{have been made}} for quite a while, particularly for stoppers for glass bottles and retorts. These days, <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> joints can be precisely ground to a reproducible taper or shape. They are made to join two glassware pieces together. One of the glassware items to be joined would have an inner (or male) joint with the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> surface facing outward and the other would have an outer (or female) joint of a correspondingly fitting taper with the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> surface facing inward.|$|R

This paper compares {{the behavior of}} waste glass powders of different fineness with that of natural pozzolana, coal fly ash and silica fume. Chemical analysis, compressive strength measurements and durability tests were carried out to investigate the effect of <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> on strength and durability performances of mortars. Blended both with portland cement and lime, <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> improved strength, resistance to chloride penetration and resistance to sulphate attack of mortars more than natural pozzolana and similarly to fly ash. Mortars with <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> immersed in water for seven years did not show any sign of degradation and increased their compressive strength. The ranking of <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> {{with respect to the}} other mineral additions was not affected by fineness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} {{technique}} {{of using a}} modified Kopans wire to localize <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> pulmonary nodules prior to resection. Methods: CT-guided preoperative localization of <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> nodules was performed using the modified Kopans wire. Results: In both cases, the wire successfully localized the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> nodule and the surgeon was able to remove the nodule during video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. Conclusions: Preoperative CT-guided insertion of the modified Kopans wire can result in successful wedge resection of <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> nodules.

50|$|In {{motion picture}} cameras, the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> is a small, usually {{removable}} piece of transparent glass that sits between the rotary disc shutter and the viewfinder. The <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> usually contains precise markings {{to show the}} camera operator {{the boundaries of the}} frame or the center reticle, or any other important information. Because the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> is positioned between the mirror shutter and the viewfinder, it does not interfere with the image reaching the film and is therefore not recorded over the final image, but rather serves as a reference for the camera operator.|$|R
5000|$|To {{operate the}} view camera, the {{photographer}} opens the shutter on the lens to focus and compose {{the image on}} a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> plate on the rear standard. The rear standard holds the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> in the same plane that the film later occupies—so that an image focused on the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> {{is focused on the}} film. The <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> image can be somewhat dim and difficult to view in bright light. Photographers often use a focusing cloth or [...] "dark cloth" [...] over their heads and the rear of the camera. The dark cloth shrouds the viewing area and keeps environmental light from obscuring the image. In the dark space created by the dark cloth, the image appears as bright as it can, so the photographer can view, focus, and compose the image.|$|R

40|$|Lamp glass {{rational}} utilization {{problem is}} actual over the world. The main {{aim of the}} work is to develop technology for utilizing waste of lamp bore-silicate glass as micro-filler for traditional and self-compacting concrete. <b>Ground</b> <b>glass</b> effect is investigated and compared to traditional micro fillers of concrete. The best compressive strength results are achieved by using silica fume combination with additionally <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> as complex admixture. Concrete mixes containing silica fume and <b>ground</b> bore-silicate <b>glass</b> perform long-term hard-ening effect, which may be explained by puzzolanic reactions with cement components. The experimental program has been elaborated for investigation of <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> material as micro filler for self-compacting concrete. Flowing characteristics of mix are tested using modern EN standards. Obtained results confirm a possibility of applying a <b>ground</b> bore-silicate lamp <b>glass</b> as effective alternative micro filler for traditional and self-compacting concrete mixture...|$|R

50|$|Focussing {{of these}} plate cameras {{was by the}} use of a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> screen at the point of focus. Because lens design only allowed rather small {{aperture}} lenses, the image on the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> screen was faint and most photographers had a dark cloth to cover their heads to allow focussing and composition to be carried out more easily. When focus and composition were satisfactory, the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> screen was removed and a sensitised plate put in its place protected by a dark slide. To make the exposure, the dark slide was carefully slid out and the shutter opened and then closed and the dark slide replaced.|$|R
