40|$|ABSTRACT Concrete {{is a major}} {{material}} {{in the construction industry}} in Nigeria and the world at large, either mass concrete alone or sometimes complimented with other materials like steel. Calcined <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> is cast that has been subjected to great heat. The primary aim of this research was to determine the strength characteristics of concrete incorporating calcined <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> as partial replacement of cement. The objectives were to to obtain the optimum percentage of calcined <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> {{that can be used to}} replace cement in a given concrete mix, and to examine the physical and chemical properties of the admixture (calcined <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast).</b> From the tests carried out on the characteristic of concrete using <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> as a pozzolana, it was concluded that; the initial and final setting time of the concrete containing <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> increases with the increase in <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> content. The specific gravity of calcined <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> is 2. 38. The bulk density of calcined <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> is 1294 kg/m 3. In all mixes, compressive strength decreased with increase in calcined <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> replacement. The compressive strength of concrete obtained ranged from 25. 16 to 15. 66 N/mm 2 with 0, 10, 20, 30...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{removing}} pollutants from aqueous wastewater is growing {{with the increase}} in water pollution owing to enhanced industrial activities. Three <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> soil types were studied. Modified and unmodified types were prepared and used for removal of lead and Chromium ions. At about 298 K, the <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> soil types, modified and unmodified removed lead and Chromium ions from aqueous solution. Both equilibrium and dynamic sorption experiments showed that physically and chemically modified <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> soils removed lead and chromium ions better than the unmodified form. The equilibrium data fitted well into Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The unmodified <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> soil with a dynamic equilibrium constant, Kc of 266 performed better in lead(ii) ion removal than chromium(vi) ion with a dynamic equilibrium constant of 4 at 298 K. �G°, the standard free energy change of adsorption of Pb 2 + and Cr 6 + onto unmodified <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> soil is negative which implied spontaneity and feasibility of adsorption process.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of nutritional and microbial parameters {{was conducted on}} two types of biogenetic structures of <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> (8. 7 cm in height, 7 casts/ 1 m× 1 m) formed by litter eating Pheretima sp., and mound (64 cm in height, 1. 0 mounds/ 10 m× 50 m) built by fungus growing termite, Macrotermes gilvus, and compared to the surrounding bulk soil as control in the tropical monsoon forest in Cu Chi National Park of Viet Nam. The proportion of the sand in the <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> was {{higher than in the}} surrounding bulk soil, and the clay fraction in the termite mound was 1. 6 times higher than that found in the surrounding soil, indicating the different selection by the earthworm or termite for soil particles. Earthworm casts were different from termite mounds in their organic C contents which were approximately seven times as high. Bacterial counts and soil enzymatic activities of β-glucosidase in casts were greatly higher than in the ambient soils, although microbial population and available N and P in the termite mound were significantly lower than those measured in their surrounding soils. On the whole, these results would suggest that plant nutrition is stored in the <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast,</b> but the mound soils of fungus growing termite is infertile...|$|E
40|$|Spores and infective propagules of {{vesicular-arbuscular}} (VA) mycorrhiza {{were examined}} in <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> and field soils collected from three different soil management treatments (zero tillage with straw amendment, deep tillage without amendment (bare), and zero tillage with previous perennial cropping of Stylosanthes hamata) on an Alfisol in the semi-arid tropics (SAT) of India. The average mean of spore counts and most probable number (MPN) of infective propagules of VA mycorrhiza (VAM) were significantly (P <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> than in field soil across the three soil management treatments.

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{interesting}} sampling medium - <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> was examined {{in a highly}} Hg contaminated area. Enrichment factor (EF) {{has been applied to}} assess elevated concentrations of analyzed elements in <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> and to determine elevated concentrations of these elements in soils and casts with regard to European average concentrations in topsoil. In a previous study (Teršič & Gosar, 2012) it was shown that Hg contents and dispersion in casts from studied roasting site are comparable to those in soil, which indicates that soil contamination is substantially reflected in contamination of <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts.</b> Therefore the comparison between elemental concentrations in <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> and soil was investigated with the intention to assess the reflection of possible soil contamination in casts. Besides Hg contamination, elevated concentrations of As, Ca, Cd, Mo, Pb and U were also determined in <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts.</b> The calculated EFs show moderate enrichment of casts with Ca, Sr and P and minimal enrichment with Mg, Zn and Cu. Cast, SOM (surface organic matter rich soil layer) and soil enrichments with regard to the European averages show extreme enrichment of all studied media with Hg, followed by significant enrichment with Mo and Cd and moderate enrichment with As. Spatial distributions of analyzed elements in casts mostly show similar pattern as in soil, however, because of the different nature of different earthworm species and specific properties of different elements, the data about cast contamination can only serve as an approximate prediction about the dispersion and distribution of contaminant in soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{associated with}} improvement of soil nutritional status by oilseed rape crop, leading to better performance of rice crop, in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems is little known. The {{present study was}} aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> produced during oilseed rape-growing season have positive effects on grain yield and fertilizer nitrogen (N) utilization in the subsequent flooded rice crop. A 15 N-tracing pot experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> collected from oilseed rape fields on yield attributes in rice and the fate of fertilizer N. Soil treated with <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> (soil: <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> = 4 : 1, w/w) (EC 1) produced 39 % higher grain yield than soil only (EC 0). EC 1 had 18 % more panicle number and 10 % higher spikelet filling percentage than EC 0. Aboveground biomass and harvest index were higher in EC 1 than in EC 0 by 20 % and 15 %, respectively. SPAD values in flag leaves were 10 % and 22 % higher under EC 1 than EC 0 at 15 and 20 days after heading, respectively. EC 1 had 19 % higher total N uptake and 18 % higher physiological N-use efficiency than EC 0. These positive effects of <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> on yield attributes offset negative effects of decreasing N rate from 0. 74 g pot- 1 (equivalent to the recommended field rate of 150 kg ha- 1) to 0. 44 g pot- 1 (equivalent to 60 % of the recommended rate). Fertilizer N retention rate was 7 % higher while fertilizer N loss rate was 6 % lower in EC 1 than in EC 0. Our study suggests that <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> produced during oilseed rape-growing season are expected to have the following benefits on the subsequent flooded rice system: (1) improving growth and physiological processes in rice plants and consequently increasing rice grain yield, and (2) increasing fertilizer N retention rate and hence decreasing fertilizer N loss rate and reducing environmental risk...|$|R

40|$|Quantification of {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} distribution patterns of soil fauna {{is a relatively new}} area of research, and has been proposed as the key to understanding the high diversity typical of soil fauna communities. Field research on the relationships among the spatial distribution patterns of trees, litter and earthworm surface casting was carried out in two agroforestry fields in a rugged area of western Honduras. Grid-based sampling at a scale of 2 – 20 m was employed to determine whether any spatial relationships existed among these variables at this fine scale. Each field was sampled twice at either 2 or 3 week intervals, to determine the short-term stability of spatial relationships. The spatial distribution of litter showed a strong pattern of aggregation, whereas <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> distribution did not exhibit strong spatial autocorrelation. However, the spatial distribution patterns of each of these variables were well explained by the spatial arrangement of trees in both sites. Fitted model cross-semivariograms explained between 70 % and 90 % of the total variation in cross-semivariance between tree density and litter cover, and between tree density and <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> weight. The results of the study suggest that farmers may be able to manipulate populations of earthworms indirectly by managing the spatial arrangement of trees within their crop fields. Planning the distribution of trees could allow farmers to create ‘patches’ of organic resources within fields, while minimising the negative effects of trees on crop growth due to competition for light, water and nutrients. Over the short time scale of the study, unusually heavy rainfall led to substantial changes in spatial distribution patterns of <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> activity and litter cover, which may otherwise not have occurred. This result emphasises the need to take into account short-term temporal change during ecological studies at fine spatial scales. Peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to test the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method in improving the biological properties of paddy soil. The indicators of improvement were measured by the number of <b>earthworm</b> feces (<b>cast),</b> and the population of some microbial and nutrient content in the cast. The experiments were performed by comparing the three methods, namely: (1) SRI, (2) semi-conventional, and (3) conventional, using Randomized Completely Block Design. Each treatment was repeated nine times. The experiments were performed in the paddy fields belonging to farmers in Sukoharjo, Central Java. The result showed that the SRI (application of 1 tons ha- 1 of vermicompost + 50 % of inorganic fertilizer dosage) tends {{to increase the number of}} <b>earthworms</b> <b>cast.</b> It is an indicator of earthworm activity in soil. <b>Earthworms</b> <b>cast</b> contains more phosphate solubilizing bacteria (12. 98 x 1010 cfu) and N content (1. 23 %) compared to its surrounding soil.

40|$|Earthworms {{were fed}} soil from two polders, differing in soil age {{and land use}} (grass and arable). Sterilised and non-sterilised moist <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> were, {{directly}} or after ageing (for 2, 4, 8 and 20 weeks), analysed for clay dispersability and polysaccharide content, either as such, or after treatment with water or K-periodate/K-borate. Results for casts were compared with those for field aggregates of comparable size that were treated similarly. Fresh <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> were very unstable. Soil age and land use influenced the stability of fresh casts: those from old polder in grassland were most stable, those from young polders under arable land the least. Casts and field aggregates from arable soil were much more susceptible to periodate treatment than those from grassland. Casts and field aggregates from the grassland in the old polder were least affected by periodate. When measured after water or periodate treatment, casts became more stable within the first 4 weeks of ageing. As this occurred both in sterile and non-sterile casts, microbial activity was not necessary for the stabilisation. Polysaccharide content within treatments did not vary over time, so changes in stability of moist <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> were not related {{to changes in the}} amount of polysaccharide. We conclude that reorientation of clay particles, leading to closer contact between particles and/or binding substances probably explains stabilisation of continuously moist <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Earthworm casts on {{golf courses}} affect the {{playability}} of the turf and can potentially damage mowing equipment. Traditionally this {{problem has been}} limited using chemical controls. It is estimated that 0. 6 % of the total UK land surface is occupied by golf courses, therefore, the land management strategies which green keepers adopt {{with respect to the}} application of chemicals has a major environmental impact. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the ecology and potential control of earthworm casting in golf turf in environmentally sustainable ways. A quadrat survey of earthworm casts was conducted over two years at five golf courses in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, UK. Using generalized linear models and forward multiple stepwise regression, an internally validated predictive model of earthworm casting activity was constructed. Annual activity on surfaces was predicted using five physicochemical parameters of which C: N and total inorganic nitrogen were the most important. Environmental parameters were also used to predict monthly earthworm activity, with evapotranspiration and rainfall representing the most significant variation. ' Mustard extraction surveys were used to investigate species diversity and community structure of earthworms. Four dominant species were identified (Aporrectodea rosea, Lunibricus rubellus, Aporrectodea longa and Lumbricus terrestris). It is likely that A. longa and L. terrestris, the two must abundant anecic forms, cause the greatest problems to green keepers as these are the largest of the four earthworm species. The microbial community of soil represents the earthworm's primary food source. An analysis of the microbial community size (using chloroform-extraction) and community structure (using phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] analysis) showed that different surfaces found on golf courses supported significantly distinct and consistent microbial communities. Differences in population size and structure were evident at different depths through all golf course soil profiles investigated. Individual surface types were comparable, irrespective of geographical location. Therefore different surfaces and depths through the soil profile on golf courses represent different earthworm habitats. An investigation of the effects of different construction techniques and materials used in the golf industry on the rate of <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> formation was made. This showed no effect of construction on the vertical distribution of earthworms, but the rate of casting increased on the sand dominated surfaces. It is proposed that {{this is due to the}} lower calorific value that this soil represents to the earthworms. This knowledge was applied in an <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> mitigation experiment, reducing casting rates by stimulating the size of the microbial community with glucose solution. Control through physical exclusion of earthworms to the surface using a buried mesh was also trialled and significantly reduced earthworm casts, however no causal mechanism could be elucidated. This study has advanced the understanding of earthworm ecology on golf courses, deriving mechanistic understandings of this system as a whole. This will lead to a more environmentally sustainable approach to the control of earthworms on golf courses. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Os tratamentos foram definidos a partir da mistura de seis concentrações (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 e 100 %) de solo e coprólitos. Utilizaram-se dois tipos de solo, eutrófico no experimento 1 e distrófico no experimento 2. Aos 34 dias após a semeadura avaliaram-se a matéria seca da parte aérea, da raiz e total da planta. Os resultados do experimento 1 indicam que o acréscimo de coprólitos a solos eutróficos promove máximo incremento de massa seca da parte aérea e total da planta com concentrações de coprólitos de 13, 49 % e 17, 88 %, respectivamente.

Soil pH for agriculture soils {{was significantly lower}} than for forest soils but the latter was significantly lower than for grassland. Significant increase in soil pH after inoculation of different species of earthworms in culture medium corroborates the reports of Basker, Kirkman, and Macgregor (1994). Darwin (1883) and Lee (1985) noticed that the reason behind the change could be the fact that different species of earthworms, including Lumbricus terrestris, secrete calcium carbonate by their calciferous glands. The pH values measured in our study observed to be lower may be because of the fields used with urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer added frequently. At some experimental site in the forest habitat, a higher pH value in fresh <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> compared with adjacent soil was observed. The higher pH of cast soil {{may be due to}} the ammonia secreted in the worm’s gut. In this study, soil pH tends to increase in the agricultural lands.

However at few experimental sites of agricultural land, soil pH was slightly increased with soil depth due to accumulation of basic cations. Lime concentration in forest and grassland soil was similar while lime concentration significantly increased under agricultural land. More or less a negative correlation was found between pH value of soil and earthworm species distribution in different habitats.|$|E

We performed feeding trials with the geophagous earthworm Metaphire guillelmi using C- 14 -labelled bacteria (Escherichia coil and Bacillus megaterium) cells, fungal (Penicillium chrysogenum) cells, protein, peptidoglycan, and chitin. The mineralization rate of the microbial cells and cell components was significantly 1. 2 - 4. 0 -fold higher in soil with the presence of M. guillelmi for seven days than in earthworm-free soil and 1 - 11 -fold higher than in fresh <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast</b> material. When the earthworms were removed from the soil, the mineralization of the residual carbon of the microbial biomass was significantly lower than that in the earthworm-free soil, indicating that M. guillelmi affects the mineralization of the biomass in soil in two aspects: first stimulation and then reduction, which were attributed to the passage of the microbial biomass through the earthworm gut, and that the microorganisms in the cast could play only minor roles in the stimulated mineralization and residual stabilization of microbial biomass. Large amounts (8 - 29 %) of radiolabel of the tested microbial biomass were assimilated in the earthworm tissue. Accumulation of fungal cells (11 %) and cell wall component chitin (29 %) in the tissue was significantly higher than that of bacterial cells (8 %) and cell wall component peptidoglycan (15 %). Feeding trails with C- 14 -lablled microbial cells and cell components provided direct evidence that microbial biomass is a food source for geophagous earthworm and fungal biomass is likely a more important food source for earthworms than bacterial biomass. Findings of this study have important implications for the roles of geophagous earthworms in the fate of microbial biomass in soil...|$|E
40|$|Keywords:   crop yields, <b>earthworm</b> <b>cast,</b> Inga edulis, land use, {{nutrient}} flows, nutrient stocks, nutrient management, slash {{and burn}} A field {{study was conducted}} on acid soils in the humid forest zone of Southern Cameroon, to characterize the traditional slash-and-burn land uses, assess the major effects of land use change on soil nutrient stocks, flows, and soil biological quality, and to explore alternatives for sustainable land management. The typical land use chronosequence in the area after forest felling includes essep (cucumber-based), banana, and afup (groundnut/cassava-based), and is interrupted by short (after banana) and long (after afup) fallows. Moreover, farmers have cocoa farms where many shade trees are kept.   Yield declines in farmers' fields were attributed to diseases and weed infestation (56 %) and soil properties (44 %).    Burning is practiced prior to essep, and prior to afup.   It reduces the weed seed-bank, cleans the field and improves short-term soil fertility, but, together with changing land use, it strongly reduces standing biomass, carbon and nutrient stocks in the vegetation.   The forest carbon stock decreased from 199 Mg. ha - 1 to 102 Mg. ha - 1 in essep, and to 64 Mg. ha - 1 in banana farm.   Nutrient stocks showed the same trend, but Chromolaena short fallow, that followed banana, recovered most of the P.   The cocoa plantation had 53 % of the carbon stocks of the original forest.   Soil carbon stock was less affected than vegetation stocks. Burning increased P, K, Ca and Mg available stocks in essep and afup.   Lowest 'system' C and N occurred in afup, which {{is followed by a}} long fallow to restore soil fertility. The nutrient balance at farm level was strongly negative, i. e.,   - 72. 6 kg N, - 4. 8 kg P and - 38. 2 kg K ha - 1 yr - 1, showing its 'no external input' character, where food and wood are derived from natural stocks.   Major losses were   due to burning, leaching and the non-recycling of   farm residues. Only the cocoa farm had a positive nutrient balance: + 9. 6 kg N, + 1. 4 kg P and + 7. 6 kg K ha - 1. yr - 1, as burning is absent, leaching modest, and deep capture by shade trees providing inputs to the productive system.   Simple scenarios showed that recycling farm residues is able to redress the P and K balance, and avoiding burning could even turn the entire nutrient balance positive.   Burning also negatively affected earthworm density and casting activities. Up to 95 % loss in density was recorded, and casting activity was inhibited during 14 and 19 months in land use systems following afup and essep respectively.   Inga fallow proved to favour rapid and intensive casting just as the forest ecosystem.   Total cast production was: 5. 9 Mg. ha - 1 in afup, 3. 2 Mg. ha - 1 in forest and Inga, and 2. 9 Mg. ha - 1 in essep after two years, but although the casts were richer in nutrients than the topsoil, the nutrients recycled from casts alone were insufficient for sustained crop production.     Inga edulis was found to be a suitable planted fallow, providing several benefits to farmers and follow-up crops.     Inga fallows produce more biomass (between 44. 5 and 62 Mg ha - 1), and accumulate more C and N than natural fallow.   Maize following Inga fallow yielded 800 to 2200 kg. ha - 1, against a mere 200 - 400 kg. ha - 1 after natural fallow.    Burning Inga residues gave ngon (cucumber) production of 300 kg. ha - 1, which is similar to yields obtained in essep following natural forest.   Mulching instead of burning, however, only gave 50 kg. ha - 1. An innovative on-farm approach was used in {{the development and implementation of}} planted fallows, ensuring high adoption.   Inga edulis planted fallow can play a leading role among strategies to fight the gradual process of land degradation in the land use chronosequence, providing wood and fruits, and mimicking the natural forest to a considerable extent...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} earthworm (Aporrectodea giardi) activity on soil properties and on atrazine (AT) adsorption and biodegradation by comparing a coarse-textured smectite-free wetland soil (Brittany, France) with the <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> derived from the top horizon of this soil. Casts are characterized by lower pH, are enriched in organic carbon (OC) and clay content, have a larger cation exchange capacity, and a greater exchangeable Ca content. The clay mineralogy of the soil studied and casts {{is characterized by a}} muscovite-kaolinite-chlorite association. In addition, the clay fraction of the soil contains lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), which was not found in the casts. Atrazine adsorption isotherms were reasonably well described by the Freundlich equation and were all non-linear. The mean amounts of adsorbed AT for starting concentrations of 3 - 30 mg litre 1 ranged from 8 to 34 %, being largest in <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts.</b> Soil AT adsorption capacity was well correlated with OC content. Non-decomposed organic matter present in the coarse size fractions and specific compounds present in <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> (proteins, mono- and polysaccharides, polyphenols, sugars, lignin) and microbial and fungal biomass contribute to AT adsorption. Weak electrostatic (physical) sorption of AT on organic compounds and on mineral surfaces prevails. For casts, the formation of additional hydrophobic interactions between AT and SOM is proposed. We also studied AT biodegradation by the model bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP in the presence of soils or <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts.</b> An enhancement of the AT disappearance rate was observed in the presence of all the solid matrices tested compared with that obtained in an aqueous medium. The biodegradation rate was shown to be dependent not only on the OC content of the solid matrix, but mainly on its composition and structur...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this laboratory {{study was to determine}} the influence of a tropical endogeic earthworm, Pontoscolex corethrurus, on CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes from a tropical Ferralsol and microorganisms potentially involved in these gases emissions. CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes were measured during 35 days from soil mesocosms with and without earthworms. At the end of the incubation, 7 % of soil was egested as <b>cast</b> in the <b>earthworm</b> treatment. Then, <b>casts</b> which may be aged from few hours to 35 clays old were isolated from non-ingested soil. Different descriptive parameters (activity, density, and structure) of the microbial communities were investigated in the control, the non-ingested soils, and the casts. Quantitative PCR of denitrification genes encoding the nitrite (nirK) anti nitrous oxide (nosZ) reductases was used to study denitrifier density in the <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts.</b> The presence of P. corethrurus induced a significant increase in CO 2 emissions but did not affect N 2 O fluxes when measured at mesocosm level. Despite the absence of significant differences in C and N contents between soils and casts, the near infra-red spectra analysis clearly underlined a specific organic signature for the casts. Fungal and bacterial biomass significantly decreased (similar to 2 -fold) in casts compared to parent soil, but the fungal-to-bacterial ratio was not modified by the <b>earthworm</b> <b>casting</b> activity. Data suggested that bacterial communities, especially denitrifiers, were modified in casts. The relative abundance of nirK and nosZ genes increased in the casts while the genetic structures of total bacteria and denitrifying communities were slightly modified in the casts. This study highlighted the importance of <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> as a specific soil habitat where a subset of soil functional bacterial communities (such as denitrifiers) found favourable condition for their growth.

40|$|International audienceIn {{temperate}} soils, {{there has}} been little study of the abundance and water stability of belowground <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> under different tillage systems and soil depths. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of earthworm activity on soil aggregate stability under various tillage systems. Three tillage treatments were compared (moldboard plowing (MP), surface tillage (ST) and no-tillage (NT)). We present here an original method by which <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> were quantified via image analysis at 2 - and 12 -cm depths. In addition, soil aggregate stability expressed as the mean weight diameter (MWD) and factors involved in soil aggregate stabilization such as soil organic carbon, hot-water extractable carbohydrate content (HWEC) and water repellency (WR) of aggregates were measured in <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> and bulk soil. In superficial soil layers, the relative cast abundance was small and more abundant under NT than the ST and MP treatments. At 12 cm, the relative cast abundance doubled irrespective of the tillage treatment and tended to be higher with conservation tillage (i. e., NT and ST). Moreover, the MWD increased in casts compared to the bulk soil in this deeper layer. The increase inMWDin casts was explained in part by the increase in soil organic matter (carbon content and HWEC) and the WR. For the two depths, we found a positive relation between the MWD from the bulk soil and casts among the tillage treatments. We conclude from this study that casts located at a 2 -cm depth did not participate in soil aggregate stabilization, while at 12 cm the greatest structural stability observed under conservation tillage was explained in part by the production of casts...|$|R

We thus investigated the organic matter (OM) biochemical composition of biostructures using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and its relationship with selected biological (respirometry) and chemical attributes. 2 We found significant differences in OM quality and potential respiration rate among biostructures. These results were attributed to production patterns of biostructures and invertebrate feeding behaviour. A multiple co-inertia analysis was performed with NIRS, respirometry and chemical results. It separated (i) carton termite mounds, (ii) <b>earthworm</b> <b>casts</b> and organo-mineral termite mounds and (iii) termite sheathings and ant deposits. 3 These results suggest that NIRS spectra might be used as ‘fingerprints’ to identify organisms responsible for soil aggregate production.

Experiments were carried out with Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea caliginosa in 24 perspex columns (0 10 cm), filled with 20 - 23 cm non-polluted soil (OM 2 %, clay 2. 9 %, pH 0. 01 M CaCl 2 6. 4), that was covered by a 3 - 5 cm layer of aged zinc spiked soil (500 mg Zn/kg dry soil) and another 2 cm non-polluted soil on top. After 80 and 175 days, columns were sacrificed and each cm from the top down to a depth of 15 cm was sampled. <b>Earthworm</b> <b>casts,</b> placed on top of the soil, were collected. Each sample was analyzed for total and CaCl 2 -exchangeable zinc concentrations. Effects of earthworm bioturbation were most pronounced after 1, 75 days. For A. chlorotica, total and CaCl 2 -exchangeable zinc concentrations in the polluted layers were lower with than without earthworms. Total zinc concentrations in the non-polluted layers were higher in columns with <b>earthworms.</b> <b>Casts</b> of A. chlorotica collected on the soil surface showed slightly higher total zinc concentrations than non-polluted soil. Casts were found throughout the whole column. For A. caliginosa there were no differences in total zinc concentration between columns with and without earthworms. CaCl 2 -exchangeable zinc concentrations in the polluted layers were lower for columns with <b>earthworms.</b> <b>Casts</b> were mainly placed on top of the soil and contained total zinc concentrations intermediate between those in non-polluted and polluted soil layers. This study shows that different endogeic earthworm species have different effects on zinc distribution and availability in soils. A. chlorotica transfers soil throughout the whole column, effectively mixing it, while A. caliginosa decreases metal availability and transfers polluted soil to the soil surface.
