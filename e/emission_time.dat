The resulting <b>emission</b> <b>times</b> are compared against the classical simple man's model as well as against the more accurate quantum orbit model based on complex trajectories. The influence of the range of the binding potential (long or short) on the level of agreement is assessed. Our analysis reveals that the short-trajectory harmonics are emitted slightly earlier than predicted by the quantum orbit model.

40|$|We will shortly {{review the}} basic physics of charge carrier {{trapping}} and emission from trapping states within the bandgap of a semiconductor {{in order to}} show that high temperature CV-measurements are necessary for GaAs MOS characterization. The mid-gap trapping states in GaAs have characteristic <b>emission</b> <b>times</b> of the order of 1000 seconds, which makes them extremely complicated to measure at room temperature.

50|$|Loss of {{activity}} caused by photobleaching {{can be controlled}} by reducing the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, by reducing the frequency and thus the photon energy of the input light, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g. Alexa Fluors or DyLight Fluors). To a reasonable approximation, a given molecule will be destroyed after a constant exposure (intensity of emission X <b>emission</b> <b>time</b> X number of cycles) because, in a constant environment, each absorption-emission cycle has an equal probability of causing photobleaching.|$|E
5000|$|In quantum physics, {{coincidence}} counting is used {{in experiments}} testing particle non-locality and quantum entanglement. In these experiments two or more particles are created from the same initial packet of energy, inexorably linking/entangling their physical properties. Separate particle detectors measure the quantum states of each particle and send the resulting signal to a coincidence counter. In any experiment studying entanglement, the entangled particles are vastly outnumbered by non-entangled particles which are also detected; patternless noise that drowns out the entangled signal. In a two detector system, a coincidence counter alleviates this problem by only recording detection signals that strike both detectors simultaneously (or more accurately, recording only signals that arrive at both detectors and correlate to the same <b>emission</b> <b>time).</b> This ensures that the data represents only entangled particles.|$|E
50|$|Once the float's {{mission is}} over and the data {{collected}} by the satellites, one major step is to compute the float's route over time. This is done {{by looking at the}} travel time of the signals from the moored speakers to the float, computed from the <b>emission</b> <b>time</b> (known accurately), the reception time (known from the float's clock and corrected if the clock had moved). Then, because the speed of sound is known to 0.3% in sea, the position of the float can be determined to about 1 km by an iterative circular tracking procedure. The doppler effect can also be taken into account. Since the float's speed is not known, a first closing speed is determined by measuring the shift in time arrival between two transmissions, where the float is considered not to have moved.|$|E

The anti-correlation at small reduced velocities is more pronounced in Ar- 36 + Sn- 124 system than that in Ar- 36 + Sn- 112 system. The difference of the correlation functions between the two reactions is mainly contributed by the particle pairs with high momenta.

30|$|Overall, it is {{observed}} that TFP with CO 2 <b>emissions</b> over <b>time</b> has grown faster than TFP without CO 2 emissions for periods 1, 2, and 4. The faster growth of TFP with CO 2 <b>emissions</b> over <b>time</b> is consistent with Domazlicky and Weber [15], Färe et al. [14], and Kumar [18], who suggested that when accounting for changes in pollution as an undesirable output, the average productivity growth is higher than the growth when ignoring pollution. TFP with CO 2 <b>emissions</b> over <b>time</b> lower than TFP without CO 2 emissions was observed in period 3. However, in general, the manufacturing sector showed the best performance in period 4, characterized by a positive growth level for all TFP measures, including a positive growth level of its components: efficiency change and technological progress. Efficiency change is the source of productivity growth in periods 1 and 2, whereas technical progress is the basis of productivity growth in periods 3 and 4. In particular, three outstanding sectors have been noted as the best-performing sectors with the highest productivity growth for all periods: motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers; electrical machinery and apparatus; and basic metals. The best-performing sectors might be interpreted as a positive response to changes in the prices of oil commodities by maintaining the positive growth of TFP with CO 2 <b>emissions</b> over <b>time</b> during all periods.|$|R
