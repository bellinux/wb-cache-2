500|$|The {{death of}} Mara in February 1959 {{unsettled}} Bell and he experienced {{a heart attack}} later that month. He converted to Catholicism {{in the summer of}} 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife, Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney, a practicing Catholic. Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, [...] "I'd rather die watching football than <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> with my boots off." [...] Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field on October 11, 1959. The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans. Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and died later that day.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, {{the comedy}} picture Who's Been Sleeping <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Bed?,</b> {{starring}} Dean Martin, Elizabeth Montgomery, Jill St. John and Carol Burnett, {{was shot at}} the hotel. In the 1970s, John Lennon and Yoko Ono hid out {{in one of the}} bungalows for a week. Richard M. Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and presidential aide John Ehrlichman were eating breakfast in the Polo Lounge when they were informed of the Watergate [...] in 1972. In January, 1976, Peter Finch died of a sudden heart attack while sitting in the hotel lobby. Two months later, he was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Howard Beale in the film Network. His co-star Faye Dunaway stayed at the hotel after winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for the same film; in one memorable photograph she was seated by the hotel pool lounging back in a chair surrounded by newspapers and her Oscar trophy. The exterior of the hotel was featured on the album cover art of The Eagles's [...] LP [...] "Hotel California" [...] that same year. Two years later, [...] California Suite was filmed at the hotel.|$|E

[...] "Betty is only nineteen, and, as head of the family, I don't think she can marry without my consent. I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Anyway, if she does, I won't have her husband here sitting <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chairs, eating off <b>my</b> tables, sleeping <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>beds,</b> wearing out <b>my</b> stair-rods, helping himself----" ...|$|R

500|$|After this, Bond's next {{role was}} Phœbe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888–89). [...] Of this role, Bond wrote, [...] "My {{share in the}} most {{beautiful}} of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was delightfully easy and natural. [...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were very hard on me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] , the curtain rises on Phœbe alone at her spinning wheel, and Gilbert kept fussing about... until I was almost as demented as he was. [...] At last I turned on him savagely. [...] 'For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!' He gave me a final frenzied hug, and vanished." ...|$|E
500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman in his bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E
