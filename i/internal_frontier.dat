Within that framework, the paper then explores the case of Israel, and the impact of the settlement and spatial planning in the Galilee region on the formation of regional collective identities. The analysis shows that the process of settling the frontiers has given rise to ethnic, social and institutional fragmentation, particularly between Palestinian-Arabs, Oriental Jews and Ashkenazi Jews.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{investigate}} {{the function of}} the Roman army in the Negev. Evidence from archaeological survey and excavations of thirty-nine structures reveals that for 700 years Roman sites were situated to serve trade networks. Negev trade goods included frankincense, myrrh, spices, cassia, and silk - the epitome of luxury items in the Roman world. The importation, distribution, and taxation of these goods provided the imperial treasury with a steady revenue stream. Military units monitored road systems, secured supply lines, and performed local policing duties functioning, in effect, as agents of imperial administration. I begin with the period immediately prior to Roman annexation, when the Negev was home to Nabataean traders. This phase (1 st c. BCE- 1 st c. CE) ended with the formation of the province of Arabia, a move likely inspired by the need for new revenue on account of the enormous outlays required by Trajan's Dacian wars. For the next 200 years, the Romans maintained the preexisting Nabataean network. In the early fourth century C. E., about half of the established Roman sites were abandoned and new ones were built along a new route - not as a reaction to localized threats but instead to support more efficient sea-borne trade via Aila, on the Red Sea. In the fifth century nomadic tribes began to cause serious security problems. In response new infantry and cavalry units were posted to the region, but were stationed in existing forts so as to maintain the continued security of the trade networks. In the Negev, the Roman military acted as an extension of imperial administration to support the smooth functioning of trade. The results clarify ancient historical references to the Limes Palaestinae, a term that modern scholars have understood to refer to a militarized defensive line on the Negev frontier. The distribution patterns that I found do not support a military interpretation, either of a defensive strategy or an <b>internal</b> <b>frontier.</b> Rather, the region remained structured around long established Nabataean-era road networks that were used to transport luxury commodities. In the Negev, the Roman army facilitated imperial interests for economic, rather than military, security. 2019 - 01 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E

A perfectly discriminating monopolist, for instance, would be allowed to trade his goods and services under the conditions of a single-internal market just like before under the conditions of the non-single internal market; if it happens that elasticities of demand differ among member countries this monopolist would - by discriminating purely on the grounds of economic reasoning - discriminate on grounds of nationality when taken by its face value...|$|R

40|$|The phrase 'pastoral frontier' is {{generally}} {{used to identify}} the periphery of farm settlement; the advancing borderland between territory newly won by farmers and a region of untamed virgin land. This thesis is concerned with a different 'pastoral frontier', although related to the former. Using the term 'pastoral' as indicative of the ministrations of priests and ministers to their flocks, this 'pastoral frontier' is the ever changing border area where the Church penetrates society and society re-shapes the Church. The key figure is James Gibb, who led the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand for over three decades; a Scot who came to Otago after a short ministry in Victoria, and a pastor who faced the 'pastoral frontier' for fifty-three years. Gibb was a church leader par excellence; founding father of a national Presbyterian Church, Moderator, pioneer of social services and founder of church schools. He was a social crusader who emphasised a social ethic and social redemption. His Scottish Presbyterian conviction that the Church was duty-bound to transform the state into a Christian commonwealth led him {{into a series of}} public campaigns and political encounters that had as their goal the making of a less sinful New Zealand. This thesis argues that Gibb adapted the Social Gospel, the new social interpretation of Christianity emphasised by European, British and American theologians from the close of the nineteenth century, to the New Zealand 'pastoral frontier'. His central role in church affairs, and his placement as a campaigner and lobbyist in the political field, allow an assessment of his successes and failures as a social crusader to indicate the successes and failures of the New Zealand Protestant churches in their attempts to penetrate national life and mould society to their own design. The rise and fall of Gibb's social crusades reflect {{the rise and fall of}} the Social Gospel in New Zealand. Gibb's 'pastoral frontier' was not static and during his Australasian ministry he planted his social crusading flag at three frontiers:- 1. A Limited Frontier, 1882 - 1903. 2. An Expanded Frontier, 1903 - 1922. 3. A Contracted Frontier, 1923 - 1935. 1. A Limited Frontier, 1882 - 1903 This frontier was circumscribed by the narrow boundaries of Presbyterian interest and opportunity in Victoria and Otago. In the Presbyterian Church of Victoria Gibb found himself embroiled in a fierce conflict between theological revisionists and Calvinist Confessionalists. His ministry in Melbourne was dominated by the Charles Strong affair. In Otago he found himself in a provincial church planted by Free Church of Scotland ministers who lived in the mental climte of the Scottish Disruption of 1843. A provincial perspective, the rigid confessionalism of an imported theology, and attempts to impose Calvinist social controls over marriage, Sabbath observance, drinking and dancing, were the hall-marks of this Church's impact on society. Gibb's leadership of the Bible-in-Schools movement was prompted by a-concern to make the state education system accept Biblical studies as a foundation for all other knowledge. Between 1886 (when he arrived in Otago) and 1902 Gibb and his Church were not entirely dominated by intra-mural concerns but they were mainly concerned with polishing thsir denominational badge and attaching it to others. Towards the close of this period a developing sense of national identity aided Gibb in creating the united Presbyterian Church of New Zealand yet even then some of his Otago supporters were more concerned with Presbyterian hegemony than with the challenge posed by the creation of a national church. 2. An Expanded Frontier, 1903 - 1922 The 'pastoral frontier' expanded dramatically from 1903. Gibb responded with a more self-conscious programme of nation building. He failed in his attempt to manufacture one national Protestant Evangelical church, incorporating the nation's Presbyterians, Methodists, and Congregationalists. He succeeded in planting a Presbyterian minister and agent in almost every settlement, in town and back-blocks, and broke with traditional Scottish Church polity in so doing, by creating a new order of ministers-home missionaries. This expanded frontier extended to the Pacific Islands and into China with Gibb leading petitions for British control of the New Hebrides and attacking the opium trade to China. The Church still demanded the right to legislate national social control and crusades in favour of prohibition and Bible-in-Schools grew in intensity and impact, with Gibb encouraging back-block ministers to rasp-off pioneer rough edges and polish colonial rough diamonds. The 1914 - 1918 war brought conflict within the Church as imperial patriotism and Christian principles met in tension. Consolidation of settlement and post-war despair and failure to return to 'normalcy' ended an era of self confidence. 3. A Contracted Frontier, 1923 - 1935 From 1923 the 'pastoral frontier' began to steadily contract. The 'crusades' - Bible-in-Schools, Prohibition, Disarmament, and a united Protestant Church - all failed. The Church's national impact was further weakened by her failure to prevent increasing economic and political polarization within society, her failure to convince an increasingly mobile and pleasure-seeking society, her failure to create a disciplined and coherent national Church, the decline in dynamic that followed the closing of the <b>internal</b> <b>frontier,</b> state acceptance of social service roles, the impact of Barthian theology, and her inability to hold back or accommodate the flood of secularism...|$|E

The importance of immigration, asylum and border control is evident {{in the fact that the}} topic is presented as early as in Article 3 of Title I of the Common Provisions of the Lisbon Treaty.

40|$|The {{control of}} migrant flows {{was not a}} decisive {{function}} for European nation-states {{until the end of}} the nineteenth century. Across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, European states began to document migrants’ individual identities and to implement frontier controls, activities complemented in international coordination of information and policing. Passports and other identification papers became standard tools of movement from the middle of the twentieth century, as did systems of registration by foreigners. The abolition of <b>internal</b> <b>frontiers</b> in the European Union made border control between EU and non-EU countries a sharper demarcation of state boundaries, overlaying serous tensions between Western and Eastern EU states. Historically, European modernity was characterized by outward migration and state border controls developed especially to control exit strategy and to limit the loss of population. In the contempor- ary period, the question of state borders has been made salient by mass migration and more recently by terrorist attacks. The mobilization of European-born citizens as Islamic extremists draws attention to the relative success of the US and Canada in assimilating new immigrants and their offspring. These developments are discussed in this chapter with reference to immigration integration and assimilation, and the migration and security challenge to European state borders...|$|R
40|$|The current {{refugees}} crises {{has made}} Europe {{an emblem of}} the ambivalences and failures {{in the management of}} forced migrations in the contemporary era. Cradle of human rights, {{but at the same time}} dominated by the securitarian logic nowadays hegemonic at world level, in face of the biblical exodus of the last months Europe has exhibited the arbitrariness of its borders, both internal and external. Indeed, if the integrated borders management, subjugated by aims of migration containment, was been accomplished exactly in the years in which Europe enlarged itself, thus making concrete the promise of the abolishment of the <b>internal</b> <b>frontiers,</b> today, the call for the guard of the external borders put into question the same idea of a European common space. But securitization, as evoked by the idea of an “European Fortress”, represents only one of the two poles of a pendulum perpetually swinging between an Europe of Fear and an Europe of Hope. The origin of this European Dilemma can be traced back in the post WWII era, when the European migration regime was initially shaped. After describing its key features, the article will identify three main ambivalences which mark the European experience and its complex relationship with immigration...|$|R

The digital single market a recent concept developed {{in the context of}} the European Union goes beyond the Cloud computing IoT and Big Data that are present-day words frequently mentioned in country strategies. The aim of coming together into a single market is to maximise the benefits of technology while simultaneously preserving values we hold timeless. Expanding this concept and considering the configuration of a digital market in Albania is the underpinning of this paper. Goods and services provided on-line will grant a better access and improved service to the benefit of customers under conditions of fair competition and a high level of consumer and personal data protection. A single platform necessarily digital can incorporate the banking industrial education investment markets and contribute to their unification. This first step of placing the idea should be followed by considering components like digital infrastructure development digitally educated people collaborative economy and others. There is a vision for the country development with no timeline yet above and beyond the brainstorming approach...|$|R
