40|$|This report {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} human tolerance to acceleration at 1 G and changes in tolerance after exposure to <b>hypogravic</b> fields. It was found that human tolerance decreased after exposure to hypokinetic and <b>hypogravic</b> fields, but the magnitude of such reduction ranged from 0 to 30 percent for plateau G forces and 30 to 70 percent for time tolerance on sustained G forces. A logistic regression model of the probability of individuals with 25 percent reduction in +Gz tolerance after 1 to 41 days of <b>hypogravic</b> exposures was constructed. The estimated values from the model showed a good correlation with the observed data. A brief review {{of the need for}} in-flight centrifuge during long-duration missions was also presented. Review of the available data showed that the use of countermeasures (such as anti-G suits, periodic acceleration, and exercise) reduced the decrement in acceleration tolerance after long-duration space flights. Areas of further research include quantification of the effect of countermeasures on tolerance, and methods to augment tolerance during and after exposures to <b>hypogravic</b> fields. Such data are essential for planning long-duration human missions...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{discusses}} a {{model of}} the cardiovascular system and related subsystems capable of long-term simulations of the type desired for in-space <b>hypogravic</b> human physiological performance prediction. The discussion centers around the model of Guyton and modifications of it. In order {{to draw attention to the}} fluid handling capabilities of the model, one of several transfusion simulations performed is presented, namely, the isotonic saline transfusion simulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a short {{exposure}} to weightlessness on hemodynamic parameters of humans was investigated in seven subjects flown aboard the KC- 135 aircraft. Particular attention {{is given to the}} relationships among various hemodynamic responses to hypergravic and <b>hypogravic</b> states, observed for four different postures: semisupine, supine, standing, and sitting. Results are presented on changes in the thoracic fluid index, heart rate, cardiac index, and the coefficient of variation of the R-R intervals. High values of the coefficient of variation were found at the onset of 0 -G, suggesting that vagal cardiac neural activity increases in all positions except supine (where a small decrease was registered) ...|$|E
40|$|Since Apollo crews enjoyed {{freedom of}} {{movement}} and experienced {{many of the same}} problems as earlier crews, confinement had to be ruled out in the etiology of space flight-related changes. Apollo was a mission of physiological firsts: the first inflight illnesses were reported, and a series of cardiac arrhythmias occurred. The most important physiological changes were decreased cardiovascular responsiveness, reduced red blood cell mass, and musculoskeletal deterioration. Vestibular-related problems were also noted for the first time. Crewmen lost weight {{as a result of a}} hypocaloric regimen inflight and a tendency to lose body tissue under <b>hypogravic</b> conditions. Aldosterone production increased causing some intracellular fluid loss. Very few of the crewmen experienced any psychological problems after Apollo...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} simulation of a mathematical circulation model {{is used to}} study the alterations of body fluids and their electrolyte composition that occur in weightlessness. The behavior of the renal-regulating hormones which control these alterations is compared in simulations of several one-g analogs of weightlessness and space flight. It is shown that the renal-regulating hormones represent a tightly coupled system that responds acutely to volume disturbances and chronically to electrolyte disturbances. During <b>hypogravic</b> conditions these responses lead to an initial suppression of hormone levels and a long-term effect which varies depending on metabolic factors that can alter the plasma electrolytes. In addition, {{it is found that}} if pressure effects normalize rapidly, a transition phase may exist which leads to a dynamic multiphasic endocrine response...|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{now well}} {{accepted}} that exposure to the <b>hypogravic</b> environment of space induces a shift of fluid from the lower extremities toward the upper body, the actual physiological responses to this central volume expansion have not been well characterized. Because {{it is likely that}} the fluid and electrolyte response to hypogravity plays a critical role in the development of Cardiovascular Deconditioning, elucidation of these mechanisms is of critical importance. The goal of flight experiment 223, scheduled to fly on SLS- 2, is the definition of the basic renal, fluid and electrolyte response to spaceflight in four instrumented squirrel monkeys. The studies were those required to support the development of flight hardware and optimal inflight procedures, and to evaluate a ground-based model for weightlessness, lower body positive pressure (LBPP) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} for life sciences {{research on the}} lunar surface {{in order to determine}} the consequences of returning from extended missions in various low gravity environments and of transiting through high multiple gravity forces during decelerations is discussed. The functions of a lunar gravitational biology laboratory are outlined. Lunar science objectives include investigations in developmental biology including the evaluation of the capacity of diverse organisms to undergo normal development and the evaluation of the use of the lunar environment to study specific developmental phenomena in ways that cannot be accomplished by earth-based research. The need for musculoskeletal studies to examine the dynamics of osteoclast and osteoblast formation and breakdown and to address bone and demineralization problems is discussed. Biological adaptation to <b>hypogravic</b> environments and the effects of radiation and electromagnetic environmental factors are also considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of calcium loss during bed rest {{was found to}} be analogous to the loss of bone material which occurs in the <b>hypogravic</b> environment of space flight. Ways of preventing this occurrence are investigated. A group of healthy adult males underwent 24 - 30 weeks of continuous bed rest. Some of them were given an exercise program designed to resemble normal ambulatory activity; another subgroup was fed supplemental potassium phosphate. The results from a 12 -week period of treatment were compared with those untreated bed rest periods. The potassium phosphate supplements prevented the hypercalciuria of bed rest, but fecal calcium tended to increase. The exercise program did not diminish the negative calcium balance. Neither treatment affected the heavy loss of mineral from the calcaneus. Several additional studies are developed to examine the problem further...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether hindlimb suspension {{is associated with}} the development of cardiovascular deconditioning, male rats were studied before and after undergoing one of three treatment conditions for 9 days: (1) cage control (n = 15, CON), (2) horizontal suspension (n = 15, HOZ), and (3) head-down suspension (n = 18, HDS). Testing included lower body negative pressure administered during chloralose-urethan anesthesia and graded doses of sympathomimetic agents (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and tyramine) administered to conscious unrestrained animals. Both HDS and HOZ were associated with a small decrease in the hypotensive response to lower body negative pressure. The HOZ group, but not the HDS group, exhibited augmented reflex tachycardia. Furthermore, both HDS and HOZ groups manifested reduced pressor responses to phenylephrine after treatment. These reductions were associated with significantly attenuated increases in mesenteric vascular resistance. However, baroreflex control of heart rate was not altered by the treatment conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that 9 days of HDS in rats does not elicit hemodynamic response patterns generally associated with cardiovascular deconditioning induced by <b>hypogravic</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if fluid-electrolyte, renal, hormonal, and cardiovascular responses during and after multi-hour water immersion were associated with aerobic training. Additionally, we compared these responses in those who trained in a <b>hypogravic</b> versus a 1 -g environment. Seventeen men comprised three similarly aged groups: six long-distance runners, five competitive swimmers, and six untrained control subjects. Each subject underwent 5 h of immersion in water [mean (SE) ] 36. 0 (0. 5) degrees C to the neck. Immediately before and at each hour of immersion, blood and urine samples were collected and analyzed for sodium (Na), potassium, osmolality, and creatinine (Cr). Plasma antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone were also measured. Hematocrits were used to calculate relative changes in plasma volume (% delta Vpl). Heart rate response to submaximal cycle ergometer exercise (35 % peak oxygen uptake) was measured before and after water immersion. Water immersion induced significant increases in urine flow, Na clearance (CNa), and a 3 - 5 % decrease in Vpl. Urine flow during immersion was greater (P 0. 05) between runners, swimmers, and controls. After 5 h of immersion, there was an increase (P 0. 05) was observed in swimmers.
