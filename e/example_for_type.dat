There are three main versions of this conjecture: the unrestricted, the classically restricted and the level-restricted version. We discuss all three versions and illustrate the methods of proof with many <b>examples</b> <b>for</b> <b>type</b> A (1) n− 1. In particular, the combinatorial approach via crystal bases and rigged configurations is discussed. Each section ends wit...|$|R
