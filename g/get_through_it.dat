In a review by NME, {{the album was}} positively compared to Patti Smith's Horses, {{as well as the}} debut albums of the Ramones, Television, and New York Dolls, [...] and was branded as being in [...] "a class of its own", while Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote in The New Yorker that [...] "Pretty on the Inside is such a cacophony... very few people are likely to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> once, let alone give it the repeated listenings it needs for you to discover that it's probably the most compelling album to have been released in 1991." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

The track {{was one of three}} songs on the standard edition of My World that Bieber co-wrote. In an interview in the November 14, 2009 issue of Billboard, Bieber explained the meaning behind the song stating, [...] "It's a ballad about the feelings I had when my parents split up and how I helped my family <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> I think a lot of kids have had their parents split up, and they should know that it wasn't because of something they did.

500|$|Although Mass Effect 2 was {{primarily}} developed at BioWare's Edmonton studio, {{a new team}} of 30 people was set to work at EA Montreal in March 2009 to supplement the teams already working on the game. The new team was composed {{of a number of}} people who worked on the original game, but the majority was new hires. Overall, Mass Effect 2 was developed over the course of roughly two years and more than 150 people worked on the game. Hudson mentioned two significant challenges that interfered with the development: the 2008–2012 global recession limited the game's budget, and the team had to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> without impacting their ambitious goals. Additionally, due to the 2009 flu pandemic, a significant part of the team was ill during the last months of development, resulting in a loss of a man-year of time. Despite these factors, Hudson described the development of Mass Effect 2 as successful [...] "on time, on budget, and exceeding quality goals." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Change Your Life" [...] is a mid-tempo pop power ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and 21 seconds. Having {{elements}} of soul and urban contemporary music, its Instrumentation includes tumbling R piano lines and a pulsating, driving backbeat. The song begins with an emotionally frayed spoken-word introduction by Leigh-Anne Pinnock, [...] "She captures her reflection then she throws the mirror to the floor/ Her image is distorted, screaming 'Is it worth it anymore?" [...] 4Music said that the spoken-word introduction is reminiscent of All Saints' 1997 single, [...] "Never Ever". The chorus, [...] "Change, change your life, take it all/We gonna stick together, know we <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> all", is pledged by the group in harmony over a spiralling piano lines, cascading keyboard lines and rousing, chugging strings.

Written in the key of A major, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate". The singer continued to say that because of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E

[...] In an interview with MTV, Cox explained what fans would be able to expect from the song and why he felt Ross and Mill were [...] "the perfect fit."

Cox also added that Carey had committed herself to working on the album before she knew she was pregnant, but decided to halt its production until after she had given birth.

50|$|Kirby: Canvas Curse {{features}} special collectibles called Medals, {{which can}} be used to unlock secret features in the game, such as characters, sound tests, and alternate paint colors. There are three ways for the player to find a Medal. The first way is to get one in one of the main levels. Each level has three Medals to be found, all of {{which can be}} seen on the map if Kirby is in the correct area and close enough. It is often required that the player do something particularly challenging to acquire one, and the difficulty of the challenge is respective to the difficulty of the level. Another way is through Rainbow Run mode. In it, Kirby must complete a portion of one of the main levels, with the objective being either <b>getting</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> as fast as possible, or <b>getting</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> while trying to use as little paint as possible. Reaching a certain peg awards Kirby with one or more Medals. The third way is by defeating the lesser bosses outside of the main game with an A Rank on the third level in each of the boss battles.|$|R

[...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive.

Though Lionel was in shock, he took Luke in, Leigh stated, [...] "Lionel’s struggling to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> as fatherhood is thrust upon him. He just inherited a 16-year-old son unlike most people who get to watch their kids from a baby and slowly get used to them." [...] The storyline proved to be hugely topical, {{with the amount of}} single parent families in the nineties was at an all-time high.

[...] After initially struggling to connect with Luke, when he was involved in a dramatic bus crash Lionel realised how much he loved his son and even went to the extent of cooking him gourmet school lunches. After only knowing each other a year, the father-son partnership was broken after Lionel died in scenes that Freeman described as, [...] "draining". Luke soon became a father with his teenage bride, Josie Bergman (Karamia Muller) at age 16, similarly to his father Lionel.|$|E
2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of.
