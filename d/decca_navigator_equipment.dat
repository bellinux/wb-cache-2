50|$|The {{headquarters}} of <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> were at New Malden, Surrey, {{just off the}} Kingston by-pass. There was a Decca School, at Brixham, Devon, where employees were sent on courses from time to time. Racal, the UK weapons and communications company, acquired Decca in 1980. Merging Decca's radar assets with their own, Racal began selling off the other portions of the company, including avionics and <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> {{transmitter}} {{station was}} located here, {{one of four}} that formed the English Chain 5B. Designated the Green station, with a base frequency of 127.500 kHz, it's GPS location was 50.917°N, 00.150°E. John Pratt was the Station Master and he lived on site {{with his wife and}} daughters. After the closure the family moved to Hailsham. A combination of Euro law and the technological advent of the GPS system doomed <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator,</b> which first saw service on D-Day and was used to guide ships ashore.|$|R
40|$|Hardware and {{software}} {{aspects of the}} design of various microprocessor-based <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> radionavigation receivers are discussed. Two new hardware designs are presented. The Mark 5 receiver uses the "orange" channel of the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> transmissions, {{and is based on}} a design published by J. D. Last; but unlike Last's design, it computes a position fix by directly measuring the phase of the signal, using phase-locked-loop techniques, with software correction for interrupt latency. The Mark 6 receiver dispenses with the phase-locked loop, and uses instead digital signal processing techniques to ascertain the phase of the received <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> carriers. Details of several algorithms used in the Mark 5 and Mark 6 receivers are presented, and their implementation discussed. A phase-determination algorithm is presented which compensates for local oscillator drift and for skew error due to movement of the vehicle during the measurement cycle, and which appears to be particularly resis [...] ...|$|R

50|$|By {{this time}} the Loran-C and <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> systems were {{dominant}} in the medium-range roles, and short-range was well served by VOR and DME. The expense of the clocks, lack of need, and the limited accuracy of a long wave system eliminated {{the need for such}} a system for many roles.|$|R
50|$|The Decca Company, a British {{gramophone}} manufacturer that, as Decca Records, released records {{under the}} Decca label, {{contributed to the}} British war effort during the Second World War. This military engineering activity resulted {{in a number of}} commercial ventures after the war, in particular the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System, and the Decca Radar company.|$|R
50|$|The biggest local {{employer}} {{in the twentieth}} century was the Decca gramophone record company. In 1929 this was employing 700 people, and making up to 60,000 records a day at its factory in Burlington Road, New Malden. The company diversified during World War Two to make radar and the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System.|$|R
50|$|After {{testing the}} <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System at Moray Firth in early 1944, Scott {{surveyed}} positions for the blockships and Phoenix breakwaters of the Mulberry harbour at Arromanches during the Invasion of Normandy. She then surveyed liberated harbours including Morlaix, Boulogne, Brest, Dunkirk and Antwerp; and surveyed locations for the cross-channel pipelines of Operation Pluto.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System was a {{hyperbolic}} {{radio navigation}} system which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving radio signals from fixed navigational beacons. The system used phase comparison of low frequencies from 70 to 129 kHz, as opposed to pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN. This made {{it much easier to}} implement the receivers using 1940s electronics.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System {{consisted}} {{of a number of}} land-based radio beacons organised into chains. Each chain {{consisted of}} a master station and three (occasionally two) secondary stations, termed Red, Green and Purple. Ideally, the secondaries would be positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with the master at the centre. The baseline length, that is, the master-secondary distance, was typically 60-120 nmi km.|$|R

Dawson was a Commander in the Royal Navy {{and like}} his father a {{prominent}} member of The Castaways' Club and was club Chairman from 1960-65. He was with Dawson & Forbes Ltd, investment bankers, and was {{a director of the}} British Tyre and Rubber Company between 1924 and 1969 and of <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> Company between 1945 and 1975.|$|R
50|$|Accurate heading {{information}} was {{supplied by the}} Azimuth Datum Instrument (ADI), a star tracker mounted on a periscope so that it projected its display on a plate {{in front of the}} navigator. Using angle measurements similar to those taken with a sextant, the aircraft heading could be accurately determined. For initial position fixes, Gee was replaced with the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System (Mark 6), which directly output measurements on three dials.|$|R
25|$|Mann's {{expertise}} in signals {{took him into}} civil service on familiar ground. He became the Civil Aviation Signals representative in Cairo, starting in 1945. He moved {{on to become the}} Director of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Civil Aviation from 1948 to 1950. He then became Director-General of Civil Aviation Navigational Services until his second retirement in 1959. He would spend the next two years representing the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> Company before returning to England.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1960s, ICAO {{began the}} process of {{introducing}} a standardized radio navigation system for medium-area coverage {{on the order of}} a few hundred kilometres. This system would replace the older Low-frequency radio range and similar systems used to navigate over national ranges. A number of proposals were submitted, including ones based solely on angle measurements like VOR, solely on distance measures like DME, combinations, or systems that output a location directly, like <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> and Loran-C.|$|R

50|$|After {{the end of}} World War II the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> Co. Ltd. {{was formed}} (1945) and the system {{expanded}} rapidly, particularly in areas of British influence; at its peak it was deployed {{in many of the}} world's major shipping areas. More than 15,000 receiving sets were in use aboard ships in 1970. There were 4 chains around England, 1 in Ireland and 2 in Scotland, 12 in Scandinavia (5 each in Norway and Sweden and 1 each in Denmark and Finland), a further 4 elsewhere in northern Europe and 2 in Spain.|$|R
50|$|The {{gyrocompass}} {{was introduced}} in 1908 while ship's radar came in after the 1930s. Radar is also used on land for monitoring the position of shipping, for example in the Strait of Dover which is the busiest area of sea in the world. The <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System was a hyperbolic radio navigation system that was installed around the coasts of Britain in the 1940s. It was phased out after the introduction of satellite-based navigation from the 1960s. The echo sounding {{was introduced in}} the 1930s to determine water depth.|$|R
50|$|The {{first such}} {{system to be}} used was the World War II-era Gee, {{introduced}} by the Royal Air Force for use by RAF Bomber Command. This {{was followed by the}} <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System in 1944 by the Royal Navy, along with LORAN by the US Navy for long-range navigation at sea. Post war examples including the well-known US Coast Guard LORAN-C, the international Omega system, and the Soviet Alpha and CHAYKA. All of these systems saw use until their wholesale replacement by satellite navigation systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Delrac system, Dectra was {{essentially}} the normal <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> {{system with the}} modification of several existing transmitter sites. These were located at the East Newfoundland and Scottish chains, which were equipped with larger antennas and high-power transmitters, broadcasting 20 times {{as much energy as}} normal chain stations. Given that the length of the chain baselines did not change, and were relatively short, at long distance the signal offered almost no accuracy. Instead, Dectra operated as a track system; aircraft would navigate by keeping themselves within the signal defined by a particular Decca lane.|$|R
50|$|Another British {{system from}} the same era was <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator.</b> This {{differed}} from Gee primarily in that the signals were not pulses delayed in time, but continuous signals delayed in phase. By comparing the phase of the two signals, the time difference information as Gee was returned. However, this was far easier to display; the system could output the phase angle to a pointer on a dial removing any need for visual interpretation. As the circuitry for driving this display was quite small, Decca systems normally used three such displays, allowing quick and accurate reading of multiple fixes. Decca found its greatest use post-war on ships, and remained in use into the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In the UK and Ireland, {{the system}} was {{implemented}} as a maritime navigation aid {{to fill the gap}} left by the demise of the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System in 2000. With a network of 12 transmitters sited around the coastline and three control stations, it was set up in 1998 by the countries' respective General Lighthouse Authorities (GLA) — Trinity House covering England, Wales and the Channel Islands, the Northern Lighthouse Board covering Scotland and the Isle of Man and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, covering the whole of Ireland. Transmitting on the 300-kHz band, the system underwent testing and two additional transmitters were added before {{the system was}} declared operational in 2002.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> Company of London {{sued the}} United States {{government}} over patent infringements, {{claiming that the}} Omega system {{was based on a}} proposed earlier Decca system known as DERLAC, Decca Long Range Area Coverage, that had been disclosed to the US in 1954. Decca cited original US documents showing the Omega system was originally referred to as DERLAC/Omega. Decca won the case and was awarded $44,000,000 in damages. Decca had previously sued the US government for alleged patent infringements over the LORAN C system in 1967. Decca won its case, but as the navigation system was judged to be a military one, no damages were paid by the US.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} its many advantages, {{the high cost of}} {{implementing}} a Loran-C receiver made it uneconomical for many users. Additionally, as military users upgraded from Loran-A to Loran-C, large numbers of surplus Loran-A receivers were dumped on the market. This made Loran-A popular in spite of being less accurate and fairly difficult to operate. By the early 1970s the introduction of integrated circuits combining a complete radio receiver began to greatly reduce the complexity of Loran-A measurements, and fully automated units the size of a stereo receiver became common. For those users requiring higher accuracy, Decca had considerable success with their <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> system, and produced units that combined both receivers, using Loran to eliminate the ambiguities in Decca.|$|R
50|$|The tanker did {{not have}} a {{scheduled}} route and as such lacked a complement of full scale charts of the Scilly Islands. To navigate the region, the vessel used LORAN, but not the more accurate <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator.</b> When a collision with a fishing fleet became imminent, there was some confusion between the Master and the helmsman as to their exact position. Significant further delay arose due to uncertainty as to whether the vessel was in manual or automatic steering mode. By the time the problem was corrected, a grounding was unavoidable. In the hours and days to follow, extensive attempts to float the vessel off the reef proved unsuccessful, and even resulted in the death of a member of the Dutch salvage team, Captain Stal.|$|R
40|$|This report {{begins with}} a {{synopsis}} {{of the principles of}} operation of the two most widely used low-frequency terrestrial radionavigation systems, the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System (DNS) and Loran-C. The main types of receiver architecture for each system are reviewed. The main part of the report describes the hardware and software components of a microprocessor-based "test-bed" for developing new algorithms for low-frequency radionavigation. The system comprises a whip antenna and antenna coupler, a radiofrequency (RF) stage which converts the RF signal to baseband, a quadrature directdigital -synthesis local oscillator, and separate one-bit I and Q digital sampling channels. The high-level control program runs on an Inmos transputer, and a Motorola MC 68 EC 000 processor handles the low-level tasks. The transputer is programmed in Java, and a new Java cross-compiler which generates efficient transputer code has been written for this project. The use of Java for real-time programming raises some [...] ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{implement}} the timing measurements needed for a hyperbolic navigation system, pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN, and phase-timing systems like the <b>Decca</b> <b>Navigator</b> System. The former requires sharp pulses of signal, and their accuracy is generally limited to how rapidly the pulses can be turned on and off, which is, in turn, a function of the carrier frequency. There is an ambiguity in the signal, the same measurements can be valid at two locations relative to the broadcasters, but in normal operation these are hundreds of kilometers apart so one possibility can be eliminated. The second system requires constant signals ("continuous wave") and is easy to use even at low frequencies. However, its signal is ambiguous over the distance of a wavelength, meaning there are hundreds of locations that will return the same signal, referred to as cells in Decca. This demands some other navigation method to be used in conjunction to pick which cell the receiver is within.|$|R
