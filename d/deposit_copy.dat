The submission of legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> to the Lyceum library became mandatory with a decree published by the Austrian court in 1807, at first only in Carniola, except {{for a short period of}} French administration, when it received copies from all the Illyrian provinces. In 1919, it was named State Reference Library and started to collect legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> from the entire Slovenia of the time. In the same year, the University of Ljubljana (the first Slovenian university) was established and the library served its needs too. In 1921, it started to acquire legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> from the entire Yugoslavia. It was named University Library in 1938.|$|R
50|$|The United States Copyright Office {{requires}} a <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> {{of the work}} for which copyright registration is sought.

First, if a copyright infringement lawsuit arises, the owner may prove that the material that is infringed {{is exactly the same}} material for which the owner has secured a registration. Second, this requirement helps the Library of Congress build its collection of works.|$|E
50|$|The National Library {{was founded}} on 29 August 1919, one year after independence, as the Valsts Bibliotēka (State Library). Its first chief {{librarian}} and bibliographer was Jānis Misiņš (1862-1944) who made his immense private collection {{the basis of the}} new library. Within a year, until 1920, the stocks had grown to 250,000 volumes. Starting in the same year, all publishers were obliged to hand in a <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> of their works. Since 1927, the Library has published the National Bibliography of Latvia.|$|E
50|$|During {{the time}} of the {{independent}} Republic of Estonia from 1918-1940, the Library developed and grew fast. In 1919, the Library began to receive a legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> of all printed matter published in Estonia. In 1921, the first international exchange agreements were concluded. In 1935 the State Library established an Archival Collection of all publications in the Estonian language and about Estonia. This {{was the beginning of a}} systematic acquisition of printed matter on Estonia and the Baltic countries. In the 1930s, the State Library started to perform more functions than those of a parliamentary library - the collections comprised about 50,000 items and the readership included outstanding intellectuals, cultural and public figures.|$|E

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a review of}} current literature addressing {{the issues of the}} <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> scheme within the two decades after 1989. The dynamic development of the publishing market in Poland following the emergence of the new social and economic reality, and the introduction of new media, prompted librarians and publishers to postulate changes in relevant obsolete legal regulations that dated back to 1968. The conflict of, or incompatibility of, interest between the two sections were most apparent in demands submitted by libraries to retain full control over the publishing market in terms of the obligation of publishers to furnish to libraries their complete publishing output according to the <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> scheme. On {{the opposite side of the}} conflict, publishers demanded the number of eligible <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> libraries to be significantly reduced. At the time, library periodicals and publishing journals abounded with articles presenting opinions, views and suggestions put forward by librarians and publishers alike. A number of stages in the discussion can be distinguished: from fact-finding evaluations produced soon after 1989 and proposals referring to changes in regulations with regard to passing an act in the lower house of the Parliament (the Polish Sejm), appraisals of new legal regulations in the light of their actual operation, to a new debate on amendments and changes in the Act. The article is complemented with an extensive bibliography in chronological order...|$|E
40|$|What is a „Book"? In {{this article}} the author defines {{the book as}} any text carrier {{regardless}} of form. The article starts off with {{an account of the}} Swedish art historian Lars Vilks' activities at Kullaberg in Sweden. Vilks {{is best known for his}} stone sculpture on the beach which was later judged to be a book, given the title Arx, complete with ISBN-number and cataloguing data in the Swedish National Database LIBRIS. The University Library in Lund, which is a deposit library, has claimed a <b>deposit</b> <b>copy,</b> a task which is easier said than done. Arx is 6 meters high and 12 meters wide and weighs 150 tons. With Arx as his starting point the author contends that the definition of a book is not all that simple. He goes on to recount the history of the book starting with oral legends and ending with the electronic book, which he judges to be the next logical step in the cvolutionary proccss of the book. He also cites other examples of unusual books including imaginary books, books that were never written etc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. DiVA – Digitala vetenskapliga arkivet (DiVA Archive) – is a {{comprehensive}} description of a searchable archive containing the documents, which are published in an electronic format at Uppsala University in Sweden. The DiVA System, developed by the Electronic Publishing Centre at Uppsala University Library, {{makes it possible to}} reuse and enhance data originally entered by the author as the basis for creation of all metadata and the “digital master ” for both the electronic and printed version of the document, to store these documents in the local depository (DiVA Archive), assign a persistent identifier (URN:NBN), checksum the file and to send a copy of the documents to the Royal Library, the National Library of Sweden, to deliver a <b>deposit</b> <b>copy</b> to the National Library Archive. This paper discuss the workflow which has been established between the DiVA archive and the Swedish National Library Archive to support long term preservation and future access to the digitally published documents and, more specifically, the significant role of URN:NBN (Uniform Resource Name:National Bibliographic Number) as an identifier in different parts of this process...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the present status of China National Bibliography and bibliograhic control in China. In China, there isn’t any legal deposit law, {{but there are some}} regulations promulgated by the State Council and the General Administration of Press and Publications (GAPP, 新闻出版总署) under the State Council. According to these regulations, legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> of books, journals, newspapers and A/V materials should be sent to the GAPP (1 copy), the National Depository Library (NDL, 中国版本图书馆) under GAPP (1 copy) and the National Library of China (NLC, 中国国家 图书馆) (3 copies). Sometimes, however, these regulations are not very effective. Because NLC is not responsible for the ISBN registration and there is no legal deposit law, NLC is very hard to acquire all the new publications of China. Publishers give their top priority to the legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> to GAPP and then to NLC. Acquisitions librarians have to contact publishers every year to remind them to send legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies</b> and prepare reports to GAPP, so that GAPP can {{pay more attention to the}} NLC legal deposit issues in their management of publications. The legal deposit rate is about 70 %, not including children’s books, juvenile books, school textbooks and teacher’s manuals. To make the collection and the bibliographical databases as complete as possible, NLC has to pay extra money to purchase books without legal <b>deposit</b> <b>copies.</b> In recent years, NLC discusses the legal deposit issues regularly with GAPP to ask them to implement related regulations more strictly. We expect to see a higher legal deposit rates in the future. We are also appealing to draft a national library law, which should include legal deposit issues...|$|R
