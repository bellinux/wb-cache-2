500|$|The song proved {{popular with}} both {{young and old}} listeners. The public enjoyed hearing a {{supergroup}} of musicians singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying the record, knowing that the money would go towards a good cause. People reported they bought more than one copy of the single, some buying up to five copies of the record. One mother from Columbia, Missouri purchased two copies of [...] "We Are the World", stating, [...] "The record is excellent whether it's for a cause or not. It's fun trying to identify the different artists. It was a good feeling <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was helping someone in need." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1911, Mertz went to London to {{meet with}} the Australian {{geologist}} and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908–09 Nimrod Expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition. In his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as [...] "they have proved so good for the purpose & <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am as good as any one on skys." [...] While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 49Greenland Huskies, aboard the expedition ship SY Aurora, bound for Hobart.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Joshua Safran {{initially}} {{wanted a}} [...] "straightforward action show" [...] {{different from his}} past work, which included the soapy dramas Gossip Girl and Smash. He revealed {{that he wanted to}} do something with a law enforcement theme such as a political thriller about the NYPD after the September 11 attacks. He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." [...] He called the series a sexy romance and a political thriller, adding [...] "It's like, what would Die Hard be if Die Hard was weekly and was also a soap".|$|E
500|$|Titled Return to the Planet of the Apes, {{the project}} was put on fast track and almost entered pre-production. Rick Baker was hired to design the {{prosthetic}} makeup with Danny Elfman composing the film score. Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen were in contention for the lead role. [...] "I can't accurately describe in words the utter euphoria I felt <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> Adam Rifkin, {{was going to be}} resurrecting the Planet of the Apes. It all seemed too good to be true. I soon found out it was." [...] Days before the film was to commence pre-production, new studio executives arrived at Fox, which caused creative differences between Rifkin and the studio. Rifkin was commissioned to rewrite the script through various drafts. The project was abandoned until Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh pitched their own idea, with the apes going through a Renaissance. In the story, the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works, the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half-human, half-ape from the gorillas. Roddy McDowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the Leonardo da Vinci-type character they had written for him. However, the executive Jackson spoke to was not a fan of the series and seemingly unaware of McDowall's involvement in the series, and Jackson turned his attention back to Heavenly Creatures.|$|E

2500|$|In his 2009 book, {{entitled}} Analytixz, Griff criticized his 1989 statement: [...] "to say the Jews {{are responsible}} for the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe I would have to know about the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, which is impossible... I'm not the best knower. Then, not only <b>knowing</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> would have to know who is at the crux of all of the problems in the world and then blame Jewish people, which is not correct." [...] Griff also said that not only were his words taken out of context, but that the recording has never been released to the public for an unbiased listen.|$|E
25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case.

2500|$|All the album's {{songs were}} written by the band, with Conley {{providing}} lyrics. According to Conley, Sound the Alarm details the [...] "furious truth of my aching heart, my tumultuous emotional landscape, and my fractured psyche. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed to turn myself around after nearly destroying myself and my relationships with my strained emotional existence". Sound the Alarm was named {{after one of the}} songs on the album that Conley said, [...] "sums up the mood of the record". Describing the album's theme, Conley said it was [...] "desolation, like you're the last person standing after the apocalypse and you're alone and you're cold.

2500|$|Bowles {{could read}} at age 3 and was writing stories by age 4. Soon, he wrote surrealistic poetry and music. In 1922, at age 11, {{he bought his}} first book of poetry, Arthur Waley's A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems. At age 17, he had a poem, [...] "Spire Song", {{accepted}} for publication in Transition. This Paris-based literary journal served as a forum for leading proponents of modernism— Djuna Barnes, James Joyce, Paul Éluard, Gertrude Stein [...] and others. Bowles' interest in music also dated from his childhood, when his father bought a phonograph and classical records. (Bowles was interested in jazz, but such records were forbidden by his father.) His family bought a piano, and the young Bowles studied musical theory, singing, and piano. When he was 15, he attended a performance of Stravinsky's The Firebird at Carnegie Hall, which made a profound impression: [...] "Hearing The Firebird made me determined to continue improvising on the piano {{when my father was}} out of the house, and to notate my own music with an increasing degree of <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had happened upon a new and exciting mode of expression." ...|$|E

[...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics. [...] She said, [...] "This is the best feeling – it's just so amazing. I'm in shock right now. I think this will be the happiest I'll ever be in my life. [...] It's the absolute best feeling <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> trained so hard for this and all the hard things that I have accomplished and now to be on this team. [...] These girls are my best friends. [...] My team mate Kyla Ross, we have been best friends since we were six years old so it's just absolutely amazing to be going to the Olympics." [...] When asked about feeling pressure to win gold on vault at the Olympics, she replied, [...] "If I do my job I know I can get the gold medal.
