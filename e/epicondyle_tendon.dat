40|$|Introduction and {{objectives}} Tendinopathy, which {{is accompanied by}} structural changes to the tendon, is a common sporting injury. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nutritional supplement containing mucopolysaccharides, type I collagen and vitamin C (TendoactiveTM) on the clinical and structural evolution of tendinopathies of the Achilles tendon, patellar tendon and lateral <b>epicondyle</b> <b>tendon</b> in the elbow. Materials and methods A multicenter, open-label, non-comparative, prospective, exploratory phase iv study was performed. A total of 98 tendinopathy patients (32 Achilles, 32 patellar and 34 lateral epicondylar), who received a daily dose of 435 mg mucopolysaccharides, 75 mg type i collagen and 60 mg vitamin C (equivalent to three capsules of TendoactiveTM per day) for 90 consecutive days, were included. Every month, pain at rest and when active was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), joint function was assessed using the VISA-A, VISA-P and PRTEE questionnaires, and the tendon affected was characterized by ultrasound. Results A significant reduction in pain both at rest and when active was observed between the first control visit (day 30) and the end of the study (day 90) for all three types of tendinopathy. Thus, a 38 % improvement in VISA-A, 46 % in VISA-P and 77 % in PRTEE was observed on day 90 (P <. 001). Similarly, a 12 % decrease in the thickness of the Achilles tendon, a 10 % decrease in the patellar tendon and a 20 % decrease in the lateral <b>epicondyle</b> <b>tendon</b> was observed (P <. 05). Conclusions The results of this study show that the administration of TendoactiveTM is safe and effective for improving the clinical symptoms and structural evolution of tendinopathies of the Achilles, patella and lateral epicondyle tendons...|$|E
40|$|Elbow pain is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in throwing athletes and golfers. Medial-sided elbow problems such as flexor/pronator strain, ulnar collateral ligament injury, ulnar nerve conditions, and medial epicondylitis are usually more common, but lateral elbow conditions such as lateral epicondylitis and osteochondritis dissecans can also occur. Sometimes lateral elbow pain {{can be associated with}} mechanical symptoms, such as snapping or catching, or the location of the pain is posterolateral and not along the lateral <b>epicondyle</b> or extensor <b>tendon</b> origin. In these more rare instances, these symptoms can be caused by a thickened or inflamed synovial plica, 1, 2, 5 much like medial parapatellar knee pain can sometimes be caused by a hypertrophic mediopatellar synovial plica. 9, 10, 14, 15, 17 It has been our observation that certain athletes who engage in repetitive activities of the elbow, such as throwing a ball or swinging a golf club, especially at a high competitive level, can be susceptible to this problem. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical results of throwing athletes and golfers with posterolateral elbow pain caused by a thickened, hyper-trophic plica and treated with elbow arthroscopy and debridement...|$|R
