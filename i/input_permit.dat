40|$|Brendan Mumey September 16, 1997 Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} detecting errors in input data for a class of combinatorial problems. The data set is assumed to have a local-consistency property: every bad element in the data set is included in a detectably inconsistent set of elements called a gang. If a certain criteria on the gang structure hold, we give deterministic and randomized algorithms for identifying the bad elements. We also suggest a heuristic algorithm for when the criteria does not hold. This method has been used on real data sets from a probe-location problem. 1 Introduction For certain types of combinatorial problems, a few errors in the input may {{make it impossible to}} find a feasible solution. It would be desirable to detect these errors and remove them from the <b>input,</b> <b>permitting</b> a solution to be found. We consider an abstract model of data errors and propose algorithms for their detection. A motivating example is a physical mapping problem t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{simulated}} {{a network}} of 10, 000 two-compartment cells, spatially distributed on a two-dimensional sheet; 15 % of the cells were inhibitory. The input to the network was spatially delimited. Global oscillations frequently were achieved with a simple set of connectivity rules. The inhibitory neurons paced the network, whereas the excitatory neurons amplified the <b>input,</b> <b>permitting</b> oscillations at low-input intensities. Inhibitory neurons were active over a greater area than excitatory ones, forming a ring of inhibition. The oscillation frequency was modulated to some extent by the input intensity, {{as has been shown}} experimentally in the striate cortex, but predominantly by the properties of the inhibitory neurons and their connections: the membrane and synaptic time constants and the distribution of delays. In networks that showed oscillations and in those that did not, widely distributed inputs could lead to the specific recruitment of the inhibitory neurons and to near zero activity of the excitatory cells. Hence the spatial distribution of excitatory inputs could provide a means of selectively exciting or inhibiting a target network. Finally, neither the presence of oscillations nor the global spike activity provided any reliable indication of the level of excitatory output from the network...|$|R

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} co-activator YAP is an evolutionarily conserved regulator {{of organ}} size and progenitor cell proliferation. YAP is overexpressed at high frequency in many common human cancers and can directly drive cancer development in mouse models. YAP abundance and nuclear localization are negatively {{regulated by the}} Hippo kinase cascade, which, in epithelia, is activated by physiological cell-cell contact. Recent work in intestinal epithelium has established that YAP is constitutively inhibited by the Hippo pathway and entirely dispensable for normal development and homeostasis. YAP serves only in a standby capacity; should cell-cell contact be abrogated, as after intestinal damage, the loss of Hippo <b>input</b> <b>permits</b> increased YAP abundance and nuclear residence. In turn, YAP cooperates with beta-catenin to transactivate genes that promote stem cell expansion for epithelial repair. This interplay between overexpressed YAP and beta-catenin also drives proliferation of colon cancer cells. The dispensability of YAP in normal intestine makes YAP's expression or outputs attractive targets for cancer therapy.
