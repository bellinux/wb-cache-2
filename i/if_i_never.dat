500|$|About a {{year after}} release, Fox commented that he was {{surprised}} by how popular the game had become and though appreciative of the attention, he became stressed out over it. Fox said: [...] "It wouldn't surprise me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> made a game as successful again. That's fine with me though." ...|$|E

But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E

500|$|After the season, Hornish {{remained}} {{optimistic about}} an eventual IndyCar return: [...] "I hope they move the schedule so that somebody could do it. That's my goal. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> {{ran in the}} Indy 500 again or an IndyCar Series race I would probably say I would be disappointed about that." [...] He received offers to return after his departure, and in late 2008 was rumored to be returning to replace Hélio Castroneves the next season due to Castroneves' IRS problems. Castroneves was eventually cleared, missing only the season opener with Will Power driving for Penske during his absence. In November 2013, Hornish declined an offer to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing in the upcoming season after Dario Franchitti's career-ending injuries at the 2013 Shell-Pennzoil Grand Prix of Houston.|$|E
500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I {{have nothing to say}} on the screen right now. Even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of his}} death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|He {{frequently}} {{tells the}} press that [...] "My music is not Christian, Lecrae is." [...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E

500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> see you again." ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{three months}} since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in sundry booksellers' hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, {{in which a}} letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by {{one or two of}} them taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care not <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> be. The other, whom at that time I did not so much spare as since I wish I had, for that, as I have moderated the heat of living writers and might have used my own {{discretion}} (especially in such a case, the author being dead), that I did not I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because myself have seen his demeanor no less civil than he excellent in the quality he professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that approves his art.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1986 Globe and Mail interview, Shaver {{said that}} she was being {{considered}} for a role in Joshua Then and Now, which would have promoted her career much farther than Desert Hearts. Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to hang up the phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, that was fine [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, and here it was, and all I had to do was say yes. I had always wanted to carry a movie. Now, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> make another one, I've done this. For the first time, I feel I've done a complete work on film." ...|$|E

2500|$|McCartney {{has called}} it his {{favorite}} song of all time. In {{an interview with}} David Leaf in 1990 he stated, [...] "I was asked recently to give my top 10 favorite songs for a Japanese radio station ... I didn't think long and hard on it but I popped that [...] {{on the top of}} my list. It's very deep. Very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one." [...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time I hear it. It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm afraid to say that during the sound check I broke down. It was just too much to stand there singing this song that does my head in and to stand there singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E
