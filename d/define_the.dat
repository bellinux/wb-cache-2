The fruit bodies of A.coccinea, known only from temperate regions of Japan (Tochigi Prefecture), grow solitarily or in groups on rice husks, straw, or dung. They are found from summer to autumn.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} candela, all the base units will {{be defined in}} terms of {{universal}} physical constants, but without an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the constants and the base units. Thus six physical constants will be needed to <b>define</b> <b>the</b> six base units.|$|E

5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to <b>define</b> <b>the</b> different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to <b>define</b> <b>the</b> functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

5|$|Through this weaving process, aspect weavers {{allow for}} code {{which would have}} {{otherwise}} been duplicated across classes. By eliminating this duplication, aspect weavers promote modularity of cross-cutting concerns. Aspects <b>define</b> <b>the</b> implementation code which would have otherwise been duplicated and then use pointcuts and join points to <b>define</b> <b>the</b> advice. During weaving, the aspect weaver uses the pointcuts and join points, known as a pointcut designator, to identify the positions in candidate classes at which the implementation should be injected. The implementation is then injected into the classes at the points identified, thus permitting the code to be executed at the appropriate times without relying on manual duplication by the programmer.|$|E
5|$|When Congress {{created the}} Michigan Territory in 1805, it used the Northwest Ordinance's {{language}} to <b>define</b> <b>the</b> territory's southern boundary, which therefore differed {{from that in}} Ohio's state constitution.

5|$|Although most Final Fantasy {{installments}} are stand-alone {{stories with}} different settings and main characters, they feature identical elements that <b>define</b> <b>the</b> franchise.

Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, pop culture, and mythologies of cultures worldwide.|$|E
