50|$|The founders, a {{small group}} of men and women 20 years of age and just out of the {{military}} service, decided to pursue a life of pioneering and built their home in the desert. They had massive challenges presented by the desert: the burning sun, the heat, shortage of water, salty land and water, limited transportation and no secure source of income. They started making all kinds of agricultural trials growing grapes, pomegranates and vegetables; they raised cattle and chickens - all with little success. The dates plantation proved more suitable to the arid conditions.And then came the initiative to found a dairy that would provide milk to Eilat, which was expected to grow rapidly. Breeding milking cows in the desert was considered an impossible mission. In 1962 the dairy was founded, with four cows, the member who led the vision and the operation was Ori Horazo (1939-1966). The members tried to get funds from the Jewish Agency, but failed. Eventually, they received funding from the Israeli Trade and Industry Minister, Pinhas Sapir. In the first year, the dairy produced 500,000 liters of milk. By 2008, it was producing 62 million liters a year and controlled 63% of the Israeli dairy beverages market (making NIS400 million a year), and 49% of the <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> market (making NIS 250 million a year).

40|$|Background Osteoporosis {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{concerns}} in postmenopausal women which increase the risk of bone fracture. Osteoporosis reduces the quality of life; increases the medical burden in the society and also the risk of mortality. It has been suggested that bone health can be improved through higher dairy products intake. However, dairy consumption may not be a daily habit in all ethnic groups, especially for Asian. Due to lower estrogen level, there is high possibility of rapid bone loss after menopause especially in the first few years. This is associated with greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture. This study investigated the effect of dairy product consumption after menopause. Aim To investigate whether <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> consumption after menopause can bring beneficial effects on bone health in postmenopausal women. Methodology A systematic review was carried out to identify the clinical randomized controlled trials which investigated short-term (4 weeks to 6 months) or long-term (1. 5 years to 3 years) postmenopausal <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> supplementation on bone health. Outcome measures including bone biochemical markers, vitamin D status, parathyroid hormone level in blood and also bone mineral density were extracted and analyzed. Results Over a 20 year period (1995 - 2015), 11 research studies (5 short-term interventions and 6 long-term interventions) were identified in this review. All short-term intervention studies showed that bone biochemical markers were altered after supplementation of calcium <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> with/without vitamin D and calcium <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> with magnesium. This included lower bone turnover markers of serum C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) and procollagen type 1 N terminal propeptide (P 1 NP) in postmenopausal women. Meanwhile a majority of the long-term studies showed that calcium <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> with/without vitamin D supplementation after menopause reduced bone loss when compared to the control group. The findings suggested that <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> can improve bone health in postmenopausal women. Conclusion Both short-term and long-term postmenopausal <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> supplementation posed beneficial health effects on bone especially in Asian, by reducing the bone loss and also the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The findings of this review suggested that acquiring calcium and vitamin D from <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> after menopause may improve bone health. However, the dietary requirement of calcium and long term effect of <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> on bone fracture and health related risk should be further investigated. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

After 18 mo, there was no significant exercise by <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> interaction for total body LM, muscle CSA, or any functional measure. However, main effect analyses revealed that exercise significantly improved muscle strength (∼ 20 – 52 %, P < 0. 001), LM (0. 6 kg, P < 0. 05), FM (− 1. 1 kg, P < 0. 001), muscle CSA (1. 8 %, P < 0. 001), and gait speed (11 %, P < 0. 05) relative to no exercise.

The purpose {{of this research was}} to increase the retention of vitamin D 3 in Cheddar cheese by incorporating it as part of an oil-in-water emulsion using a milk protein emulsifier to obtain a fortification level of 280 IU/serving. Four oil-in-water vitamin D emulsions were made using sodium caseinate, calcium caseinate, nonfat dry milk (NDM), or whey protein. These emulsions were used to <b>fortify</b> <b>milk,</b> and the retention of vitamin D 3 in cheese curd in a model cheesemaking system was calculated. A nonemulsified vitamin D 3 oil was used as a control to <b>fortify</b> <b>milk.</b> Significantly more vitamin D 3 was retained in the curd when using the emulsified vitamin D 3 than the nonemulsified vitamin D 3 oil (control). No significant differences were observed in the retention of vitamin D 3 when emulsions were formulated with different emulsifiers. Mean vitamin D 3 retention in the model system cheese curd was 96 % when the emulsions were added to either whole or skim milk compared with using the nonemulsified oil, which gave mean retentions of only 71 % and 64 % when added to whole and skim milk, respectively. A similar improvement in retention was achieved when cheese was made from whole and reduced-fat milk using standard manufacturing procedures on a small scale. When sufficient vitamin D 3 was added to produce cheese containing a target level of approximately 280 IU per 28 -g serving, retention was greater when the vitamin D 3 was emulsified with NDM than when using nonemulsified vitamin D 3 oil. Only 58 ± 3 % of the nonemulsified vitamin D 3 oil was retained in full-fat Cheddar cheese, whereas 78 ± 8 % and 74 ± 1 % were retained when using the vitamin D 3 emulsion in full-fat and reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these studies was to further {{research}} on bone density in children with cystic fibrosis, particularly {{as it pertains to}} nutritional parameters and care. The first paper presented a comparison of a group of 50 children with cystic fibrosis to a group of 32 control children. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in any of the pertinent bone density measurements. Serum 25 (0 H) vitamin D was positively correlated with spine density z score in the cystic fibrosis group. The second paper, incorporating all of the information obtained from the first paper, describes an intervention study with the implementation of a <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> to determine the effects of additional calcium and vitamin D on bone density in the cystic fibrosis group. A follow-up bone scan was done. The <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> did not significantly improve bone density, but the <b>fortified</b> <b>milk</b> group did have significantly higher lung function scores on follow-up...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve the nutritional value of butter milk by blending with dry leaves of Moringa oleifera that can be used to prevent and correct malnutrition in women and children of this poor nation. Dry leaves of Moringa oleifera was incorporated into butter milk at three different concentrations i. e. 1 % addition (T 1), 2 % addition (T 2) and 3 % addition (T 3). All these treatments were compared with a control T 0 without any addition of dry leaves of Moringa oleifera (100 % butter milk). Addition of dry leaves of Moringa oleifera at all levels did not have any negative effect on pH and acidity of the <b>fortified</b> butter <b>milk.</b> Protein and ash content increased from 3. 41 - 4. 09 % and 0. 75 - 1. 13 % which was 20 and 50 % respectively at T 3 level. Iron and calcium content of the <b>fortified</b> butter <b>milk</b> increased from 0. 03 - 6. 77 and 117. 22 - 174. 34 mg/ 100 grams in T 3. Vitamin C, B 1, B 2 and B 3 increased by 168, 233, 393 and 624 % respectively as compared to control. Addition of dry leaves of Moringa oleifera at T 2 level did not have any significant effect on color, taste and overall acceptability scores. The overall acceptability score of T 3 was 6. 7 out of 9 which was more than 74 %. It was concluded that dry leaves of Moringa oleifera can be used at T 3 level (3 % addition) to formulate <b>fortified</b> butter <b>milk</b> with increased health benefits and acceptable sensory attributes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} whey protein {{concentrates}} on physical and rheological properties of yogurt were studied. Five commercial whey protein concentrates (340 g kg− 1 protein nominal) {{were used to}} <b>fortify</b> <b>milk</b> to 45 g protein kg− 1. Fermentation was performed with two different starters (ropy and non-ropy). Resulting yogurts were compared with a control yogurt enriched with skim milk powder. The water-holding capacity of the yogurt <b>fortified</b> with skim <b>milk</b> powder was 500 g kg− 1 and ranged from 600 to 638 g kg− 1 when fortified with whey protein concentrates. Significant rheological differences have been noticed between the yogurts fortified with different whey protein concentrates, independent of the starter used. Three whey protein concentrates generated yogurts with a behavior similar to the control. The two others produced yogurt with lower firmness (15 g compared with 17 g), lower Brookfield viscosity (6 Pa s compared with 9 Pa s), lower yield stress (2 Pa compared with 4 Pa), lower complex viscosity (13 Pa s compared with 26 Pa s), and lower apparent viscosity (0. 4 Pa s compared with 1 Pa s) than the control, respectively. The yogurts with the lowest firmness and viscosity were produced with concentrates which contained the highest amount of non-protein nitrogen fraction (160 g kg− 1 versus 126 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen), and the highest amount of denaturation of the whey protein (262 versus 200 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen) ...|$|R
