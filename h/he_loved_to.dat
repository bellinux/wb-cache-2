5|$|Maurice Princet {{joined us}} often... {{it was as}} an artist that he {{conceptualized}} mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked n-dimensional continuums. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.|$|E
5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> do on the farm), he {{made the mistake of}} announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E

5000|$|... "Timothy quietly pays attention. He {{has little}} {{interest}} in talking about himself and in his poems he rarely names the places he describes --he's no tourist. <b>He's</b> a <b>loving</b> observer. Wherever {{in the world he}} is he notices the everyday, the changes of weather, the ordinary, the harsh, the destructive, the lovely. He uses imagery but sometimes figurative language and you feel those comparisons are never arbitrary. He appears in the poems as a self, not a particular individual self but a self who expresses the universal. <b>He</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> write, <b>he</b> is devoted <b>to</b> the language, <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> read, <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> concentrate then <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> surface and contact the few people he is regularly in touch with because he cares nothing for the trappings of the literary world--he wants work and love." ...|$|R

25|$|Maurice Princet {{joined us}} often. Although quite young, {{thanks to his}} {{knowledge}} of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked n-dimensional continuums. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.|$|E
25|$|Liberace was a {{conservative}} in his politics and faith, eschewing dissidents and rebels. He believed fervently in capitalism {{and was also}} fascinated with royalty, ceremony, and luxury. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> hobnob with the rich and famous, acting as starstruck with presidents and kings as his fans behaved with him. Yet to his fans, he was still one of them, a Midwesterner who had earned his success through hard work, and who invited them to enjoy it with him.|$|E

25|$|J.P. {{also had}} {{a passion for the}} written word, and in 1958 he owned a bookstore in Portland, Oregon, “Days and Nights,” and carried many titles from Grove Press, which was at that time embattled in court for distributing Henry Miller's works, among others. Later when he lived in Lagunitas, (western Marin County) he worked at the Discovery bookstore in San Francisco. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> tell his friends about buying books from people who had just shoplifted them from the City Lights Bookstore up the block.|$|E
25|$|Casey {{was also}} a violinist and <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> play Irish songs for his fellow friars during {{recreation}} time, {{but he had a}} terrible singing voice, attributed to his childhood speech impediment. Other friars could not refrain from rolling their eyes or coughing, so he would excuse himself politely and sneak down to the chapel to entertain an invisible audience at the tabernacle. The friar often fasted, but ate enough. Until his late seventies, he was able to join the younger religious in games of tennis and volleyball, and even went jogging on occasion.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, Arnold stayed {{active in}} {{aviation}}, joining the Cubic Corporation Board of Directors, the Golden Eagles, the San Diego Aerospace Museum {{and various other}} naval aviation oriented groups. Ever the artist, he continued drawing and working in his garden. Occasionally, he would put an entry into the Rancho Santa Fe Garden Club show, almost always gaining a ribbon or two.

25|$|Spruance was {{an active}} man who thought nothing of walking eight or 10 miles a day. He was fond of symphonic music, and his tastes were {{generally}} simple. He never smoked, and drank little. He enjoyed hot chocolate and would make it for himself every morning. Besides his family, he loved the companionship of his pet schnauzer, Peter. Fit into his 70s, Spruance {{spent most of his}} retirement days wearing old khakis and work shoes and working in his garden and greenhouse; <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> show them to visitors.|$|E
25|$|Léonce {{enrolled}} in the new music school, Schola Cantorum, located in the Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris. His talent as an excellent singer and flute player soon became apparent, thus began his very prolific artistic career. During this time, <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> watch plays at the theatre in his free time and felt more and more drawn to the stage. He participated in small stage productions {{in order to learn}} the trade; he had to accept any offer that came his way to get paid, which often amounted to a pittance. At the same time he continued to take music and theatre classes.|$|E
25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Richard Brown was {{a veteran}} of Douglas Jardine's Bodyline side of 1932-33 and was Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1933. Born in Peru and educated in Chile and Cambridge University he was a big-hearted, self-confident {{red-headed}} all-rounder usually seen wearing a white silk handkerchief round his neck, with a big grin and an avuncular pipe. Over six feet tall and weighing 15 stone (over 200lbs or 100 kilos) <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> attack the bowling. Captured with Bill Bowes at Tobruk in 1942 Brown {{spent most of the}} Second World War in prisoner-of-war camps in Italy and Germany, where they organised games of cricket, baseball and rugby and lost over 60lbs (30 kilos) before being liberated by the Americans. A leg-spinner for Surrey before the war he became a medium-paced seamer in the late 1940s and organised cricket while working as a welfare officer in a Doncaster colliery. When the coal mines were nationalised Brown lost his job and became the captain and assistant-secretary of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1949. From being in seventeenth and last place in the County Championship in 1948 (and failing to win a county match between 1934 and 1939) Brown led Northants to sixth place in 1949. He was rotated in the England captaincy in 1949-50 with George Mann and Norman Yardley without success. He drew twice against a weak New Zealand in 1949 and lost to the West Indies in 1950. After Mann and Yardley had turned down the Ashes tour Brown impressed the selectors by hitting a six into the Lord's Pavilion while smashing 122 out of 131 runs inside two hours as captain in the Gentlemen v Players match, followed with three quick wickets, and he was offered the post the same afternoon. This was still the age when the England captain had to be a gentleman, even if he was a 'passenger' in the team, Brown having made only 233 runs (23.30) and taken 14 wickets (40.79) in his 9 Tests. Despite his age (he turned 40 on tour) Brown had the most successful series of any England captain in Australia; Taking 18 wickets (21.61) and making 210 runs (26.25), third in the batting averages (behind Len Hutton and Reg Simpson) and in the bowling averages (behind Trevor Bailey and Alec Bedser). Brown's jovial bonhomie and refusal to admit defeat won him many fans in Australia and he was a magnificent ambassador for the game, a role which the MCC regarded quite as important as sporting success, and the scorer Bill Ferguson said it was the easiest, happiest tour he had been on for over 40 years. After losing 4-1 to Australia he won 1-0 in New Zealand and beat South Africa 3-1 at home in 1951. At 42 he was recalled to the England team for the 1953 Lord's Test, where took 4/82 and hit 50 runs to ensure a vital draw in the year England regained the Ashes. Like many amateur captains he was happy to take advice from the senior professional and 'Brown conferred with Len Hutton before he made a bowling change...there was little room for doubt...that Brown had tremendous respect for Hutton's advice on the cricket field', as well he should as the Yorkshireman was recognised as 'a tactical genius, whose advice was often sought', Actually making a northern professional vice-captain was a step too far and this office was granted to the debonair Middlesex batsman Denis Compton, the first professional cricketer to hold that office in living memory. Though Brown also conferred with Compton on the field, it was only after he had spoken to Hutton. The young Trevor Bailey surprised everybody by drawing up plans for dismissing and containing every Australian batsmen, which were used to great effect in the series.|$|E

500|$|Australia {{had taken}} the series 3–0, Miller scoring 384 runs at 76.80 and taking 16 wickets at 20.88, which placed him second in both batting and bowling averages behind Bradman and Lindwall respectively. Nevertheless, Miller did not enjoy himself as much as during the Victory Tests of 1945 and became disillusioned with Bradman's {{relentless}} pursuit of victory and ruthless mentality. Miller was impulsive and cared little for records or mercilessly dominating his opponents; <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> play in a flamboyant manner with early declarations to keep the match alive and less concern for winning or losing. Hassett had outlined after the Victory Tests that the post-war era should be about [...] "cricket, not war". Miller's Services team-mate and biographer Richard Whitington said that Miller [...] "did not enjoy the humiliation of men who had proved themselves champions before the war".|$|E
500|$|In his Life of Samuel Johnson Boswell {{referred}} to Johnson as 'Dr. Johnson' {{so often that}} he would always be known as such, even though he hated being called such. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers. Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life, {{like many of his}} fellow Englishmen Johnson had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson [...] "exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism". Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said: [...] "We all know how well <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> abuse the Scotch, & indeed to be abused by them in return." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was killed {{off in a}} dramatic storyline, which aired on Christmas Day 2006 and was watched by an estimated 10.7million viewers.

[...] The row culminates with Sonia slapping Pauline, causing her to {{fall to the floor}} and break the Fowler fruit bowl—"the enduring symbol of her family, which smashed, significantly, into smithereens." [...] Though Pauline resolves to stay and reunite with her family in the end, she does not get the chance, as she collapses and dies in the middle of Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise.|$|E
