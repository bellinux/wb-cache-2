This is the progestogen component of the first oral contraceptive to be offered for sale (i.e., Enovid). Treatment of the ethynyl enol ether with strong acid leads to NET (6).|$|E
50|$|<b>Etynodiol</b> (INN), or ethynodiol (BAN), {{also known}} as 3β-hydroxynorethisterone, is a steroidal {{progestin}} related to norethisterone which was never marketed. A diacylated derivative, <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, {{is used as a}} hormonal contraceptive. While <b>etynodiol</b> is sometimes used as a synonym for <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, it usually refers to <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, not <b>etynodiol.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Etynodiol</b> diacetate is {{virtually}} inactive {{in terms of}} affinity for the progesterone and androgen receptors and acts as a prodrug of <b>etynodiol,</b> {{which in turn is}} a prodrug of norethisterone. Upon oral administration and during first-pass metabolism in the liver, <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate is rapidly converted by esterases into <b>etynodiol,</b> which is followed by oxygenation of the C3 hydroxyl group to produce norethisterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etynodiol</b> diacetate (sold as Continuin, Femulen, Luteonorm, Luto-Metrodiol, and Metrodiol), or ethynodiol diacetate (USAN, BAN, JAN), {{also known}} as norethindrol diacetate or 3β-hydroxynorethisterone diacetate, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-nortestosterone group which {{is used as a}} hormonal contraceptive. It is the 3β,17β-diacetate ester of <b>etynodiol,</b> and acts as a rapidly converted prodrug to norethisterone, with <b>etynodiol</b> occurring as an intermediate. <b>Etynodiol</b> diacetate has weak androgenic activity, and, unlike most progestins but similarly to norethisterone and noretynodrel, also has some estrogenic activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etynodiol</b> is a prodrug of norethisterone, and is {{converted}} immediately and completely into norethisterone. In addition, <b>etynodiol</b> is an intermediate in {{the conversion of}} the prodrug lynestrenol into norethisterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etynodiol</b> is a 19-nortestosterone derivative. Structurally, it {{is almost}} {{identical}} to norethisterone and lynestrenol, differing only in its C3 substituent.

50|$|Norsteroid {{examples}} include: 19-norpregnane (from pregnane), desogestrel, ethylestrenol, <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, ethinylestradiol, gestrinone, levonorgestrel, norethisterone (norethindrone), norgestrel, norpregnatriene (from pregnatriene), quinestrol, 19-norprogesterone (from a progesterone), Nomegestrol acetate, 19-nortestosterone (from a testosterone), and norethisterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|Lynestrenol is a {{derivative}} of 19-nortestosterone, {{and is a}} member of the estrane subgroup. It differs from norethisterone and <b>etynodiol</b> only by the lack of a ketone group and hydroxyl group at the C3 position, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Noretynodrel, {{unlike most}} progestins but {{similarly}} to <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, has some estrogenic activity. It {{has little or}} no androgenic activity. The drug is a relatively weak progestogen, with only about one-tenth of the progestogenic activity of norethisterone, and in relation to this fact, is no longer used in oral contraceptives.|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone, {{together}} with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), {{is also the}} parent compound of {{a large group of}} progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, dienogest (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.|$|E
50|$|A 2001 {{comparative}} study of the IMS LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database interpreted that in a large cohort of women using oral contraceptives, there was found a small, statistically {{significant increase in the}} risk of gallbladder disease associated with desogestrel, drospirenone and norethisterone compared with levonorgestrel. No statistically significant increase in risk was associated with the other formulations of oral contraceptive (<b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, norgestrel and norgestimate).|$|E
50|$|Reduction of {{norethisterone}} (1) affords the 3,17-diol. The 3β-hydroxy compound is {{the desired}} product; since reactions at C-3 {{do not show}} nearly the stereoselectivity as those at C-17 {{by virtue of the}} relative lack of stereo-directing proximate substituents, the formation of the desired isomer is engendered by use of a bulky reducing agent, Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride. Acetylation of the 3β,17β-diol affords <b>Etynodiol</b> diacetate (3), one of the most potent oral progestins.|$|E
50|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) entered {{clinical}} use and became widely marketed, largely superseding the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone esters. A variety of analogues of medroxyprogesterone acetate, such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, were subsequently developed and introduced as well. Progestogen esters {{of other groups}} of progestins have also been introduced, including the 19-norprogesterone derivatives gestonorone caproate, segesterone acetate (nestorone), nomegestrol acetate, and norgestomet (11β-methyl-17α-acetoxy-19-norprogesterone), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, and quingestanol acetate.|$|E
50|$|A few progestins have weak estrogenic activity. These {{include the}} 19-nortestosterone {{derivatives}} norethisterone, noretynodrel, and tibolone, {{as well as}} the norethisterone prodrugs norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, and <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate. High dosages of norethisterone and noretynodrel have been associated with estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with alleviation of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, non-estrogenic progestins were not found to be associated with such effects.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Although esters of steroidal androgens and estrogens are {{generally}} inactive themselves {{and act as}} prodrugs, the same is not true for many progestogen esters. For instance, esters of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate, are highly active themselves (and in fact far more active than their unesterified forms) and are not prodrugs, forming little or none of their parent compounds (in the cases of the examples given, hydroxyprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone, and cyproterone, respectively). On the other hand, esters of 19-nortestosterone derivatives such as <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, and quingestanol acetate are all prodrugs.|$|E
50|$|Lynestrenol {{itself does}} not bind to the {{progesterone}} receptor and is inactive as a progestogen. It is a prodrug, and upon oral administration, is rapidly and almost completely converted into norethisterone, a potent progestogen, in the liver during first-pass metabolism. No other metabolites besides norethisterone are formed from lynestrenol. As such, its pharmacological activity is essentially identical to that of norethisterone. The conversion of lynestrenol into norethisterone is catalyzed by CYP2C9 (28.0%), CYP2C19 (49.8%), and CYP3A4 (20.4%), while other cytochrome P450 enzymes are each responsible {{for no more than}} 1.0% of the total conversion. It appears that lynestrenol first undergoes hydroxylation of the C3 position, forming <b>etynodiol</b> as an intermediate, followed by oxygenation of the hydroxyl group to form norethisterone.|$|E

50|$|In 1966, {{during its}} {{clinical}} development, ethynerone {{was found to}} produce mammary gland tumors in dogs treated with it at very high doses for prolonged periods of time. Subsequent investigation found that 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatves included anagestone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate produced similar mammary gland tumors, and that their ability to do so correlated directly with their progestogenic actions. In contrast, the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, and <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, which are much less potent as progestogens, did not produce such effects at the dosages tested. Clinical development of ethynerone was discontinued, {{and many of the}} 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives were withdrawn for the indication of hormonal contraception. Research later on revealed species differences between dogs and humans and established that there is no similar risk in humans.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 {{he joined}} Searle {{as a senior}} {{research}} chemist. In 1952 Colton synthesized the progestin noretynodrel (an isomer of norethisterone), which combined with the estrogen mestranol as Enovid {{was approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1956 for menstrual disorders and in 1960 as the first oral contraceptive. In 1953 he synthesized norethandrolone, which as Nilevar was approved in 1956 as the first oral anabolic steroid. In 1954 Colton and Paul D. Klimstra synthesized the progestin <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, which combined with the estrogen mestranol as Ovulen was approved in 1965 as Searle's second oral contraceptive, and combined with the estrogen ethinylestradiol was approved in 1970 as Demulen. Colton retired from Searle in 1986 as research adviser. In 1988 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, {{along with}} a variety of other progestogens {{including}} progesterone, chlormadinone acetate, megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, ethynerone, and chloroethynyl norgestrel, anagestone acetate was found to induce the development of mammary gland tumors in Beagle dogs after extensive treatment (2-7 years) with very high doses (10-25 times the recommended human dose), though notably not with 1-2 times the human dosage. In contrast, the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, and <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate were not found to produce such nodules. Because of these findings, anagestone acetate was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by the manufacturer in 1969. The findings also led to the virtual disappearance of most 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives as hormonal contraceptives from the market (though medroxyprogesterone acetate has continued to be used). According to Hughes et al., [...] "It is still doubtful how much relevance these findings have for humans as the dog mammary gland seems to be the only one which can be directly maintained by progestogens." [...] Subsequent research revealed species differences between dogs and humans and established that there is no similar risk in humans.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, CMA was {{introduced}} {{as a component}} of oral contraceptives. However, around 1970, such formulations were withdrawn from many markets due to the finding that CMA induced mammary gland tumors in Beagle dogs. (CMA has continued to be widely used as a contraceptive in some countries, such as Germany and China, however.) The doses administered that caused the nodules were 10 or 25 times the recommended human dosage {{for an extended period of}} time (2-4 years), while no tumors were found in dogs treated with 1-2 times the human dosage. In addition to CMA, mammary tumors were found in dogs with various other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and anagestone acetate, and they were also discontinued for the indication of hormonal contraception (although medroxyprogesterone acetate has since been reintroduced). Tumors were also observed with progesterone, as well as with ethynerone and chloroethynylnorgestrel, but notably not with the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, or <b>etynodiol</b> diacetate, which remained on the market. In any case, according to Hughes et al., [...] "It is still doubtful how much relevance these findings have for humans as the dog mammary gland seems to be the only one which can be directly maintained by progestogens."
