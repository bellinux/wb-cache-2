40|$|Abstract [...] The {{effects of}} {{hydrothermal}} {{conditions on the}} sorption and fixation of cesium by various clay minerals and shales were investigated. Hydrothermal heating, which may be expected in a radioactive waste repository, altered the clay minerals and shales {{and led to a}} decrease in their cation-exchange ca-pacity. Cesium sorption greatly decreased in micaceous vermiculite and in well-crystallized <b>illites</b> con-taining vermiculite upon hydrothermal treatment a 400 ~ and 300 bars pressure due to complete layer collapse. However, poorly crystallized <b>illites</b> heated as above showed either a small increase or only a slight decrease in Cs sorption because of partial ayer collapse. These studies how that he decrease in Cs sorption is greater in well-crysallized <b>illites</b> than in poorly crystallized <b>illites</b> when treated similarly under hydrothermal conditions. Hydrothermal heating of Cs-sorbed and Cs-saturated samples increased the amount of Cs fixation in all minerals and shales as a result of collapse of the layers. For example, asample of the Conasauga shale fixed only 18 % of sorbed Cs before treatment but fixed 47 % after hydrothermal treatment a 200 ~ and 300 bars pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Authigenic llites and {{chlorites}} from elastic reservoirs, offshore Norway, {{have been}} studied by analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM). Present-day reservoir conditions range from 1600 m burial depth and 70 ~ to 4400 m and 160 ~ The reservoir units have xperienced continuous subsidence since arly Cretaceous, and are presently atmaximum burial. Textural and morphological evidence indicates that the authigenic <b>illites</b> and chlorites investigated are late diagenetic products, except for an early-formed berthierine in the shallowest reservoir. While the <b>illites</b> show very limited chemical variability at temperatures between 140 ~ and 160 ~ the chlorites exhibit definite compositional trends with increasing temperatures. Tetrahedral Ai increases substantially from 100 ~ 176 and the octahedral vacancy decreases correspondingly. These observations i dicate that continuous recrystalliza-tion of authigenic clays has taken place. This is also supported by the chemical composition f present-day porewaters, which are close to equilibrium with the clay mineral assemblage. <b>Illites</b> and chlorites are diagenetic minerals of considerable importance both because of their general geochemical reorganization during diagenesis and also their influence on the production of hydrocarbons from elastic reservoirs.

Temperature was estimated from combined geothermometric approaches, and especially from fluid inclusion studies on quartz coexisting with clays. The Al(lv) content in the tetrahedral site of chlorites, and the K content and total interlayer occupancy of <b>illites</b> increase with temperature.

25|$|Carbonate rocks dominantly {{consist of}} {{carbonate}} minerals such as calcite, aragonite or dolomite. Both the cement and the clasts (including fossils and ooids) of a carbonate sedimentary rock can consist of carbonate minerals. The mineralogy of a clastic rock {{is determined by}} the material supplied by the source area, the manner of its transport to the place of deposition and the stability of that particular mineral. The resistance of rock forming minerals to weathering is expressed by Bowen's reaction series. In this series, quartz is the most stable, followed by feldspar, micas, and finally other less stable minerals that are only present when little weathering has occurred. The amount of weathering depends mainly on the distance to the source area, the local climate and the time it took for the sediment to be transported {{to the point where it}} is deposited. In most sedimentary rocks, mica, feldspar and less stable minerals have been reduced to clay minerals like kaolinite, <b>illite</b> or smectite.|$|E
25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, <b>illite,</b> and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E

40|$|The exchangeability of {{interlayer}} K in micaceous minerals {{is governed}} by the conditions imposed by the solution around the particles and the mineral properties themselves. This study focused {{on the role of}} mineral properties by relating the K extracted by NaCl-NaTPB solutions to differences in existing and thermally altered properties of selected minerals. The relevance of particle size, mixed layering and dioctahedral structures were emphasized by using size-fractions of ground muscovite, 3 ̆c 2 (mu) m fractions of Tumut and Grundite <b>illites</b> and four trioctahedral mica-vermiculites;When the micaceous minerals were heated, several changes in K exchangeability occurred and the minerals lost weight by dehydration and dehydroxylation. Dehydroxylation enhanced the rate and amount of K release in all the dioctahedral minerals by increasing the interlayer spacing. Mica-vermiculites with mixed layering yielded the same thermal response even though trioctahedral micas behaved otherwise and {{there was no evidence of}} dehydroxylation involvement. The minerals varied in their response to temperatures under 400 (DEGREES) C, but dehydration was not an obvious factor. These low temperatures reduced layer weathering and thereby provided a means of detecting this mechanism of K release. Layer weathering was a significant factor in ground micas, not in the <b>illites.</b> In the absence of dehydroxylation, reductions in edge weathering also occurred in many heated samples. The thermally induced changes in layer and edge weathering probably stemmed from a reduction in interlayer spacing. If so, a similar explanation should be considered for the limited K release in small particles because the relevance of layer weathering was eliminated by comparisons of heated <b>illites</b> and ground mica. X-ray diffraction studies verified the occurrence of structural alterations but not a measurable decrease in interlayer spacing. However, the small particle effect in <b>illites</b> was circumvented by the expanding effects of dehydroxylation. Mixed layering plays a major role in the thermal responses of mica-vermiculites but has no identifiable effect on K exchange in unheated minerals;The interlayer spacing and condition of the lateral edges of the mineral particles appear to dominate the exchangeability of interlayer K...|$|R
