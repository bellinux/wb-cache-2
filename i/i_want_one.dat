James Gordon Bennett, Jr.—"a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse"—had a mercurial reign. He launched the New York Telegram, an evening paper, {{in the late}} 1860s and kept the Herald the most comprehensive source of news among the city's newspapers. [...] Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley's trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, and scooped the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a heavy hand, telling his executives {{at one point that}} he was the [...] "only reader of this paper": [...] "I am the only one to be pleased. [...] If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>one</b> feature article a day. If I say the feature is black beetles, black beetles it's going to be." [...] In 1874, the Herald ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where {{the front page of the}} newspaper was devoted entirely to fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.|$|E

2500|$|Hirst {{said that}} he only painted five spot {{paintings}} himself because, [...] "I couldn't be fucking arsed doing it"; he described his efforts as [...] "shite"—"They're shit compared to ... the best person who ever painted spots for me was Rachel. She's brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel." [...] He also describes another painting assistant who was leaving and asked {{for one of the}} paintings. Hirst told her to, [...] "'make one of your own.' And she said, 'No, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>one</b> of yours.' But the only difference, between one painted by her and one of mine, is the money.'" [...] By February 1999, two assistants had painted 300 spot paintings. Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist: ...|$|E

5000|$|According to critic Richie Unterberger of Allmusic, [...] "I'm Down" [...] is [...] "one of {{the most}} frantic rockers in the entire Beatles' catalog."
