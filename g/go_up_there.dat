500|$|There {{are about}} 350officially graded rock {{climbing}} routes on the 27cliffs {{that make up}} Cheddar Gorge, which are generally open to climbers between 1 October and 15 March each year. Each of the routes is named and included in the British Mountaineering Council guidebook. Although {{the majority of the}} climbs are [...] "trad" [...] or [...] "traditional", which means that the leader places protection as they <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> <b>there</b> are also some [...] "sport" [...] routes where bolts are left in place. Climber Chris Bonington was the first to scale the Coronation Street route in 1965.|$|E
500|$|Van der Byl {{moved to}} Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage {{some of his}} family's tobacco farming interests, hoping {{to make his own}} fortune. Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he [...] "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in." [...] He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest {{elephant}} shot, which stood until 1955.|$|E
500|$|Appalachian State had {{routinely}} scheduled FBS teams, {{playing against}} schools such as LSU (2005), Auburn (1999), Kansas (2005), and NC State (2006). They also had games against Wake Forest in every season from 1979 to 1996, {{as well as}} in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Appalachian State had won six of these games, all of them against Wake Forest. The Mountaineers had not beaten an FBS team since 2000. Michigan, a historic college football power with a large fan base, had never played an FCS team. According to Appalachian State athletic director Charlie Cobb, both schools had gaps in their schedule as late as February 2007; the friendship between Mountaineers coach Jerry Moore and Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr {{played a key role in}} completing the deal. While attempting to determine the amount of money Appalachian State would be paid for playing Michigan, negotiations between the two schools reached a halt. Moore went to school officials and urged them to accept any offer Michigan gave them; he recalled telling them that [...] "It's an opportunity game. It'll be a one-shot, once-in-a-lifetime deal to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and play. It's an unbelievable environment." [...] Appalachian State ultimately settled on a $400,000 payment in return for playing against Michigan to open the 2007 season.|$|E

500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
500|$|This Dragon Quest, {{similar to}} Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest VII, has a class system. Once the party gets to Alltrades Abbey, {{they have the}} option of {{becoming}} one of several starter classes. Each class has eight levels, which are gained by winning a specific number of battles (unlike character levels, which are gained by earning experience points), and advancing in level teaches a character new spells and / or skills, which are retained across class changes. Once a character has mastered a specific set of two or three starter classes, they can change into a hybrid class which builds on their themes; for example, mastering Warrior and Martial Artist unlocks the Gladiator Class, which learns powerful physical attacks, and mastering certain hybrid classes unlocks the Hero class. Some of the classes give special bonuses beyond their stats and abilities such as the Merchant who gives a small bonus to the party's income after every battle, or the Sage who receives a discount to MP costs. To master a class, the character must fight a set number of battles as that class. Once certain hybrid classes are mastered, a stat relating to that class will permanently <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> are two secret classes as well, Dragon (Hackasaurus) and Liquid Metal Slime, which are unlockable through consumable books. Dragon Quest VI was the first game in the series to include [...] (special attacks and other techniques which are not spells and usually do not cost MP) for human party members. These special techniques were added to the remakes of III, IV and V later on.|$|E

2500|$|T.I. {{was born}} Clifford Joseph Harris, Jr. on September 25, 1980, in Atlanta, Georgia, {{the son of}} the late Clifford [...] "Buddy" [...] Harris, Sr. and Violeta Morgan.

By age 14, he had been arrested several times. He was nicknamed [...] "Tip" [...] after his paternal great-grandfather. Upon signing with Arista Records a subsidiary of LaFace Records in 1999, he shortened his name to T.I. out of respect for label mate Q-Tip.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E

5000|$|First aired November 2, 201060 minute episodeThe {{teams are}} told {{that they will be}} {{spending}} the week with the Marines at Camp Pendleton, where they will undergo Marine training. At the camp, they are subjected to harsh treatment and living conditions, and have a little trouble with the food, which is the same food served to Marine recruits. They face an obstacle course challenge, with the reward being phone calls home. The Blue Team wins handily as Elizabeth, of the Black Team, passes out and needs assistance. The Black Team finishes the course but are practically carrying Elizabeth. The contestants came into their last chance workout and Bob and Jillian are especially surprised to see Brendan getting his hair and beard shaved off. The Teams stayed at Camp Pendleton for Last Chance Workout with Jillian. Ada manages a 10 mph sprint, briefly, on the treadmill. At the weigh-in, the results are dismal.

The black team needs to lose more than 28 lb. Ada <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and drops 7 lbs. Patrick drops 7 lbs. also. Then Brendan then Anna loses 2 lbs. Elizabeth gains a pound. Frado gains 4 pounds. Jillian, Bob, and Ali are all disgusted at Frado, who gains 4 pounds, and he swears there was no game play involved in his gain. Ada had the highest percentage of weight loss, so she got immunity. The Black Team loses and they unanimously vote off Anna, {{as the rest of the}} team is a tight group ...|$|R
