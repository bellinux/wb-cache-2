40|$|We {{investigate}} {{two aspects}} of <b>housing</b> market <b>price</b> dynamics. Firstly, whether the spatial pattern of <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> in a metropolitan housing market converge or diverge over time and secondly, whether suburbs with relatively low (high) <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> 20 years ago continue to occupy the same relative position in the <b>house</b> <b>price</b> distribution. The empirical work uses a property transaction database for Melbourne to examine the changing distribution of suburban <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> over a nearly 20 -year period (1990 - 2009) that spans two housing cycles. We focus on convergence measures that use Melbourne submarket-based repeat sale <b>house</b> <b>price</b> indexes as a unit of measurement. We find that <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> diverge, and so the gap between low-priced submarkets and high-priced submarkets is increasing. A second key result is that low-priced submarkets typically remain {{at the low end}} of the <b>house</b> <b>price</b> distribution, because their rates of appreciation fall short of those at the upper end of the <b>house</b> <b>price</b> distribution.

40|$|On the {{background}} of current global mortgage crisis the article discusses the housing market theory and particularly the methods and indicators used {{for the evaluation of}} long-term sustainability of <b>house</b> <b>price</b> trends. The authors provide the time series of such indicators for selected OECD countries, critically examine the past research studies evaluating pre-crisis <b>house</b> <b>price</b> development and argue that <b>house</b> <b>price</b> falls present in many developed countries are more the causes than the consequences of mortgage crisis. The change in <b>house</b> <b>price</b> trends in 2007 in many developed countries could be thus interpreted {{as the result of the}} previous record <b>house</b> <b>price</b> growth, often labeled as a price bubble.

40|$|Increases in <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> {{can lead}} to higher <b>house</b> <b>price</b> volatility, a {{significant}} determinant of default and the prepayment of housing loans (Miles, 2008). Many researchers believe that significant growth in <b>house</b> <b>price</b> {{has the potential to}} generate a <b>house</b> <b>price</b> bubble. The bursting of a <b>house</b> <b>price</b> bubble is likely to endanger the stability of the country’s real economy. China experienced substantial increases in <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> at the end of 1990 s. In Beijing, <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> increased dramatically following the liberalization of China’s housing market in 1998, and especially so after reforms in 2004. The significant growth of Beijing <b>house</b> <b>prices</b> could have generated a <b>house</b> <b>price</b> bubble, thus endangering the stability of the Beijing housing market and thereby the overall Chinese economy. This paper investigates whether a bubble existed in the Beijing housing market from 1998 to 2010, using economic fundamental variables such as interest rates, inflation, and cost of supply. Results of the analysis revealed that the Beijing <b>house</b> <b>price</b> index was significantly larger than the equilibrium value, based on the relative economic fundamental variables (income, inflation, interest rate and construction cost) during 2004 to 2007.
