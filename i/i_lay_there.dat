2500|$|The firing stopped. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> maybe 10 or 15 seconds. I got up, I saw {{four or five}} {{students}} lying around the lot. By this time, it was like mass hysteria. Students were crying, they were screaming for ambulances. I heard some girl screaming, [...] "They didn't have blank, they didn't have blank," [...] no, they didn't.|$|E
2500|$|Rebecca {{has also}} {{recovered}} from an eating disorder, which she developed at around {{the age of}} 18. [...] "Every time I looked in the mirror, I told myself 'My goodness, how fat. You look terrible today.' It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
60|$|Timothy {{said he had}} heard, and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> {{speechless}} in {{the stifling}} trench, too overcome by my greatness of good fortune {{to be able to}} utter a word of gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was when}} he was hog-fat and living high. Work the grease out of him and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there's</b> no great {{difference}} between them. Have you been weighed lately, Mr. Montgomery?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made some}} {{attempt to get}} up and dress myself. When I next {{attended}} to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. <b>I</b> still <b>lay</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|How could I be aware, The {{opposite}} window eyeing As <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> listless <b>there,</b> That {{through its}} blinds was dying One I had rated rare Before I had set me sighing For another more fair? ...|$|R
60|$|I did not {{languish}} long {{within the}} prison of Salensus Oll. During {{the short time}} that <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> fettered with chains of gold, I often wondered as {{to the fate of}} Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> some {{minutes more}} in an agony of suspense. Would she {{come back in}} time, or would the fiery flood burst up once more to the level where I lay before she had time to arrive with assistance? ...|$|E
6000|$|No gale would arise or wreck occur. This was trying, as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> wakeful and hopeful, {{with plenty}} of time to study the perplexing {{question}} whether it is legitimate, under any circumstance, to wish for a wreck or a fire! ...|$|E
60|$|I made {{inquiries}} concerning them {{among men}} of every nation, {{and at last}} {{from one of the}} yellow prisoners of war I learned that they had been apprehended by an officer of the palace as they sought to reach the Pit of Plenty while <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> imprisoned <b>there.</b>|$|R
60|$|Seek {{we first}} an altar fit For such victims laid on it: It shall be this slab brought home In old happy days from Rome,-- Lazuli, once blest to line Dian's inmost cell and shrine. Gently now <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> them <b>there.</b> Pure as Dian's {{forehead}} bare, Yet suffused with warmer hue, Such as only Latmos knew.|$|R
6000|$|... "In some {{withered}} stuff among a {{clump of}} willows; I scraped the snow off it. That is, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>there,</b> but as the fire wouldn't burn well, I don't think I got much rest. Part of the time I wondered what I was staying in this country for. I didn't seem to find any sensible answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{have found}} it," [...] said {{the blind man}} proudly. [...] "Here I have placed my staff upon the line of it. Twice as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> with my ear to the ground I have heard {{footsteps}} pass beneath me." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> in my bag, {{the very}} happiest {{fellow in the}} wide world, {{the sound of my}} mirth was as the buzz of the wings of a fly to the mighty storm. Roar on roar filled the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|Would that <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> [...] And {{she were}} housed here! Or better, {{together}} Were folded away there Exposed to one weather We both,--who would stray there When sunny the day there, [...] Or evening was clear [...] At {{the prime of}} the year.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lay</b> long <b>there</b> in the silence, {{forgetting the}} misery of my body while I {{considered}} this proposition Morrell had advanced. Already, as I have explained, by mechanical self-hypnosis I had sought to penetrate back through time to my previous selves. That I had partly succeeded I knew; but all that I had experienced was a fluttering of apparitions that merged erratically and were without continuity.|$|R
60|$|It {{could not}} have been more than a few seconds that <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> {{senseless}} <b>there</b> upon the northern ice, while all that was dearest to me drifted farther from my reach in the clutches of that black fiend, for when I opened my eyes Thurid and Matai Shang yet battled at the ladder's top, and the flier drifted but a hundred yards farther to the south--but the end of the trailing rope was now a good thirty feet above the ground.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought it}} best for but one of us to return, since two could {{accomplish}} but little more than one and would double the risk of discovery. In the meantime he could make {{his way to the}} sea and guard the boat, which <b>I</b> told him <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> {{at the foot of the}} cliff.|$|R
60|$|As {{luck would}} have it, I sprained my ankle, and succeeded in getting no farther than South San Francisco. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> that night in an out-house, {{shivering}} with the cold {{and at the same}} time burning with fever. Two days <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> too sick to move, and on the third, reeling and giddy, supporting myself on an extemporized crutch, I tottered on toward San Francisco. I was weak as well, for it was the third day since food had passed my lips. It was a day of nightmare and torment. As in a dream I passed hundreds of regular soldiers drifting along in the opposite direction, and many policemen, with their families, organized in large groups for mutual protection.|$|E
6000|$|Because he did {{not speak}} again I {{understood}} that Sergeant Corney was not inclined for conversation, and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> motionless and silent until {{it was as if}} twice four and twenty hours had passed, when the old man, rising to a sitting posture, whispered, cautiously: ...|$|E
60|$|If {{there had}} been a bolt on the window the matter would not have been so disturbing. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> a-quiver, eyes upon the gray window space of my room. Dead silence once more intervened. All I heard was the pound of my heart against my ribs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he was {{not taken}} prisoner, but he came to visit the Sultan at Damascus while <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> in bonds <b>there,</b> for I saw him twice or thrice, though what his {{business}} was I do not know. Afterwards he left, and at Jaffa I heard that he had sailed for Europe three months before I did." ...|$|R
50|$|The song is {{recorded}} in the African Methodist Episcopal Church Review in 1911 as having been sung by an opera singer awaiting trial for fraud in his cell while {{a group of men}} arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct were before the judge. The men were said to have dropped to their knees as the song began 'Last night <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> a-sleeping, <b>There</b> came a dream so fair.', the lyrics contrasting with their previous night's drunkenness. The song's conclusion resulted in the judge dismissing the men without punishment, each having learned a lesson from the song.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{brought me}} round to my senses, {{as you may}} guess. To break one's leg up in the {{mountains}} is bad at any time, but when it {{is in the middle of}} winter, and you have got a tribe of red-skins at your heels, it means you have got to go under. I sat up and looked at my leg. Sure enough, the left one was snapt like a pipe-stem, about half-way between the knee and the ankle. 'Why, chief,' I said, 'it would have been a sight better if you had put a bullet through my head as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> up <b>there.</b> <b>I</b> should have known nothing about it.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{circumstance}} that I {{should become a}} monk was no departure from the idea to which I had been trained, although explicitly no more than my mere priesthood had been spoken of. So <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> without thinking of any words in which to answer him.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I did {{he never}} found the mine. I was {{scarcely}} sensible when I reached his camp, and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> very ill until {{he went on}} and left me with half a deer he'd shot. After that I nearly gave out again making the settlements." ...|$|E
6000|$|The bed {{on which}} they placed me was neat and soft. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> dozing with pain. Elsie sat by my side, her own arm in a sling. By-and-by, an Irish maid came in and undressed me {{carefully}} under Elsie's direction. Then Elsie said to me, half shrinking: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the tower}} of Tillietudlem," [...] {{said one of the}} soldiers. [...] "Old Lady Margaret Bellenden lives there. She's one of the best {{affected}} women in the country, and one that's a soldier's friend. When I was hurt by one of the d--d whig dogs that shot at me from behind a fauld-dike, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> a month <b>there,</b> and would stand such another wound to be in as good quarters again." ...|$|R
60|$|The Portuguese Captain {{laughed in}} a cool way, and {{with the flat of}} his cutlass, hit me crosswise, as if I was the bough of a tree that he played with: first on the face, and then across the chest and the wounded arm. I looked him steady in the face without {{tumbling}} while he looked at me, I am happy to say; but, when they went away, <b>I</b> fell, and <b>lay</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, then--it was Riggs!" [...] Roy grew still paler as {{he confessed}} this and his voice, almost a whisper, {{expressed}} shame and hate. [...] "Thet four-flush did it. Shot {{me from behind}} Beasley! I had no chance. I couldn't even see him draw. But when <b>I</b> fell an' <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> an' the others dropped back, then I seen the smokin' gun in his hand. He looked powerful important. An' Beasley began to cuss him an' was cussin' him as they all run out." ...|$|R
6000|$|After which, Joe withdrew to the window, {{and stood}} with his back towards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme {{weakness}} prevented me from getting up and going to him, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> penitently whispering, [...] "O God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!" ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> there arose out of {{the utter}} stillness the {{rumbling}} of a carriage a very great way off, that drew near, and passed within a few streets of the house, and died away as gradually as it had arisen. This, too, was as a reminiscence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My lord, a {{girl looked}} out of that window and spoke {{a few words to}} me, and I fell to the ground. For seven days and seven nights <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> unable to move. But, O my lord, it is not given to us twice to behold beauty such as hers.' ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> still <b>there,</b> until <b>I</b> {{began to}} think of food and drink; and at that thought the real {{hopelessness}} of my position came home to me. I knew no way of getting anything to eat. I was too ignorant of botany to discover any resort of root or fruit that might lie about me; I had no means of trapping the few rabbits upon the island. It grew blanker the more I turned the prospect over. At last in the desperation of my position, my mind turned to the animal men I had encountered. I tried to find some hope in what I remembered of them. In turn I recalled each one I had seen, and tried to draw some augury of assistance from my memory.|$|R
60|$|This filled us with horror, and we {{knew not}} what course to take; but the creatures {{resolved}} us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. It happened very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there by some large timber trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and <b>I</b> suppose <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> for carriage: <b>I</b> drew my little troop in among these trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.|$|R
60|$|I went, {{directed}} by Heaven, no doubt; {{for in this}} chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the few books <b>I</b> had saved <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> too, <b>I</b> took {{out one of the}} Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into; I say I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.|$|R
