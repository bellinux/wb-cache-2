30|$|The {{accumulation}} of misorientations in crystal lattice of the γ- and the ε-phases of the Fe- 18  wt.% Mn- 2  wt.% Si alloy {{due to the}} cyclic γ-ε-γ transformations proceeds less intensively than in iron-nickel alloys with γ-α-γ transformations.

Angle Ψ for the reverted austenite even upon intensive γ-ε-γ cycling did not exceed 9 °– 10 °, which was lower than 14 °– 15 ° characteristic of high-angle boundaries. It can be concluded that in iron-manganese alloys, only low-angle sub-boundaries of initial <b>grain</b> <b>fragments</b> are formed during the cyclic γ-ε-γ transformations.

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the {{microstructure}} and distribution of components of rye porridge enriched with different inulin and gluten proportions (0 : 0, 3 : 9, 6 : 6, 9 : 3), and their relationship with texture. Inulin was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) prior to its addition to the porridges, and multiple staining was applied to cryosections in order to also observe other components of the porridges. Porridge structure consisted of <b>grain</b> <b>fragments</b> and a continuous phase formed by released amylose, starch granules and protein. Addition of inulin and gluten to rye porridge partly hindered starch gelatinization due to their water binding capacity. The green fluorescence from FITC-labeled inulin was brighter in detached starch granules in the continuous phase, indicating greater interaction of inulin with starch than with protein. Viscosity was lower in those porridges with high inulin content and low gluten content. Solubilized inulin created a protective layer around starch granules limiting their swelling and amylose release, which may explain the differences in viscosity between the porridges and could have further influence in starch digestibility.

Here, a unique phenomenon was observed that ultra-fine-grained (UFG) SiCp/ZL 108 composites after severe plastic deformation (SPD) exhibit higher impact toughness at temperatures slightly lower than room temperature. The enhanced impact toughness is attributed to the simultaneous increase of strength and ductility of UFG materials at lower temperatures, related to <b>grains</b> or <b>grain</b> <b>fragment</b> boundary modification.

Yellow CL (emission band between 500 and 700 nm) is probably caused by electron defects localized on the [SiO 4] groups (e. g. related to oxygen vacancies) or activation by Yb 2 + generated by radiation.

40|$|Sands and {{sandstones}} from Leg 66 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project can {{be grouped}} into three general categories based upon textural and diagenetic similarities. Early Miocene upper slope sandstones from Sites 489 and 493 are cemented either by calcite, or by gypsum. Calcite is volumetrically {{the most important}} cement; it occurs as a void-filling cement in foraminifer chambers, as a micritic to sparry pore-filling cement, and as a replacement mineral in framework grains. The gypsum cement has a patchy distribution and {{appears to have been}} introduced along fractures in upper slope sands. Quaternary lower slope sands from Sites 488 and 486 are either weakly consolidated or totally unconsolidated. Framework grains in finer-grained sands are surrounded by thin, discontinuous films of chlorite and illite, which originated largely from the in situ alteration of biotite. Coarser-grained sands have thicker, more continuous clay films that consist of altered detrital biotite and of mechanically dispersed illite and chlorite. Subsequent burial diagenesis could totally obscure these differences in the origin of matrix between the finer- and coarser-grained sands. Middle to late Miocene slope sands from Site 492 have a complicated diagenetic history. There is a pervasive network of fractures throughout the sands, yet there has been no rotation of <b>grain</b> <b>fragments.</b> Either the sands were fractured tectonically following compaction or they were fractured as a result of compaction subsequent to decementation.

40|$|A central aim in fault {{mechanics}} is {{to understand}} the microphysical mechanisms controlling aseismic-seismic transitions in fault gouges, and to identify microstructural indicators for such transitions. We present new data on the slip stability of calcite fault gouges, and on microstructural development down to the nanometer scale. Our experiments consisted of direct shear tests performed dry at slip rates of 0. 1 – 10 μm/s, at a constant normal stress of 50 MPa, at 18 – 150 °C. The results show a transition from stable to (potentially) unstable slip above 80 °C. All samples recovered showed an optical microstructure characterized by narrow, 30 – 40 -μm-wide, Riedel and boundary shear bands marked by extreme grain comminution, and a crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Boundary shear bands, sectioned using FIB-SEM (focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy), revealed angular <b>grain</b> <b>fragments</b> decreasing from 10 to 20 μm at the outer margins to 0. 3 μm in the shear band core, where dense aggregates of nanograins also occurred.

Our {{results suggest that the}} mechanisms controlling slip include cataclasis and localized crystal plasticity.

A (U–Th) /He central age of 207. 1 ± 6. 4 Ma (2 standard error (SE), n = 40) has been determined. With 4 outlier ages removed the central age is refined to 208. 9 ± 5. 1 Ma (2 SE). Both of these ages are within error of the previously determined U–Pb zircon age of 214 ± 1 Ma (2 σ) derived from the impact melt. Manicouagan's central uplift formed due to rapid elevation from 7 – 10 km depth {{as part of the}} modification stage of the impact process, which has facilitated the dating of its emplacement due to resulting rapid exhumation and cooling and closure of the (U–Th) /He system in titanite.

The youngest ca. 195 Ma (U–Th) /He dates preserved in some titanite fragments are synchronous with Early Jurassic, rift-induced lithospheric thinning and associated igneous activity that defines the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP).

[...] Department of Geosciences and Department of Chemistry. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 The primary {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the potential effects of hydrocarbons on the geotechnical properties of sand. A series of laboratory experiments were carried out to ascertain the influence of some common and widespread organic contaminants on the hydraulic conductivity of sand. Bulk sand samples from the Missouri River Valley aquifer— a major source of groundwater supply in the U. S. Midwest— were collected for this study. Sand samples, representing the aquifer and vadose zone, comprising − 2. 36 mm and − 0. 425 mm fractions respectively, prepared from the bulk samples, were used for conducting laboratory tests. Gasoline and some of its constituent chemicals—benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), isooctane— as well as trichloroethylene (TCE) were used to contaminate sand samples at varying saturation levels for extended periods of time to simulate changes in geotechnical properties and hydraulic conductivities of sand caused by oil tank spills and leaking petroleum pipelines. Seventy-four medium grained sand samples were contaminated with TCE and gasoline at about 25 %, 50 % and 100 % saturation levels for 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 weeks. In addition, five sand samples were fully saturated with BTEX and isooctane for eight weeks to compare the results of their geotechnical properties and hydraulic conductivities with gasoline-contaminated sand. Also, 10 aquifer sand samples were exposed to aqueous solution contaminated with about 1, 2, 3, and up to 10 % of TCE and gasoline for 8 weeks. Grain size parameters of the sand and its density, void ratio, porosity, and hydraulic conductivity were determined before and after the duration of exposure. All tests were performed in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials’ standard test methods. The results showed an overall decrease in the geotechnical properties and up to 60 % reduction in hydraulic conductivity of contaminated sand. Another set of experiments was carried out to determine the influence of evaporation rate of contaminating chemicals on hydraulic conductivity of sand. Results indicate that chemicals permeating sand grains have variable evaporation rates with a certain amount of chemicals left behind in sand voids. The inherent differences in the structure and nature of chemicals influenced hydraulic conductivity such that the observed decrease was greater for aliphatic than aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons. X‒ray diffraction results show that the contaminating chemicals used in this study did not alter the mineralogy of both aquifer and upper layer sand, even after extended periods of exposure. Scanning electron microscopy of contaminated sand grains revealed highly irregular surfaces with presence of nano size grooves along with presence of prominent granules and <b>grain</b> <b>fragments.</b> This contributes to increase in surface area and decrease in porosity with attendant increase in surface tension. All of which resulted in a decrease in hydraulic conductivity of contaminated sand.

Two types of cereals (barley and sorghum) were ground, {{and the resulting}} grounds separated by size using sieving, with sizes ranging from similar to 0. 1 to similar to 3 mm. In vitro enzymatic digestion was performed, using pancreatic alpha-amylase, amyloglucosidase and protease, to determine fractional-digestion rates over 24 h. The resulting glucose production rate data were well fitted by simple first-order kinetics. For each sieve screen size, the digestion rate of barley was always {{higher than that of}} sorghum. The rate coefficients for digestion showed a decrease with increasing size, and could be well fitted by an inverse square relationship. This is consistent with the supposition that starch digestion in these systems is controlled by diffusion of enzyme through the <b>grain</b> <b>fragment.</b> Apparent diffusion coefficients of alpha-amylase obtained by fitting the size dependence were 0. 76 (sorghum) and 1. 7 (barley) x 10 (- 7) cm(2) s(- 1), 9 (sorghum) and 4 (barley) times slower than predicted for a molecule of the size of alpha-amylase in water.

This fragmental material has various <b>grain</b> size <b>fragments</b> starting from a very fine tuff until breccia pumice that has very coarse <b>grains</b> <b>fragments</b> (Yusliandi et al. 2013). The abundance of pumice fragments in Tmse indicates that Tmse is typically co-ignimbrite deposit. In term of volcanology sediment, the co-ignimbrite deposit can be classified as a volcanic material which was formed by close explosive eruption (Mulyaningsih et al., 2011); (Yusliandi et al. 2013); (Winarti 2015); (Bronto et al., 2009). On the contrary, Nglanggran Formation (Tmn) was formed {{as a result of}} an effusive eruption and deposited on the top of the Semilir Formation. Tmn consists of solid material of breccia, lava andesite, and basalt. This formation is wide-spread along the Baturagung Escarpment in the west part of Parangtritis and east part of Gunung Panggung. Similar to Semilir Formation, Nglanggran is lacking fossils. However, based on the foraminifera content that was found in the insertion of sandstone and claystone in the bottom-most layer, Nglanggran Formation is the middle Miocene deposits. These Miocene formations were buried by younger sedimentary rock including the Young Volcanic Deposits of Merapi Volcano (Qmi) and the Alluvium (Qa). The young volcanic deposits of Merapi Volcano consist of the Young Merapi Volcano sediment that was transported by several big rivers such as Opak River while the alluvium was formed through the denudation processes on the steep areas. The Qa and Qmi are characterized as dense soil located in the extensive flat land along the Opak River. In the eastern part of the research area, uplift and erosion have stripped away much of the cover rock, exposing the underlying rock, Nglanggran and Semilir Formation.|$|R

Statistics of the in-grain orientation spreads were computed based on approximately 3000 orientation measurements per grain.

5000|$|Regionally, the lower, heterogeneous, {{part of the}} Vinini is {{composed}} principally of the following components: beds of sandstone composed of the following clasts: quartz <b>grains,</b> <b>fragments</b> of calcareous and phosphatic organisms, the alga Nuia, dolomite rhombs, sponge spicules, and chert grains; less common are beds of conglomerate, feldspathic siltstone, shale, bedded chert, and greenstone. [...] "Rip-up” clasts are common in some areas. These are boulder-size, angular fragments of sandy limestone that, apparently, were [...] "ripped up" [...] by strong currents, from existing strata in a submarine environment. The angularity of these clasts and their similarity to underlying, undisturbed beds indicate very little transport. The proportions of rock types vary stratigraphically and {{from place to place}} indicating a laterally varied and temporally shifting environment. Most of the sand-size components appear to be debris shed from the eastern, carbonate, assemblage. However, some beds are composed almost entirely of quartz grains, and this presents a problem: correlative shallow-water carbonate deposits in the eastern assemblage are free from quartz sand and could not have been the source. Based on the age of associated zircons, this sand originated in central Laurentia (Linde et al., 2015), but the means by which the quartz grains reached the Vinini depositional area are unknown.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that rocks {{containing}} water-reactive clays may swell when contacting with fresh water. In a conventional formation, this swelling may cause wellbore stability problem or damage formation by reducing its permeability. However, the effect of water salinity on shale rocks may be different. This issue is investigated in this paper. Shale rocks were immersed in water of different salinities. Shale rocks used were Mancos, Marcellus, Barnett and Eagle Ford. Different concentrations of NaCl and KCl salt solutions from 0 % to 30 % by weight were added in the water. It was observed that Mancos core plugs were crushed into loose <b>grains</b> (<b>fragmented)</b> at low salinity solutions up to 15 %. Barnett core plugs showed consecutive cracks along bedding planes at low salinities. Minor cracks were seen on Marcellus, while no visual cracks were found in Eagle Ford core plugs at low salinities. When the shale plugs were saturated with oil, 2 %- 15 % oil was recovered by water spontaneous imbibition, depending on water salinity and rock mineralogy. Similar observations were made when shale core plugs were applied to an overburden pressure. The results from this paper help us to understand the drive mechanisms in shale oil and shale gas reservoirs. It also stimulates us to explore new ways to improve oil and gas recovery in shale reservoirs...|$|R
5000|$|Lithic {{framework}} grains are {{pieces of}} ancient source rock that {{have yet to}} weather away to individual mineral <b>grains,</b> called lithic <b>fragments</b> or clasts. Lithic fragments can be any fine-grained or coarse-grained igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rock, although the most common lithic fragments found in sedimentary rocks are clasts of volcanic rocks.|$|R
