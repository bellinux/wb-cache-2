40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) currently lacks procedures for verifying compliance of signatories; this shortcoming, {{in combination with}} advances in biotechnology and a changing global security environment {{have resulted in the}} continued proliferation of biological and toxin weapons (BTW). Efforts to strengthen the BWC with an inspection protocol have been hampered by disagreement over intrusive inspection and the threat it poses to national security and industrial competitiveness. Debate within the United States, however, fails to consider the impact of U. S. involvement in the inspection regime on the behavior of signatories such as China which are suspected to be violating the treaty. Michael Swaine's model of Chinese government decision making is used to evaluate reactions to three U. S. policies toward BWC inspections. Research suggests that responsibility for BWC verification overlaps institutional interests and that U. S. participation in the protocol may have a positive effect in the Chinese cost-benefit calculation of accepting <b>inspections.</b> <b>Findings</b> suggest that one way of encouraging nations such as China in nonproliferation efforts may be to push forward and accept intrusive inspections, with an understanding of their limitations and costs.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{explores the}} attitudes and opinions of people either working or residing in a Probation Approved Premises (hostel) regarding the purpose of such premises. This includes the views of different categories of staff (Probation Officers, Probation Services Officers and relief staff) and those of offenders resident in the hostel. The opinions expressed are placed {{in the context of}} hostel policy, guidance and <b>inspections.</b> <b>Findings</b> are drawn from a case study into how people live out their lives in a hostel on a daily basis. This study focussed on sex offenders, but considered wider issues relevant to all offenders as part of the analysis. Data was collected through participant observation undertaken over 21 months, and through interviews with 24 staff members and 17 residents. In addition 12 (over 1 year) Multi-Agency Public Protection Panels were observed. Very little research has considered the daily lives and views of front-line staff or residents in hostels; the research presented here has addressed this gap. The key findings presented relate to the variety of perspectives relating to the purpose and role of probation hostels. Some differences in opinion were noted between all groups identified, although staff were less critical than residents. The opinions are discussed in respect to surveillance and supervision, management and control, reintegration and public protection...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{substantial}} evidence that placing child care provider inspection and complaint {{reports on the}} Internet changed the behavior of child care inspectors and improved the quality of child care received by low-income children. We believe that these results were forthcoming in part because: (1) the media widely reported the availability of this information on the Web, (2) the information was easy to locate and use and (3) the inspector's name and contact information appeared {{on the first page}} of the reports. To be more specific, we find that, after child care provider inspection and complaint reports are made available on the Internet: (1) inspectors produce significantly more inspection reports and (2) inspectors become significantly more likely to provide mixed reviews of centers {{in the course of their}} routine <b>inspections,</b> <b>finding</b> that centers sometimes meet minimum standards and other times fail to do so. Controlling for time trends and other unobserved policy and economic changes, we also find that, after inspection reports are made available on the Internet, there is a significant improvement in classroom environment and center management at centers serving low-income children with child care subsidies. While the magnitude of the improvement in terms of observational assessment scores (i. e., 2. 82 points, or « of a standard deviation) is moderate, it is comparable in size to improvements often achieved by more expensive approaches to improve classroom environment or the curriculum. ...|$|R

40|$|Shoplifting has a {{substantial}} impact on retailers, consumers and wider society, yet {{we know very}} little about people‟s attitudes towards this behaviour, especially from a non-Western perspective. A better understanding of consumer misbehaviour in Arabic countries would therefore be of particular interest as such societies represent a new market for global retailers. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to explore the initial results of consumers‟ attitudes towards shoplifting from a cross-cultural perspective. Preliminary analysis of 529 questionnaire responses from UK, US and Libyan consumers finds that attitudes towards shoplifting are broadly similar despite the different cultural and retail contexts.
