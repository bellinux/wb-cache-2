5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, the hotel's {{first floor}} held its {{reception}} rooms, parlors, dining rooms, library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to {{and north of}} the large dining room. The ballroom had classical fluted Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. Thomas Edison was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and {{was based on a}} restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia, and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized well water.|$|E
5|$|Monster's Ball II {{was held}} at Bound for Glory. Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match. James Mitchell {{accompanied}} Abyss to the ring. In a Monster's Ball match, pinfalls and submissions count anywhere. There are no disqualifications or count-outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed. It is called Monster's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked in a <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> for the preceding 24 hours without food or water. In the very beginning, Sabu started bleeding from his right eye, while Hardy had blood {{coming out of a}} cut on his arm. Midway through the bout, Rhino also started to bleed. Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended {{to the top of the}} Bound for Glory set. He then jumped off in a somersault and landed on Abyss. Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered, leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver. Afterwards, Rhino drove Hardy's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with a pin to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds. After this match, Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten-Man Gauntlet match would be held later in the show to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} showing Beyoncé against a green wall and Jay-Z {{sitting on a}} chair inside a <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b> Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to {{simultaneously}} play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune.

When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, Beyoncé is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial oral sex scene. Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé leaning back in a pose as fireflies race away.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E

5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

50|$|Klein {{spent hours}} in <b>dark</b> <b>rooms</b> {{creating}} the contrast or effect {{that he had}} in his mind. One of his many talents was the ability to photograph birds as if he positioned them himself. This talent led to one of his assistants saying that he carried birds in his pocket. However, this talent was due to Klein’s ability to wait until the right moment where the outcome matched his vision. He would then spend his time in the <b>dark</b> <b>rooms</b> to create his contrasting colors.His work entitled Zebra (1957) strongly shows this practice because of the sharp etching across the picture that creates an almost hypnotizing pattern.|$|R
