Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was to be available to individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and <b>elastic</b> <b>money</b> supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E
50|$|Bankers {{felt the}} real {{problem was that the}} United States was the last major country without a central bank, which might provide {{stability}} and emergency credit in times of financial crisis. While segments of the financial community were worried about the power that had accrued to JP Morgan and other 'financiers', most were more concerned about the general frailty of a vast, decentralized banking system that could not regulate itself without the extraordinary intervention of one man. Financial leaders who advocated a central bank with an elastic currency after the Panic of 1907 included Frank Vanderlip, Myron T. Herrick, William Barret Ridgely, George E. Roberts, Isaac Newton Seligman and Jacob H. Schiff. They stressed the need for an <b>elastic</b> <b>money</b> supply that could expand or contract as needed. After the scare of 1907 the bankers demanded reform; the next year, Congress established a commission of experts {{to come up with a}} nonpartisan solution.|$|E

40|$|We link {{banking and}} asset prices {{in a simple}} {{monetary}} macroeconomic model. Our main innovation is to consider how wide-spread default affects the banking system. We find that the interaction of credit, asset prices, and loan losses explains a complete spectrum of outcomes, including financial extremes for which separate theories were thought to apply. When fundamentals deteriorate, an asset price decline causes default among leveraged firms, and banks suffer loan losses. Their size determines whether a capital crunch, financial instability, or a banking crisis occurs. But self-fulfilling capital crunches and banking crises are also possible when loan losses force a credit contraction that feeds back onto asset prices. This model, unlike others, distinguishes between financial and macroeconomic stability, and derives explicit solutions and balance sheet effects even far from the steady state. It is applied to Japan’s Lost Decade and to the US Great Depression. It also sheds light {{on the role of}} asset prices in monetary policy, and on the procyclical effect of capital adequacy requirements.

40|$|Not to be quoted without authorizationThe {{debate about}} reserves- 100 -percent vs. {{fractional}} reserves- in monetary systems {{is more or}} less considered as definitely closed in mainstream economics: It is generally accepted in monetary theory that a monetary system is necessarily a fractional-reserve system. However, Austrian economists have not abandoned the debate and they are right, because it can be considered as the most important one within monetary economics. Interestingly enough, Austrian economists do not agree at all about this problem. However it would be simplistic just to oppose those who favor a 100 -percent reserve system and those who favor a fractionalreserve system, since the reasons for their respective support have to be made clear. Broadly speaking one may distinguish three streams of thought 1 : 1 - The supporters of a 100 -percent reserve system 2 mainly use two categories of arguments: The moral and juridical argument consists in stressing that fractional-reserves systems create incompatible property rights and are, therefore, a fraud. The utilitarian argument stresses that fractional-reserve systems are a cause of inflation and monetary unstability. 2 - Some of the supporters of a fractional-reserve system argue that it makes possible an <b>elastic</b> supply of <b>money</b> which make easier {{to meet the needs of}} a growing demand for money and avoids costly deflations and/or depressions 3. 3 - As we stress below, the first ones are right when arguing against the second ones and, not so paradoxically, we basically feel much closer to the first ones than to the second ones. But so long, it does not imply that there is no justification for fractional reserves. Thus, those who support a third line of reasoning, although they do not agree with those in the second category, favor fractional reserves for completely different reasons. As such, they do not accept all the arguments of the first ones, although they accept the criticism they address to the second ones. The aim of the present paper is to clarify the precise analysis of this thir...|$|R

This paper discusses whether three other institutional designs could achieve the same improvement in efficiency: (1) a private arrangement based on a payment versus a payment settlement standard supported by central banks' free intraday credit, (2) a financial institution that provides a negotiable certificate of deposit, and (3) a currency union. ...|$|E

Optimal {{allocation}} of resources requires an <b>elastic</b> <b>money</b> supply in both the foreign exchange market and the domestic credit market to clear all debts and foreign exchange at par value in the short run, and provide a constant money supply in the long run. Such monetary controls could be achieved by either an independent central bank or a private clearinghouse, but the governance structure of those institutions must reflect the interests of both debtors and creditors.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between nominal interest rates and prices using nearly two centuries of data from ten industrial countries. Both {{a positive relationship between}} interest rates and price levels (that is, a positive Gibson effect) and a negative relationship between interest rates and subsequent price changes (that is, a negative Fama-Fisher effect) prevailed until World War I. We propose a simple explanation wherein this doubly paradoxical juxtaposition of effects arises when money is supplied inelastically and prices are flexible. This double paradox disappeared after World War II when economies became mostly characterized by <b>elastic</b> <b>money</b> and sticky prices. During that period, a positive Fama-Fisher effect emerged while the Gibson effect largely dissipated.

40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} New Keynesian {{approach}} {{to analyze the}} relationship between nominal interest rates and prices. In this new framework, both a positive relation between interest rates and price levels (i. e., a positive Gibson effect) and a negative relation between interest rates and subsequent price changes (i. e., a negative Fama-Fisher effect) arise when money is supplied inelastically and prices are flexible. Such an economy is subject to Gibson’s Paradox, a long-standing puzzle in monetary economics, and a novel paradox identified here, a Fama-Fisher Paradox. By contrast, economies characterized by <b>elastic</b> <b>money</b> and sticky prices are not so paradoxical since nominal interest rates are positively related to subsequent inflation and ambiguously related to the price level. Empirical analysis of nearly two centuries of data for ten countries supports the new theory. Fama-Fisher Paradox, Gibson’s Paradox, inelastic money, flexible prices, gold standard...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{monetary}} policy is studied {{in an environment}} in which money plays an essential role in facilitating exchange and aggregate shocks affect individual agents asymmetrically. Exchange may be conducted using either bank deposits (inside money) or fiat currency (outside money). A central monetary authority both controls the stock of outside money and pursues an interest rate policy that affects the rate at which private banks create inside money. We find that the optimal {{monetary policy}} requires management of both interest rates and the quantity of outside money. By controlling interest rates the monetary authority can affect the price level in the short-run and adjust households' consumption, thus providing insurance against unfavorable aggregate shocks. The feasibility of the interest rate policy requires a minimum rate of trend inflation that may be positive and in principle quite large. The paper thus links two principal components of monetary policy: the optimal interest rate policy and the optimal long-run inflation rate. banking, inside money, <b>elastic</b> <b>money,</b> monetary policy, inflation, zero bound...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{relation}} between interest rate targets and money supply in a (bubble-free) rational expectation equilibrium of a standard cash-in-advance model. We examine contingent monetary injections aimed to implement interest rate sequences that satisfy interest rate target rules. An interest rate target with a positive inflation feedback in general corresponds to money growth rates rising with inflation. When prices are not completely flexible, this implies that a non-destabilizing money supply cannot implement a forward-looking and active interest rate rule. This principle also applies for an alternative model version with an interest <b>elastic</b> <b>money</b> demand. The implementation of a Taylor rule then requires a money supply that leads to explosive or oscillatory equilibrium sequences. In contrast, an inertial interest rate target can be implemented by a non-destabilizing money supply, even if the inflation feedback exceeds one, which is often found in interest rate rule regressions. contingent money supply; interest rate inertia; interest rate rules; macroeconomic stability; policy equivalence...|$|E
