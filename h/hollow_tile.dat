60|$|On the {{way back}} Babbitt picked up his partner and father-in-law, Henry T.

Cues of men with lunch-boxes clumped toward the immensity of new factories, sheets of glass and <b>hollow</b> <b>tile,</b> glittering shops where five thousand men worked beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares that would be sold up the Euphrates and across the veldt. The whistles rolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the April dawn; the song of labor in a city built--it seemed--for giants.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were other}} sources of new assignments: Niels Steensen became very {{interested}} in a new method of construction in which <b>hollow</b> <b>tiles</b> {{were included in the}} compression zone of reinforced concrete slabs, making floors and roofs lighter, as well as less expensive.

40|$|Concern for the {{environment}} has lately heightened awareness {{about the need for}} recycling in the construction industry. However, some standards, such as the Spanish standard, only accept the recycling of aggregates derived from concrete, which limits the extensive use of construction and demolition waste, which are produced in much bigger volumes. The aim of this work was to explore the possibility of using recycled mixed aggregates (RMA) in the preparation of precast non-structural concretes. To that end different percentages of natural aggregate were replaced by RMA in non-structural elements (25, 50, 75 and 100 %). Contents of cement, water, and the dosages commonly used by companies were unchanged by the introduction of RMA. The characterization of the prepared elements has been done using the specific tests for each type of non-structural element (terrazzo for indoor use, <b>hollow</b> <b>tiles,</b> kerbstones and paving blocks) : compression and flexural strength, water absorption, dimensional tolerances, abrasion and slipping resistance. The paving blocks, kerbstones, and <b>hollow</b> <b>tiles</b> prepared were tested for 360 days. The stability of the tested properties confirmed the possibility of using these wastes on an industrial scale satisfying the standard requirements. However, the surface of terrazzo with RMA is not as good as that prepared with natural aggregate.
