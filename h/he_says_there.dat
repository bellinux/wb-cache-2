5|$|After {{seeing the}} last girl, Yogesh's mother beseeches him to choose with his heart {{instead of his}} mind. Yogesh sees all of the girls in a dream, {{and in the morning}} decides who he will marry. He goes to Rajni's office because she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>there</b> is no need for Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E
5|$|Aksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, {{signals to}} them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the Abwehr, the German {{military}} intelligence service. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they are without money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the Danish Army Intelligence. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>there</b> {{will be no more}} attacks, as they need peace to assemble men for a big attack. The three agree that they should not follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.|$|E

25|$|Cauchy {{makes some}} general remarks about {{functions}} in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse algébrique (1821). From what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>there,</b> {{it is clear}} that he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that he is prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.|$|E
25|$|According to a Hindu American Foundation report, {{the rights}} and {{religious}} freedom of Kashmiri Hindus have been severely curtailed since 1989, when there was an organised and systematic campaign by Islamist militants to cleanse Hindus from Kashmir. Less than 4,000 Kashmiri Hindus remain in the valley, reportedly living with daily threats of violence and terrorism. Sanjay Tickoo, who heads the KPSS, an organisation which looks after Pandits who remain in the Valley, says the situation is complex. On one hand the community did face intimidation and violence {{but on the other}} hand <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>there</b> was no genocide or mass murder as suggested by Pandits who are based outside of Kashmir.|$|E
500|$|Burt drives Kurt to Blaine's [...] "secret" [...] {{marriage}} proposal at Dalton Academy in {{the season}} premiere. Kurt, who {{is aware of the}} proposal, asks his father for advice on what he should do. He tells Kurt the story about how he met his mother when he was twenty-two, and married her six months later. While married life was not easy, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>there</b> is nothing he would change. In [...] "The Quarterback", Burt is shown with Kurt and Carole after the death of Finn as they attempt to clean out Finn's room. He decides to keep the football from Kurt's first game, and the lamp from Kurt's basement re-decoration. He expresses his grief by saying that he should have hugged Finn more, and comforts Carole when she starts to break down. When New Directions dedicates their Nationals Show Choir Competition performance to Finn, they invite Carole and Burt to accompany them to Los Angeles for the event.|$|E

500|$|In an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} composition [...] "In Dreams Awake", Binkelman opines that this song bears a strong contemporary classical influence and that some people might even hear strains of Philip Glass’ music. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>there</b> is an exultant feel to the melody, but because Joseph maintains absolute control of nuance and shading the song never descends into overblown melodrama or bombast. As the track progresses, the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif, with more textural synths, bell tones and bell trees, and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur. The Glass-like motif returns for the song’s finale. [...] Parsons characterizes this same song as [...] "a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings. Building as it evolves, it never takes a breath until {{near the end of}} the theme. From there, the piece becomes dreamy and ambient, [...] "floating effortlessly" [...] on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter, increasing to the intensity of the first theme". At the same time, Debbage notes [...] "...the multi-movements found on the challenging 'In Dreams Awake'..." [...] and says that it [...] "...opens with an extended piece of strings that almost appear to be battling against each other, only to move into a beautiful dreamy midsection to once again return to the more chaotic strings, much like our nonsensical dreams".|$|E

Dershowitz offered to produce his handwritten drafts (he does not type) to debunk the claim that The Case for Israel was ghostwritten and claimed Finkelstein has not asked to see them.|$|E
2500|$|For Spinoza, as {{discussed}} in Parts Two and Three of his Ethics, affects are states of mind and body {{that are related to}} (but not exactly synonymous with) feelings and emotions, of which <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>there</b> are three primary kinds: pleasure or joy (laetitia), pain or sorrow (tristitia) and desire (cupiditas) or appetite. Subsequent philosophical usage by Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and their translator Brian Massumi, while derived explicitly from Spinoza, tends to distinguish more sharply than Spinoza does between affect and what are conventionally called emotions. Affects are difficult to grasp and conceptualize because, as Spinoza says, [...] "an affect or passion of the mind [...] is a confused idea" [...] which is only perceived by the increase or decrease it causes in the body's vital force. The term [...] "affect" [...] is central to what has become known as the [...] "affective turn" [...] in the humanities and social sciences.|$|E

2500|$|Mickey {{becomes the}} victim of {{bullying}} from Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) in May 2008, who does such things as assaulting Mickey and vandalising his property. Mickey is too scared to take any action against Sean, and relies on his sister's boyfriend, Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord), for protection. On 18 June 2008 he is knocked out when Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) hits him {{over the head with}} a crowbar, whilst trying to steal Dawn's baby, Summer. When Micky awakes, he manages to stop May from absconding with Summer, but she subsequently causes a gas explosion, and the Millers' house goes up in flames. [...] May is killed in the explosion. Mickey, Dawn and Summer are trapped in a first floor bedroom. When Mickey attempts to pass Summer out the window to the awaiting crowd below, he loses consciousness and drops her, though she is caught by Jase. Dawn pushes an unconscious Mickey out the window, saving his life. Mickey discovers a letter from Rosie, offering Keith a job as a concierge at her home in the Cotswolds. All of the Millers are angry at him for not acknowledging the letter, and Mickey decides to take the job instead as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>there</b> is nothing left for him in Walford.
