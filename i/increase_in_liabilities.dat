50|$|The Fiscal Responsibility Law {{also allowed}} for the {{creation}} of two sovereign wealth funds: the Pension Reserve Fund (PRF) and the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund (ESSF). The PRF was created {{as a response to the}} expected <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities</b> related to old-age pensions and benefits, especially for the poor, and it had accumulated US$5.883 million (market value) by the end of 2012. The PRF is set to receive yearly capital injections between 0.2% and 0.5% of the previous year’s GDP depending on the fiscal surplus, so new resources are secured every year. The ESSF’s objective is to stabilize fiscal spending by providing funds to finance fiscal deficits and debt amortization and had market value of US$14.998 million by the end of year 2012. Each year, the ESSF accumulates any fiscal surplus remaining after the contributions to the FRP and to the capital of the Central Bank of Chile, excluding debt service and anticipatory contributions during the previous year. The funds are managed by the Central Bank of Chile and a Financial Committee advises on their investment policy. Chile also participated in the discussion and agreed to the Santiago Principles.|$|E

30|$|This article {{offers a}} {{narrative}} of the Spanish crisis building upon previous literature and the papers published in this issue. This narrative focuses on two main topics: (1) {{the reasons why the}} Spanish economy embarked in the expansionary/speculative path resulting in an over-accumulation of debt and severe macroeconomic imbalances that led to the crisis, and (2) the factors that explain why the Spanish crisis materialized with such a high intensity and duration. The article addresses them by highlighting three main characteristics of the Spanish economy in the pre-crisis period: (1) a composition of economic activity increasingly biased towards construction, real state, and other non-tradeable sectors, (2) a banking system that was able to satisfy the huge increase in credit demand arising from households and firms, in a context of very low real interest rates, excessive optimism about growth, and large facilities for using real assets as loan collateral, and (3) the recourse to external funding that originated an unprecedented <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities</b> with respect {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis paper {{provides}} information for decision {{making of the}} managers and the staff of national university hospitals. MethodsIn order to conduct a financial analysis of national university hospitals, this study uses reports on the final accounts of 10 university hospitals from 2008 to 2011. ResultsThe results of comparing 2008 and 2011 showed {{that there was a}} general decrease in total assets, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and a decrease in total medical revenues, with a continuous deficit in many hospitals. Moreover, as national university hospitals have low debt dependence, their management conditions generally seem satisfactory. However, some individual hospitals suffer severe financial difficulties and thus depend on short-term debts, which generally aggravate the profit and loss structure. Various indicators show that the financial state and business performance of national university hospitals have been deteriorating. ConclusionThese research findings will be used as important basic data for managers who make direct decisions in this uncertain business environment or by researchers who analyze the medical industry to enable informed decision-making and optimized execution. Furthermore, this study is expected to contribute to raising government awareness of the need to foster and support the national university hospital industry...|$|E
40|$|After 2000, {{pension funds}} found {{themselves}} in a bind. Due to declines in long-term interest rates, liabilities of pension plans rose, and asset prices fell as the stock market bubble burst. The <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities</b> and assets required companies to make contributions to their pension plans at a time when earnings were low and they are least able to afford it. Moreover, pension funds were discouraged by existing rules from making additional contributions when times were good. The confluence of low interest rates and low rates of returns on stocks, though, is a counter-cyclical phenomenon, which is likely to recur in future recessions. Consequently, addressing the short-term problem of large demands on firms to fund their pension funds should also address the long-term counter-cyclical problem of rising contributions when economic times are bad. We propose to consider three changes to existing funding rules that may help to reduce the cyclicality of funding rules: (1) a long-term average of long-term interest rates as the benchmark discount rate, (2) asset valuation assumptions that adjust for market price deviations from the long-term trend of asset prices, and (3) increases in the required funding level. We use a pension simulation model to evaluate annual contributions and funding limits if the current rules had existed for the past 50 years, and to calculate the likely improvements resulting from alternative funding rules in the future.

40|$|Exchange {{rates in}} Latin America display a large volatility, {{constitute}} a central {{element of the}} policy strategies and their evolution have an important impact on financial stability due to the dollarization of liabilities which most countries exhibit. However, assessments on equilibrium exchange rates are scarce in the region. This paper aims at both filling this gap and analysing {{the impact of the}} adjustment of the exchange rates to equilibrium on financial stability. Building on the methodology of Alberola et al (1999 - 2002), we show that the stock of net foreign assets and the evolution of productivity are the fundamentals underlying the behavior of the real exchange rate. Using an unobserved components methodology in a cointegration framework, a time varying equilibrium real exchange rate is derived, and deviations from this equilibrium provide an estimate of the degree of multilateral misalignment. The results uncover among other things the large overvaluation of the Argentinean peso in 2001, which was only partially explained by the estimated dollar overvaluation. The adjustment of exchange rates in 2002 corrected this and, to a lesser extent, other misalignments. The final part of the paper addresses the impact of liability dollarization on the adjustment of exchange rates. It is argued that the real exchange rate will tend to overshoot its equilibrium level, due to the need to foster higher current account surplus in the aftermath of depreciation to make up for to the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities.</b> An adjustment to account for this effect is performed on the previous results. This overshooting, when coupled with sudden stops of capitals, may help explaining the higher volatility of real exchange rates in the region.

40|$|Scholars {{have long}} {{maintained}} that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> encourage firms to contract out risky activities {{in order to}} take advantage of so-called judgment-proof strategies. These strategies allow entities to limit their liability through contractual arrangements with nearly insolvent firms. However, the use of judgment-proof firms triggers countervailing effects: it provides opportunities to externalize liability through judgment-proof firms, but the insolvency of these firms introduces distortion in care levels that can generate more liability costs. These costs may outweigh the benefits of externalizing liability, making contracting out suboptimal. A simple model of organizational decision making with judgment-proof firms is developed and applied to the oil industry, where contracting out decreased in response to heightened liability following the Exxon Valdez oil spill...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{development}} of the Fayetteville Shale Play, an unconventional natural gas reservoir in Central and Eastern Arkansas, has created considerable opportunities for {{the state and its}} citizens as the industry has made substantial investment in the region. These developments have resulted in thousands of new jobs for Arkansans, billions of dollars in direct and indirect output, and millions in state and local tax revenues. One of the most visible issues in recent state news has been the controversy surrounding the severance tax levied by the state government on the extraction of natural gas. The question at hand has been whether or not to increase Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s rate. The state has had the lowest severance tax incidence in the nation causing many to speak out for a raise in the tax rate to something comparable to surrounding states in the region. These demands caught the attention of Arkansas Governor Beebe who worked with natural gas companies to find a reasonable severance tax package including some discounts for shale play wells. The legislature shortly thereafter approved this increase to be enacted January 1, 2009. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the state 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to these recent events and offer any additional recommendations that may enhance this set of decisions. A comparison of Arkansas Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas was conducted on multiple levels of economic conditions to evaluate the overall tax structure within each state. Outside research was also considered in forming these conclusions. After completing an extensive cross-state comparison and incorporating econometric research, it was determined that the Arkansas state legislature was justified in increasing the severance tax rate. However, the rationale for tax increases - specifically the reasoning that other states have higher severance tax rates - is somewhat flawed based on consideration of economic conditions, natural gas production numbers, and overall tax structures. A stronger rationale lies in additional research that suggests that an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities</b> for severance taxes yields minor changes in investment and drilling activity and potentially positive economic rewards...|$|E

An <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> an asset account is subtracted from net income, and an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> a <b>liability</b> account is added back to net income.

25|$|On revaluation, the {{multiplier}} is adjusted so {{that the}} overall <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> across {{the country is in}} line with the Retail Prices Index, a measure of inflation. A property whose rateable value changes exactly in line with the national average would see an inflation-only rise <b>in</b> <b>liability.</b> Conversely, properties with unusually large changes in rateable value would have a significant change <b>in</b> <b>liability.</b> To smooth these jumps <b>in</b> <b>liability,</b> schemes of transitional relief have been applied to each rating list. These operate by restricting the proportion by which liability may change per year, both upwards and downwards. The 1990 and 1995 transitional relief schemes required funding from the Treasury, while the 2000 list scheme was designed to be revenue-neutral over the lifetime of the list, albeit with Treasury funding at the beginning. The Local Government Act 2003 required that all revaluations in England feature a revenue-neutral scheme, beginning with the 2005 rating list. Transitional relief applies only to changes <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> between rating lists, not changes within lists. For example, under the 2005 transitional relief scheme in England, if a rateable value had risen by 20%, the rise <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> would be restricted to 12.5% in the first year, 17.5% in the second year, and the full 20% in the third year (different restrictions would apply for a small business). Transitional relief schemes have been applied to the 1990, 1995, and 2000 rating lists in England and Wales, and to the 2005 rating list in England.|$|R

Results show that an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> polluter <b>liability</b> does not necessarily increase safety or efficiency in cases where the polluter is risk neutral. Complete polluter liability is found to yield Pareto optimality. When either party is risk averse, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> polluter <b>liability</b> may sometimes reduce safety and efficiency. If the polluter is risk neutral and the victim is risk averse, Pareto optimality is only achieved by assigning full liability on the polluter, i. e. giving the victim complete property rights to a clean environment. If the polluter is risk averse and the victim is risk neutral, no level of polluter <b>liability</b> is optimal. <b>In</b> this case, optimality can only be achieved through a contract on abatement activities, such that the risk-averse polluter receives a guaranteed payment regardless of the stochastic outcome. ...|$|R

This paper {{shows that the}} connection between director liability and board behavior is more subtle, because directors have multiple means to respond to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> exposure: They can increase oversight to prevent accounting manipulation and/or reduce performance-based CEO pay to mitigate the CEO's ex ante incentive to engage in manipulation. These two decisions are interrelated, implying {{that the effects of}} director liability on board oversight and CEO incentive pay are ambiguous. In particular, the model predicts that, for firms in which board oversight is difficult and costly (e. g., large firms with complex business operations), a stricter legal environment for directors leads to a lower level of board oversight, lower CEO incentive pay, and lower shareholder value. corporate governance, director liability, board oversight, CEO incentive pay, earnings management...|$|R
