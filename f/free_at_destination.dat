40|$|Clustering {{of housing}} {{development}} around rail stations holds promise {{not only for}} increasing transit ridership, but also yielding important environmental and social benefits. This paper examines evidence on {{the degree to which}} existing housing complexes near rail stations in California have encouraged transit usage. For Bay Area cities served by BART, residents living near rail stations were around five times as likely to commute by rail transit as the average resident-worker in the same city. The strongest predictors of whether station-area residents commuted by rail was whether their destination was near a rail station and whether they could park for <b>free</b> <b>at</b> their <b>destination.</b> Neighbourhood density and proximity of housing to stations were also related to rail travel. The paper concludes that if transit-based housing is to reap significant mobility and environmental benefits, it must be accompanied by transit-based employment growth and programmes that pass on true costs to motorists and parkers. ...|$|R

In communication system information data is transferred from source to destination through channel. In between, source and destination, data may be corrupted due to any type of noise. To find original information we use Hamming code error detection and correction technique. In hamming code error detection and correction technique, to get error <b>free</b> data <b>at</b> <b>destination,</b> we encrypt information data according to even and odd parity method before transmission of information at source end. In this project 14 bit Information data {{is divided into two}} groups of 7 bit data. After this division each group is encrypted using four Redundancy bit. In this way 14 bit information data at sender end is now converted into two groups of 11 bit data (with redundant bits). Both groups are joined to make total 22 bit Information data. At Receiver end 22 bit information data in divided into two groups of 11 bit data and each group is detected and corrected using even and odd parity check method.

30|$|All {{these papers}} assume that CSI and {{decoding}} error probability at the relay are available <b>at</b> the <b>destination,</b> {{which is not}} always true in practical wireless systems. It is shown in[19, 20] that imperfect CSI can significantly degrade the performance of cooperative systems. In this paper, we study the impact of both CSI and decoding error probability at the relay in the multiple access relay channel. It is assumed that CSI at the receivers is acquired via the transmission of pilot symbols. The decoding error probability at the relay is not assumed to be available for <b>free</b> <b>at</b> the <b>destination</b> but we propose a practical way of transmitting a quantized version of it. We study the performance of two notable relaying protocols: Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying and Demodulate-and-Forward (DMF) relaying. Behind, Compute-and-Forward has been recently introduced as a new relaying protocol which achieves {{a higher rate than}} existing relaying techniques and relies on lattice decoding structure[21]. However, this relaying technique is far different from our work in decoding aspects, hence is out of scope of this paper. In DF relaying, channel decoding is performed at the relay before NC and forwarding. On the other hand, in the DMF case, only demodulation is performed at the relay. As such, DMF has less computational complexity than DF but it is more prone to decoding errors at the relay. For each protocol, we develop two new channel-aware JNCD algorithms. To summarize, the contributions of the paper are as follows: we show that JNCD provides better performance than separate network channel decoding only if the destination has enough knowledge of the decoding error probability at the relay; in addition, this gain will be larger as the number of fading blocks per codeword increases. Also, it is shown that the number of pilot symbols mostly affects the coding gain of the system with a negligible impact on the diversity order, at least for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range of interest. Finally, it is shown that CSI quantization errors affect both coding gain and diversity order. Additionally, it is shown that, in general, 3 -bit quantization is sufficient for DMF relaying and 6 -bit quantization is needed for DF relaying.|$|R

Fixed charge solid {{transportation}} {{problems are}} formulated under a budget constraint <b>at</b> each <b>destination.</b> Unit transportation costs, fixed charges, sources at origins, demands <b>at</b> <b>destinations,</b> conveyances capacities {{are assumed to}} be crisp or fuzzy. Budget constraints <b>at</b> <b>destinations</b> are imposed. It is also assumed that transported units are crisp. So the problem is formulated as constraint optimization programming problem in crisp and fuzzy environments. As optimization of fuzzy objective as well as consideration of fuzzy constraint is not well defined, credibility of fuzzy event are used to transform the problem into equivalent crisp problem. The reduced crisp problem is solved following Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method using lingo software. The models are illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive routing, which {{dynamically}} selects {{the route}} of a packet, has been widely studied for interconnection networks in massively parallel computers and system area networks. Although adaptive routing {{has the advantage of}} providing high bandwidth, it may deliver packets out-of-order, which some message passing libraries don’t accept. In this paper, we propose two mechanisms called 1) FIFO transmission and 2) couple limitation to guarantee in-order packet delivery in adaptive routing. Both of them limit packet injection at source hosts. The FIFO transmission completely avoids packet sorting <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> hosts, while the couple limitation uses few additional buffers to sort packets <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> hosts. Evaluation results show that the FIFO transmission and the couple limitation achieve a similar throughput to that of a method equipped with huge (infinite) buffers enough to store all outof-order packets <b>at</b> <b>destination</b> hosts under both synthetic traffic and NAS Parallel Benchmarks...|$|R
