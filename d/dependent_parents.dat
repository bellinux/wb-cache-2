Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Initially, Cheney was not drafted due to his marriage to Lynne Cheney. When the draft was expanded to include married men without children, he applied for four deferments in sequence. He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant.

We develop a model of family bargaining to study the impact of the distribution of bargaining power within the family on the choices of nursing homes, and on the location and prices chosen by nursing homes in a Hotelling economy. We show that, if the <b>dependent</b> <b>parent</b> only cares about the distance, whereas his child cares also about the price, the mark up rate of nursing homes is increasing in the bargaining power of the <b>dependent</b> <b>parent.</b> We contrast the laissez-faire with the social optimum, and we show how the social optimum can be decentralized in a first-best setting and in a second-best setting (i. e. when the government cannot force location). Finally, we explore the robustness of our results to considering families with more than one child, and to introducing a wealth accumulation motive within a dynamic OLG model, which allows us to study the joint dynamics of wealth and nursing home prices. We show that a higher capital stock raises the price of nursing homes through higher mark up rates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThis article {{presents}} the results of a study on alcohol dependent patients attachment style and its various dimensions. MethodThere were 94 alcoholic and 94 non-alcoholic participants (both 53 women and 41 men). Plopa's Questionnaire of Attachment Styles (KSP) and Collins and Read's Adult Attachment Scale (AAS) were used. The variable of having a <b>dependent</b> <b>parent</b> was also taken into consideration. ResultsThe study has shown that people with alcohol dependence significantly differ from non-alcoholics in terms of attachment style and its dimensions. They also receive significantly lower scores on secure attachment style and higher scores on insecure attachment style – anxious-ambivalent and avoidant style, and higher scores on attachment dimensions – anxiety and avoidance. There were no differences in attachment styles and their dimensions for patients with alcohol <b>dependent</b> and non-dependent <b>parents.</b> ConclusionsAlcohol <b>dependent</b> persons rarely present secure connection to others and more often manifest mistrust in interpersonal relationships and avoid closeness and intimacy...|$|R

The only source of information asymmetry stems from the governments inability to observe the degree of altruism of the adult child for his/her parent. Further tax collection entails some social costs. In such a second best setting, we show that the quality of institutional care has to be kept relatively low and that compared to altruistic children, non-altruistic ones enjoy a high level of consumption. ...|$|R

5000|$|On 8 May 2012, Redzz {{released}} his sixth and most recent single titled Through The Eyes (formally known as I'm An Alcoholic) which caused a huge online stir on its initial release gaining over 116,000 views on YouTube and trending number 1 on Twitter {{as the most}} shared video ahead of Justin Bieber. On 14 May 2012, Redzz was interviewed by Chicago Monthly & Chelsea Monthly magazines where {{he talked about the}} story behind 'Through The Eyes' and his views on combating alcoholism which also prompted a supportive response from former Liberal Democrats MP Lembit Opik who said; [...] "I think it is very important what Redzz is doing with the 'Through The Eyes' song, especially when it concerns young people. The more education they get the better informed they are". On 16 May 2012, Through The Eyes went number 1 on The Official International Independent Charts. The song is {{based on a true story}} about an old friend of Redzz named Del, who was an alcoholic. In the song Redzz raps in First-person narrative as if he is Del the alcoholic, portraying the downward spiral in Del's life, dealing with the effects of alcoholism and also explaining why Del became an alcoholic to help the listeners sympathize with the character. The music video to Through The Eyes was the first music video to be co-directed by Redzz himself, it was also co-directed by Sal Warner & Elmino Da Great. In the music video Redzz is depicted as either (left open for the viewers to debate) a guardian angel or a Grim Reaper who is seen by the viewer but not by Del (Simon Paice). This is made clear at the end of the music video when a newspaper with the title [...] "Rapper Redzz Dies Of Alcoholism" [...] is read by a man in a pub. He then unknowingly, walks past Redzz who then proceeds to follow him, indicating the man is to be the next victim. The music video features cameo roles from; Simon Paice, Ian Duck (from the films Derailed, Run Fat Boy Run & Wimbledon) & Sal Warner. Scenes in the music video were primarily filmed in and around Redzz home towns Leyton & Leytonstone in East London such as The Coach And Horses pub, Leyton Supermarket & Thatched House.

On 3 June 2012, Redzz performed 'Through The Eyes' at the annual Upfest, a charitable festival in association with NACOA.

In a tweet on Twitter Redzz stated [...] "It's sad how a song about getting drunk out of your face is acceptable, but a song about the negative effects of alcohol is seen as a taboo." ...|$|E
