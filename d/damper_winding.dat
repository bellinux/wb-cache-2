40|$|This thesis aims to {{identify}} methods for detection of <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> faults in synchronous machines (SMs) powered by {{variable frequency drives}} (VFDs). The problem of failing damper windings has received attention after reports of serious damage which have been discovered during maintenance checks. Since SMs often are used for critical applications, failures can be devastating if they cause total breakdowns. Also, VFDs are believed to cause additional stress in the damper windings of SMs and since the utilisation of VFDs is increasing, the problem is expected to become {{more common in the}} future. Currently, there is no method for detection of failures during normal operation of SMs, thus research in the area is required. Simulations based on the finite element method as well as laboratory experiments have been performed in order to examine the impact of VFDs and to find a way of detecting <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> failures. The results confirm that utilization of VFDs produce higher currents in the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> compared to direct-online operation. The results also show that in case of a damper bar failure, the current distribution among the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> segments is affected. However, monitoring of all <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> segments is unrealistic due to the number of sensors required. Another approach, which has been investigated, involves monitoring of the current through the pole interconnectors of one of the endrings. Potential fault indicators have been found by analysing the currents in the frequency domain. However, further studies are required in order to evaluate the method. Also the temperature of the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> was investigated as an indicator...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{machines}} {{are subject to}} different types of failures. Early detection of the incipient faults and fast maintenance may prevent costly consequences. Fault diagnosis of wind turbine is especially important because they are situated at extremely high towers and therefore inaccessible. For offshore plants, bad weather can prevent any repair actions for several weeks. In {{some of the new}} wind turbines synchronous generators are used and directly connected to the grid without the need of power converters. Despite intensive research efforts directed at rotor fault diagnosis in induction machines, the research work pertinent to <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> failure of synchronous machines is very limited. This dissertation is concerned with the in-depth study of <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> failure and its traceable symptoms in different machine signals and parameters. First, a model of a synchronous machine with <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> based on the winding function approach is presented. Next, simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed. A specially designed inside-out synchronous machine with a <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> is employed for the experimental setup. Finally, a novel analytical method is developed to predict the behavior of the left sideband amplitude for different numbers and locations of the broken bars. This analysis is based on the magnetic field theory and the unbalanced multiphase circuits. It is found that due to the asymmetrical structure of <b>damper</b> <b>winding,</b> the left sideband component in the stator current spectrum of the synchronous machine during steady state asynchronous operation is not {{similar to that of the}} induction machine with broken bars. As a result, the motor current signature analysis (MCSA) for detection rotor failures in the induction machine is usable to detect broken damper bars in synchronous machines. However, a novel intelligent-systems based approach is developed that can identify the severity of the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> failure. This approach potentially can be used in a non-invasive condition monitoring system to monitor the deterioration of a synchronous motor <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> as the number of broken bars increase over time. Some other informative features such as speed spectrum, transient time, torque-speed curve and rotor slip are also found for <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Permanent Magnet (PM) {{machines}} {{can have}} difficulties dealing with unstable loads, which in worst case {{can make the}} machine to step-out of synchronous speed. This problem can be avoided by equipping the rotor with damper windings. During load variation the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> will induce a torque to dampen {{the impact of the}} load variation. To investigate the effects from using damper windings a numerical model of a PM machine was developed and studied in this thesis. The model is intended to operate with regards to load torque and the stator field. The stator configuration which was used in this thesis is very complex, which resulted in a lot of trial and error. Due to the complexity of the stator meant it had to be applied with a current density, which means that the voltage over the phases was not taken into account during the simulations. This simplification appears to have created an unnatural damping factor in the simulations. Simulations show that a high-conductive <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> performs faster during load variations then a low conductive <b>damper</b> <b>winding.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} a low resistance will induce a high torque at low slip. The size of the windings also affects the performance but these are small and difficult to notice. Simulations show that the size of the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> should be between 5 - 10 % of the size of the stator winding. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{distributed}} energy production, {{permanent magnet}} synchronous generators (PMSG) are often {{connected to the}} grid via frequency converters, such as voltage source line converters. The price of the converter may constitute {{a large part of}} the costs of a generating set. Some of the permanent magnet synchronous generators with converters and traditional separately excited synchronous generators couldbe replaced by direct-on-line (DOL) non-controlled PMSGs. Small directly networkconnected generators are likely to have large markets in the area of distributed electric energy generation. Typical prime movers could be windmills, watermills and internal combustion engines. DOL PMSGs could also be applied in island networks, such as ships and oil platforms. Also various back-up power generating systems could be carried out with DOL PMSGs. The benefits would be a lower priceof the generating set and the robustness and easy use of the system. The performance of DOL PMSGs is analyzed. The electricity distribution companies have regulations that constrain the design of the generators being connected to the grid. The general guidelines and recommendations are applied in the analysis. By analyzing the results produced by the simulation model for the permanent magnet machine, the guidelines for efficient <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> parameters for DOL PMSGs are presented. The simulation model is used to simulate grid connections and load transients. The <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> parameters are calculated by the finite element method (FEM) and determined from experimental measurements. Three-dimensional finite element analysis (3 D FEA) is carried out. The results from the simulation model and 3 D FEA are compared with practical measurements from two prototype axial flux permanent magnet generators provided with damper windings. The dimensioning of the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> parameters is case specific. The <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> should be dimensioned based on the moment of inertia of the generating set. It is shown that the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> has optimal values to reach synchronous operation in the shortest period of time after transient operation.

40|$|Hydropower {{research}} is often {{perceived to be}} an old and exhausted field of study but with ageing equipment and the need for more intermittent operation caused by an increased share of other renewable energy sources new challenges lie ahead. The main focus of this dissertation are the electromagnetic forces resulting from nonuniform air gap flux, whether it be caused by rotor eccentricity or a faulty field winding. Results are predominantly obtained from measurements on an experimental generator and numerical simulations. With the computational capacity available today it is possible to numerically analyse physical phenomena that previously could only be studied with analytical tools. Numerical models can also be expanded to encompass more than one aspect of generator operation in coupled field-circuit models without model complexity surpassing computer capability. Three studies of unbalanced magnetic pull, UMP, in synchronous salient pole generators constitute the main part of this thesis. The first is a study of how parallel stator circuits affect the unbalanced magnetic pull caused by rotor eccentricity. Depending on the relationship between the geometry of the separate circuits and the direction of the eccentricity it was found that parallel circuits could reduce the UMP substantially. Secondly, an investigation of the effect of <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> configuration on UMP was performed. The results showed that <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> resistivity and the distance between the damper bars in a pole determine the effectiveness of the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> in reducing the UMP. Simulations of a production machine indicate that the reduction can be substantial from damper windings with low resistivity. The third study analyses the consequences of field winding interturn short circuits. Apart from a resulting rotating unbalanced magnetic pull it is found that the unaffected poles with the same polarity as the affected pole experience an increase in flux density. In a fourth article a new stand still frequency response, SSFR, test method including measurements of <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> voltage and current is presented. It is found that the identified models are capable of predicting the stator to damper transfer function both with and without the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> measurements included...|$|E

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} an {{advanced}} {{contribution to the}} design process of large synchronous generators with high number of poles. It proposes two original contributions, the first one allowing a very precise prediction of the no-load voltage and of the no-load losses in the <b>damper</b> <b>winding,</b> the second one allowing a rigorous calculation of the unbalanced magnetic pulls and of the associated losses in the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> {{in the case of}} a machine in eccentricity conditions or with any kind of rotor and stator deformation. Both contributions are based on the same strategy, apart from the fact that it has to be taken into account that the geometry is not the same in both cases, it is supposed perfect in the first case and damaged in the second. The magnetostatic 2 D finite element method (FEM) is used to determine the magnetic coupling of the machine conductors as a function of the rotor position. These values of magnetic coupling are then used in the voltage equations of the machine which are solved using a numerical method. A particularity is the calculation of the magnetic flux coupled with a conductor in two situations, once with only the field winding currents, fixing the levels of saturation, and once with field winding currents and a current in one damper bar. This strategy leads to the concept of differential inductances. The two contributions are different because for the first one the geometric, cyclic periodicity of the machine is of one stator slot pitch and for the damaged machine no short cyclic periodicity can be found. In the first case the values of flux linkage and the inductances necessary for the voltage prediction are therefore calculated only for some rotor positions within one stator slot pitch. These values are then reused for all other rotor positions. This method allows to predict the currents and the losses in the <b>damper</b> <b>winding,</b> as well as the no-load voltage waveform with the same precision as a transient magnetic FEM simulation but reducing the simulation time by a factor of about 20. Comparisons with measurements and with transient magnetic FEM simulations on several operating units prove the precision of this approach. As in the case of the calculation of the unbalanced magnetic pulls and of the associated losses in the <b>damper</b> <b>winding</b> for a machine with damaged geometry one can not take advantage of a short geometric periodicity, the procedure has to be different. Again the magnetic coupling of the different circuits is calculated in advance using the magnetostatic FEM, but in this case without rotation of the rotor. The stator slotting can be neglected because it does not influence the aimed results. Any kind of geometric deformation is represented by contiguous segments, placed on the interior stator surface, which can be displaced radially in both directions. A correct adjustment in time of the air gap value of each segment allows to represent any combination of static and dynamic deformation of the air gap for any position of the rotor. The use of a linear superposition of the linearized influences of all segments on the values of magnetic coupling and on the inductances allows to reduce the number of preliminary magnetostatic FEM calculations to the minimum. It has to be specified that the preliminary magnetostatic 2 D FEM calculations are carried out only once for a given machine. They can then be used for different deformations of the geometry. If one wants to use the transient magnetic 2 D FEM the whole approach has to be repeated for every geometric deformation to be analyzed. The results obtained haven been systematically compared to results obtained through transient magnetic FEM calculations. The agreement is excellent and the reduction of calculation time is enormous. Both contributions were implemented in highly automatized tools; they are therefore well adapted to an industrial application...|$|E

An in-detailed sensitivity analysis of the machine’s design parameters that mostly affect the performance of the platform under investigation is performed. It has been found that the position and the shape of axial ventilation ducts, as well as the stator slot shape do not affect the electromagnetic performance in a significant way and it can be highly beneficial from a thermal point of view, resulting in reduced rotor temperatures.
