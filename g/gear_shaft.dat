25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|E
25|$|An {{epicyclic}} differential can use {{epicyclic gearing}} to split and apportion torque asymmetrically between {{the front and}} rear axles. An epicyclic differential {{is at the heart of}} the Toyota Prius automotive drive train, where it interconnects the engine, motor-generators, and the drive wheels (which have a second differential for splitting torque as usual). It has the advantage of being relatively compact along the length of its axis (that is, the sun <b>gear</b> <b>shaft).</b>|$|E

25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter <b>gear</b> <b>shaft.</b> The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|E
25|$|In DCTs {{where the}} two {{clutches}} are arranged concentrically, the larger outer clutch drives the odd-numbered gears and the smaller inner clutch drives the even-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven roadwheels, by applying the engine's torque to one clutch {{at the same time}} as it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.|$|E

2500|$|A key {{safety feature}} of the aircraft's main gear box (MGB) is an {{emergency}} oil spraying sub-system present in the lubrication system; this is designed to exceed the JAR 29 Standard's requirements of a 30-minute running time {{in the event of}} the loss of MGB oil pressure, and has demonstrated up to 50-minute running time. The engine also incorporates a [...] "blade shedding" [...] system to ensure engine integrity during an overspeed instance. Energy absorbent self-sealing fuel tanks are contained in the aircraft's sponsons, along with other equipment such as downward-facing illumination and navigation lighting fixtures. The transmission can accommodate more power than the maximum output of the engines; however two aircraft were lost in 2012 due to the cracking of the bevel <b>gear</b> <b>shaft,</b> a gearbox component. In response, the design of the transmission was modified in 2013, and the onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) was upgraded to provide real-time monitoring of the bevel <b>gear</b> <b>shaft</b> against the threat of crack formation.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate <b>gear</b> <b>shaft,</b> the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E
