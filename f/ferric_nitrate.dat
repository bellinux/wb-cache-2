40|$|Shewanella putrefaciens MR- 1 {{has emerged}} as a good model to study {{anaerobic}} respiration and electron transport-linked metal reduction. Its remarkable respiratory plasticity suggests the potential for a complex regulatory system to coordinate electron acceptor use in the absence of O 2. It had previously been suggested that EtrA (electron transport regulator A), an analog of Fnr (fumarate nitrate regulator) from Escherichia coli, may regulate gene expression for anaerobic electron transport. An etrA knockout strain (ETRA- 153) was isolated from MR- 1 using a gene replacement strategy. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total RNA demonstrated the loss of the etrA mRNA in ETRA- 153. ETRA- 153 cells retained the ability to grow on all electron acceptors tested, including fumarate, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), thiosulfate, dimethyl sulfoxide, <b>ferric</b> citrate, <b>nitrate,</b> and O 2, as well as the ability to reduce <b>ferric</b> citrate, manganese(IV), <b>nitrate,</b> and nitrite. EtrA is therefore not necessary for growth on, or the reduction of, these electron acceptors. However, ETRA- 153 had reduced initial growth rates on fumarate and nitrate but not on TMAO. The activities for fumarate and nitrate reductase were lower in ETRA- 153, as were the levels of fumarate reductase protein and transcript. ETRA- 153 was also deficient in one type of ubiquinone. These results are in contrast to those previously reported for the putative etrA mutant METR- 1.

5000|$|A {{wide range}} of chemicals, both {{household}} and commercial, can give a variety of patinas. They are often used by artists as surface embellishments either for color, texture, or both. Patination composition varies with the reacted elements and these will determine {{the color of the}} patina. For copper alloys, such as bronze, exposure to chlorides leads to green, while sulfur compounds (such as [...] "liver of sulfur") tend to brown. The basic palette for patinas on copper alloys includes chemicals like ammonium sulfide (blue-black), liver of sulfur (brown-black), cupric nitrate (blue-green) and <b>ferric</b> <b>nitrate</b> (yellow-brown). For artworks, patination is often deliberately accelerated by applying chemicals with heat. Colors range from matte sandstone yellow to deep blues, greens, whites, reds and various blacks. Some patina colors are achieved by the mixing of colors from the reaction with the metal surface with pigments added to the chemicals. Sometimes the surface is enhanced by waxing, oiling, or other types of lacquers or clear-coats.

They occur commonly in shallow depressions and level areas of subhumid and humid climate in association with other classes of soil on slopes and hills.

If flooding occurs when the soil temperature is above approximately 5 °C, microbial activity results in depletion of oxygen within a few days. Under such conditions, oxidized soil components (e.g., <b>nitrate,</b> <b>ferric</b> oxide) are reduced. Depletion of ferric oxide removes the brownish colour common to many soils, leaving them grey.

The theory views life, like other self-organizing systems in the Universe, as an inevitable outcome of particular disequilibria.

Anaerobic ni-trate-dependent ferrous iron oxidation was a biological process. One strain isolated from brackish-water sediment (strain HidR 2, a motile, nonsporeforming, gram-negative rod) was chosen for further investigation of ferrous iron oxidation {{in the presence of}} acetate as cosubstrate. Strain HidR 2 oxidized between 0. 7 and 4. 9 mM ferrous iron aer-obically and anaerobically at pH 7. 2 and 30 °C in the pres-ence of small amounts of acetate (between 0. 2 and 1. 1 mM). The strain gained energy for growth from anaerobic ferrous iron oxidation with nitrate, and the ratio of iron oxidized to acetate provided was constant at limiting ac-etate supply. The ability to oxidize ferrous iron anaerobi-cally with nitrate at approximately pH 7 appears to be a widespread capacity among mesophilic denitrifying bac-teria. Since nitrate-dependent iron oxidation closes the iron cycle within the anoxic zone of sediments and aero-bic iron oxidation enhances the reoxidation of ferrous to ferric iron in the oxic zone, both processes increase the importance of iron as a transient electron carrier in the turnover of organic matter in natural sediments.

In anaerobic paddy soil, the complete mineralization of organic matter to CH(4) and CO(2) is accomplished by the sequential reduction of <b>nitrate,</b> <b>ferric</b> iron, sulfate, and methanogenesis. In order to estimate the temporal changes of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP) as decomposers of organic matters, the effects of rice straw amendment on the dynamics of sulfate reduction and SRP were investigated by combining the monitoring of CH(4), sulfate, and organic acids with molecular tools such as soil DNA extraction, real-time PCR, cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. The incorporation of rice straw into paddy soil significantly increased concentrations of sulfate, formate, acetate, propionate, and lactate and CH(4) production. The rate of sulfate reduction in the straw-amended slurries {{was significantly higher than}} that in the unamended slurries. The dsrAB gene copy numbers of SRP in the straw-amended soil slurries ranged from 4. 26 x 10 (6) to 1. 96 x 10 (8) per gram of dry soil, which were significantly higher than those in the unamended control ranging from 1. 99 x 10 (6) to 7. 90 x 10 (7) per gram of dry soil.

Hydrogen and pyruvate served as alternate electron donors for strain SZ, and the range of electron acceptors included (reduced products are given in brackets) PCE and trichloroethene [cis-DCE], nitrate [ammonium], fumarate [succinate], Fe(III) [Fe(II) ], malate [succinate], Mn(IV) [Mn(II) ], U(VI) [U(IV) ], and elemental sulfur [sulfide]. PCE and soluble Fe(III) (as ferric citrate) were reduced at rates of 56. 5 and 164 nmol min− 1 mg of protein− 1, respectively, with acetate as the electron donor. Alternate electron acceptors, such as U(VI) and nitrate, did not inhibit PCE dechlorination and were consumed concomitantly. With PCE, Fe(III) (as <b>ferric</b> citrate), and <b>nitrate</b> as electron acceptors, H 2 was consumed to threshold concentrations of 0. 08 ± 0. 03 nM, 0. 16 ± 0. 07 nM, and 0. 5 ± 0. 06 nM, respectively, and acetate was consumed to 3. 0 ± 2. 1 nM, 1. 2 ± 0. 5 nM, and 3. 6 ± 0. 25 nM, respectively. Apparently, electron acceptor-specific acetate consumption threshold concentrations exist, suggesting that similar to the hydrogen threshold model, the measurement of acetate threshold concentrations offers an additional diagnostic tool to delineate terminal electron-accepting processes in anaerobic subsurface environments. Genetic and phenotypic analyses classify strain SZ as the type strain of the new species, Geobacter lovleyi sp. nov., with Geobacter (formerly Trichlorobacter) thiogenes as the closest relative. Furthermore, the analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences recovered from PCE-dechlorinating consortia and chloroethene-contaminated subsurface environments suggests that Geobacter lovleyi belongs to a distinct, dechlorinating clade within the metal-reducing Geobacter group. Substrate versatility, consumption of electron donors to low threshold concentrations, and simultaneous reduction of electron acceptors suggest that strain SZ-type organisms have desirable characteristics for bioremediation applications...|$|R

40|$|Electronics is an {{important}} industry in the UK, as there are many home-grown manufacturing companies {{in the areas of}} optics, electronics and micro-systems. As a consequence of the growth in this industry, there has been an increase in the discharges from manufacturing. A process that could reclaim the metals contained in these wastes is desirable because of the increasing costs of raw materials and environmental compliance. The aim of this project was to develop a systematic method to determine the feasibility of metal recovery from aqueous solutions. Waste tin stripping solution was chosen as a case study. This waste arises from a stage in the manufacture of printed circuit boards when a protective tin layer is stripped from the copper pattern. The solution is mainly nitric acid, but also contains suspension agents, ferric salts and inhibitors. After use it also contains suspended tin oxide and dissolved copper. It has been suggested that the tin and copper could be recovered from this waste by electrodeposition. Initially the thermodynamics of the system were studied, followed by experiments to verify the theoretical work. Pourbaix diagrams were constructed to determine when the metals would be in the solid or liquid phase depending on the concentration of metal and anion, pH and system potential. This information was then compared to separation processes to determine or confirm the recovery route. This study showed that the dissolved copper and suspended tin oxide could be separated by filtration if the pH was maintained between - 0. 4 and 2. 4. The dissolved copper could then be removed by electrodeposition. After the metal recovery route has been established, the individual stages are studied in more detail.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{biogeochemical}} {{controls on the}} release of phosphorus (P) from riparian wetland sediments to solution, and the subsequent delivery of P to receiving waters. The research was conducted at Strumpshaw Fen, a riparian wetland in the floodplain of the River Yare in the UK. Novel mesocosm work identifies the reductive-dissolution of iron-bound P as the dominant control on P release to solution. The timing of P release to pore water and surface water is also influenced by the concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in floodwater, because redox potential is poised above the level necessary for the reduction 0 f <b>ferric</b> iron whilst <b>nitrate</b> remains in solution. Field-based hydrochemical monitoring confirms the findings from laboratory mesocosm work on the controls on P release to solution, and indicates that P concentrations indicative of hyper eutrophic conditions may be established in the pore water and surface water of this riparian wetland. Sequential filtration establishes {{that the vast majority}} of the MRP fraction in 0. 45 J. 1 m filtrates may be composed of free orthophosphate. An investigation of hydrological connectivity between the shallow peat and (i) the underlying mineral aquifer and (ii) the adjacent open-water network is used to indicate whether P in solution might be exported from the peat in large quantities. Reliable characterisation of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of the peat deposits at Strumpshaw Fen is achieved after a thorough evaluation of the piezometer technique, and the application of a novel laboratory-based method. K is found to be relatively high, indicating a potential for substantial flows of water between the near-surface peat and the ditch network at the site, given suitable hydraulic gradients. Field-based hydrological monitoring suggests that lateral exchanges between the peat and adjacent open-water bodies are more important than vertical exchanges between the peat and the underlying mineral aquifer. It is shown that the combination of P availability and hydrological connectivity between the peat and open water, will result in bioavailable P reaching the ditch network at Strumpshaw. In the light of these findings, riparian fen wetlands should not be assumed a priori to be 'protectors' of the chemical and ecological quality of receiving waters, but may in fact be sources for significant quantities of P that have the potential to be exported from the fen system. ...|$|R
