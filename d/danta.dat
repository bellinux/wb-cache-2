25|$|The Ambaji Fair {{is held in}} the Hindu {{month of}} Bhadrapad (around August–September) at Ambaji, during a time which is {{particularly}} suitable for farmers, when the busy monsoon season is about to end. The Bhadrapad fair is held at Ambaji {{which is in the}} <b>Danta</b> Taluka of Banaskantha district, near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway. Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45km away), Palanpur (65km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, whilst some Muslims attend the fair for trade.|$|E
