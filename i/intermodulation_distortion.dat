25|$|A linear {{amplifier}} responds to different frequency components independently, {{and does not}} generate harmonic distortion or <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion.</b> No amplifier can provide perfect linearity (even the most {{linear amplifier}} has some nonlinearities, since the amplifying devices—transistors or vacuum tubes—follow nonlinear power laws such as square-laws and rely on circuitry techniques to reduce those effects).|$|E
25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound. One advantage of higher sampling rates {{is that they can}} relax the low-pass filter design requirements for ADCs and DACs, but with modern oversampling sigma-delta converters this advantage is less important.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to maintain some degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal's bandwidth. This {{can be accomplished by}} transmitting single-sideband with a normal or slightly reduced carrier. This mode is called compatible (or full-carrier) SSB or amplitude modulation equivalent (AME). In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with envelope detectors is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.|$|E

Unfortunately, at high frequencies and low output powers, accurate prediction of <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortions</b> fails {{with most of}} the available HEMT models due to nonlinearity extractions based on CW S-parameter measurements at DC bias points or low RF frequency measurements. In this paper, we propose a suitable HEMT model, extracted from pulsed I/V and pulsed S-parameter measurements over a wide frequency range, which allows accurate prediction of <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortions</b> at both high frequencies and large output power range...|$|R

40|$|Harmonic and <b>Intermodulation</b> <b>distortions</b> {{occur when}} a {{physical}} system is excited {{with a single}} or several frequencies and when {{the relationship between the}} input and output is non-linear. Working with non-linearities in the Frequency domain is not straightforward specially when the relationship between the input and output is not trivial. We outline the complete derivation of the Harmonic and <b>Intermodulation</b> <b>distortions</b> from basic principles to a general physical system. For illustration, the procedure is applied to the Single Mode laser diode where the relationship of input to output is non-trivial. The distortions terms are extracted directly from the Laser Diode rate equations and the method is tested by comparison to many results cited in the literature. This methodology is general enough to be applied to the extraction of distortion terms to any desired order in many physical systems in a general and systematic way. Comment: 11 pages, no figures.

25|$|Examples {{of typical}} {{measurements}} are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under {{one or more}} conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> vs. sound pressure level (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in decibels (dBspl).|$|E
500|$|The {{amplifier}} {{has what}} the manufacturer calls a [...] "dual-mode power supply", where the output stage is only loosely regulated, {{so it is}} free to supply the high voltages needed for musical transients and the large currents at lower voltages needed for driving low-impedance loads in the power amplifier circuitry. The design also incorporates a separate regulated power supply circuit, fed from a secondary winding on the transformer, dedicated to the pre-amplifier and tone control stages. It is thus claimed that <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> and blurring of the stereo image due to power supply functioning cannot occur.|$|E

40|$|The third-order <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortions</b> of an InGaAs/InP {{modified}} uni-traveling carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) {{are characterized}} using a two-tone setup. At 0. 3 GHz modulation frequency and photocurrents above 40 mA the third order local intercept point (IP 3) reaches 52 dBm and remains above 35 dBm {{up to the}} photodiode’s 3 dB bandwidth. A simple equivalent circuit model is used to explain the frequency characteristics of the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortions.</b> Based on experimental data, {{we find that the}} frequency characteristics of the IP 3 {{can be attributed to the}} change of both the responsivity and device capacitance induced by the photocurrent and the transient voltage drop at the load and series resistors.

2500|$|The inner ear, for example, does {{significant}} {{signal processing}} in converting sound waveforms into neural stimuli, so certain differences between waveforms may be imperceptible.

In addition, the ear has a nonlinear response to sounds of different intensity levels; this nonlinear response is called loudness. Telephone networks and audio noise reduction systems make use of this fact by nonlinearly compressing data samples before transmission, and then expanding them for playback.
