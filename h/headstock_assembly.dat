40|$|Abstract [...] In CNC machine tools, {{transient}} temperature {{variation in the}} <b>headstock</b> <b>assembly</b> and ball screw system are the major contributors for spindle thermal error. A high-speed ball screw system naturally generates more heat and results in greater thermal expansion, adversely affecting the accuracy of positioning. Consequently, the present study focuses {{on the development of}} new thermal error model, to reduce the thermal error in spindle lateral direction (X-Component of the spindle). The proposed novel approach is based on the development of a net thermal error model by the integration of individual error models developed for the <b>headstock</b> <b>assembly</b> and ball screw system. The individual models are developed using multi linear ridge regression technique. The contribution of each heat source on net thermal error is evaluated by the use of net thermal error and the mean thermal error. The developed net thermal erro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper mainly {{analyses}} {{the issues}} of the temperature distributions of the <b>headstock</b> <b>assembly</b> of a CNC lathe incorporating contact behavior. The thermal deformation is due to the heat generation in the bearings, chucking cylinder and motor. Experiments were carried out on a slant bed 2 axis CNC lathe for a period of 14 hours under a specified load cycle. Since heat generated in the machine tool cannot be measured, the temperatures at certain points on the machine structure are usually measured and correlated with thermal errors. A finite element model of the <b>headstock</b> <b>assembly</b> of a CNC lathe was developed without much structural simplification to obtain the designed accuracy of the simulation results. The effect of individual heat generation elements over the machine structure is studied and analyzed. The results show that the simulation results are satisfactory to replace the experimental results for further studies.
