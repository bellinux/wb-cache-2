30|$|The online {{questions}} {{collected a}} range of demographic and personal information. The 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (Goldberg and Williams 1988) provided an indication of current psychological distress. GHQ responses were scored using a binary system (0 - 0 - 1 - 1; maximum score = 12); a cut-off of three items was used for GHQ- 12 'caseness’ (Goldberg and Williams 1988). When scores on the GHQ exceeded this cut-off, the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) was used to probe for current depressive episodes (threshold score = 15; maximum score = 27) (Kroenke et al. 2001). Previous history of depression was also assessed. Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) (Eysenck et al. 1985) was included {{as a measure of}} neuroticism (maximum score = 15). The CAGE questionnaire (Mayfield et al. 1974) for alcohol <b>dependency</b> (<b>threshold</b> score = 2; maximum score = 4) and questions about gambling frequency and online gambling were included. Simple questions about current and past health problems and use of medications were also included.|$|E
30|$|While our {{simulation}} results can provide {{some insight into}} how isolation and other mechanisms can affect robustness in interdependent networks, there are substantial limitations to their applicability and generality. So far, we have limited our analysis {{to a pair of}} coupled networks, but real-world problems can display a dizzying number of interconnected systems. In such cases, the viability of a component will not just depend on being connected to only one other network, but to many more. With the increase of the dimensionality of dependency thresholds, the robustness of the whole system might become drastically lower. If the effects of high-dimensional dependency thresholds over the robustness of such systems are so far not explored, the implications of a one-dimensional <b>dependency</b> <b>threshold</b> as shown in this paper are already far reaching. Moreover, our models are biased in that choosing the nodes coupled between networks randomly does not necessarily reflect the attachment preferences encountered in real world cases. Other selection strategies such as correlation based on nodes with the highest degree, or the highest betweenness centrality, or even spatially embedded networks (Beyeler et al. 2007; Gao et al. 2014; LaViolette et al. 2006; Newman 2003) would result in different biases. Similarly, one could argue that random attacks are just one way to destroy the networks, and that other attack strategies based on different measures of centrality or system load as in (Su et al. 2014) might give a different view of the problem. The proposed introduction of permutable nodes that would give interconnected systems rewiring capabilities, and guarantee a higher symbiotic viability seems sound from a topological point of view, but would require some feasibility study {{from the point of view}} of functional robustness and cost implications to make it applicable to real-life networks such as the industrial complex when day to day operations depend on the simultaneous availability of multiple technologies, ecosystems where the mutually dependent species cannot exist in isolation, or mutually dependent transport networks.|$|E

We investigated {{the influence of}} pulmonary vascular "priming" with endotoxin on the responsiveness of the lung to a low-dose HlyA challenge. Rabbit lungs were perfused with Krebs Henseleit buffer containing 0. 1 - 100 ng/ml Salmonella abortus equii lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 60 - 180 min. This treatment caused protracted release of tumor necrosis factor into the recirculating medium, but did not induce significant alterations of pulmonary hemodynamics and fluid balance. At a dose of 1 ng/ml, HlyA elicited only moderate thromboxane release (< 200 pg/ml) and pulmonary artery pressure increase (< or = 6 mmHg) in control lungs. Acceleration and potentiation of both the metabolic and vasoconstrictor response occurred in lungs primed with LPS. This priming effect displayed dose (threshold integral of 0. 1 - 1 ng/ml LPS) and time <b>dependencies</b> (<b>threshold</b> integral of 60 - 90 min LPS incubation). Maximum thromboxane release and pulmonary artery pressure increase surpassed the responses to HlyA in nonprimed lungs by more than 15 -fold. Cyclooxygenase inhibition and thromboxane-receptor antagonism blocked these effects. These data demonstrate that LPS priming synergizes with HlyA challenge to provoke vascular abnormalities that are possibly relevant to the pathogenesis of organ failure in severe local and systemic infections...|$|R

To study the function of CAPS (Ca 2 +-dependent activator protein for secretion), a protein required for Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis of dense-core vesicles, secretory responses in single rat melanotrophs were monitored by patch-clamp membrane capacitance measurements. Flash photolysis of caged Ca 2 + elicited biphasic capacitance increases consisting of rapid and slow components with distinct Ca 2 + <b>dependencies.</b> A <b>threshold</b> of ≈ 10 μM Ca 2 + was required to trigger the slow component, while the rapid capacitance increase was recorded already at a intracellular Ca 2 + activity < 10 μM. Both kinetic membrane capacitance components were abolished by botulinum neurotoxin B or E treatment, suggesting involvement of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) -dependent vesicle fusion. The rapid but not the slow component was inhibited by CAPS antibody. These results were further clarified by immunocytochemical studies that revealed that CAPS was present on only a subset of dense-core vesicles. Overall, {{the results indicate that}} dense-core vesicle exocytosis in melanotrophs occurs by two parallel pathways.

40|$|Reversibility {{of state}} {{transitions}} is intensively studied topic in many scientific disciplines over many years. In cell biology, it {{plays an important}} role in epigenetic variation of phenotypes, known as phenotypic plasticity. More interestingly, the cell state reversibility is probably crucial in the adaptation of population phenotypic heterogeneity to environmental fluctuations by evolving bet-hedging strategy, which might confer to cancer cells resistance to therapy. In this article, we propose a formalization of the evolution of highly reversible states in the environments of periodic variability. Two interrelated models of heterogeneous cell populations are proposed and their behavior is studied. The first model captures selection dynamics of the cell clones for the respective levels of phenotypic reversibility. The second model focuses on the interplay between reversibility and drug resistance in the particular case of cancer. Overall, our results show that the <b>threshold</b> <b>dependencies</b> are emergent features of the investigated model with eventual therapeutic relevance.

40|$|Parametric {{inference}} for spatial max-stable processes {{is difficult}} since the related likelihoods are unavailable. A composite likelihood approach {{based on the}} bivariate distribution of block maxima has been recently proposed in the literature. However modeling block maxima is a wasteful approach provided that other information is available. Moreover an approach based on block, typically annual, maxima is unable {{to take into account}} the fact that maxima occur or not simultaneously. If time series of, say, daily data are available, then estimation procedures based on exceedances of a high threshold could mitigate such problems. In this paper we focus on two approaches for composing likelihoods based on pairs of exceedances. The first one comes from the tail approximation for bivariate distribution proposed by Ledford and Tawn (1996) when both pairs of observations exceed the fixed threshold. The second one uses the bivariate extension (Rootzen and Tajvidi, 2006) of the generalized Pareto distribution which allows to model exceedances when at least one of the components is over the threshold. The two approaches are compared through a simulation study according to different degrees of spatial dependency.

The measure has never been specifically validated for use within this population, despite questions raised about the scale's validity. This study seeks to analyse {{the construct validity of}} the HADS in MND by fitting its data to the Rasch model. Methods The scale was administered to 298 patients with MND. Scale assessment included model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), unidimensionality, local <b>dependency</b> and category <b>threshold</b> analysis. Results Rasch analyses were carried out on the HADS total score as well as depression and anxiety subscales (HADS-T, D and A respectively). After removing one item from both of the seven item scales, it was possible to produce modified HADS-A and HADS-D scales which fit the Rasch model. An 11 -item higher-order HADS-T total scale was found to fit the Rasch model following the removal of one further item. Conclusion Our results suggest that a modified HADS-A and HADS-D are unidimensional, free of DIF and have good fit to the Rasch model in this population. As such they are suitable for use in MND clinics or research. The use of the modified HADS-T as a higher-order measure of psychological distress was supported by our data.

Octave band and broadband pink noise stimuli were presented to subjects as phantom images from vertically arranged stereophonic loudspeakers located {{directly in front of}} the listening position. With respect to the listening position the lower loudspeaker was not elevated; the upper loudspeaker was elevated by 30 ◦. Subjects completed a method of adjustment task in which they were required to reduce the amplitude of the upper loudspeaker until the resultant phantom image matched the position of the same stimulus presented from the lower loudspeaker alone. The upper loudspeaker was delayedwith respect to the lower by 0, 0. 5, 1, 5, and 10 ms. The experimental data demonstrated that the main effect of frequency on the localization threshold was significant, with the low frequency stimuli (125 and 250 Hz) requiring significantly less level reduction (less than 6 dB) than the mid-high (1, 2, and 8 kHz) frequency stimuli (9 – 10. 5 dB reduction). The main effect of interchannel time difference (ICTD) on the localization thresholds for each octave band was found to be non-significant.
