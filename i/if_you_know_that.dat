According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|Emile Rafael {{directed}} the official music video for [...] "Trouble", with cinematography by Charlie Herranz. During {{an interview with}} Elle, Kills talked on the concept she went with for the visual. Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them and she felt better with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears off you want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E
500|$|Forces {{act in a}} {{particular}} direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as [...] "vector quantities". This means that forces follow {{a different set of}} mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Cruyff {{announced}} his irreversible decision {{to retire from}} international football {{at the age of}} 30, despite still lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup. A move which was shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff lifted the lid on his decision in an interview with Catalunya Radio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona. And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory {{at the end of his}} international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with Catalunya Radio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, “You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> someone [...] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change your point of view towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.” ...|$|E
