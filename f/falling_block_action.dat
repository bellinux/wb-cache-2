25|$|The Kragâ€“Petersson repeating rifle has a <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action,</b> i.e. the {{breechblock}} moves downwards as {{the mechanism}} is opened, actuated (operated) by {{the operation of}} the exterior hammer. The tubular magazine, containing a total of 10 rounds of ammunition, was placed under the barrel. Once the mechanism was open, an extractor ejected the spent cartridge. A fresh round of ammunition was pushed into a shaped recess on top of the falling block by the spring in the magazine, whereupon the falling block rose slightly. The round could then be pushed into the chamber by the shooter, and the breechblock would rise completely. This rising of the breechblock (by means of a powerful spring) could catch the shooter off guard, resulting in pinched skin on the thumb.|$|E

The <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> lent itself to conversion to the new metallic cartridges developed in the late 1860s, and many of these converted carbines in [...]50-70 Government were used during the Indian Wars in the decades immediately following the Civil War.|$|E

50|$|Quarth is a {{combination}} of Tetris-style gameplay and a fixed shooter in the Space Invaders tradition. The player's focus is on <b>falling</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the <b>action</b> is geometrical.Rather than arranging the blocks together to make a row of disappearing blocks, a spaceship positioned {{at the bottom of the}} screen shoots blocks upwards to make the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> pattern into squares or rectangles. Once the blocks have been arranged properly, the shape is destroyed and the player is awarded points based on the shape's size. The blocks continue to drop from the top of the screen in various incomplete shapes. As each level progresses, the blocks drop at greater speed and frequency. There are also various power-ups which could be located to increase your ship's speed, among other bonuses.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]38 rimfire {{cartridge}} {{was available in}} short, long, extra long, and also shotshells. Most of the revolvers and rifle which were produced were chambered for either [...]38 short, or [...]38 long. While {{there were a few}} different rifles produced for the [...]38 extra long cartridge and a few rolling <b>block,</b> <b>falling</b> <b>block,</b> and bolt <b>action</b> rifles had smooth bore barrels which had a slight choke which enabled it to shoot the [...]38 RF shotshells, which was good for hunting small game at close ranges. Hopkins & Allen produced revolvers and rifles chambered for the [...]38RF. Rifles of this caliber were produced by Remington (the revolving rifle of 1866), Ballard, Stevens and Frank Wesson, and revolvers by Enterprise, Favorite, Forehand & Wadsworth, and Colt.|$|R
50|$|The break open {{action is}} one of the most compact {{firearms}} actions. Since there are no parts to reciprocate, it is shorter than repeating designs, and generally more compact than non-repeating firearms such as the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> and rolling <b>block</b> <b>actions.</b> This compactness results in reductions in weight and size compared to larger actions; this can also allow a longer barrel in a firearm of similar size.|$|R

5000|$|In 1966, Sturm, Ruger {{introduced}} {{their first}} true rifle, Ruger No. 1, {{which uses a}} falling-block action and is available in {{a wide selection of}} calibers from [...]22 Hornet to [...]458 Winchester Magnum. The No. 1 has always been sought after by shooters who appreciate the compact size of a single-shot rifle, and the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> cuts about four inches off the length of the rifle for a given barrel length. From 1972 to 1987, Ruger also made a less expensive version of the #1, the #3. The #3, which sold for about half the price of a #1, used a simplified, non-locking lever for the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action,</b> and came with an uncheckered stock.|$|E
50|$|A falling-block action (also {{known as}} a sliding-block action) is a single-shot firearm action in which a solid metal {{breechblock}} slides vertically in grooves cut into the breech of the weapon and actuated by a lever. Examples of firearms using the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> are the Sharps rifle and Ruger No. 1.|$|E
5000|$|Dropping <b>block</b> are <b>actions</b> {{wherein the}} {{breechblock}} lowers or [...] "drops" [...] {{into the receiver}} to open the breech, usually actuated by an underlever. There are two principal types of dropping block: the tilting <b>block</b> and the <b>falling</b> <b>block.</b>|$|R

50|$|In a <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> {{the block}} does not pivot, but rather slides {{vertically}} in a slot milled into the receiver. Falling blocks {{are among the}} strongest small-arm actions ever produced, and are also used in heavy artillery. Well-known falling block designs include the Sharps rifles and carbines, the Browning/Winchester Single Shot, the Farquharson rifle, and the modern Ruger No. 1.|$|E

5000|$|The Ruger No. 1 is a single-shot rifle, with Farquharson-style {{internal}} hammer <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action,</b> {{manufactured by}} Sturm, Ruger. It {{was introduced in}} 1967.

Lenard Brownell, commenting on his work at Ruger, said of the No. 1: [...] "There was never any question about {{the strength of the}} action.

5000|$|Winchester {{produced}} nearly 140,000 Single Shot rifles from 1885 to 1920, and it {{was found}} that the falling-block Model 1885 had been built with one of the strongest actions known at that time. The <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> was so strong that the Winchester Company used it to test fire newly created rifle cartridges. To satisfy the needs of the shooting and hunting public, the Model 1885 Single Shot was eventually produced in more calibers than any other Winchester rifle. Winchester also produced a large number of Single Shots in [...]22 caliber for the US Army as a marksmanship training rifle, the [...] "Winder musket." ...|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1880, {{the company}} began making <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> rifles. These, though less well known than Ballard or Winchester firearms, were of {{comparable}} quality.

40|$|The {{roof line}} of the North Tower of the World Trade Center is shown {{to have been in}} {{constant}} downward acceleration until it disappeared. A downward acceleration of the <b>falling</b> upper <b>block</b> implies a downward net force, which requires that the upward resistive force was less than the weight of the block. Therefore the downward force exerted by the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> must also have been less than its weight. Since the lower section of the building was designed to support several times the weight of the upper block, the reduced force exerted by the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> was insufficient to crush the lower section of the building. Therefore the <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> could not have acted as a "pile driver. " The downward acceleration of the upper block can be understood as a consequence of, not the cause of, the disintegration of the lower section of the building.

50|$|Browning was {{a member}} of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served a two-year mission in Georgia {{beginning}} on March 28, 1887. His father Jonathan Browning, who was among the thousands of Mormon pioneers in the mass exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois to Utah, established a gunsmith shop in Ogden in 1852. John Moses worked in his father's Ogden shop from the age of seven, where he was taught basic engineering and manufacturing principles, and encouraged to experiment with new concepts. He developed his first rifle, a single-shot <b>falling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> design, then founded his own manufacturing operation, in partnership with his younger brother Matthew Sandifer Browning, and began to produce this firearm.|$|E
