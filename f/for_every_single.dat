The commissioners had city legal counsel study whether they could condemn the land and accept it as a donation (as Congress had appropriated no money for the city to pay for the property). The city's chief attorney, Albert G. Riddle, reported that federal law barred the city from condemning the property.

500|$|Vikram did {{not sign}} up to a film for sixty {{five days after the}} release of Sethu, to ensure that he made the right career move. Vikram spent time {{completing}} projects he had agreed to feature in before the release of Sethu and hence made a couple of appearances in the Malayalam films, Red Indians and the horror film Indriyam. He also played a leading role in Siragugal, a rare Tamil telefilm produced and featuring Radhika Sarathkumar, which was shot entirely in the suburbs of London. Furthermore, he also completed two Telugu films during the period; 9 Nelalu and Youth. 9 Nelalu featured Vikram as the husband of the character played by Soundarya, who faces the challenges of being a surrogate mother. The film won positive reviews, with a critic mentioning that Vikram gave a [...] "controlled performance; while Vikram's newfound popularity in Tamil films saw the film dubbed into Tamil soon after as Kandane Seethayai, with an inserted comedy track by comedian Vivek. His next release was Rajakumaran's Vinnukum Mannukum, alongside Sarath Kumar, Kushboo and Devayani, which revolved around an ordinary boy falling in love with an actress. Vikram has since mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film, claiming that he had arguments with the director <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> shot and that [...] "everything in that film, right from the first shot was wrong"; the film became a failure commercially. His next film was Dhill where he played an aspiring police officer, Kanagavel, who tackles a corrupt policeman. To appear trim {{in the role of the}} aspiring police officer, Vikram went on a strict diet eating only fruits and drinking juice. The film opened to positive reviews with a critic from The Hindu claiming that [...] "Vikram has the ability and potential" [...] and that [...] "Vikram has once again proved that his success in Sethu was not a fluke". Dhill subsequently went on to become Vikram's first success in the masala film genre and led the way for more such films in the same genre for him. Vikram's portrayal of a blind folk singer in Vinayan's Kasi won him the Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award and the film also did well commercially. For the movie, he sunbathed on the terrace of his beachside home in Chennai for a sunburnt look and got dizzying headaches while practising to look blind. Again, Vikram's performance won positive reviews from critics with a reviewer describing it as an [...] "extraordinarily detailed performance" [...] and that [...] "as the blind singer, he brings laughter, tears and a lump in one's throat".|$|E
