5|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> highly soluble in many {{rare earth}} and {{transition}} metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when <b>hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E

Most <b>hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{contains a}} range of interesting compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> in relatively short supply in the Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's <b>hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> theorised to have been lost to space, with the remainder being mostly bound up in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> proven by a very high D–H ratio measured in the Venusian atmosphere. The ratio is about 0.015–0.025, which is 100–150 {{times higher than the}} terrestrial value of 1.6.

40|$|Since Yakushima Island {{is rich in}} rainfall, {{hydroelectric}} power produced on the island is sufficient {{to cover all the}} energy demands on this island. A <b>hydrogen</b> fueling station <b>was</b> constructed on this island and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>was</b> produced by water electrolysis. The <b>hydrogen</b> production rate <b>is</b> 1. 25 Nm 3 /h. The produced <b>hydrogen</b> <b>was</b> used for the driving tests of fuel cell vehicles, while the public acceptance of <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>was</b> studied. This station is comprised of several systems, including hydrogen generation, hydrogen purification, compression and storage. During the operation of the station, the electricity consumption by each component and the production rate of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>were</b> measured.

5|$|Lanthanum reacts exothermically with {{hydrogen}} {{to produce}} the dihydride LaH2, a black, pyrophoric, brittle, conducting compound with the calcium fluoride structure.

5|$|Throughout the universe, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> mostly {{found in}} the atomic and plasma states, with {{properties}} quite {{different from those of}} molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> {{found in the}} neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift z=4.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Spherical {{sponge iron}} (SSI) with high {{activity}} and intension could be prepared through direct reduction by charcoal or hydrogen.

Moreover, cadmium removal percentage by SSI reduced with <b>hydrogen</b> <b>was</b> much higher than that reduced by charcoal. When the original concentration of cadmium was 50 mg/L, cadmium removal by SSI {{appeared to be the}} pseudo-first-order reaction because the reaction order was from 0. 861 to 0. 984. The apparent reaction rate constant of cadmium removal by SSI reduced with charcoal was 0. 586 h- 1. While <b>hydrogen</b> <b>was</b> utilized as reduction agent, the apparent reaction rate constant of cadmium removal was increased by 7. 3 and 13. 7 times...|$|R
5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E

The meager {{magnetic field}} is buried within Jupiter's much larger magnetic field and would show {{only as a}} local perturbation of the field lines. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone). Atomic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> a minor atmospheric constituent.

5|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>is</b> not {{an energy}} resource, {{except in the}} {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E
40|$|The {{permeation}} {{behavior of}} hydrogen through pure aluminum {{has been investigated}} in the temperature range of 625 K to 778 K by a gas permeation technique.
