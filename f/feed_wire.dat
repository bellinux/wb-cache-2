50|$|When {{a common}} tower {{is used for}} both AM and FM {{transmission}}, the folded-unipole is often a good choice. Since {{the base of the}} tower connects to the ground system, the transmission lines to any antennas mounted thereon run {{up the side of the}} tower with no isolation necessary. Another broadcast antenna that had a grounded base is the shunt-fed (or slant-wire) antenna. This antenna comprises a grounded tower with a feed-line wire attached at a point of approximate transmission-line match. A series capacitor tunes out the inductive reactance of this feed-line (this feed is also called a gamma match when the <b>feed</b> <b>wire</b> is parallel to the radiating element). When the folded-unipole antenna replaced the slant-wire fed antenna, a marked improvement of performance often occurred.

The surface damage occurs in the form of frozen-in dislocations, phase changes, and microcracks.

This technique uses sequential measurement of the minority carrier lifetime after etching thin layers from the surfaces. The lateral spatial damage variations, which seem to be mainly related to wire reciprocation process, were observed by photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime mapping.

As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min.
