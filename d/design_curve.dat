40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns the}} accuracy with which three different estimation schemes predict the variation of applied I with applied strain for semi-elliptical surface cracks. The three estimation schemes considered were a weight function technique proposed by Bhandari, {{a modification of}} the EPRI estimation scheme proposed by Ainsworth, and Turner's Engineering- I <b>design</b> <b>curve.</b> Each of these techniques is simple enough to employ in design, the most arduous calculation required being that needed to determine the linear elastic stress intensity factor. Accuracy of the estimation schemes was assessed by comparing I predictions to finite element results for three small semi-elliptical surface cracks in a moderately hardening steel loaded in either pure tension or pure bending. The results obtained indicate that, for applied strains up to three times the yield strain, both the weight function and the modified EPRI schemes under estimate applied I by between 23 % and 83 % depending on the applied strain level. Conversely, Turner's Engineering-I <b>design</b> <b>curve</b> provides accurate or conservative (i. e. over) estimates of applied J in both tension and bending provided total crack size is less than 3 % of the total cross sectional area and maximum crack depth is less than 25 % of the plate thickness. Application to larger and deeper cracks loaded in tension is not recommended as the <b>design</b> <b>curve</b> does not conservatively account for net section yielding in these situations. The <b>design</b> <b>curve</b> can still be applied in bending to cracks of size up to 7 % of the total cross sectional area. However, the degree of conservatism inherent in this application may be considered excessive in certain situations.

40|$|Abstract:- For {{the purpose}} of evaluation, a NURBS curve is used, because it is {{commonly}} used in the areas of CAD/CAM and Computer Graphics. A curve with a monotone radius of curvature distribution is considered as a fair curve in the area of Computer Aided Aesthetic Design (CAAD). But no official standards have been established. Therefore, a criterion for a fair curve is proposed. A quintic NURBS curve, the first derivative of a quintic NURBS curve, curvature vector, curvature, and radius of curvature are expressed. The concept of radius of curvature specification to modify the shape of a NURBS curve is illustrated. The difference between the NURBS curve radius of curvature and the specified radius of curvature is minimized by introducing the least-squares method to modify the shape of the NURBS curve. As curve fairness evaluation, radius of curvature distribution is used as an alternative characteristic of a curve. Algebraic functions such as linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, and six degrees are applied to the radius of curvature distribution of the <b>designed</b> <b>curve</b> to specify the radius of curvature. Then, the shape of the curve is modified according to the specified radius of curvature distribution. In this manner, six NURBS curves whose radius of curvature are these algebraic functions are generated, and are predefined. Using the correlation matching, the similarity is evaluated by comparing the radius of curvature distribution of the <b>designed</b> <b>curve</b> with those of six NURBS curves predefined.
