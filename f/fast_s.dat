40|$|Chromatin-modifying enzymes play a {{fundamental}} role in regulating chromatin structure so that DNA replication is spatially and temporally coordinated. For example, the lysine demethylase 4 A/Jumonji domain-containing 2 A (KDM 4 A/JMJD 2 A) is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. Overexpression of JMJD 2 A leads to altered replication timing and <b>faster</b> <b>S</b> phase progression. In this study, we demonstrate that degradation of JMJD 2 A is {{regulated by the}} proteasome. JMJD 2 A turnover is coordinated through the SKP 1 -Cul 1 -F-box ubiquitin ligase complex that contains cullin 1 and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 4 (FbxL 4). This complex interacted with JMJD 2 A. Ubiquitin overexpression restored turnover and blocked the JMJD 2 A-dependent <b>faster</b> <b>S</b> phase progression in a cullin 1 -dependent manner. Furthermore, increased ubiquitin levels decreased JMJD 2 A occupancy and BrdU incorporation at target sites.

CNQX, an AMPA/kainate antagonist, reduced all 3 {{components of the}} dorsal horn field potential whereas MK 801, an NMDA ion channel antagonist, reduced the <b>fast</b> <b>S</b> 2 component and the slow wave.

NMDA antagonists, D-AP 5, 7 -chlorokynurenic acid and arcaine, and the metabotropic glutamate antagonists L-AP 3 and ethylglutamic acid, while having {{little effect on the}} fast components of the field potential, all reduced the slow component.

40|$|International audienceShear-wave {{splitting}} {{studies on}} seismo-grams from local earthquakes {{at the site}} of the Mornos delta (Gulf of Corinth, Greece) has revealed a clear seismic anisotropy, with a <b>fast</b> <b>S</b> polarization striking N 55 + 25 ø. Magneto-telluric soundings in the frequency range 0. 01 to 100 Hz on the delta showed a clear electric anisotropy, with a N 55 ø + 10 ø direction for the highest frequency. This anisotropy spans through the whole layer of sediments, about 1 km thick. Comparison of the 1966 - 1972 triangulations and the 1991 - 1995 GPS positions of geodetic points in and around the delta showed rapid extension strain (2 x 10 -S/year) in the direction N 340 ø + 30 ø, perpendicular to the <b>fast</b> <b>S</b> and the highest conductivity directions, suggestive of a causal relationship between these observations. We thus propose that this strain controls the two reported anisotropies, by the formation and maintaining of fluid filled, steeply dipping antithetic faults and fractures, and fluid filled vertical cracks, all striking N 55 ø 4 - 20 ø. The source of strain is likely to be active normal faulting near and under the delta, as independently evidenced by the recent discovery of nearby offshore faults, striking about N 60 ø, significantly different from the dominant E-W strike of the major faults of the Gulf...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} arrhythmia {{in the healing}} phase after infarction {{has been linked to}} remodeling in the epicardial border zone (EBZ). Ionic models of normal zone (NZ) and EBZ myocytes were incorporated into one-dimensional models of propagation to gain mechanistic insights into how ion channel remodeling affects action potential (AP) duration (APD) and refractoriness, vulnerability to conduction block, and conduction safety postinfarction. We found that EBZ tissue exhibited abnormal APD restitution. The remodeled Na+ current (INa) and L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L) promoted increased effective refractory period and prolonged APD at a short diastolic interval. While postrepolarization refractoriness due to remodeled EBZ INa was the primary determinant of the vulnerable window for conduction block at the NZ-to-EBZ transition in response to premature S 2 stimuli, altered EBZ restitution also promoted APD dispersion and increased the vulnerable window at <b>fast</b> <b>S</b> 1 pacing rates. Abnormal EBZ APD restitution and refractoriness also led to abnormal periodic conduction block patterns for a range of <b>fast</b> <b>S</b> 1 pacing rates. In addition, we found that INa remodeling decreased conduction safety in the EBZ but that inward rectifier K+ current remodeling partially offset this decrease. EBZ conduction was characterized by a weakened AP upstroke and short intercellular delays, which prevented ICa,L and transient outward K+ current remodeling from playing a role in EBZ conduction in uncoupled tissue. Simulations of a skeletal muscle Na+ channel SkM 1 -INa injection into the EBZ suggested that this recently proposed antiarrhythmic therapy has several desirable effects, including normalization of EBZ effective refractory period and APD restitution, elimination of vulnerability to conduction block, and normalization of conduction in tissue with reduced intercellular coupling...|$|E

This system architecture has been developed with the intent of reducing the dynamic decision making so as to reduce the run time and also by minimising the number of context switching operations by providing more than one FPGA processors.
