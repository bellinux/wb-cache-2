5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{typically}} have quite small brains relative to body size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some fish <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to normal-length spines, {{members of the}} subfamily Opuntioideae <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> short spines, called glochids, that are barbed along their length and easily shed. These enter the skin and are difficult to remove, causing long-lasting irritation.|$|E
5|$|Massive main {{sequence}} stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000K. Smaller {{stars such as}} the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> low surface temperatures of about 3,600K; {{but they also have}} a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{serpentine}} outcrops where A.viridimontanum thrives <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> few endemics, {{compared to}} serpentine exposures globally. A.viridimontanum {{is one of}} only five taxa (four species and a variety) that are strictly endemic to serpentine in eastern North America, and two of these, A.aleuticum and Aspidotis densa, grow on non-serpentine substrates elsewhere in North America.|$|E

5|$|The {{hindbrain}} (or metencephalon) {{is particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest {{part of the}} brain. Hagfish and lampreys <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.|$|E
5|$|The supernovae of TypeII {{can also}} be sub-divided based on their spectra. While most TypeII supernovae show very broad {{emission}} lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second, some, such as SN 2005gl, <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> narrow features in their spectra. These are called TypeIIn, where the 'n' stands for 'narrow'.|$|E
5|$|Timema spp. {{differ from}} other Phasmatodea in that their tarsi have three {{segments}} rather than five. For stick insects, they <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> small, stout bodies, {{so that they}} look somewhat like earwigs (order Dermaptera).|$|E

5|$|Viperidae is {{a family}} of venomous snakes found all over the world, except for Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Madagascar, Hawaii and the Arctic Circle.

5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to <b>have</b> <b>{{relative}}ly</b> large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|About 19 {{isotopes}} and 8 {{nuclear isomers}} {{are known for}} americium. There are two long-lived alpha-emitters, 241Am and 243Am with half-lives of 432.2 and 7,370years, respectively, and the nuclear isomer 242m1Am has a long half-life of 141years. The half-lives of other isotopes and isomers range from 0.64microseconds for 245m1Am to 50.8hours for 240Am. As with most other actinides, the isotopes of americium with odd number of neutrons <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> high rate of nuclear fission and low critical mass.|$|E

5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was {{disappointed}} that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd {{was disappointed}} that Lightning and Caius Ballad <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|In 1962–1966, {{there were}} {{attempts}} in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using {{a series of}} six underground nuclear explosions. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with mass number greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> long half-lives of α-decay. This inobservation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels, such as neutron emission and nuclear fission.|$|E
5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects typically <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid dental development, {{particularly among the}} largest species. For example, indriids <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption. By contrast, anthropoid primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at weaning.|$|E
5|$|Long-lived {{isotopes}} of nobelium and isotopes of lawrencium (and of heavier elements) <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> short half-lives. For nobelium 11 isotopes {{are known}} with mass numbers 250–260 and 262. The chemical properties of nobelium and lawrencium were studied with 255No (t1/2 = 3 min) and 256Lr (t1/2 = 35 s). The longest-lived nobelium isotope 259No has a half-life of 1.5 hours.|$|E
5|$|Males <b>have</b> <b>relatively</b> small testes {{compared}} to other lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples.|$|E
