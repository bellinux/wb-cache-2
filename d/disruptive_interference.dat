New blood vessel formation is a relatively fragile process, subject to <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference</b> at several levels. In short, the therapy is the selection agent which {{is being used to}} kill a cell compartment. Tumor cells evolve resistance rapidly due to rapid generation time (days) and genomic instability (variation), whereas endothelial cells are a good target because of a long generation time (months) and genomic stability (low variation).|$|E
50|$|Light {{harvesting}} in photosynthesis employs both {{classical and}} quantum mechanical processes with an energy efficiency of almost 100 percent. For light to produce energy in classical processes, photons must reach reaction sites before their energy dissipates {{in less than}} one nanosecond. In photosynthetic processes, this is not possible. Because energy can exist in a superposition of states, it can travel all routes within a material at the same time. When a photon finds the correct destination, the superposition collapses, making the energy available. However, no purely quantum process can be wholly responsible, because some quantum processes slow down the movement of quantized objects through networks. Anderson localization prevents the spread of quantum states in random media. Because the state acts like a wave, it is vulnerable to <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference</b> effects. Another issue is the quantum zeno effect, in which an unstable state never changes if it is continuously measured/watched, because watching constantly nudges the state, preventing it from collapsing.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} of microarrays and deep sequencing techniques have unveiled an unexpected {{complexity of the}} eukaryotic transcriptome, demonstrating that virtualy the entire genome is transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Transcription occurring outside of annotated regions is generally referred to as pervasive transcription and leads {{to the production of}} several classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). In this review we will discuss the metabolism and functional significance of these ncRNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will discuss the mechanisms that the cell has adopted to prevent potentially <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference</b> between pervasive transcription and the expression of canonical genes. We will explore the possible reasons that justify the evolutionary conserved maintenance of extensive genomic transcription...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{is vulnerable to}} intentional electromagnetic interference, and therefore {{it is important to}} understand the interfering mechanisms. In this paper we investigate the effect of pulsed interference – as compared to continuous interference – on a receiver of digital amplitude modulated signals. To correctly receive the signals, a threshold estimate has to be computed for the proper detection of the symbols. The threshold estimate is based on average received power over an arbitrary length of time. We show that the effect of pulsed interference on the threshold estimate is severe, as compared to that for continuous interference. For this reason, pulsed interference can be more <b>disruptive</b> than continuous <b>interference</b> on a wireless link. This conclusion is confirmed by bit-error-rate measurements on a wireless receiver of amplitude-shift keying modulated signals...|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain is {{a complex}} {{disabling}} experience that negatively affects the cognitive, affective and physical functions as well as behavior. Although the interaction between chronic pain and physical functioning is a well-accepted paradigm in clinical research, the understanding of how pain affects individuals' daily life behavior remains a challenging task. Here we develop a methodological framework allowing to objectively document <b>disruptive</b> pain related <b>interferences</b> on real-life physical activity. The results reveal that meaningful information is contained in the temporal dynamics of activity patterns and an analytical model based on the theory of bivariate point processes {{can be used to}} describe physical activity behavior. The model parameters capture the dynamic interdependence between periods and events and determine a 'signature' of activity pattern. The study is likely to contribute to the clinical understanding of complex pain/disease-related behaviors and establish a unified mathematical framework to quantify the complex dynamics of various human activities...|$|R
40|$|A major {{conundrum}} {{in evolution}} is that, despite natural selection, polymorphism is still omnipresent in nature: Numerous species exhibit multiple morphs, namely several abundant values {{of an important}} trait. Polymorphism is particularly prevalent in asymmetric traits, which are beneficial to their carrier in <b>disruptive</b> competitive <b>interference</b> {{but at the same}} time bear disadvantages in other aspects, such as greater mortality or lower fecundity. Here we focus on asymmetric traits in which a better competitor disperses fewer offspring in the absence of competition. We report a general pattern in which polymorphic populations emerge when disruptive selection increases: The stronger the selection, the greater the number of morphs that evolve. This pattern is general and is insensitive to the form of the fitness function. The pattern is somewhat counterintuitive since directional selection is excepted to sharpen the trait distribution and thereby reduce its diversity (but note that similar patterns were suggested in studies that demonstrated increased biodiversity as local selection increases in ecological communities). We explain the underlying mechanism in which stronger selection drives the population towards more competitive values of the trait, which in turn reduces the population density, thereby enabling lesser competitors to stably persist with reduced need to directly compete. Thus, we believe that the pattern is more general and may apply to asymmetric traits more broadly. This robust pattern suggests a comparative, unified explanation to a variety of polymorphic traits in nature. ope...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{investigations}} of escape panic of confined pedestrians have revealed interesting dynamical {{features such as}} pedestrian arch formation around an exit, <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference,</b> self-organized queuing, and scale-free behavior. However, these predictions have remained unverified because escape panic experiments with real systems are difficult to perform. For mice escaping out of a water pool, we found that for a critical sampling rate the escape behavior exhibits the predicted features even at short observation times. The mice escaped via an exit in bursts of different sizes that obey exponential and (truncated) power-law distributions depending on exit width. Oversampling or undersampling the mouse escape rate prevents the observation of the predicted features. Real systems are normally subject to unavoidable constraints arising from occupancy rate, pedestrian exhaustion, and nonrigidity of pedestrian bodies. The effect of these constraints on the dynamics of real escape panic is also studied...|$|E

40|$|GNSS jammers {{are small}} {{portable}} devices able to broadcast <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference</b> and overpower the much weaker GNSS signals. In this paper, {{the effects of}} GNSS jammers on GPS and Galileo receivers are thoroughly analyzed {{and the use of}} an adaptive notch filter is suggested as an effective countermeasure to jamming. Signals generated by a commercial jammer are broadcast in a large anechoic chamber along with the GPS and Galileo signals generated by a hardware simulator. The analysis is conducted in terms of C/N 0 degradation and different jammer power levels are considered. The use of mitigation techniques, such as notch filtering, significantly improves the performance of GNSS receivers even in the presence of strong and fast-varying jamming signals. The presence of a pilot tone in the Galileo E 1 signal enables pure PLL tracking and makes the processing of Galileo signals more robust to jamming. JRC. G. 6 -Security technology assessmen...|$|E
40|$|Femtosecond optical laser pulses {{have been}} {{comprehensively}} {{applied in the}} past to control the material properties of high critical temperature superconductors. However, since the superconducting gap is of the order of several millielectronvolts, optical photons have the potential to deplete the condensate by breaking Cooper-pairs. This thesis takes a novel direction as it reports on the non-dissipative control of the Josephson plasma in the layered cuprate superconductor La 1 : 84 Sr 0 : 16 CuO 4 using terahertz electromagnetic waves. To achieve sufficiently intense sub-millimetre radiation, two complementary experimental approaches are taken. First, the table-top tilted pulse front technique is employed as a source of microjoule broadband terahertz pulses. Second, a large-scale free electron laser is operated to achieve multi-cycle pulses of less than two percent relative bandwidth. Using the tilted pulse front technique, out-of-plane superconducting transport in La 1 : 84 Sr 0 : 16 CuO 4 is gated bi-directionally on ultrafast timescales. The applied electric field modulates the interlayer coupling, leading to picosecond oscillations between superconducting and resistive states. Thereby, the modulation frequency is determined by the electric field strength in spirit of the a. c. Josephson effect. Throughout the oscillations, in-plane properties remain unperturbed, revealing an exotic state in which the dimensionality of the superconductivity is time-dependent. Using a free electron laser, it is shown that resonant terahertz excitation of nonlinear Josephson plasma waves in La 1 : 84 Sr 0 : 16 CuO 4 creates a metastable state that is transparent over a narrow spectral region. This finding is interpreted as the result of <b>disruptive</b> quantum <b>interference</b> between the linear plasma modes of the cuprate and an optically injected Josephson vortex lattice, which features the periodicity of the driving field, giving rise to three-level quantum interference optical transparency. Both observations demonstrate the potential of layered superconductors for quantum nonlinear optics and are of relevance for applications in ultrafast nanoelectronics. </p...|$|R
40|$|The corpus {{striatum}} {{serves a}} critical function in inhibiting involuntary, intrusive movements. Striatal degeneration in Huntington's disease {{results in a}} loss of motor inhibition, manifested by abnormal involuntary choreiform movements. Sensorimotor inhibition, or "gating", can be measured in humans using the startle reflex: the startle reflex is normally inhibited when the startling stimulus is preceded 30 - 500 ms earlier by a weak prepulse. In the present study, prepulse inhibition (PPI) was measured in patients with Huntington's disease to quantify and characterise sensorimotor gating. Compared with age matched controls, patients with Huntington's disease exhibit less PPI. Startle gating deficits are evident in patients with Huntington's disease when startle is elicited by either acoustic or tactile stimuli. Even with stimuli that elicit maximal PPI in normal subjects, patients with Huntington's disease exhibit little or no PPI, and their pattern of startle gating does not show the normal modulatory effects usually elicited by changing the prepulse interval or intensity. Startle amplitude and habituation and latency facilitation are largely intact in these patients, although reflex latency is significantly slowed. In patients with Huntington's disease, startle reflex slowing correlates with cognitive impairment measured by the dementia rating scale, and with the performance <b>disruptive</b> effects of <b>interference</b> measured by the Stroop test. These findings document a profound disruption of sensorimotor gating in patients with Huntington's disease and are consistent with preclinical findings that identify the striatum and striatopallidal GABAergic efferent circuitry as critical substrates for sensorimotor gating of the startle reflex...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} {{memories}} require time to consolidate {{has a long}} history, but the understanding of what consolidation means has evolved over time. In 1900, the German experimental psychologists Georg Müller and Alfons Pilzecker published a monograph in which a new theory of memory and forgetting was proposed, one that included – {{for the first time}} – a role for consolidation. Their basic method involved asking subjects to study a list of paired-associate nonsense syllables and then testing their memory using cued recall after a delay of several minutes. Typically, some of the list items were forgotten, and to investigate why that occurred, Müller and Pilzecker (1900) presented subjects with a second, interfering list of items to study before memory for the target list was tested. They found that this interpolated list reduced memory for the target list compared to a control group that was not exposed to any intervening activity. Critically, the position of the interfering list within the retention interval mattered such that interference occurring soon after learning had a more <b>disruptive</b> effect than <b>interference</b> occurring later in the retention interval. This led them to propose that memories require time to consolidate and that retroactive interference is a force that compromises the integrity of recently formed (and not-yet-consolidated) memories. In this chapter, we review the major theories of consolidation – beginning with the still-relevant account proposed by Müller and Pilzecker (1900) – and we consider a variety of recent developments in what has become a rapidly evolving field...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHumans {{and animals}} encode {{and store in}} memory elapsed {{intervals}} as evidenced through their temporal expectancies. However, {{there are very few}} experimental studies on long-term memory of duration. The aim of this original {{study was to examine the}} consolidation process for duration and its effect on time judgement. In our study, memory of duration was tested in humans with a temporal generalization task. Consolidation was assessed by means of a 15 -min nontemporal interference task introduced at different delays after the initial learning of a 4 -s standard duration. The results showed that (a) when tested 24 hours after the learning phase, memory of the 4 -s duration was disrupted (less precision and lengthening effect) if the interference task was introduced 30 - 45 min after learning; (b) no disruption was observed when memory was tested immediately after the interference task; and (c) there was a temporal gradient of the <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference</b> effect within the first hour after learning. Overall, these results fulfil the key criteria for the inference of a synaptic/cellular consolidation process and thus demonstrate that, as is the case for other memories, memory of duration undergoes a consolidation process that lasts at least one hour...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} kinetic {{competition}} between charge striped order and superconductivity in $La_{ 1. 675 }$Eu$_{ 0. 2 }$ Sr$_{ 0. 125 }$CuO$_ 4 $. Ultrafast optical excitation is tuned to a midinfrared vibrational resonance that destroys charge order and promptly establishes transient coherent interlayer coupling in this material. This effect {{is evidenced by}} the appearance of a longitudinal plasma mode reminiscent of a Josephson plasma resonance. We find that coherent interlayer coupling can be generated up to the charge-order transition T$_{CO}$ ≈ 80 K, far above the equilibrium superconducting transition temperature of any single layer cuprate. Two key observations are extracted from the relaxation kinetics of the interlayer coupling. First, the plasma mode relaxes through a collapse of its coherence length and not its density. Second, two distinct kinetic regimes are observed for this relaxation, above and below spin-order transition T$_{SO}$ ≈ 25 K. In particular, the temperature-independent relaxation rate observed below T$_{SO}$ is anomalous and suggests coexistence of superconductivity and stripes rather than competition. Both observations support arguments that a low temperature coherent stripe (or pair density wave) phase suppresses c-axis tunneling by <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference</b> rather than by depleting the condensate...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive Radio Networks allow {{unlicensed}} {{users to}} opportunistically access the licensed spectrum without causing <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference</b> {{to the primary}} users (PUs). One of the main challenges in CRNs {{is the ability to}} detect PU transmissions. Recent works have suggested the use of secondary user (SU) cooperation over individual sensing to improve sensing accuracy. In this paper, we consider a CRN consisting of a single PU and multiple SUs to study the problem of maximizing the total expected system throughput. We propose a Bayesian decision rule based algorithm to solve the problem optimally with a constant time complexity. To prioritize PU transmissions, we re-formulate the throughput maximization problem by adding a constraint on the PU throughput. The constrained optimization problem is shown to be NP-hard and solved via a greedy algorithm with pseudo-polynomial time complexity that achieves strictly greater than 1 / 2 of the optimal solution. We also investigate the case for which a constraint is put on the sensing time overhead, which limits the number of SUs that can participate in cooperative sensing. We reveal that the system throughput is monotonic over the number of SUs chosen for sensing. We illustrate the efficacy of the performance of our algorithms via a numerical investigation...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{exploring}} {{the role of}} neural oscillations in cognition have revealed sustained increases in alpha-band power (ABP) during the delay period of verbal and visual working memory (VWM) tasks. There have been various proposals regarding the functional significance of such increases, including the inhibition of task-irrelevant cortical areas {{as well as the}} active retention of information in VWM. The present study examines the role of delay-period ABP in mediating the effects of interference arising from on-going visual processing during a concurrent VWM task. Specifically, we reasoned that, if set-size dependent increases in ABP represent the gating out of on-going task-irrelevant visual inputs, they should be predictive with respect to some modulation in visual evoked potentials resulting from a task-irrelevant delay period probe stimulus. In order to investigate this possibility, we recorded the electroencephalogram while subjects performed a change detection task requiring the retention of two or four novel shapes. On a portion of trials, a novel, task-irrelevant bilateral checkerboard probe was presented mid-way through the delay. Analyses focused on examining correlations between set-size dependent increases in ABP and changes in the magnitude of the P 1, N 1 and P 3 a components of the probe-evoked response and how such increases might be related to behavior. Results revealed that increased delay-period ABP was associated with changes in the amplitude of the N 1 and P 3 a event-related potential (ERP) components, and with load-dependent changes in capacity when the probe was presented during the delay. We conclude that load-dependent increases in ABP likely play a role in supporting short-term retention by gating task-irrelevant sensory inputs and suppressing potential sources of <b>disruptive</b> <b>interference...</b>|$|E
