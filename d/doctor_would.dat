5|$|All serials in {{this season}} {{continue}} directly one after the other, tracing one single problematic voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is considered its own standalone story. This season also introduced the character of Harry Sullivan as a companion; this character was intended to undertake action scenes, during the period prior to Tom Baker being cast, when it was unclear how old the actor playing the new <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination {{was that of}} a physician in the nineteenth century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the <b>doctor</b> <b>would</b> swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E
5|$|An item of {{discussion}} between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise {{that he had}} accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter. The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the episode's commentary track, and Gardner vehemently believed the <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> reciprocate Rose's love.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doctors</b> <b>would</b> test by {{tasting the}} urine. A sweet taste meant {{the patient had}} diabetes.|$|R
50|$|He {{said that}} the <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> seek a {{judicial}} review of {{the decision not to}} pursue an inquest.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to numerous educational advances, Aristide and Lavalas {{embarked on an}} ambitious plan to develop the public primary health care system with Cuban assistance. Since the devastation unleashed by Hurricane Georges in 1998, Cuba entered a humanitarian agreement with Haiti whereby Haitian <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be trained in Cuba, and Cuban <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> work in rural areas. At the time of 2010 Haiti earthquake, 573 doctors had been trained in Cuba.|$|R
5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} fighting over a princess. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> become involved in his own timeline by arriving {{at the wrong time}} and becoming accused of being a poisoner. Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but nothing came of the submission.|$|E
5|$|Written by Basil Dawson, this four-part story {{involving}} {{murders in}} Victorian London. Dawson, a veteran screenwriter, {{was approached by}} script editor Robert Holmes to develop a story which would introduce a new companion to replace Sarah Jane Smith following her departure. The new character {{was to be a}} Cockney girl whom the <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> take under his wing and educate, in the manner of Eliza Doolittle in the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. This story was planned to be the fourth story of Season 14. The Gaslight Murders was quickly abandoned, however. Its spot in the schedule was ultimately filled by The Face of Evil, while Holmes reused the general framework in The Talons of Weng-Chiang.|$|E
5|$|Written by Robert Holmes, {{this story}} was planned as the 20th anniversary special. The 90-minute single-part story was {{commissioned}} on 2 August 1982 and would involve the various Doctors and companions drawn to the planet Maladoom where they are trapped by the Master who is working for the Cybermen. The Cybermen want to isolate the genetic material that permits Time Lords to time travel freely {{so that they can}} incorporate that information into their own biology. The First <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> be revealed as an android, hence the title being the Six Doctors. Holmes made little headway with the script and withdrew from the project on 13 October 1982. Holmes would later use part of the storyline in The Two Doctors.|$|E
30|$|When {{asked whether}} or not the junior <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> {{consider}} radiology as a career option, 22 % replied yes.|$|R
50|$|Surveys in 2008 {{suggested}} {{that two-thirds of}} <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> refuse {{to have their own}} medical records on the system.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the mid 20th century, upon {{graduation}} Australian doctors {{spent time}} in general practice. A medical career usually included completing an intern year immediately after graduation as a resident in a major teaching hospital. After {{a period of time}} in general practice, some <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> seek specialist qualifications. Possibly reflecting the historical origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, these <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> travel overseas, most often to the UK, to specialise and then return to establish practice.|$|R
5|$|Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{exclusively}} {{reported a}} new storyline for Hollyoaks as Mercedes and Joe Roscoe's (Ayden Callaghan) unborn baby would die before birth in scenes to air in early November 2015. It was revealed the show {{had been working}} with stillbirth charities, Count the Kicks and Sands to produce various ways mothers can monitor their unborn baby's progress. Rival soap opera, EastEnders, had produced a similar storyline when Shabnam Masood and Kush Kazemi (Rakhee Thakrar and Davood Ghadami) lost their son Zaair before he was born, but fans were reassured the storyline had been planned {{months prior to the}} announcement of EastEnders storyline. It was revealed Mercedes would first admit her fears to John Paul and they visited the hospital where a <b>doctor</b> <b>would</b> inform them that their son had died. Kilkelly teased that the storyline would see how Mercedes coped with the situation, how it affects Mercedes and Joe's relationship, as well as seeing the permanent return of Myra.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack {{is more of a}} conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> view as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team was tasked with finding a suitable actor {{for the role}} of the Doctor. Most notably, they approached film stars Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson for the role. By the time Mal Young had suggested actor Christopher Eccleston to Davies, Eccleston was one of only three left in the running for the role: the other two candidates are rumoured in the industry to have been Alan Davies and Bill Nighy. His involvement in the programme was announced on 20 March 2004 following months of speculation. In the April 2004 issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies announced that Eccleston's <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> indeed be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Richard E. Grant's Shalka Doctor to non-official status. Russell T Davies revealed that Eccleston asked for the role in an e-mail.|$|E
30|$|Enhanced {{attention}} to trauma mechanism by educating the initial treating <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> {{improve the quality}} of acute-phase treatment of fractures in the knee in children.|$|R
50|$|<b>Doctors</b> <b>would</b> test urine {{by using}} a visual examination. If the urine had blood in it the patient was {{suffering}} from tumors in the urinary tract.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, suppose I had pricked my foot!" [...] she wailed. [...] "Then the <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> {{have cut}} my foot off, and I'd be lamed for life!" ...|$|R
25|$|The Second <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> {{return to}} the series on three occasions: in 1973 for the 10th anniversary serial The Three Doctors (which also saw the return of William Hartnell as the First Doctor), in 1983 for the 20th anniversary special, The Five Doctors, and once more in 1985 in The Two Doctors.|$|E
25|$|Brigid Maturin is Stephen and Diana's daughter, born {{while he}} was away at sea. Before her father met her she was {{severely}} introverted, showing signs of what a modern <b>doctor</b> <b>would</b> diagnose as autism. After Diana's grief-driven departure, Padeen's gentle and nurturing manner helps her {{to connect with the}} world, and gain a full recovery.|$|E
25|$|After much {{speculation}} in {{the press}} about possible candidates, BBC announced that Christopher Eccleston would be the Ninth Doctor, accompanied by former pop singer Billie Piper as Rose. In the April 2004 issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies announced that Eccleston's <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> indeed be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Grant's Ninth Doctor to non-official status.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{proposed}} {{method is}} to enact laws that <b>would</b> hold <b>doctors</b> accountable for not reporting suspected organ trafficking. Scheper-Hughes {{has written extensively on}} the issue of doctors knowingly performing illegal operations with illicit organs. [...] She argues that though <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be violating doctor-patient privilege, their legal obligation to the patient is superseded by public interest in ending alleged medical violations of human rights. If accountability measures were imposed, <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be liable as accomplices if they knowingly performed operations with black market organs.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2007, the Solomon Star {{reported}} that Solomon Islands' high commissioner to the United Nations {{was soon to}} be sworn in as ambassador to Cuba. In September 2007, {{it was announced that}} 40 Cuban <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be sent to the Solomon Islands. The Solomons’ Minister of Foreign Affairs Patterson Oti said that Solomon Islander <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> [...] "learn from their Cuban colleagues in specialised areas". In addition to providing doctors, Cuba provided scholarships for 50 Solomon Islanders to study medicine in Cuba for free.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{administration}} of a remedy of my own, which I'll admit few <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> venture to use. It's almost {{as dangerous as}} the first course, and in case of success recovery is slower." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{character}} of Harry Sullivan {{was created by}} the production team when it was expected that the Fourth <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> be played by an older actor who would have trouble with the activity expressed by his predecessor. The role went to 40-year-old Tom Baker, and the part of Harry, no longer required for the action role, was reduced.|$|E
25|$|A {{man named}} Sabbath, an {{eighteenth-century}} secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised the blackened organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor {{of some of}} his higher Time Lord abilities (his respiratory bypass system and his ability to metabolise toxins). It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm (though any injury sustained by the <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> weaken Sabbath).|$|E
25|$|An {{edition of}} Beadle's Hotshots {{featured}} a sketch entitled Doctor What who travelled {{in space and}} time with his companion in his machine, called the BARDIS (Beverage And Refrigerator Dispenser In Space, which was a pub on the inside) and fighting his enemies the Headmaster (a take on The Master) and the Cyberbins (named after the Cybermen but basically Dalek Dustbins) before popping in to N.I.T. HQ and meeting the Brigadier. Frequently, the <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> regenerate but kept putting on false noses, silly wigs each time. After the sketch, Jeremy Beadle brought on Sylvester McCoy to meet the actors, commenting that he enjoyed the sketch, especially the girl's screaming.|$|E
50|$|Craterization {{is an old}} medical {{procedure}} in which <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> drill holes into people's heads to remove a foreign mass (i.e., a tumor). It gets {{its name from the}} crater-like holes it leaves behind.|$|R
50|$|On 1 August 2014 Meha {{suffered}} an injury during a friendly match against Maccabi Haifa {{and was forced}} undergo surgery, which according to <b>doctors,</b> <b>would</b> keep him from playing for 8 weeks until his recovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Verra true," [...] Mackellar agreed. [...] "For a' that, {{the chances}} against Dick's {{reaching}} twenty-one {{are greater than}} usual. It seems ye {{do not know that}} two <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> not pass him for the army." ...|$|R
25|$|To {{address the}} quality of surgeons, Moore {{organized}} an examination system to identify untrained doctors. If they failed, the <b>doctor</b> <b>would</b> serve as an attendant in a hospital for a time and retake the test. This system allowed semi-trained surgeons to be further educated, and unusable doctors to be dismissed from service. In 1864 Moore established the Confederate States Medical and Surgical Journal, a manual to instruct the surgeons throughout the army; it included both exact descriptions and drawings of operations. During the war Moore also founded the Association of Army and Navy Surgeons of the Confederate States of America. This organization {{is believed to be}} the oldest military medical society in the United States. He also added dentists to the hospitals, the first time in American history its soldiers and sailors had access to this service. By the end of the war in 1865, the Medical Department of the Confederacy had about three thousand men under Moore.|$|E
25|$|Hartnell's <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> {{initially}} {{be accompanied}} by his granddaughter Susan Foreman (played by Carole Ann Ford), originally to have been merely a travelling companion, but with a family tie added by Coburn, who was uncomfortable with the possible undertones the relationship could carry were they to be unrelated. They were joined in the first episode by two of Foreman's schoolteachers, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell), from contemporary 20th century England. This remained the line-up of the series for the entire first season, but over time the regular line-up would change regularly as the Doctor's various companions left him to return home, having found new causes on worlds they had visited and elected to stay there, or even occasionally being killed off. However, he would always quickly find new travelling companions. Such characters were used by the production team to relate {{the point of view}} of the viewers at home, asking questions and furthering the stories by getting into trouble.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} {{beforehand}} that Jon Pertwee {{would be leaving}} {{his role as the}} Third Doctor and that a new Fourth <b>Doctor</b> <b>would</b> need to be cast for the part. Tom Baker was an out-of-work actor who had been working in construction at the time. Baker had been a television and film actor, having major parts in several films including Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) and The Vault of Horror (1973). He had written to Bill Slater, the Head of Serials at the BBC, asking for work. Slater suggested Baker to Doctor Who producer Barry Letts who had been looking to fill the part. Letts had been the producer of the series since the early Pertwee serials in 1970. He had seen Baker's work in The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and hired him for the part. Baker would continue in his role as the Doctor for seven seasons, longer than any other actor to play the part.|$|E
50|$|Cybermedicine {{is the use}} of the Internet {{to deliver}} medical services, such as medical {{consultations}} and drug prescriptions. It is the successor to telemedicine, wherein <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> consult and treat patients remotely via telephone or fax.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2007, it was {{announced}} that 40 Cuban <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> be sent to Solomon Islands. Solomons’ Minister of Foreign Affairs Patterson Oti said that Solomon Islander <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> [...] "learn from their Cuban colleagues in specialized areas". He added that such relations had been [...] "on the drawing board between Solomon Islands and Cuba since 2000". In addition to providing doctors, Cuba provided scholarships for 50 Solomon Islanders to study medicine in Cuba for free. According to a spokesman for Solomon Islands' Ministry of Health, the Solomons are [...] "desperately in need" [...] of doctors, and hence grateful to Cuba for its [...] "much needed assistance".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, very sudden; {{he has had}} {{the same}} before," [...] said Herbert. [...] "But they do not at all affect his intellect or bodily powers. Depression is, I suppose, the name that the <b>doctors</b> <b>would</b> call it." ...|$|R
