50|$|Magnetorquers are lightweight, reliable, and energy-efficient. Unlike thrusters, they do {{not require}} <b>expendable</b> <b>propellant</b> either, so they could in theory work indefinitely as long as {{sufficient}} power is available to match the resistive load of the coils. In Earth orbit, sunlight is one such practically inexhaustible energy source, using solar panels.|$|E
5000|$|Kinetic {{energy and}} angular momentum: Spinning up (or down) parts {{or all of}} the habitat {{requires}} energy, while angular momentum must be conserved. This would require a propulsion system and <b>expendable</b> <b>propellant</b> or could be achieved without expending mass by an electric motor and a counterweight such as a reaction wheel or possibly another living area spinning in the opposite direction.|$|E
40|$|A heavy {{launch vehicle}} is discussed. The launch vehicle is {{comprised}} of an expendable, multi-container, propellant tank that has a plurality of winged booster propulsion modules {{at one end and}} a payload supported by adapter structure at the other end. The preferred payload is an entry module that can be adapted for docking to the space station and used as a return vehicle for the space station crew. Additionally, the payload may include communication satellites, supplies, equipment, and/or structural elements for the space station. The winged propulsion modules are released from the <b>expendable</b> <b>propellant</b> tank, in pairs, and they return to Earth in a controlled glide. After a safe landing, at or near the launch site, the modules are prepared for reuse. The rocket engines for each propulsion module are dual-fuel, dual-mode engines and use methane-oxygen and hydrogen-oxygen from the multi-containers of the propellant tank. When the propulsion modules are released from the <b>expendable</b> <b>propellant</b> tank, the rocket engines are moved into the module cargo bay for the return glide flight...|$|E
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), {{launched}} ITOS-D with {{an improved}} attitude control system. A Hall generator brushless dc torque motor replaced the brush dc torque motor on Tiros-M and ITOS-A. Two CO 2 attitude horizon sensors and one mirror replaced the four wideband horizon sensors and two mirrors on ITOS- 1 and NOAA- 1. Redundant pitch-control electronic boxes containing additional electronic circuitry for earth-splitting and brushless motor electronics were used. A method of generating a spacecraft earth-facing side reference for {{comparison to the}} time occurrence of the earth-splitting pulse was used to automatically correct pitch-attitude error. A single rotating flywheel, supported by a single bearing, provided gyroscopic stability and the required momentum interchange to keep {{one side of the}} satellite facing the earth. Magnetic torquing against the earth's magnetic field eliminated the requirement for <b>expendable</b> <b>propellants</b> which would limit satellite life in orbit...|$|R
40|$|The ITOS with an {{improved}} {{attitude control system}} is described. A Hall generator brushless dc torque motor will replace the brush dc torque motor on ITOS-I and ITOS-A (NOAA- 1). The four attitude horizon sensors will be replaced with two CO 2 sensors for better horizon definition. An earth horizon splitting technique {{will be used to}} keep the earth facing side of the satellite toward earth even if the desired circular orbit is not achieved. The external appearance of the pitch control subsystem differs from TIROS-M (ITOS- 1) and ITOS-A (NOAA- 1) in that two instead of one pitch control electronics (PCE) boxes are used. Two instead of four horizon sensors will be used and one instead of two mirrors will be used for sensor scanning. The brushless motor will eliminate the requirement for brushes, strain gages and the telemetry for the brush wear. A single rotating flywheel, supported by a single bearing provides the gyroscopic stability and the required momentum interchange to keep one side of the satellite facing the earth. Magnetic torquing against the earth's magnetic field eliminates the requirement for <b>expendable</b> <b>propellants</b> which would limit satellite life in orbit...|$|R
40|$|Solar sailing is a promising, future in-space {{propulsion}} {{method that}} uses the small force of reflecting sunlight to accelerate a large, reflective membrane without <b>expendable</b> <b>propellants.</b> One of two solar sail configurations under development by NASA is a striped net approach by L'Garde, Inc. This design uses four inflatably deployed, lightweight booms supporting a network of thin strings onto which four quadrants of ultrathin aluminized membranes are attached. The NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) provided both experimental and analytical support to L'Garde for validating the structural characteristics of this unique, ultralightweight spacecraft concept. One of LaRC's responsibilities was to develop and apply photogrammetric methods to measure sail shape. The deployed shape provides important information for validating the accuracy of finite-element modeling techniques. Photogrammetry is the science and art of calculating 3 D coordinates of targets or other distinguishing features on structures using images. A minimum of two camera views of each target is required for 3 D determination, but having four or more camera views is preferable for improved reliability and accuracy. Using retroreflective circular targets typically provides the highest measurement accuracy and automation. References 3 and 4 provide details of photogrammetry technology, and reference 5 discusses previous experiences with photogrammetry for measuring gossamer spacecraft structures such as solar sails. This paper discusses the experimental techniques used to measure a L Garde 10 -m solar sail test in vacuum with photogrammetry. The test was conducted at the NASA-Glenn Space Power Facility (SPF) located at Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio. The SPF is the largest vacuum chamber in the United States, measuring 30 m in diameter by 37 m in height. High vacuum levels (10 (exp - 6) torr) can be maintained inside the chamber, and cold environments (- 195 C) are possible using variable-geometry cryogenic cold walls. This test used a vacuum level of approximately 1 torr (sufficient for structural static/dynamic characterization) and instead of using the cryogenic cold walls, used local LN 2 cold plates underneath {{each of the four}} cold-rigidizable solar sail booms instead...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{scenario for}} {{the initiation of}} a space manufacturing enterprise using lunar materials to construct solar power satellites (SPS) was developed, with particular attention to habitat design and logistic support requirements. If SPS's can be constructed exclusively from lunar materials, the entire enterprise can be initiated in a 7 year period of launch activity (beginning as early as 1985) using the Space Shuttle and a low-cost, Shuttle-derived heavy lift vehicle. If additional chemical feedstocks must be imported from earth in significant quantities, {{it may be necessary}} to bring the next-generation launch vehicle (single-stage-to-orbit) into operation by 1991. The scenario presented features use of the mass-driver reaction engine for orbit-to-orbit transfer of cargos and makes extensive use of the <b>expendable</b> Shuttle external <b>propellant</b> tanks...|$|R
50|$|Nixon {{appointed}} his Vice President Spiro Agnew {{to head a}} Space Task Group in 1969 {{to recommend}} follow-on human spaceflight programs after Apollo. The group proposed an ambitious Space Transportation System based on a reusable Space Shuttle which consisted of a winged, internally fueled orbiter stage burning liquid hydrogen, launched by a similar, but larger kerosene-fueled booster stage, each equipped with airbreathing jet engines for powered return to a runway at the Kennedy Space Center launch site. Other components of the system included a permanent modular space station, reusable space tug and nuclear interplanetary ferry, leading to a human expedition to Mars as early as 1986, or as late as 2000, depending {{on the level of}} funding allocated. However, Nixon knew the American political climate would not support Congressional funding for such an ambition, and killed proposals for all but the Shuttle, possibly to be followed by the space station. Plans for the Shuttle were scaled back to reduce development risk, cost, and time, replacing the piloted flyback booster with two reusable solid rocket boosters, and the smaller orbiter would use an <b>expendable</b> external <b>propellant</b> tank to feed its hydrogen-fueled main engines. The orbiter would have to make unpowered landings.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increasing}} interest {{of the scientific community}} toward the study and development of unmanned automatic vehicles, also in the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) frame. Indeed, a number of unmanned vehicle projects have been devoted to demonstrate some key aspects of the technological challenges related to an autonomous RLV. The major efforts have been undertaken by NASA, with the past X- 33 and X- 34 programs. However, because of the high funding required by the development of a costeffective completely reusable vehicle, current efforts are focused on developing demonstrators of some critical technologies of such a vehicle. Recent examples are the successful NASA’s X- 37 /X- 40 and DLR’s Phoenix 5, testing autonomous landing of an RLVshaped vehicle, and the NASA X- 43 A 6, testing air-breathing propulsion. In this framework, the Unmanned Space Vehicle (USV) Program 7 is being performed by the Italian Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA). The USV Program main focus is on the development and in-flight testing of critical technologies of autonomous, fully re-usable, winged-body launch vehicles. To this end, three vehicles, named Flight Test Beds (FTB), will perform a number of missions aimed at gaining further insight into transonic and hypersonic flight, sub-orbital and orbital re-entry, guidance navigation and control, innovative thermal protection systems. In this context, a phase-A study of a low-cost reduced-scale technology demonstrator of a RLV has been carried out by research teams at Politecnico of Turin and at the universities of Naples and Rome under CIRA funding. The main goal {{of the study was to}} assess the feasibility of a reduced scale (1 : 5) technology demonstrator aiming at validating some critical technological and operational aspects of RLVs and of the USV program, by taking the Suborbital Re-entry Test (SRT) mission as case study. The SRT mission main objective is flying at thermal fluxes higher than 650 kW/m 2 at the stagnation point for a time interval at least of 15 s (“hot time”), in order to test innovative Thermal Protection System (TPS) technologies. The vehicle, conceived as a result of the phase-A studies, is a two-stage system. The first stage consists of an <b>expendable</b> off-the-shelf solid <b>propellant</b> motor while the second stage is a non-propelled glider, whose aerodynamic shape is a scaled version of the full-scale USV vehicle...|$|R
