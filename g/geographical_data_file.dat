40|$|ABSTRACT] Environment of a {{river basin}} in Sri Lanka was {{analyzed}} by digital mapping, CIS, and remote sensing data. The 2 ̆ 2 Walawe 2 ̆ 2 river in selected basin {{is one of the}} major rivers in Sri Lanka. It brings water for one of the most active agricultural settlement area and also for number of other smaller reservoirs. The river basin covers over 2400 sq. km. area of land from central mountains to south coast. Vegetation distribution of this area was classified using digital data of Landsat MSS, and produced the other related <b>Geographical</b> <b>data</b> <b>files</b> into a GIS data base with 5 x 5 sec ground resolution. Significant features in; land cover, elevation, slope, soil, climate, and other social phenomena were observed and inter-relations of these elements were analyzed by GIS. Thematic maps such as; soil+paddy, slope+forest, were produced using <b>data</b> <b>file</b> of the GIS data base. The results indicated the; environmentally poor present vegetation structure, neediness for forest conservation and reforestation, and better management of soil and water resources of the area. The extensive use of water and soil of the area for agriculture also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Metadata is the {{important}} information describing <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> resources and their key elements. It is used to guarantee the availability and accessibility of the data. ISO 19115 is a metadata standard for geographical information, making the geographical metadata shareable, retrievable, and understandable at the global level. In order {{to cope with the}} massive, high-dimensional and high-diversity nature of <b>geographical</b> <b>data,</b> data mining is an applicable method to discover the metadata. This thesis develops and evaluates an automated mining method for extracting metadata from the data environment on the Local Area Network at the National Land Survey of Sweden (NLS). These metadata are prepared and provided across Europe according to the metadata implementing rules for the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE). The metadata elements are defined according to the numerical formats of four different data entities: document data, time-series data, webpage data, and spatial data. For evaluating the method for further improvement, a few attributes and corresponding metadata of <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> <b>files</b> are extracted automatically as metadata record in testing, and arranged in database. Based on the extracted metadata schema, a retrieving functionality is used to find the file containing the keyword of metadata user input. In general, the average success rate of metadata extraction and retrieval is 90. 0 %. The mining engine is developed in C # programming language on top of the database using SQL Server 2005. Lucene. net is also integrated with Visual Studio 2005 to build an indexing framework for extracting and accessing metadata in database...|$|R

How to manage spatial data is becoming an essential issue for research and education in planning and design especially in the analysis and evaluation phases. This paper discusses the importance of spatial data in planning education and shows how a common spatial database for model analysis methods was constructed at the University of Tsukuba. The database consists of many <b>geographical</b> and statistical <b>data</b> <b>files</b> classified under the standard region mesh codes and covers the whole country from global areas to local areas.

40|$|Introduction and {{motivation}} The development and documentation of {{software for the}} analysis of <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> is maturing, and the needs and desires of varying user communities are becoming clearer. Certainly today there are more users in more communities, and in general much more data than before, even though data is more accessible in some countries than in others. Many more users are now meeting <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> through <b>geographical</b> information systems software (GIS). GIS are general-purpose environments for handling <b>geographical</b> <b>data,</b> and do not assume that the user will need to make predictions or draw inferences from the data, or error propagation in <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> analysis. Indeed, much of current progress in GIS is in making it easier for users to construct maps at the front end and in providing open and consistent data base support at the back end. Neither of these two areas lie close to the central concerns of statistical data analysts, such as making predictions wit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhylogeography is a {{field that}} focuses on the {{geographical}} lineages of species such as vertebrates or viruses. Here, <b>geographical</b> <b>data,</b> such as location of a species or viral host {{is as important as the}} sequence information extracted from the species. Together, this information can help illustrate the migration of the species over time within a geographical area, the impact of geography over the evolutionary history, or the expected population of the species within the area. Molecular sequence data from NCBI, specifically GenBank, provide an abundance of available sequence data for phylogeography. However, <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> is inconsistently represented and sparse across GenBank entries. This can impede analysis and in situations where the geographical information is inferred, and potentially lead to erroneous results. In this paper, we describe the current state of <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> in GenBank, and illustrate how automated processing techniques such as named entity recognition, can enhance the <b>geographical</b> <b>data</b> available for phylogeographic studies...|$|R
