2500|$|Kember was a keen record {{collector}} {{from the}} age of 11 or 12; some of the first records he purchased included albums by The Velvet Underground. Pierce: [...] "When I was 14, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>The</b> Stooges' Raw Power and I listened to nothing but that for a year".

She said: [...] "I {{thought it was just}} gorgeous. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> record and played it a million times, then sat down and wrote 'Think of Rain.' That's really how I started writing that way. I just decided it was better than what was happening in jazz." [...] Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne wrote that [...] "It's impossible to exaggerate how beautiful this song is. Everywhere, it takes risks." [...] Bono said in October 2006 during Brian Wilson's induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame that [...] "the string arrangement on 'God Only Knows' is fact and proof of angels". Jimmy Webb, an American popular music composer, has also stated his love for the song, stating, [...] "I love 'God Only Knows' and its bow to the baroque that goes {{all the way back to}} 1740 and Johann Sebastian Bach. It represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian's music. And Carl's singing is pretty much at its pinnacle—as good as it ever got." [...] In a 2003 solo concert in Tel Aviv, Steven Wilson, frontman of Porcupine Tree, declared [...] "God Only Knows" [...] as his favorite song of all time. On the Insurgentes listening party that took place in Mexico City in 2009, Steven Wilson said it was a perfect song.
