5|$|His {{successor}} at Ipswich was {{his assistant}} manager Bobby Ferguson. Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice, but worsening performances {{meant that they}} began to struggle in the top division. The recent construction of an <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> stand at Portman Road had limited the club's budget, despite the money gaining from sales of key players including Frans Thijssen and John Wark.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Lucky Luciano {{was photographed}} {{in front of}} the Hotel Sole in the centre of old Palermo – often the {{residence}} of Don Calò Vizzini – talking with Don Calò’s bodyguards. The photographer was beaten up, but he never reported the fact to the authorities after receiving an <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> camera and cash. Vizzini’s network reached the United States where he knew the future family boss Angelo Annaloro of Philadelphia, known as Angelo Bruno, who was born in Villalba.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E

5000|$|The Nordrach Clinic was small, housing {{a maximum}} of fifty patients, and very <b>expensive.</b> <b>News</b> of the successes of Nordrach soon spread and helped give rise to the {{sanatorium}} business in nearby Switzerland, a country whose landscape was much more suited to the high altitude and fresh wind regimen stressed by Nordrach. The Nordrach experiment also gave rise to several [...] "mini Nordrachs", most notably Nordrach-in-Mendip, Nordach-on-Dee and Nordrach-in-Wales.|$|R

5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E
25|$|As {{trade between}} Caribbean and North American states {{increased}} in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana {{became known as the}} Paris of the Antilles.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.|$|E

25|$|A {{major threat}} {{was already on}} the horizon, however, as the Rothesay Dock in Clydebank was under construction. It opened in 1907, {{equipped}} with modern mechanical handling equipment for bulk minerals; it was only 20miles (32km) from most of the coalfields, and sea-going ships could be loaded there. Much traffic was immediately diverted from Ardrossan, and use of the <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> L route declined steeply.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the toxic}} {{materials}} used {{in the production of}} modern computers, obsolescence, if not properly managed, may lead to harmful environmental impacts. On the other hand, obsolescence may sometimes be desirable to a company which can profit immensely from the regular purchase of what is often <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> equipment instead of retaining one device {{for a longer period of}} time. Those in the industry are well aware of this, and may utilize planned obsolescence as a method of increasing profits.|$|E
25|$|Vanity Fair Germany {{launched}} in February 2007 {{at a cost}} of €50 million, then the most <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> magazine in Germany in years and Condé Nast's biggest investment outside the United States. After circulation had plummeted from half a million to less than 200,000 per week, the German edition was shut down in 2009. A French version started in June 2013. The Spanish version of the magazine was first published in Spain in 2008 and it has been published monthly. In April 2015 Condé Nast México y Latinoamerica was to launch Vanity Fair Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Without {{commenting on}} the {{morality}} of the bill, the Canadian Network Operators Consortium noted that smaller, independent ISPs would likely be unable to afford <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> equipment to allow authorities real-time monitoring of their customers and may have to discontinue business. The Ministry had estimated that the initial cost of the bill to be $80 Million over four years, and $6.7 Million dollars each year after that. The ISPs claimed the cost could be much higher. According to the CBC, the costs would have either translated as higher telecommunications costs for Canadian consumers, or increased federal {{taxes to pay for}} the program.|$|E
25|$|This {{historical}} {{importance of}} the Dunedin is due to this meat shipment, which proved refrigerated meat could be exported long distances, so establishing the New Zealand meat export industry, and revolutionising agriculture in New Zealand and Australia. In the United Kingdom (UK), the rapidly expanding population had outrun the supply of local meat, leading to rapid increases in prices. The shipment of livestock from New Zealand to England was prohibitively <b>expensive.</b> <b>New</b> Zealand did export some canned meat, but the industry was in its infancy, and while the product was popular in the Pacific islands, it was less so in England.|$|E
25|$|Asda {{had also}} {{neglected}} {{many of the}} older stores within its estate by not refurbishing them in line with other stores that had been refurbished and its more <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> store sites. One example was the Astley Bridge, Bolton store which had been built in 1970. This store did not receive its first major refurbishment until 1993, and was until that point still trading with the old blue and orange Asda corporate logo and signage attached to the building in various positions, {{and there were many}} other stores like that. It meant that Asda had left the older, outdated unrefurbished stores in locations where competitors were opening new stores more vulnerable to losing customers to their shiny new rivals.|$|E

30|$|Daptomycin has {{superior}} in vitro bactericidal activity against MRSA {{when compared with}} vancomycin and linezolid (Maraconescu et al. 2012). Multiple analyses have compared vancomycin (the incumbent “gold standard”) to linezolid and daptomycin. Though “suggestions” of superiority for daptomycin and/or linezolid have been found (van Hal and Paterson 2011;Bounthavong and Hsu 2012;Logman et al. 2010;Davis et al. 2007), the actual value with respect to hospital LOS from changing from initial therapy with vancomycin, a time tested and inexpensive antibiotic, {{to one of the}} more <b>expensive</b> <b>newer</b> agents as initial therapy for inpatient SSTIs have not been convincingly demonstrated. As part of a cost benefit analysis at our medical center, we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the impact of initial inpatient antibiotic choice (daptomycin, linezolid, or vancomycin) on SSTI length of hospital stay.|$|R
25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1980s, the stadium {{underwent}} another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the Taylor Report's recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces {{of the south and}} east stand were converted to seating, with the north stand becoming all-seater the following season. The south stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant Sony Jumbotron TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings. In 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand had a new upper tier as well as a second Jumbotron screen added. Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006 bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.|$|E

Magnetic tape formats like LTO have far surpassed MO media for high capacity enterprise-grade backup storage.|$|R
2500|$|To fund these <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> ventures, the Beys of Tunis {{relied on}} tax {{revenues}} paid on a customary basis.

There is much scholarly debate about exactly what this constituted and how it was levied, but it appears that before 1856, the term mejba signified a tax paid by a tribe, clan or other social group, based on a collective assessment. The Beys also imposed monopoly taxes on salt, tobacco, tanned hides and other commodities.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, {{faced with}} the need for <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> {{equipment}} for unprofitable suburban service, the PRR decided to extend the life of the MP54 cars instead of buying new equipment. The MP54s were rebuilt at the Wilmington electric shops with an initial batch of fifty [...] cars in the class MP54E5 and a follow-up batch of 50 508hp cars in the class MP54E6 were rebuilt at the Altoona shops. (For unknown reasons, the designation MP54E4 was skipped.) In addition to the new, more powerful propulsion gear, other new equipment was installed including roller bearing equipped equalized trucks, new windows, and recessed transit-type lighting [...] In 1951 there were a total of 481 AC MP54 cars of all types in service, consisting of 405 MP54, 42 MP54T, 10 MPB54B, 9 MPB54, 7 MB62, 4 MBM62, and 4 MBM62T cars.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{small in}} size, AMC {{was able to}} {{introduce}} numerous industry innovations. Starting in 1957, AMC was the only U.S. manufacturer to totally immerse all automobile bodies in primer paint for protection against rust, until competitors adopted the practice in 1964. Even one of AMC's most <b>expensive</b> <b>new</b> product investments (the Pacer) established many features that were later adopted by the auto industry worldwide. These included aerodynamic body design, space-efficient interiors, aircraft style doors, and a large greenhouse for visibility. AMC was also effective in other areas such as marketing by introducing low rate financing. AMC's four-wheel drive vehicles established {{the foundation for the}} modern SUV market segments, and [...] "classic" [...] Jeep models continue to be the benchmark in this field. Roy D. Chapin drew on his experiences as a hunter and fisherman and marketed the Jeep brand successfully to people with like interests. The brand developed a cult appeal that continues.|$|E
