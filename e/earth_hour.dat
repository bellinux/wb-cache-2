In March 2011, she endorsed World Wildlife Fund's <b>Earth</b> <b>Hour</b> campaign in India. She campaigned {{for the cause}} of nutrition in India for Child In Need Institute (CINI), a non-profit organisation based in Kolkata. In September 2012, Vidya visited a village in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, where she participated in a campaign to promote children's education and the empowerment of women. For her attempts to empower women, Vidya was awarded The Prabha Khaitan Puraskar 2012 by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce; she was the youngest recipient of the award.

5|$|In 2007, McCann {{launched}} a multi-platform global advertising campaign titled Believe, that included sixminutes of live-action sequences called Landfall, {{to promote the}} latest game in the Halo series, Halo 3. Landfall was directed by Neill Blomkamp who also agreed to direct a full length Halo film, but it was cancelled due to funding disagreements. Believe proved a critical and financial hit. Over £84 million of sales were made {{on the first day}} of release alone, the highest-grossing opening sale of an entertainment product at the time. Believe received dozens of awards from the advertising community, including eight Clio Awards, Best in Show at the ANDY Awards, and two Grand Prix (for Film and Integrated campaigns) at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry. According to the Gunn Report, Believe was the second-most-awarded integrated advertising campaign of 2008, behind <b>Earth</b> <b>Hour</b> for the World Wide Fund for Nature.|$|E

5000|$|Gethen orbits {{its primary}} star once every 0.96 Earth years (8401 <b>Earth</b> <b>hours).</b> The planet rotates around its axis in 23.08 <b>earth</b> <b>hours,</b> so a Gethenian year {{consists}} of 364 local days. The only natural satellite {{of the planet}} revolves around it in 26 local days, which constitutes a month. The year is divided into 14 of these lunar months. By fortunate coincidence, the deviation between this lunisolar calendar and the true solar year is small enough to require a correction only once every 200 years. Thus the days are synchronized with the moon phase every month. Each day in a month has a unique name. Days are not grouped in weeks, but the month is evenly divided in two halves of 13 days each (the names of the days {{in the second half}} are derived regularly from those of the first half). [...] Gethenians further divide each day into ten parts or [...] "hours", the first one starting at noon.|$|R

The gravity at the surface is 40 times the Earth's, and a Dhrawn day lasts 1500 <b>Earth</b> <b>hours.</b> A {{consortium}} of spacefaring races, including humans, recruits Mesklinites, the centipede-like natives of the high-gravity planet Mesklin (see 61 Cygni: Mission of Gravity above), to explore Dhrawn.|$|R

One day is about 23 <b>Earth</b> <b>hours,</b> in contrast to the (roughly) 24 and 25-hour days of Earth and Mars. The sky is golden but opaque. Hence the sun cannot be seen, daylight is somewhat dimmer than on Earth, and the night is pitch black with no stars visible.|$|R

Half a Martian year, about three hundred and forty-four of our days, each of these men spend alone in this huge, isolated plant.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{combined}} intensity and temperature maps of sodium in Mercury's exosphere, {{made possible by}} the use of the THEMIS solar telescope on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The intensity maps clearly show high-latitude peaks, and temperatures inferred from spectral line widths suggest that these regions are either slightly hotter {{than the rest of the}} exosphere or much smaller than observed. These brighter, warmer regions are also observed, for the first time, to appear within few <b>Earth</b> <b>hours</b> which strongly suggest that they are produced by solar wind sputtering. This highly capable instrument obtained these data during daylight, highlighting the unique potential for THEMIS to undertake continuous multi-hour and multi-day datasets in conjunction with the MESSENGER mission to Mercury...|$|R

50|$|Earth and the Sun {{sometimes}} meet in {{the lunar}} sky, causing an eclipse. On Earth, one would see a lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a solar eclipse, when the Sun goes behind the Earth.
