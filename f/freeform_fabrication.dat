40|$|Abstract. In an {{injection}} moulded part, warpage is the distortion caused by non-uniform shrinkage within the plastic part. When looking critically at {{the causes of}} warpage, {{it is found that}} several key parameters of the moulding process have some effect on the warpage. However, the two major categories that contribute to warpage include the part design and the mould design. In mould design, the gate location, runner/gate system and cooling system design are the major factors affecting not only the warpage and part quality but also the injection moulding cycle time. This paper presents an investigation of using different cooling system configuration on warpage and shrinkage of an industrial plastic part with the aim of determining which cooling configuration will provide minimum warpage and cycle time. As conventional injection mould cooling design is based on straight drilling, it limits the geometric complexity of the cooling design, especially curved shape cooling channels. Nowadays, new technology of advanced rapid tooling based on solid <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrications</b> can be been used to provide conformal cooling channels in injection moulds. In this paper, several type of cooling channels are analysed to compare the performance in terms of warpage and shrinkage and to determine which configuration is suitable for minimizing warpage. Autodesk Moldflow Insight (AMI) simulation software is applied to examine the results of the cooling performances and warpage analysis...|$|R
40|$|Inherent {{across all}} scales in Nature's {{material}} systems are multiple design dimensions, the existences {{of which are}} products of both evolution and environment. In human manufacturing where design must be preconceived and deliberate, static artifacts with no variation of function across directions, distances or time fail to capture many of these dimensions. Inspired by Nature's ability to generate complex structures and responses to external constraints through adaptation, " 4 D printing" addresses additive fabrication of artifacts {{with one or more}} additional design dimension, such as material variation over distance or direction and response or adaptation over time. This work presents and evaluates a series of enabling explorations into the material, time and information dimensions of additive manufacturing: a variable elasticity rapid prototyping platform and an approach towards Digital Anisotropy, a variable impedance prosthetic socket (VTS) as a case study of interfaces between nature and manufacture, CNSilk as an example of on-demand material generation in <b>freeform</b> tensile <b>fabrication,</b> and Material DNA as an exploration into embedded spatio-temporal content variation. by Elizabeth Yinling Tsai.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Freeform</b> optics <b>fabrication</b> {{has become}} one of the hottest topics in optics {{industry}} in recent years. Although it still remains a challenge, many have tried different ways of manufacturing it. Some have achieved degrees of success. By means of a Nanotech 350 -FG five axis diamond turning machine, we too have successfully produced some prototype freeform optics and lens arrays with Slow Tool Servo and Milling method. The produced freeform optics are mainly for automobile LED headlamps and the lens arrays are for LED illumination. In order to produce the freeform optics, we developed our own DT Slow Tool Servo program which is capable of generating a DT program for diamond turning a universal/general 3 D freeform surface. Slow Tool Servo technique and Diamond Milling technique were mainly employed to produce these freeform surfaces. The manufacturing process and machining parameter details will be given in the paper. The two main methods we used will be compared and discussed as well. In measuring the freeform surface, a 3 D white light interferometer was used to scan and obtain the surface coordinates. The software made by ourselves enabled us to compare the measure results of the work piece with that of the design drawings. The deviation of our finished forms is within 5 um from that of the nominal. The surface quality Rq is about 10 nm. Measuring equipment and methodology will also be discussed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new multi-function based modeling of 3 D heterogeneous porous wound scaffolds to improve wound healing process for complex deep acute or chronic wounds. An imaging-based {{approach is developed}} to extract 3 D wound geometry and recognize wound features. Linear healing fashion of the wound margin towards the wound center is mimicked.

40|$|The growing {{field of}} {{high-order}} aspheric and <b>freeform</b> optical <b>fabrication</b> has inspired {{the creation of}} optical surfaces and systems which are difficult to align. Advances in optical alignment technology are critical to fabricating and integrating aspheric components in advanced optical systems. This dissertation explores the field of optical alignment with a computer-generated hologram (CGH) used as a reference. A CGH is a diffractive optic which {{may be used to}} create a desired phase profile across a beam of light, project irradiance patterns, or serve as a mask for an incident beam. The alignment methods presented in this dissertation are concerned {{with the use of a}} CGH to create reference phase profiles, or "wavefronts", in a beam. In one application a set of axisymmetric CGH references are co-aligned. Each CGH has also been aligned to an aspheric mirror so the co-alignment of the CGH references is also a co-alignment of the aspheric mirrors. Another application is concerned with aligning an interferometer to test an aspheric mirror surface. The interferometer measures a "null" interference pattern when its wavefront accommodates a known surface profile. In this alignment application the CGH creates wavefronts which accommodate a known set of small spherical reference features at the test surface. An interference null from all the "phase fiducial" reference features indicates an aligned projection of the CGH. The CGH co-alignment method is implemented on a 4 -mirror prime focus corrector known as the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Wide Field Corrector (HET WFC). It is shown that this method was very successful for centration alignment of some mirrors, whereas mechanical stability was the hardware limitation for other degrees of freedom. The additional alignment methods used in this project are described in detail and the expected alignment of the HET WFC is reported. The fabrication, characterization and application of spherical phase fiducials is demonstrated in a CGH-corrected Fizeau test prototype. It is shown that these reference features achieve <± 1. 5 µm transverse alignment precision. A pair of phase fiducials is also applied to constrain the clocking and magnification of a projected wavefront. Fabrication and coordinate measurement of the features present the dominant challenges in these demonstrations...|$|R

50|$|The {{technologies}} {{referred to}} as Solid <b>Freeform</b> <b>Fabrication</b> are what we recognize today as rapid prototyping, 3D printing or additive manufacturing: Swainson (1977), Schwerzel (1984) worked on polymerization of a photosensitive polymer {{at the intersection of}} two computer controlled laser beams. Ciraud (1972) considered magnetostatic or electrostatic deposition with electron beam, laser or plasma for sintered surface cladding. These were all proposed but it is unknown if working machines were built. Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute was the first to publish an account of a solid model fabricated using a photopolymer rapid prototyping system (1981). Even at that early date the technology was seen as having a place in manufacturing practice. A low resolution, low strength output had value in design verification, mould making, production jigs and other areas. Outputs have steadily advanced toward higher specification uses.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the existing soft actuators are fabricated using multistep low yield processes such as micro-moulding, solid <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication,</b> and mask lithography. However, these methods require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved. To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Therefore, special soft systems that can be fabricated in a single step by rapid prototyping methods, such as 3D printing, are utilized to narrow {{the gap between the}} design and implementation of soft actuators, making the process faster, less expensive, and simpler. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints, adhesives, and fasteners.

40|$|Solid <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> is the {{near-net-shape}} manufacturing {{of components}} by sequentially stacking thin layers of material until complicated three dimensional shapes are produced. The operation is computer controlled and requires no molds. This exciting {{new field of}} technology provides engineers {{with the ability to}} rapidly produce prototype parts directly from CAD drawings and oftentimes little or no machining is necessary after fabrication. Techniques for <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> with several types of plastics and metals are already quite advanced and maybe reviewed in references 1 and 2. Very complicated plastic models can be fabricated by stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, or three-dimensional ink jet printing. Metals may be freeformed by the LENS{trademark} technique and porous ceramic bodies by three dimensional printing into a porous powder bed. However, methods for <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> that utilize particulate slurries to build dense ceramics and composites are not as well developed. The techniques that are being developed for the <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> of dense structural ceramics primarily revolve around the sequential layering of ceramic loaded polymers or waxes. Laminated Object Manufacturing and CAM-LEM processing use controlled stacking and laser cutting of ceramic tapes [2, 3]. Similar to fused deposition modeling, ceramic loaded polymer/wax filaments are being used for the fused deposition of ceramics [2, 4]. Extrusion <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> uses high pressure extrusion to deposit layers of ceramic loaded polymer/wax systems[1]. Modified stereolithographic techniques are also being developed using ceramic loaded ultraviolet curable resins [2]. Pre-sintered parts made with any of these techniques typically have 40 - 55 vol. % polymeric binder. In this regard, these techniques are analogous to powder injection molding of ceramics. Very long and complicated burnout heat treatments are necessary to produce a dense ceramic, free of organics. Heating rates of 0. 2 degrees Celsius per minute are common. [5] Thus, while a part maybe rapidly prototype within a few hours, it takes several days to densify. In contrast, robocasting is a <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> technique developed at Sandia National Labs that utilizes particulate slurries but does not require organic binders. Since binder burnout is not an issue, a dense ceramic part maybe freeformed, dried, and sintered in less than 24 hours. In some regards, robocasting is analogous to the ceramic near-net-shape processing techniques, slip casting and gel casting [6]; however, robocasting is moldless and fabrication times can be quicker...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing of {{structural}} metal parts directly from {{computer aided design}} (CAD) data has been investigated by numerous researchers over the past decade. Researchers at NASA Langley Research Center are developing a new solid <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> process, electron beam <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> (EBF 3), as a rapid metal deposition process that works efficiently {{with a variety of}} weldable alloys. EBF 3 deposits of 2219 aluminium and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V have exhibited a range of grain morphologies depending upon the deposition parameters. These materials have exhibited excellent tensile properties comparable to typical handbook data for wrought plate product after post-processing heat treatments. The EBF 3 process is capable of bulk metal deposition at deposition rates in excess of 2500 cm 3 /hr (150 in 3 /hr) or finer detail at lower deposition rates, depending upon the desired application. This process offers the potential for rapidly adding structural details to simpler cast or forged structures rather than the conventional approach of machining large volumes of chips to produce a monolithic metallic structure.

40|$|Purpose – Solid <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> (SFF) has the {{potential}} to revolutionize manufacturing, even to allow individuals to invent, customize, and manufacture goods cost-effectively in their own homes. Commercial <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> systems – while successful in industrial settings – are costly, proprietary, and work with few, expensive, and proprietary materials, limiting the growth and advancement of the technology. The open-source Fab@Home Project has been created to promote SFF technology by placing it in the hands of hobbyists, inventors, and artists in a form which is simple, cheap, and without restrictions on experimentation. This paper aims to examine this. Design/methodology/approach – A simple, low-cost, user modifiable <b>freeform</b> <b>fabrication</b> system has been designed, called the Fab@Home Model 1, and the designs, documentation, software, and source code have been published on a user-editable “wiki ” web site under the open-source BSD License. Six systems have been built, and three of them given away to interested users in return for feedback on the system and contributions to the web site. Findings – The Fab@Home Model 1 can build objects comprising multiple materials, with sub-millimeter-scale features, and overall dimensions larger than 20 cm. In its first six months of operation, the project has received more than 13 million web site hits, and media coverage by several international news and technology magazines, web sites, and programs. Model 1 s are being used in a university engineering course, a Model 1 will be included in an exhibit on the history of plastics at the Science Museum London, UK, and kits can now be purchased commercially. Research limitations/implications – The ease of construction and operation of the Model 1 has not been well tested.
