60|$|An hour {{afterwards}} there flashed farther northward {{than ever}} current from a battery {{had gone before}} an earnest, cordial, almost affectionate message from Margaret Raleigh to Sarah Block, and it concluded with the information {{that it was the}} rough side of the plasters which should <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the skin. After that Mrs. Raleigh went to bed with a peaceful mind and slept soundly.|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} shed; regained the road; and stopped, {{looking up and}} down, and all round him, indecisively. Where should he <b>go</b> <b>next?</b> <b>To</b> the grave, {{where he had been}} told that Mary lay buried? No: not until he had first read all the letters and {{carefully}} examined all the objects in the box. Back to London, and to his promised meeting next morning with Zack? Yes: nothing better was left to be done--back to London.|$|E

The sooner we are down the hill, perhaps, the better it may be. Lead the way, then, Joel, and I will follow. Michael will <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> you, in {{readiness}} for any enemy, and I will bring up the rear. It will be better for all to keep a dead silence, until it be necessary to speak." ...|$|E
60|$|When Achish and his Philistines <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> {{fight against}} the Jews, Achish asks David and his men {{to go with him}} and his army. And then begins a very dark story. What David meant to do we are not told; but one thing is clear, that {{whatever}} he did, he must have disgraced himself for ever, if God had not had mercy on him. He is forced to go. For he can give no reason why he should not. So he goes; and in the rear with the Philistine king, in the post of honour, as his bodyguard. What is he to do? If he fights against his own people, he covers himself with eternal shame, and loses his chance of ever being king. If he turns against Achish and his Philistines in the battle he covers himself with eternal shame likewise, for they had helped him in his distress, and given him a home.|$|E
6000|$|... 23rd. Mail day.--The Ebb Tide, all but (I take it) fifteen pages, {{is now in}} your hands--possibly {{only about}} eleven pp. It is hard to say. But there it is, {{and you can do}} your best with it. Personally, I believe I would in this case make even a {{sacrifice}} to get Gordon Browne and copious illustration. I guess in ten days I shall have finished with it; then I <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> D. Balfour, and get the proofs ready: a nasty job for me, as you know. And then? Well, perhaps I'll take a go at the family history. I think that will be wise, as I am so much off work. And then, I suppose, Weir of Hermiston, but it may be anything. I am discontented with The Ebb Tide, naturally; there seems such a veil of words over it; and I like more and more naked writing; and yet sometimes one has a longing for full colour and there comes the veil again. The Young Chevalier is in very full colour, and I fear it for that reason.--Ever, ...|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} the Recog Cam option. Here, {{if you were to}} show a {{particular}} card (basically an image) {{in front of the camera}} while in this mode, it will activate something within the game. 3 of these cards were available on the manual supplied with the game. One of them was the logo of the then upcoming game, EyeToy Kinetic. Displaying that card in front of the camera would activate a video promoting the game. After the video, some information on the game would then show up where you could <b>go</b> <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> read more.|$|E
50|$|Holmes tells Watson {{he has an}} {{immediate}} appointment with the Bishop of Knightsbridge. Upon arriving, he discovers that the bishop has been tied up, burnt and mutilated, {{as well as a}} finger that presumably belongs to one of the murderers. Holmes deduces that the culprits had been low class workers, who had been hired, and given a special poison that caused a form of psychotic madness. Upon further investigation, Holmes pinpoints the location where he believes the men to have worked, a cemetery in Whitechapel. The player is then given a choice where to <b>go</b> <b>next.</b> <b>To</b> visit the cemetery, or to a local prison which houses a poison manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Sykes {{at the end}} of {{his life}} was passed Isaac Newton's papers on {{theology}} and chronology. He prepared a digest of the material, but found almost none of it fit for publication. The papers <b>went</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Jeffery Ekins.|$|R

50|$|The {{submarine}} cables were {{an economic}} boon to trading companies because owners of ships could communicate with captains {{when they reached}} their destination {{on the other side}} of the ocean and even give directions as to where to <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> pick up more cargo based on reported pricing and supply information. The British government had obvious uses for the cables in maintaining administrative communications with governors throughout its empire, as well as in engaging other nations diplomatically and communicating with its military units in wartime. The geographic location of British territory was also an advantage as it included both Ireland on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean and Newfoundland in North America on the west side, making for the shortest route across the ocean, which reduced costs significantly.|$|E
5000|$|Dersu Uzala {{saves the}} life of Captain Arseniev {{for the first time}} when the two are lost on a frozen lake and a sudden {{blizzard}} overtakes them. Dersu shows Arseniev how to quickly build a straw hut for shelter using grass and then, when Arseniev collapses due to exhaustion, Dersu pulls him into the shelter. The two men avoid freezing to death and are discovered by the rest of their comrades when the blizzard clears. The expedition then, struggling to survive the frozen tundra, encounter a Nani family who invite them into their home, providing the men much needed food, and warmth. At this point Dersu asks where Arseniev will <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> which Arseniev tells him [...] "back to the city" [...] and invites Dersu to come with him. Dersu tells him that his place is in the forest and that tomorrow he will go on his way. The next day he leaves the soldiers by the railroad tracks and returns to wilderness.|$|E
50|$|The first bond {{forces the}} {{characters}} {{to attack the}} royal carriage as it goes past, resulting {{in a fight with}} some royal guards. The characters begin searching for the first controlling faction, a band of assassins known as the Fire Knives. After defeating the Fire Knives and ridding themselves of the first bond, the characters are banished from Tilverton for trying to kill the King. The characters may then journey to Shadowdale or Ashabenford. The player then spends the rest of the game deciding where to <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> remove another bond. As the story continues, the adventurers confront the King of Cormyr and his princess, rescue Dimswart the Sage, locate three artifacts, and explore Dagger Falls. Princess Nacacia of Cormyr went missing a year ago, when she fled to escape a marriage arranged by her father, and {{it is up to the}} party to find her. The game combines mini-adventures with major adventures in the quest to remove the Azure Bonds. In the game's climactic battle, the adventurers take on an old foe back from the dead.|$|E

For this purpose we recalculate all the geometrical ingredients showing that such effect is minimum. Once we have outlined the new field equations, we <b>go</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> study their solutions in the flat case i. e. K= 0. We find that the scaling solution obtained in our previous model is the only solution for this new case and that the "constants" $G$ and $c$ must verify, as integration condition of the field equations, the relationship $G/c^{ 2 }=const. $ in spite of that both "constants" vary...|$|E
