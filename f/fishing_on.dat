5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> the Rogue, but this decision was reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E

5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the creek}} whaler {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and crustaceans. It is viviparous, with the unborn young being sustained through a placental connection. The defined mating season lasts from May to July. Females give birth to one to seven pups annually, following a gestation period of seven to 9 months. A small number of creek whalers are caught incidentally in inshore gillnets and used for food, but the effect of <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> its population seems to be inconsequential. As a result, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the smalltail shark {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fishes such as croakers, while crustaceans, cephalopods, and smaller {{sharks and rays}} may also be consumed. It is viviparous, meaning the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. Females bear litters of two to nine young on a biennial cycle, following an approximately 12-month gestation period. The smalltail shark is often caught as bycatch and {{may be used for}} meat, fins, liver oil, cartilage, and fishmeal. The impact of <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> its population is largely unknown except off northern Brazil, where it seems to have declined significantly since the 1980s. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as Data Deficient overall and as Vulnerable in Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a {{marbled electric ray}} can be severe but is not directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled electric ray as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric ray and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{proximity}} {{to the river and}} the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> the island and introduced new equipment.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century salt {{evaporation}} ponds were dug in tidal marshes {{around the}} bay, producing salt for condiments {{and to be}} used as a preservative for meats. Today, due to the bay's location, east of Goose Island State Park and west of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, very little industry can be found. No industrial plants are located on the bay's shore, but a few gas and oil wells are present. The Continental Oil Company is allowed to obtain oil and gas from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge as part of the purchase of St. Charles Ranch. Goose Island offers a few piers and campgrounds facing the bay, which encourage tourism. The privately owned St. Charles Bay Hunting Club is also found in this area, and allows hunting, boating and <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> the bay, while striving to protect the ecosystem. The lack of coastal winds also attracts tourists interested in kayaking and wadefishing, however, boating is hindered by the general shallowness of the bay and the abundance of oyster reefs. Shellfish production is approved throughout the bay, but shrimping is prohibited due to the classification of St. Charles Bay as a nursery bay.|$|E

5|$|For {{attack and}} defense, the common torpedo can deliver a strong {{electric}} shock {{of up to}} 200 volts. It is a solitary, nocturnal ambush predator that feeds mainly on bony fishes and crustaceans. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females produce litters of up to 28 young every year in late summer or autumn, after a gestation period of 4–8 months; the specifics vary between geographical regions. The common torpedo's shock is painful but otherwise of little danger to humans. Its electrogenic properties led it {{to be used in}} medicine by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In modern times, it has no economic value and is mostly discarded when caught as bycatch in fisheries. The impact of <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> its population is uncertain, and pending more data the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin lemon shark globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using anchored and floating gillnets, beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin lemon shark is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce {{under the pressure of}} expanding, unmonitored, and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and blast <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat to the survival of this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin lemon shark has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin lemon shark is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
