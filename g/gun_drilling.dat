2500|$|Some {{cutting fluids}} {{are used in}} aerosol (mist) form (air with tiny {{droplets}} of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don't even work very well. Both of those problems come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere {{and all the time}} except at the cutting interface, during the cut—the one place and time where it's wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, [...] (minimum quantity of lubricant), avoids both of those problems. The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the insert itself—an ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> or expensive, state-of-the-art liquid delivery in production milling). MQL's aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators' perspective. The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is so clean that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before. MQL doesn't provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> {{can be done}} {{on several}} kinds of machine tools. On lathes, it is {{generally}} practical with hole depths of less than 50 diameters. There are also purpose-built <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> machines, where longer aspect ratios can be drilled.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> was {{originally}} developed to drill out gun barrels {{and is used}} commonly for drilling smaller diameter deep holes. The depth-to-diameter ratio can be even greater than 300:1. The key feature of <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> is that the bits are self-centering; this is what allows for such deep accurate holes. The bits use a rotary motion similar to a twist drill; however, the bits are designed with bearing pads that slide along {{the surface of the}} hole keeping the drill bit on center. <b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> is usually done at high speeds and low feed rates.|$|E

50|$|Installing linear {{position}} sensors into {{hydraulic cylinders}} {{has been a}} sore subject for cylinder manufacturers for a long time. Extensive fabrication headaches, including <b>gun</b> <b>drilling,</b> the need to stock all different sensor lengths, and handling issues have contributed to industry frustration.

The cable connector installs into the piston or rod via a 7/16”-20 threaded connector, and the sensor is coupled to the cylinder via a hydraulic hose through a #8 SAE port.|$|E

50|$|This {{method of}} {{fabrication}} was used {{because it was}} difficult to cast a solid barrel and then drill it out without the bit coming out the side. In many regions and eras, especially before the 20th century, gunsmithing has been achieved without the help of advanced machine tool practice, such as <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> or advanced boring methods. In such contexts, advanced smithing and filing skills have often made up for the lack of machine tools.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the factors}} just mentioned, deep-hole {{drilling}} and deep-hole boring are inherently challenging areas of practice that demand special tooling and techniques. Nevertheless, technologies have been developed that produce deep holes with impressive accuracy. In most cases they involve multiple cutting points, diametrically opposed, whose deflection forces cancel each other out. They also usually involve delivery of cutting fluid pumped under pressure through the tool to orifices near the cutting edges. <b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> and cannon boring are classic examples. First developed to make the barrels of firearms and artillery, these machining techniques find wide use today for manufacturing in many industries.|$|E
50|$|Deep hole {{drilling}} is generally achievable {{with a few}} tooling methods, usually <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> or BTA drilling. These are differentiated due to the coolant entry method (internal or external) and chip removal method (internal or external). Using methods such as a rotating tool and counter-rotating workpiece are common techniques to achieve required straightness tolerances. Secondary tooling methods include trepanning, skiving and burnishing, pull boring, or bottle boring. Finally {{a new kind of}} drilling technology is available to face this issue: vibration drilling. This technology breaks up the chips by a small controlled axial vibration of the drill. The small chips are easily removed by the flutes of the drill.|$|E

The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} the development and validation of a three dimensional thermomechanically coupled finite element model for <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> AISI 4150 quenched and tempered steel. The Lagrangian formulation proposed in the FE code DEFORM 3 DTM and the constitutive Johnson-Cook material model were utilized to simulate the chip formation and to predict the cutting reaction forces as well as the temperature in <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> process using carbide gun drills with two different diameters. During <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> simulation, modified gun drill cutting edge rounding and friction law are performed to investigate the effect of tool wear and lubrication on feed force and torque respectively. Experimental <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> tests were carried out in steel AISI 4150 for the validation of the developed 3 D FE model. The developed and validated 3 D FE model can be used for optimizing the cutting process in <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> (good surface finish and straightness) taking into account the complex gun drill geometry, cutting conditions, heat transfer and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the workpiece material...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>drills</b> [...] are {{straight}} fluted drills which allow cutting fluid (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow {{body to the}} cutting face. They are used for deep drilling—a depth-to-diameter ratio of 300:1 or more is possible. Gun barrels are the obvious example; hence the name. Other uses include moldmaking, diemaking, and the manufacture of combustion engine parts such as crankcase, cylinder head, and woodwind musical instruments, such as uilleann pipes, as <b>gun</b> <b>drills</b> can drill long straight holes in metal, wood, and some plastics. The coolant provides lubrication and cooling to the cutting edges and removes the swarf or chips from the hole. Modern <b>gun</b> <b>drills</b> use carbide tips to prolong life and reduce total cost when compared with metal tips. Speed of drilling depends on the material being drilled, rotational speed, and the drill diameter; a high speed drill can cut a hole in P20 steel at 30 inches per minute.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} few years, process {{monitoring}} of drilling processes using force and vibration signals has successfully been established. However, only few investigations were performed in the monitoring of chip breakage and chip transportation, while in <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> these properties are more relevant to ensure process robustness and performance than force and vibration. This paper presents a new monitoring approach of chip frequency and transportation for <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> processes using infrared light reflection next to the drilling bush. <b>Gun</b> <b>drilling</b> is a high performance cutting process used for small diameter and large aspect ratio drilling operations {{in the field of}} automotive, aeronautic, power generation and medical devices. The usage of new harder materials for future products increases the challenge of proper chip transportation and raises the need of chip monitoring being able to operate with economically acceptable parameters. The approach of optical chip detection highlights the opportunity of detecting chips smaller than 1 mm and velocities in axial direction of more than 16 m/s clearly and suggests new characteristic values to be used for process validation. For implementing the measurement principle a new sensor is designed. In addition, the opportunities of future data analysis and detection of characteristic values are explained...|$|E

Measurements {{have been carried}} out in a real industry environment with a tailor-made multi-spindle <b>gun</b> <b>drilling</b> machine. The drilling machine comprises some 300 spindles in one line and it is used to drill holes in paper machine parts. Measured AE-signals have been analysed both in time and frequency domain and especially high frequency content of AE-signals (over 150 kHz) have been examined. Breakage can be detected distinctly over the frequency content of AE-signals born in a normal undisturbed drilling. The location of sensors play very crucial role because the high frequency content of AE-signals attenuates very rapidly with increasing distance between the sensor and cutting process...|$|E

Examples of this substitution would be mounting the guard or artillery <b>gun</b> <b>drill.</b> Because foot and arm drill commands are passed down by word of mouth through training, the Irish commands have become distorted from their original pronunciations. In the same way that has occurred in the British Army (the subject of many parodies with screaming Sergeant Majors), words of command lose their defined pronunciation; examples being Aire (Arra) which often becomes Ahha and Cle (Kley) which is sometimes distorted to Hey or Huy.|$|R
25|$|Long series {{drill bits}} are unusually long twist drill bits.

The job having a cylindrical shape and number of holes are required on it at an angle is challenging task for design engineer and hence Computer Aided Fixture Design (CAFD) is incorporated in manufacturing industry. It deals with the integration of CAD and CNC programming in CAM systems using softwares for fixture design. Except V block, no other option is available to hold cylindrical object and hence special type of fixture is designed for this case, which can be used for angular drilling. In this paper, a literature survey of computer aided fixture design and automation over the past decade is proposed. First, an introduction is given on the fixture applications in industry. Then, significant works done in the CAFD field, including their approaches and customer requirements are discussed...|$|E
