Residents in highland areas were also warned of possible mudslides, and the army was dispatched to aid in regional storm preparations.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz {{began as}} a {{showcase}} for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. Since then, it {{has evolved into a}} modern research university {{with a wide variety of}} both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> undergraduate support and student political activism. The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Vassar College in {{the town}} of Poughkeepsie, New York, {{completed}} Davison House, the fourth dorm in the college's residential quadrangle (quad). Enrollment was limited to 1,000 students by 1905 and the college saw a need to further expand the number of dorms available so it approved {{the creation of a new}} one.

5|$|In 793 the {{vulnerability}} of the English east coast was exposed when the monastery at Lindisfarne was looted by Vikings and a year later Jarrow was also attacked, events which Steven Plunkett reasons would ensure that the East Anglians were governed firmly. Æthelberht's claim to be a king descended from the Wuffingas dynasty (suggested by the use of a Roman she-wolf and the title REX on his coins) could be because of a need <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> kingship {{as a result of the}} Viking attacks.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> {{public investment}} had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E
5|$|Many riders used normal {{road race}} bikes for this stage, as {{the course is}} highly {{atypical}} for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E

5|$|The need <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> {{leaders who}} could take charge and steer America out of its crisis is seen in Gabriel Over the White House (1933), about a benevolent {{dictator}} who takes control of the United States. Walter Huston stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel Gabriel upon being knocked unconscious. The spirit's behavior {{is similar to that}} of Abraham Lincoln. The president solves the nation's unemployment crisis and executes an Al Capone-type criminal who has continually flouted the law.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, very warm and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds and warm and moist air created conditions favorable <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> thunderstorms. On June 5, {{a high risk of}} severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area. Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E

5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} to stay financially afloat. National income was desperately needed and most came from tariffs on imported goods. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service for the United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone advisory was issued on Tropical Storm Dorothy, a hurricane watch and storm warning were issued for the Leeward Islands from Dominica northward. As its westward track became more apparent, the watches and warnings were extended southward to include Martinique and Saint Lucia. On Martinique, authorities {{released a statement}} that warned the public for the potential <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> winds, heavy rainfall, and rough waves. Also on the island, officials converted schools and government buildings into shelters for people in low-lying areas. As {{a result of the}} storm, the Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Le Lamentin was closed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} western Atlantic, the Miami U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm {{warnings}} for the North Carolina coastline from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras; the region was warned to prepare <b>for</b> <b>strong</b> winds. The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina. Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85mph (140km/h), as well as waves up to 35feet (10m) in height. The combination of the winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks, after the engine was damaged when water entered the fuel line. The 26person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided {{to stay on the}} freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist. The seas damaged a portion of the ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries. The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed power poles and tree limbs, leaving 10,000houses without electricity.|$|E
