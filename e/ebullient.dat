25|$|In late 1936 he {{was invited}} to join the {{influential}} Savoy Ballroom orchestra, led by the drummer Chick Webb. Based at New York's Savoy Ballroom, Webb's orchestra was renowned {{as one of the best}} big bands of its day and regularly beat all comers at the Savoy's legendary cutting contests. Jordan worked with Webb until 1938, and it proved a vital stepping-stone in his career—Webb (who was physically disabled) was a fine musician but not a great showman. The <b>ebullient</b> Jordan often introduced songs as he began singing lead; he later recalled that many in the audience took him to be the band's leader, which undoubtedly boosted his confidence further. This was the same period when the young Ella Fitzgerald was coming to prominence as the Webb band's lead female vocalist; she and Jordan often sang duets on stage, and they later reprised their partnership on several records, by which time both were major stars.|$|E
25|$|Praise was {{reserved}} for the Indian bowlers' extensively penetrative bowling and their <b>ebullient</b> comeback after a tolling day which saw them becoming increasingly despondent and lacklustre. He bowled half of the sixteen overs possible on that day and his figures were: 8–0–42–3. These figures if expensive, belied the fact that Khan bowled according to the plans the Indians had set to different Australian batsmen. Zaheer hit an unplayable line and length mark right from his very first over and did not let any batsman settle. Agarkar kept Martyn quiet with some deliveries that the batsman played and missed. Greg Chappell and Sunil Gavaskar, two players who had played in the 1981 Melbourne test match between the two countries, when India defeated the Australians by 59 runs after setting them a target of 143, reckoned that the Indian bowlers' performances were quite close to the bowling heroics put up by the Indian team in that match. Overall, Zaheer's 5/95 was his third successive five-wicket haul in tests.|$|E
25|$|A {{right-handed}} opening batsman, Angell {{made a lot}} of runs in club cricket for the Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, but {{his record}} in first-class cricket was less successful. He played for Somerset in matches at Bath in both 1947 and 1948, and in a few more games in 1949, before joining the county club's staff in 1950. Playing mostly as the opening partner to the <b>ebullient</b> Harold Gimblett, Angell was a restrained, neat batsman and made 933 runs in his first full season, though his average was only 20 and he passed 50 only three times. There was a very similar record in 1951, with 975 runs, again at an average of 20. In 1952, Angell made his highest score of 90 in the match against Derbyshire at Derby. But three weeks later he was dropped from the side and, as Somerset hit the bottom of the County Championship table for what would prove to be the first of four consecutive last-place finishes, he was not re-engaged {{at the end of the}} 1952 season.|$|E

HHTV News' Bob Hale and his eccentric-but-erudite in-studio reports provide a broader picture on historical events (such as the Wars of the Roses and the French Revolution), in a style reminiscent of presenter Peter Snow. The [...] "Shouty Man", a parody of a typically <b>ebullient</b> infomercial host (like Barry Scott), pitches unusual historical products.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the breadth}} of Pedro's instruction, his {{education}} proved lacking. Historian Otávio Tarquínio de Sousa said that Pedro [...] "was without a shadow of doubt intelligent, quick-witted, [...] perspicacious." [...] However, historian Roderick J. Barman relates that he was by nature [...] "too <b>ebullient,</b> too erratic, and too emotional". He remained impulsive and never learned to exercise self-control or to assess {{the consequences of his}} decisions and adapt his outlook to changes in situations. His father never allowed anyone to discipline him. While Pedro's schedule dictated two hours of study each day, he sometimes circumvented the routine by dismissing his instructors in favor of activities that he found more interesting.|$|E
500|$|The {{mainstream}} press praised her as well. Christian Century suggested, [...] "the {{story of her}} life should be taught to every school child for generations to come." [...] The New York Times noted she was, [...] "one of the most potent factors {{in the growth of}} interracial goodwill in America." [...] The Washington Post said: [...] "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her... Not only her own people, but all America has been enriched and ennobled by her courageous, <b>ebullient</b> spirit." [...] Her hometown newspaper, the Daytona Beach Evening News printed, [...] "To some she seemed unreal, something that could not be.... What right had she to greatness?...

500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] is a doo-wop song, and lyrically {{comprises}} a list {{of factors}} Trainor's love interests {{should be aware of}} before proposing to her. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dubbed the song [...] "a YA dream that's no pastel-colored fantasy," [...] and opined, [...] " [...] imagines marriage as contract between equals who work and don't cook". The melody in [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] was likened to American singer Dion's [...] "Runaround Sue" [...] (1961), and sonically the song comprises a series of slick production slap-beats, a rock-inspired drum track, zippy piano and <b>ebullient</b> brass instrumentation. The EP's final track, [...] "Close Your Eyes" [...] is a modern slow dance ballad about ignoring negativity and loving yourself on your own terms. Backed by an acoustic guitar, Trainor solicits a nuanced, soulful, fluttery vocal performance afront pitch-shifted background vocals on the track.|$|E
500|$|Hawkins' single {{was a hit}} in Canada, {{according}} to writer Oliver Trager, but its release predated Canadian record chart compiler, RPM magazine. Except near the border in the Great Lakes area, the record was largely unnoticed and did not appear on the Billboard charts. In 1964, they performed an eight-minute version in a jam style later associated with the Grateful Dead. Robertson, along with Levon Helm and Garth Hudson, backed John P. Hammond for a recording of [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] for the latter's So Many Roads album. Released in 1965, the song uses a Bo Diddley beat with a blues rock arrangement. In 1976, Hawkins performed the song with the Band for The Last Waltz concert film and album. Band biographer Neil Minturn describes it as [...] "demanding an <b>ebullient,</b> loose, insistent, repetitive groove, with roots in Southern, rural culture. [...] Hawkins continued to perform [...] "Who Do You Love?" [...] as a solo artist.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{described}} live concerts by the Amps as unpolished and relaxed. The Chronicles Drema Crist praised {{their show}} at an unidentified location as [...] "fun-spirited and silly". Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune described {{one of their}} Chicago performances as [...] "off-kilter" [...] and wrote that [...] "Deal's pungent vocals were {{swallowed up by the}} guitars, and the foursome's slight melodies were lost amid all the bashing." [...] A review in The Chicago Reader of the same concert noted that [...] "The Amps play with a low-key, hangout sound." [...] The Phoenixs Matt Ashare felt that at their December 1995 show in Boston [...] "the Amps didn't click {{in a way that would}} suggest that this was Deal's new, full-time band"; he added that it was [...] "an unpretentiously gritty way for Deal to let off some steam while the Breeders [...] a little break". In Boston Rock, this concert was characterized as [...] "sloppy" [...] but [...] "charm ... hanging loosely off Kim's gruff vocals and <b>ebullient</b> personality".|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} {{stretch of the}} tour, the final encores of many shows {{presented}} a long, rousing, <b>ebullient</b> rendition of Jackie Wilson's classic [...] "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher". [...] Showcasing featured vocals from Cindy Mizelle or Curtis King and trumpet solos from Curt Ramm, the song stretched to eight minutes with key changes, reprises, and walks through the pit area by Springsteen and the singers, and became {{recognized as one of}} the highpoints of the entire tour. [...] Springsteen dispelled any notion of this being the final E Street Band show or the last for a long time; in an interview near the end of the tour he said, [...] "We're playing to an audience now that will outlive us. But at the same time the band is very, very powerful right now. And part of the reason it's powerful is that it's carrying a lot of very strong cumulative history. You come and you see 35 years of a speeding train going down the track, and you're gonna get to be on the front end of it. We look forward to many, many more years of touring and playing and enjoying it." ...|$|E
500|$|Garnet {{was not at}} {{all like}} Catesby, {{described}} by Fraser as possessing the mentality [...] "of the crusader who does not hesitate to employ the sword in the cause of values which he considers are spiritual". In contrast, Garnet believed that [...] "things were best settled by submission to the will of God." [...] He was <b>ebullient</b> over King James's succession to the English throne, and hoped there would be no foreign interference. Of the 1603 Bye Plot, revealed (with his blessing) to the Privy Council by two Catholic priests, he wrote that it was [...] "a piece of impudent folly, for we know that it is by peaceful means that his Holiness and other princes are prepared to help us." [...] He exhorted that Pope Clement VIII instruct all English Catholics not to engage in violent rebellion, [...] "quiete et pacifice". [...] It was a message echoed by Archpriest George Blackwell, who commanded his priests never to attempt any such thing, but it proved controversial; early in summer 1605 Garnet reported to Rome that English Catholics had reached [...] "a stage of desperation".|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{considers}} [...] "Getting Better" [...] {{to contain}} [...] "the most <b>ebullient</b> performance" [...] on Sgt. Pepper. Womack credits the track's [...] "driving rock sound" [...] with distinguishing {{it from the}} album's overtly psychedelic material; its lyrics inspire the listener [...] "to usurp the past by living well and flourishing in the present". He cites it as a strong example of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, particularly Lennon's addition of the line [...] "couldn't get no worse", {{which serves as a}} [...] "sarcastic rejoinder" [...] to McCartney's chorus: [...] "It's getting better all the time". McCartney describes Lennon's lyric as [...] "sardonic" [...] and [...] "against the spirit of the song", which he characterises as [...] "typical John". MacDonald characterises the beginning of the track as [...] "blithely unorthodox", with two staccato guitars – one panned left and one right – playing the dominant against the subdominant of an F major ninth chord, with the tonic C resolving as the verse begins. The dominant, which acts as a drone, is reinforced through the use of octaves played on a bass guitar and plucked on piano strings. McCartney's bass line accents non-roots on the recording's downbeat.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called the episode a [...] "generally good program, though {{not one of}} the year’s best". Jacobson said he dislikes Marge's mother; [...] "she’s one of the series’ less interesting characters, which is probably why she appears so rarely." [...] However, he thinks Grampa is [...] "always fun", and [...] "it’s nice to see him in an <b>ebullient</b> mood, at least for a while." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade and said he is [...] "never terribly interested in episodes that revolve around [...] Simpson". He believes Grampa is [...] "great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage". He added: [...] "I'm also especially uninterested in episodes revolving around Marge's mother. Having said that, this episode does have a number of inspired moments—notably the subplot involving Bart's pursuit of an Itchy & Scratchy cel, as well as one of the series' many homages to The Graduate." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Homer's nightmare vision of Bart, Lisa and Maggie as ordinary kids is a highlight of this especially crazy—surreal jokes, flashbacks and dream sequences whizz by at an alarming rate—installment." ...|$|E
500|$|The ranchera track [...] "¿Qué Creias?" [...] {{speaks of}} a woman who angrily tells her lover off, {{reminding}} female listeners [...] "how men take them for granted." [...] The [...] "spirited mariachi kiss-off anthem" [...] lyrically follows an unapologetic woman who refuses to take back a cheating partner. Patoski found [...] "¿Qué Creias?" [...] to be peculiar to Selena's cumbia repertoire, finding it to have the [...] "markings of a traditional mariachi", bordering on [...] "an outright theft." [...] He further added that it showcased her [...] "lack of restraint" [...] emotive vocal range and [...] "spitting out lyrics with the gritty passion of a Lucha Villa", calling it [...] "all sass and fire." [...] The singer said in a July 1993 interview that the song [...] " [...] for all the ladies". The lyrics to [...] "Como la Flor" [...] are [...] "simple, plaintive melody and aching". They speak {{of a woman who}} witnessed her former lover with another woman and must move on; she wishes them the best, and compares her relationship with her ex-lover to a flower that has withered and died. [...] "Como la Flor" [...] is a [...] "catchy" [...] pop cumbia that depicts a [...] "lovelorn" [...] woman in a [...] "pleading vocal delivery" [...] to a [...] "lost-love". Author Deborah Paredez said that the song signaled Selena's [...] "self-assertion" [...] and found that fans associated the song with [...] "a multivalent emotional register and communal sensibility". Paredez found the recording to contain [...] "emotive chorus to <b>ebullient</b> choreography", and stated that it [...] "captures and conveys" [...] what Roland Barthes called [...] "the grain of Selena's voice". She further added that Selena's [...] "teardrop vocal chords" [...] are present in [...] "Como la Flor", adding that the recording contains a [...] "residue of materiality". Paredez said that, with its melodic shifts, [...] "Como la Flor" [...] successfully [...] "evokes Selena's presence in the elegy marking her absence".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Perala from Anchorage Daily News complimented the video, saying [...] "If {{you have}} a secret fondness for pop singer Madonna, {{you would want to}} check out her Ciao Italia, the singer's concert film from Italy. You can be pleasantly {{surprised}} at how amazing she is." [...] Heather Phares from Allmusic said: [...] "Madonna's Ciao Italia: Live From Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like 'Lucky Star', 'True Blue', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like a Virgin', and 'Material Girl'. A much simpler, less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like The Girlie Show World Tour, Ciao Italia is still entertaining in its own right, and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old-school Madonna hits." [...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual center of the universe last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. <b>Ebullient</b> and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation seem like an exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with Ciao Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly looked like something that was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. It felt as though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E
