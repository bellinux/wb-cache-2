5000|$|Millions of {{bees are}} transported {{each year to}} California {{and other parts of}} the country to {{pollinate}} crops such as almonds. Bee hives are driven cross country in a truck nonstop or with little break. Bees are severely stressed from confinement, heat, weather changes and sudden change in their daily tasks. While on the road for two to three days, it is difficult for the truck driver or the beekeeper to check on the temperature and food level in the hives. Proper nutrition of the bees is affected and there is high risk of bees starving to death on the road trip. One study points to impaired <b>food</b> <b>gland</b> development in migratory bees resulting in improper feeding of brood. North Carolina State University news states that providing bees access to huge amount of food while on road may ease stress due to transportation ...|$|E
50|$|Laying workers {{develop in}} the absence of open brood as {{produced}} by a healthy adult queen. Normally, pheromones from the brood - known as brood recognition pheromones - prevent development of the workers' ovaries. Laying workers can develop after the colony's queen has been lost to swarming, or {{in the presence of a}} failing queen which has yet to be superseded. The process of developing a laying worker usually takes weeks after the loss of the original queen. In adult laying workers there is an anatomic (and physiological) trade-off between the sizes of their more developed ovaries and their less developed <b>food</b> <b>glands.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{three factors}} that may influence the change in protein content {{and size of the}} brood <b>food</b> <b>glands</b> in honey bees. Effects on the mandibular gland, involved in the production of brood food and in royal jelly, have not been examined in relation to primer pheromones while effects on the hypopharyngeal glands, also involved in the production of brood food, have not been examined in relation to queen mandibular pheromone. This thesis provides preliminary insight into how these pheromones affect the extractable protein content of brood <b>food</b> <b>glands.</b> The first study in this thesis assessed the effects of brood pheromone (BP), queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), and pollen presence on the protein content of hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of the honey bee. In this study, newly emerged bees were caged for 12 days in one of eight treatments: Queenless state: 1) control (no pollen + no pheromone), 2) pollen, 3) BP, 4) BP + pollen; Queenright state: 1) QMP, 2) QMP + pollen, 3) BP + QMP, 4) BP + QMP + pollen. This study indicated that regardless of pheromone treatment, the most influential factor on gland protein content and size was pollen. The second experiment examined effects of varying pollen dilution on hypopharyngeal and mandibular gland protein content, bee mass, and lipid content of the honey bee. In this experiment, newly emerged bees were caged for 7 days and fed one of five treatments: pollen, 1 : 1 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol), 1 : 2 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol); 1 : 3 pollen: cellulose (vol:vol), and cellulose. This study indicated that bees on the pollen diet were significantly greater than all other diluted diets in measurements of hypopharyngeal gland protein content, lipid content, and mass with significantly less consumption. However, mandibular gland protein content of bees on the pollen diet was significantly greater only from pure cellulose...|$|R
5000|$|Several glands in {{the head}} secrete various substances, such as those {{responsible}} for the digestion of <b>food.</b> Another <b>gland</b> with{{in the head}} produces digestive and, in some species, alarm chemicals; these chemicals are used to alert nearby ants of impending danger, and any ant that detects this alarm will automatically go into [...] "battle mode". If an ant is crushed, a huge blast of this chemical is released, causing the entire colony to go into [...] "battle mode".|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{requirement}} of long distance transportation of honey bees used for pollination, we understand little how transportation affects honey bees. Three trials in three different states (CA, GA, and MI) were conducted to {{study the effects of}} long distance transportation on honey bee physiology. Newly emerged bees from one colony were split into two groups and introduced into a transported (T) colony or a stationary (S) colony in each trial. Volumes of hypopharyngeal gland acini in T colonies were significantly smaller than S colonies in all three trials. There {{were no significant differences between}} S and T colonies in juvenile hormone titers. Protein content in head showed no significant differences between S and T either in 7 -day-old or 17 -day-old bees of MI trial, but GA trial showed a significant reduction in bees experiencing transportation. Protein content in thorax was only measured in GA trial and was not significantly different between the two groups. Lipid content in abdomen was not significantly different between the S and T colonies in all three trials. This study suggests that bees experiencing transportation have trouble fully developing their <b>food</b> <b>glands</b> and this might affect their ability to nurse the next generation of workers...|$|R
40|$|The {{productivity}} of a bee colony depends upon many factors including good preparation of colony {{to the new}} season, sufficient stimulating feeding, controlling of bee diseases and enemies, and race of bees (Szabo and Mueller, 1996). The geographical races can be discriminated by morphomertrical differences and for an exact analysis of their characters (Gromisz and Przychodzen 1981). Bee glands {{play an important role}} in bees life particularly for food material products 9 Dade, 1962). The hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands produce important proteins rich food in honey bee works as royal jelly. The hypopharyngeal glands of old bees produced digestive enzymes for honey ripping process (Nour, 1986). The development and physiological activity of the <b>food</b> <b>glands</b> vary with the work of the bees, the glands being fully functional when the worker is serving in the hive as a nurse bee feeding larvae and queens (Snodgrass, 1956). Graham (1992) stated that healthy bees are able to perform their normal activities including bee milk, enzymes and venom products. Varroa mite infesting worker bees caused severe damage to hypopharyngeal, mandibular and head salivary glands (Zakaria, 2002). Measurements of the hypopharyngeal glands are often used to describe the physiological status of honey bee workers and consider arbitrary scale classification and have been estimated by different methods, such as acinus size (Wang and Moeller, 1971 & Hrassning and Crailsheim, 1998). Dwarf honey bees Apils florae was recorded and identified for the first time in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 1985, and it distributed in most parts of the country (Al Ghamdi, 2006) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheology}} {{of saliva}} affects the coating and lubrication of oral surfaces and {{the consistency of}} ingested <b>foods.</b> Salivary <b>gland</b> dys function can cause tissue damage and dysphagia. Therefore, we have considered the problem of designing a synthetic saliva for medical management. Also, we have measured certain rheological properties [shear-dependent viscosity fk) ] and the frequency-dependent moduli [G'(f) and r'(f) ] of normal stimulated whole saliva.

In addition, we have measured rheological properties of two commercial saliva substitutes for comparison...|$|R
40|$|The modern Japanese {{population}} favors soft foods, {{which do}} not demand extensive mastication. However, daily intake of soft foods is considered to have unfavorable influences on the mind and body. This is especially within the oral maxillofacial region. Consequently, many studies using experimental animals, feed a liquid or powdered diet and indicate that soft foods negatively affect the jaw bones, masseter muscle, and temporomandibular joint. Furthermore, since a report by Hall and Schneyer in 1964, the effects of soft <b>foods</b> on salivary <b>glands</b> have been under investigation. Soft food intake induces atrophic alteration to the parotid glands in adult animals. In these glands, shrinkage, suppression of proliferation, and apoptotic deletion of acinar cells were observed. In growing animals fed soft <b>foods,</b> parotid <b>gland</b> growth is inhibited through the suppression of an increase of acinar cell size and of acinar cell proliferation, but not through apoptosis. These findings support that unfavorable effects on parotid glands are induced by the intake of soft food regardless of growing or mature phases. However, different observations exist between these two phases. Despite accumulated knowledge on parotid glands, the debate whether soft food affects submandibular and sublingual glands remains controversial. It {{is the case that}} many studies agree soft food unfavorably affects parotid glands {{to a greater extent than}} submandibular and sublingual glands. This article reviews the histological effects of soft food on major salivary glands and introduces recent data from our research group...|$|R

2500|$|Demodex mites are {{acquired}} {{shortly after}} birth and {{considered to be}} normal skin fauna that increase in number as people age. Almost everyone has {{a certain degree of}} the Demodex mite on their skin. Heavy infestations of Demodex can arrive in adolescence, and could last up to middle age. The increase of their <b>food</b> supply (sebaceous <b>glands</b> proliferate during puberty) explains the increase of infestations of mites during adolescence. [...] Hair follicles in all adults are infested, but the distribution of mites varies, which has a different impact on each person. Men are often more likely to have heavier infestations than women because they have more sebaceous glands, thus producing more food for the mites.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that salivary gland development of avian species is related to diet (Grasee 1950, Pisanó & Barbieri 1967, Farner & Ziswiller 1972). Hence, grani-vorous birds that feed on dry food possess better devel-oped salivary glands than do rapacious species. On the other hand, in birds having access to naturally well-lubricated <b>foods,</b> the buccal <b>glands</b> show little develop-ment (Forstner 1978, McLelland 1979). Nevertheless, Avila et al. (1989) and Samar et al. (1987, 1988, 1993) have demonstrated a considerable develop-ment of buccal and lingual glands in the chick embryo and in the adult chicken. The same authors have de-scribed in the Lorikeet Myiopsitta monacha the presence of buccal glands with a well-structured conformation and intraepithelial acini within the tongue of this species (Samar et al. 1992). To analyse the existence of the buccal salivary glands and their probable functional role, an histological and cytochemical analysis was undertaken on two seabirds, the Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, which feeds on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Vigi...|$|R
40|$|The chronic mild stress (CMS) {{model has}} been used as an animal model of {{depression}} which induces anhedonic behavior in rodents. The present study was aimed to evaluate the behavioral and physiological effects of administration of P-carboline harmine in rats exposed to CMS Procedure. To this aim, after 40 days of exposure to CMS procedure, rats were treated with harmine (15 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. In this study, sweet <b>food</b> consumption, adrenal <b>gland</b> weight, adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) levels, and hippocampal brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were assessed. Our findings demonstrated that chronic stressful situations induced anhedonia, hypertrophy of adrenal gland weight, increase ACTH circulating levels in rats and increase BDNF protein levels. Interestingly, treatment with harmine reversed anhedonia, the increase of adrenal gland weight, normalized ACTH circulating levels and BDNF protein levels. Finally, these findings further support the hypothesis that harmine could be a new pharmacological tool for the treatment of depression. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Vitellogenin is a yolk {{precursor}} protein in most oviparous females. In the advanced eusocial honeybee, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae), vitellogenin has recently attracted much interest as this protein, {{in addition to}} a classical function in oocyte development in the reproductive queen caste, has evolved functions in the facultatively sterile female worker caste not documented in other species. However, research on the spatial dynamics of vitellogenin in various tissues is not easily performed with available tools. Here we present an immunogold staining procedure that visualizes honeybee vitellogenin in resin embedded tissue. To establish the protocol, we used ovaries of worker bees from colonies with and without a queen. Under the first condition, vitellogenin is assumed not to be present in the workers' ovaries. Under the second condition, the ovaries of worker bees become vitellogenic, with abundant opportunities for detection of complex patterns of vitellogenin uptake and storage. By use of this experimental setup, the staining method is shown to be both sensitive and specific. To demonstrate the functional significance of the protocol, it was subsequently used to identify vitellogenin protein in the hypopharyngeal <b>glands</b> (brood <b>food</b> producing head <b>glands)</b> of nursing worker bees and in adjacent head fat body cells for the first time. Localization of vitellogenin in these tissues supports previously hypothesized roles of vitellogenin in social behavior. This protocol thus provides deeper insights into the functions of vitellogenin in the honeybee...|$|R
40|$|In {{the ongoing}} debate about {{divergent}} evolutionary morphophysiological adaptations of grazing and browsing ruminants, {{the size of}} the salivary glands has received special attention. Here, we report the most comprehensive dataset on ruminant salivary glands so far, with data on the Glandula parotis (n = 62 species), Gl. mandibularis (n = 61), Gl. buccalis ventralis (n = 44), and Gl. sublingualis (n = 30). All four salivary gland complexes showed allometric scaling with body mass (BM); in all cases, the 95 % confidence interval for the allometric exponent included 0. 75 but did not include 1. 0 (linearity); therefore, like other parameters linked to the process of <b>food</b> intake, salivary <b>gland</b> mass appears to be correlated to metabolic body weight (BM 0. 75), and comparisons of relative salivary gland mass between species should rather be {{made on the basis of}} BM 0. 75 than as a percentage of BM. In the subsequent analyses, the percentage of grass (%grass) in the natural diet was used to characterize the feeding type; the phylogenetic tree used for a controlled statistical evaluation was entirely based on mitochondrial DNA information. Regardless of phylogenetic control in the statistical treatment, there was, for all four gland complexes, a significant positive correlation of BM and gland mass, and a significant negative correlation between %grass in the natural diet and gland mass. If the Gl. parotis was analyzed either for cervid or for bovid species only, the negative correlation of gland mass and %grass was still significant in either case; an inspection of certain ruminant subfamilies, however, suggested that a convergent evolutionary adaptation can only be demonstrated if a sufficient variety of ruminant subfamilies are included in a dataset. The results support the concept that ruminant species that ingest more grass have smaller salivary glands, possibly indicating a reduced requirement for the production of salivary tannin-binding proteins...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} aspects of emotional behaviour in two piebald and two non-piebald genotypes of hamster, to confirm anecdotal reports that piebald hamsters were more fearful than other types. Behavioural differences were hypothesized {{to relate to}} psychological functions and {{to be associated with}} the recessive piebald gene, thereby representing a major gene effect which could merit further investigation by a behavioural geneticist. Limitations on uses of the terms 'fear' and 'emotionality' were acknowledged, and evidence that they were unlikely to refer to unitary states was discussed. Genetic, maternal and sibling effects were controlled for, so that a single cross could produce the four genotypes in any litter. The hamsters were bred by a geneticist, Roy Robinson. On arrival at four weeks of age they were housed solitarily or in small groups for about three weeks when they were all isolated; experiments began at eight weeks of age. Behavioural and nonbehavioural tests, designed to measure emotionality, were based on previous work and a priori reasoning. They included reaction to handling, the open field, novel situation, activity, aggressive encounter, passive avoidance learning, and measures of body weight, <b>food</b> intake, adrenal <b>gland</b> weight, gastric ulceration and mortality. The results from the experiments were subjected to analyses of variance tests; significant genotype, sex and housing differences were discussed. It was concluded that hamsters carrying the piebald gene could be described as more emotional than golden or brown hamsters. although there was no consistent pattern shown by either sex or differentially housed hamster in terms of emotionality. The piebald hamster may thus provide a starting point for investigations into a gene-behaviour pathway. The data were compared with other rodent studies on emotionality and how findings contributed information as to whether fear was a unitary condition assessed. One type of organization responsible for emotionality could be studied in the piebald hamster and this may contribute more generally to literature on physiological and behavioural expressions of fear...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB 2 ̆ 7 s) are {{organochlorine}} molecules which find various {{industrial and}} product applications. PCB 2 ̆ 7 s are {{of concern to}} biologists because they are toxic substances which have become global contaminants. They are also of concern to biologists and analytical chemists because they interfere with the determination of some organochlorine pesticide residues. PCB 2 ̆ 7 s were discovered to be environmental contaminants after they showed up as unidentified peaks in pesticide analysis using gas-liquid chromatography with an electron capture detector (GLC-EC). In the present experiment standard GLC-EC techniques were used to assay PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in Daphnia experimentally contaminated in the laboratory and in crayfish from the Willamette River. Daphnia were placed in water containing 0. 1, 4, 50 or 100 parts per billion (ppb) PCB for 4 to 72 hours. There was no mortality {{in any of the}} experiments. The individual PCB compounds were apparently taken up equally, since relative peak heights were similar in the standard and the residues extracted from Daphnia. Final concentrations of PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in Daphnis ranged from 1200 times that of the water (at water concentrations of 100 ppb) to 104, 000 times that of water (at water concentrations of 0. 1 ppb). The lower concentrations used here approximate environmental PCB levels found in some areas of the U. S. and elsewhere. Assuming that chronic exposure to these lower concentrations would not strongly inhibit growth or reproduction of Daphnia,, the high biological magnification found here would suggest that Daphnia and related organisms may {{play an important role in}} the accumulation of PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in fresh water <b>food</b> webs. Digestive <b>glands</b> of crayfish taken from the Willamette River were analyzed for PCB 2 ̆ 7 s. Statistically significant regional differences were found in the concentrations of PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in these organisms in the lower Willamette Valley. Crayfish from the center of Portland have the highest residues (7 to 9 parts per million). A similar distribution has been previously reported for other urban areas. In the present investigation, however, the highest residues occurred in crayfish from the river at a point approximately in the center of the city itself, but two miles upstream from the major industrial areas. Thus, in this case, the major source of environmental contamination may have been released from manufactured goods (e. g., automobile tires, paints, etc.) rather than from industrial sewerage. ...|$|R
