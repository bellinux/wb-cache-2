5|$|Executives from Endemol, the {{production}} company for Big Brother worldwide, defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season {{premiere of the}} 11th season in America won its timeslot with year-to-year growth. Other comparisons noted was the finale of ninth season of Italy's Grande Fratello pulled 7.9 million viewers with a 36% audience share and how in Argentina the show has been rested {{for a few years}} and returns with stronger ratings. Paul Jonson, global head of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group, noted that using audience averages to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> show performs wouldn't work since the audience builds up until the finale. Jonson also noted that the series continued to rate very well when compared to the timeslot average for Channel 4.|$|E
500|$|Since {{its debut}} in 1992, the mystery of Agrippa {{remained}} hidden for 20 years. Although many had tried to hack the code and decrypt the program, the uncompiled source code was lost long ago. Alan Liu and his team at [...] "The Agrippa Files" [...] created an extensive website with tools and resources to crack the Agrippa Code. They collaborated with Matthew Kirschenbaum at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the Digital Forensics Lab, and Quinn DuPont, a PhD student of cryptography from the University of Toronto, in calling for the aid of cryptographers to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> program works by creating [...] "Cracking the Agrippa Code: The Challenge", which enlisted participants to solve the intentional scrambling of the poem in exchange for prizes.

500|$|Programming was {{assigned}} to Tod Frye, who was not provided with any arcade design specifications to work from, and had to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> game worked by playing it. The game uses a 4KB ROM cartridge, chosen for its lower manufacturing costs compared to 8KB cartridges, which had just become available at the time. After Atari acquired the rights to produce the game, Frye began work on a prototype version. The company wanted to release the prototype {{to capitalize on the}} 1981 holiday season. As with any contemporary arcade port, the simple Atari 2600 hardware was a considerable limitation. [...] The arcade PAC-MAN system board contained 2KB of main RAM (random-access memory) in which to run the program, 2KB of video RAM to store the screen state, and 16KB of ROM (read-only memory) to store the game code, whereas the Atari 2600 featured only 128 bytes of RAM memory and none dedicated to video: effectively 32 times less RAM. The Zilog Z80 CPU microprocessor used by the Namco Pac-Man arcade system is clocked at three times the speed of the MOS 6507 CPU in the Atari 2600, but the instruction sets and architecture for each processor are very different, and a 6507 can do more operations per clock cycle (effectively 2 to 1), making 1 to 1 comparisons more difficult than simply comparing clock speed.|$|E

500|$|Hnefatafl was {{a popular}} game in medieval Scandinavia and was {{mentioned}} {{in several of the}} Norse Sagas. [...] Some of these saga references have contributed to controversy over the possible use of dice in playing hnefatafl. [...] The rules of the game were never explicitly recorded, and only playing pieces and fragmentary boards are extant, so it is not known for sure how the game was played. [...] If dice were in fact used, nothing has been recorded about how they were employed. [...] Archaeological and literary sources indicate Hnefatafl may have been played on a 1313 or an 1111 board. It became a popular game in Northern Europe during the Viking era (end of the 8thCentury to 1000C.E), a turbulent time full of conflicts. When chess became a popular game during the Middle Ages, the rules of Hnefatafl were forgotten over time. Hnefatafl was particularly popular in Nordic countries and followed the Viking civilization to other parts of Europe, primarily to the British Isles and the Viking country of Gardarike. The game developed differently at different locations. [...] Archaeologists have found editions in places such as Ireland and Ukraine. Hnefatafl literally translates to [...] "fist table," [...] from the Old Icelandic (equivalently in modern Icelandic) hnef, 'fist', and tafl, 'table'. The study of medieval manuscripts and examination of pieces and boards has allowed researchers to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> game was probably played. It was last recorded to have been played in Wales during 1587 and Lapland in 1723.|$|E
