Guggenheim, who was skeptical at first, later saw the presentation for himself, stating that he was [...] "blown away," [...] and [...] "left after {{an hour and a}} half thinking that global warming [...] the most important issue... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> you’d make a film out of it, but I wanted to try," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{has stated}} that he became serious about {{creating}} and engineering his own electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he {{has stated that}} he felt comfortable with how R and Hip hop music integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, Letur-Lefr. PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone was recorded while Frusciante looked {{to find new ways}} to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, [...] "My Recent History," [...] he notes that [...] "Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to execute." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{working with}} Lovato on her third studio album, Unbroken, Ryan Tedder stated, [...] "Demi blew {{me out of}} the water vocally! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> good her voice is.

[...] He also commented on their work {{together}} on the song [...] "Neon Lights" [...] from Lovato's fourth studio album, saying, [...] "She, in pop music, has one of the biggest ranges, possibly the highest full voice singer I've ever worked with." [...] Tamsyn Wilce from Alter The Press commented on her vocals on Demi, stating [...] "it shows just how strong her vocal cords are and the variation of styles that she can completely work to make her own." ...|$|E

500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Tedder {{worked with}} Demi Lovato for her third studio album, Unbroken. When talking {{about working with}} Tedder on the song [...] "Who's That Boy" [...] during a Spotify session named [...] "About Unbroken", Lovato stated: [...] "He's a really funny and cool guy, we had a really great time in the studio." [...] Lovato commented that the track was [...] "personally one of my {{favorite}} songs of the album." [...] Furthermore, she added that she was [...] "excited to say I worked with such a talented songwriter and producer."

2500|$|By April 2009 Cosima De Vito was {{a sponsor}} for Girls with a Purpose, a program by charity organisation, Lifehouse Project, {{to address issues}} of concern for 13- to 18-year-old girls: [...] "body image, family {{conflict}} and coping with stress". In May De Vito lost her long running legal battle with former managers, Nellis and Gardner, and was ordered to pay Nellis $30,000, plus $7,000 legal fees. Supreme Court of New South Wales Justice Nigel Rein, ruled in the case, CN Presents Pty Ltd v De Vito [...] NSWSC 388, that De Vito should pay Nellis and stated, [...] "t does seem his work was minimal {{but it was his}} idea and he prepared a budget or proposal". The claim of $500,000 for breach of management contract or lost royalties was denied. In June De Vito told New Ideas Jenny Brown, [...] "It's been a huge challenge, emotionally and financially... I was very green. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> to put an album together, so I relied on my managers. I should have trusted my own instincts". During late 2009 to early 2010 she undertook a solo Tribute to the Divas show featuring work by Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Shirley Bassey, Whitney Houston and Celine Dion. De Vito has performed songs in Italian at festivals.|$|E

60|$|Another {{cause of}} our being {{sometimes}} apart, was, that I had naturally an interest in going over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood; while Steerforth, after being there once, had naturally no great interest in going there again. Hence, on {{three or four days}} that I can at once recall, we went our several ways after an early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> he employed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was close}} upon nine {{when he set}} out. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> long he might be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and {{skipping}} over the pages of Henri Murger's [...] "Vie de Bohème." [...] Ten o'clock passed, and I heard {{the footsteps of the}} maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh.|$|E

So you see that I should really be acting for the girl, and not for you, although of course it would amount to the same thing. And if Mother Anastasia has gone to pull down the curtain on this little drama, I am all the more anxious to jerk it up again.

6000|$|Then a fresh {{apprehension}} assailed me. Suppose Bellairs {{had given}} me the slip? Suppose he was now rolling {{on the road to}} Stallbridge-le-Carthew? or perhaps there already and laying before a very white-laced auditor his threats and propositions? A hasty person might have instantly pursued. Whatever I am, I am not hasty, and I was aware of three grave objections. In the first place, I could not be certain that Bellairs was gone. In the second, I had no taste whatever for a long drive at that hour of the night and in so merciless a rain. In the third, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> I was to get admitted if I went, and no idea what I should say if I got admitted. [...] "In short," [...] I concluded, [...] "the whole situation is the merest farce. You have thrust yourself in where you had no business and have no power. You would be quite as useful in San Francisco; far happier in Paris; and being (by the wrath of God) at Stallbridge-Minster, the wisest thing is to go quietly to bed." [...] On the way to my room I saw (in a flash) that which I ought to have done long ago, and which it was now too late to think of--written to Carthew, I mean, detailing the facts and describing Bellairs, letting him defend himself if he were able, and giving him time to flee if he were not. It was the last blow to my self-respect; and I flung myself into my bed with contumely.|$|E
60|$|The scales have turned, my {{sympathetic}} Harvard, and {{the beam}} that has lifted you up has dropped me again on this terribly hard spot. I’m extremely {{sorry to have}} missed you in London, but I received your little note and took due heed of your injunction {{to let you know}} how I got on. I don’t get on at all, my dear Harvard—I’m consumed with the love of the further shore. I’ve been so long away that I’ve dropped out of my place in this little Boston world and the shallow tides of New England life have closed over it. I’m a stranger here and {{find it hard to believe}} I ever was a native. It’s very hard, very cold, very vacant. I think of your warm rich Paris; I think of the Boulevard Saint-Michel on the mild spring evenings; I see the little corner by the window (of the Café de la Jeunesse) where I used to sit: the doors are open, the soft deep breath of the great city comes in. The sense is of a supreme splendour and an incomparable arrangement, yet there’s a kind of tone, of body, in the radiance; the mighty murmur of the ripest civilisation in the world comes in; the dear old peuple de Paris, the most interesting people in the world, pass by. I’ve a little book in my pocket; it’s exquisitely printed, a modern Elzevir. It consists of a lyric cry from the heart of young France and is full of the sentiment of form. There’s no form here, dear Harvard; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> little form there is. I don’t know what I shall do; I feel so undraped, so uncurtained, so uncushioned; I feel as if I were sitting in the centre of a mighty “reflector.” A terrible crude glare is over everything; the earth looks peeled and excoriated; the raw heavens seem to bleed with the quick hard light.|$|E
60|$|We left Monte Video in the afternoon. I {{intended}} {{to proceed to}} Colonia del Sacramiento, situated on the northern bank of the Plata and opposite to Buenos Ayres, and thence, following up the Uruguay, {{to the village of}} Mercedes on the Rio Negro (one of the many rivers of this name in South America), and from this point to return direct to Monte Video. We slept at the house of my guide at Canelones. In the morning we rose early, in the hopes of being able to ride a good distance; but it was a vain attempt, for all the rivers were flooded. We passed in boats the streams of Canelones, St. Lucia, and San Jos, and thus lost much time. On a former excursion I crossed the Lucia near its mouth, and I was surprised to observe how easily our horses, although not used to swim, passed over a width of at least six hundred yards. On mentioning this at Monte Video, I was told that a vessel containing some mountebanks and their horses, being wrecked in the Plata, one horse swam seven miles to the shore. In {{the course of the day}} I was amused by the dexterity with which a Gaucho forced a restive horse to swim a river. He stripped off his clothes, and jumping on its back, rode into the water till it was out of its depth; then slipping off over the crupper, he caught hold of the tail, and as often as the horse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its face. As soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side, the man pulled himself on, and was firmly seated, bridle in hand, before the horse gained the bank. A naked man on a naked horse is a fine spectacle; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> well the two animals suited each other. The tail of a horse is a very useful appendage; I have passed a river in a boat with four people in it, which was ferried across in the same way as the Gaucho. If a man and horse have to cross a broad river, the best plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel or mane, and help himself with the other arm.|$|E
