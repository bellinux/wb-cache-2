5|$|In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School {{opened a}} new music wing, and Holst {{composed}} St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and {{his family moved to}} a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E

[...] "It's <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> high register for me, so I just blasted it out one night after dinner. That's, like, 90 per cent of what's on the final track," [...] he told Kerrang!. The idea to include piano in the track came without much forethought; [...] "We realized, 'Well, this part here could sound rad if we put piano in here.' So we tried it out, and it sounded rad," [...] said Hoppus. The piano was performed by session musician Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., {{best known for his}} work with Beck.|$|E
500|$|After {{delivering}} more forces {{during the}} next month the Japanese mounted a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal, led by Hyakutake, in late October 1942 at the Battle for Henderson Field, but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese. Vandegrift later stated that Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge in September {{was the only time}} during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded, [...] "we would have been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> bad condition." [...] Historian Richard B. Frank adds, [...] "The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942, on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield, best known ever after as Bloody Ridge." ...|$|E

The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of [...] "kids us them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down." [...] Sinclair dismissed such concerns – [...] "I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these". Teenagers interviewed by The Guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while {{it was fun to}} drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.|$|E

GameSpy praised BioShock [...] "inescapable atmosphere", and Official Xbox Magazine lauded its [...] "inconceivably great plot" [...] and [...] "stunning soundtrack and audio effects." [...] The gameplay and combat system have been praised for being smooth and open-ended, and elements of the graphics, such as the water, were praised for their quality. It has been noted that the combination of the game's elements [...] "straddles so many entertainment art forms so expertly that it's the best demonstration yet how flexible this medium can be. It's no longer just another shooter wrapped up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> game engine, but a story that exists and unfolds inside the most convincing and elaborate and artistic game world ever conceived." ...|$|E
500|$|The canons were seldom {{used for}} the {{intended}} purpose. However, {{they were used to}} provide gun salute every year {{on the occasion of the}} birthday of Kamehameha III. Another notable daily event at the fort was the beating of the drums at dusk by guards as a signal (a curfew) to the sailors on land to go back to their ships. This practice is recorded in detail by Jones as: [...] "Seamen are obliged to be clear of the beach at drumbeat—eight o'clock in the evening. [...] No person is allowed to remain on shore over night, unless furnished with a proper pass by the captain of the port; and any one found on the beach, or in the town, with no pass, after the proper time, is marched to the calboose, where he is kept in confinement till morning, and then muleted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> round sum for breaking the laws. [...] This is generally paid by the captain, and afterward, with pretty good interest, deducted from Jack's pay." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stephen" [...] {{is a song}} {{composed}} in the dance-pop genre that also incorporates elements of country music. According to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of D major and the tempo moves at 100 beats per minute at a moderately fast rate. Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of E3 to the higher note of D5. The lyrics begin with Kesha singing [...] "Stephen, Stephen, why won't you call me?." [...] The song's lyrics depict {{the tale of the}} singer stalking her then crush, Stephen, who ultimately would not call the singer. [...] "Stephen" [...] opens with layered a cappella and vocoder harmonies, later transitioning into a dominantly driven pop song. According to the singer, [...] "Stephen" [...] showcases her more vulnerable side and encompasses humor throughout its lyrics: [...] "'Stephen' shows the vulnerable side of me but it's still a funny pop song. It's me saying I'm totally obsessive and in love with this guy, but he's blowing me off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> funny way." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode premiered to near {{universal}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave it 9.6/10, {{and thought}} it was [...] "one of the most balanced and well-executed episodes of the series, Fringe fans get action, suspense, emotion, and best of all, some revelations!... This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off. Pretty interesting stuff. It's nice to finally have a reason to point at for Walter's craziness".|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} of the game was its numerous technical glitches. Adam Diamond of Isthmus was {{not happy with the}} pathfinding, writing, [...] "I often found myself traveling solo through a dungeon, my companions spread out far behind me, leaving me vulnerable to attack. What's the point of having henchmen if they're not there to protect you?". [...] Some reviews compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to , a previous Obsidian game that had received similar complaints. The bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and [...] "downright infuriating", and one reviewer encountered a [...] "showstopper bug" [...] in the initial retail version that prevented him from playing the game past a certain point. The bugs were said to negatively affect NPC AI, camera operation, and pathfinding. One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared to wonder if the game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> messy state, and even after a couple patches (as of this writing), the biggest problems remain." ...|$|E
500|$|The review {{received}} barely a sentence from Walton of The Moving Picture News who stated it was: [...] "Good from A to Z." [...] The Moving Picture World offers little more, highlighting {{that the film}} would please children and offered a brief summary devoid of criticism or praise. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a much more substantial treatment of the subject and stated, [...] "This film, intended for juvenile patrons, has yet a charm for older spectators as well, because it tells a pretty story <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> way. ... The narrative is frankly impossible in plot, but that makes it no less entertaining to the youthful. A little make-believe is relished by the best of men. The acting of the wee heroine is really wonderful; it is spontaneous, lively, resourceful, graceful, and charming. The part of the rich girl, however, although it is capitally played, should have been entrusted to a smaller, if not to a younger, woman. The size of the actress makes the film look bizarre. The scenery {{is not all that}} might be desired, still it is passable." [...] The effect and usage of a living doll would be attempted again with The Spoiled Darling's Doll, apparently with better success than Delightful Dolly.|$|E

The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Mike Hale of the New York Times felt that [...] "Throwdown": [...] "emphasized the show's increasingly dual nature" [...] whereby [...] "the students are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good musical, and the adults are in a below-average dramedy." [...] Wendy Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly deemed the episode [...] "welcome light relief", while Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "perhaps Glees sharpest episode yet", describing it as [...] "chock-full of standout scenes". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.8/10, criticizing it for [...] "overly earnest, saccharine moments" [...] but commenting that it was a [...] "great example" [...] of Glee [...] "just being damn funny".|$|E
500|$|Ian Winwood {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five [...] "Ks" [...] for the British {{magazine}} Kerrang!, an [...] "excellent" [...] review. He called the music far more upbeat than Enter Shikari's serious message: [...] "This 11-song set is a good deal of fun to listen to, even if its lyrics' subject matters are the exact opposite." [...] Winwood also reviewed the album favourably for BBC Music, comparing its lyrics to The King Blues' Punk & Poetry and calling Enter Shikari [...] "the only other mainstream-breaching British rock band concerning itself with the news of the world". Johnny Firecloud gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating on CraveOnline: [...] "Enter Shikari have found a balance while honing a voice of rebellion – at a time where tearing down boundaries and microanalyzing the current structure is more vital and valuable than ever before in our lives." [...] Iain Moffat of The Fly said of the album that 'Disenchantment should always be this spellbinding.' In NME, Dan Martin gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating: [...] "All of that surface tension lands Enter Shikari <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> powerful position for their third – and, as the title promises fabulously, they respond to the challenge in explosive style to deliver something like their defining statement." [...] Rocksound writer Ryan Bird gave the album a nine-out-of-ten score, praising the band for their emotional cultural and sonic development and noting the importance of their message: [...] "In a world edging ever closer to complete and utter destruction, Enter Shikari remain fearless and uncompromising leaders in a field of one." ...|$|E
