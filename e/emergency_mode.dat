40|$|In {{distributed}} operation, {{each unit}} is operated by its local controller {{instead of using}} a centralized controller, which allows the action {{to be based on}} local information rather than global information. Most of the distributed solutions have implemented the consensus method, however, convergence time of the consensus method is quite long, while diffusion strategy includes a stochastic gradient term and can reach convergence much faster compared with consensus method. Therefore, in this paper, a diffusion strategy-based distributed operation of microgrids (MGs) is proposed using multiagent system for both normal and <b>emergency</b> operation <b>modes.</b> In normal operation, the MG system is operated by a central controller instead of the distributed controller to minimize the operation cost. If any event (fault) occurs in the system, MG system can be divided into two parts to isolate the faulty region. In this case, the MG system is changed to <b>emergency</b> operation <b>mode.</b> The normal part is rescheduled by the central controller while the isolated part schedules its resources in a distributed manner. The isolated part carries out distributed communication using diffusion between neighboring agents for optimal operation of this part. The proposed method enables peer-to-peer communication among the agents without the necessity of a centralized controller, and simultaneously performs resource optimization. Simulation results show that the system can be operated in an economic way in both normal operation and <b>emergency</b> operation <b>modes...</b>|$|R
