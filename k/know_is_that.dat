5|$|At Calakmul's {{peak in the}} 7th century, {{the polity}} was known as Kan. Interesting to <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the title Kan was used at another place before Calakmul became a {{regional}} powerhouse. The Preclassic political state in the Mirador Basin also used the title Kan. There is the idea that, {{after the collapse of}} the Mirador state, its refugees migrated north towards Calakmul, where they founded a new Kan polity. However, epigraphical studies of the monuments at Calakmul show that prior to the 7th century AD the emblem glyph of Calakmul had nothing to do with a snake, but with a bat. It seems that a different polity ruled there. The Kan emblem glyph, before being associated with Calakmul, is found (once) at Dzibanché, a site more towards the east. Perhaps during the late 6th/early 7th century, the polity at Dzibanché moved to Calakmul in order to establish a more strategically placed capital. After Calakmul's power dwindled in the 8th century, after the rule of Yuknoom Took K'awiil, it appears that the bat emblem glyph made its resurgence. Still, many uncertainties remain and new epigraphical studies have to be done to fill the gaps.|$|E

25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, {{who said that the}} raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but what we do <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is." [...] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: [...] "Well, honey, one thing we <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she's been poaching on my literary preserves." ...|$|E

500|$|Ecosocialists {{advocate}} for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism—an egalitarian economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill human needs—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability. Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in Nature: [...] "What every environmentalist needs to <b>know</b> ... <b>is</b> <b>that</b> capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, {{in order to create}} a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E

It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want to let people <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there are so many jobs out there. My thinking is, if you're a musician and you can make music instead of digging a ditch, make it." ...|$|E

500|$|During this period, Warner {{showed little}} {{foresight}} in {{his treatment of}} the studio's cartoon operation. [...] Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, [...] "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros." [...] As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, [...] "Jack Warner...considered cartoons {{no more than an}} extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers." [...] In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't [...] "even know where the hell the cartoon studio is", and Harry added, [...] "The only thing I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we make Mickey Mouse," [...] a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. [...] As Thomas noted, [...] "They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Bannister {{pronounced}} Hendrix dead, {{a hospital}} spokesperson told the press: [...] "We don't know where, how, or why he died, but {{he died of}} an overdose." [...] By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: [...] "Well, all I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival." [...] At 2 p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: [...] "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions {{as one of the}} most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead." [...] That evening, The New York Times described him as [...] "a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power. He spoke in gestures and big as he could imagine and create." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E
500|$|Tucci {{was one of}} {{the last}} actors cast; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before {{shooting}} started. The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned Barney's creative director Simon Doonan and E!'s Robert Verdi, both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators, for the part; the BBC's Graham Norton also auditioned. Verdi would later claim there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character (he would end up with a walk-on part as a fashion journalist in Paris). Tucci claims he was unaware of this: [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> someone called me and I realized this was a great part." [...] He based the character on various people he was acquainted with, insisting on the glasses he ultimately wore. Daniel Sunjata had originally read for Tucci's part, rather unenthusiastically since he had just finished playing a similar character, but then read the Holt part and asked if he could audition for it. Simon Baker auditioned by sending a video of himself, wearing the same self-designed green jacket he has on when he and Andrea meet for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E
