5|$|In 1939, a new {{radio network}} based at station WBN in Chicago, Illinois, begins its inaugural night. The station's owner, General Walt Whalen, depends on his {{employees}} to impress main sponsor Bernie King. This includes writer Roger Henderson, assistant director Penny Henderson (Roger's wife, seeking divorce), page boy Billy Budget, engineer Max Applewhite, conductor Rick Rochester, announcer Dexter Morris, director Walt Whalen, Jr. and stage manager Herman Katzenback. After King commissions rewrites {{on the radio}} scripts, the WBN writers get angry, adding to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been paid in weeks.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, {{the most}} senior non-commissioned ranks wear the 1957 version of the coat of arms as a badge of rank, {{representing}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> received the Queen's warrant (as opposed |to the Queen's commission for officers). The revised 1957 and 1994 Arms of Canada are both protected official government symbols used to represent the state under the Federal Identity Program. Permanent resident cards issued from 2015 feature a holographic representation of the 1957 version of the coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E

25|$|Three axioms presupposed by the {{scientific}} method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|As more {{information}} was uncovered about basal theropods and phylogenetic characteristics, modern paleontologists {{began to question}} the proper naming for this group. In 2005 paleontologist Paul Sereno rejected {{the use of the}} clade Megalosauridae due to its ambiguous early history in favor of the name Torvosauridae. Today, it is accepted that megalosaurids existed at least as a group of basal tetanurans, due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> more derived taxa than ceratosaurs and that the name Megalosauridae should represent this group. Megalosauridae also has priority over Torvosauridae under ICZN rules governing family names.|$|E

Crossings are the same on the whole island of Ireland, and are either of the old gated variant, or are automatic. Ireland does have automatic crossings that have full barriers, which are not seen in the UK. The audible alarms are unique to the country.|$|E

25|$|According to Shia theologians, infallibility is {{considered}} a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility {{is based on the}} Shia interpretation of the verse of purification. Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness. It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.|$|E
25|$|People who {{consent to}} a search, {{knowing full well}} that they possess contraband, {{generally}} consent because they are ignorant of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the right to decline permission to search. Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required to disclose to suspects that {{they have the right to}} decline a search. Even when a suspect does not give permission to search, police are often known to state in arrest affidavits and even provide sworn testimony that the suspect consented to the search, secure in the knowledge that a judge will normally weigh all questions of credibility in favour of law enforcement and against the accused.|$|E
25|$|Cortinarius badiolaevis is most {{similar to}} the species in the section Bovini, but they, for the most part, have darker flesh and larger spores. C.sordidemaculatus and C.neofurvolaesus are smaller-spored members of the section, but they have {{distinct}} veils, as well as spores measuring wider than 5 micrometers in width. Species in the section Uracei are distinguished by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a slightly metallic colouration. Section Brunnei contains species which produce spores which can both have a different shape and be more covered in warts. Mushrooms produced by species in both Uracei and Brunnei have darker flesh, even if only {{in the base of}} the stem and sport dark brown gills when mature.|$|E

25|$|As {{the souls}} that Sam {{is sent to}} {{apprehend}} have already died once (along with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> various paranormal abilities), an attempt to capture or even kill them by a mere mortal could prove almost impossible. The Devil provides Sam with vessels to help him do his work. The vessel is usually sent for Sam to open in a wooden box which varies in shape per episode, sometimes inappropriate for the vessel they hold (i.e. a large box contained a Zippo lighter vessel) and it's usually up to Sam {{to figure out how}} to use it to capture the escaped soul assigned for him to apprehend since the vessels don't usually come with an instruction manual. All vessels are unique because each of them is intended to capture the escaped soul for whom they were created and intended to confine. The vessel could even be a seemingly living thing (e.g. a live dove).|$|E
25|$|Halas's {{replacement}} was Jim Dooley. In Dooley's {{first season}} {{at the helm of}} the team, the Bears finished with a 7–7 record. The low point of the season, though, was not the mediocre performance but a career threatening knee injury to Gale Sayers, from which he never fully recovered. The decade though was highlighted with the 1969 season. After Sayers's injury, back-up running back Brian Piccolo did not believe he deserved the job because of the injury. Instead of running away with his opportunity as most athletes would, Piccolo, who was a popular figure in the Chicago area and roomed with Sayers for a few years on road trips, during the entire off-season pushed Sayers to get his knee back into football playing shape. Sayers got back into the lineup, and Piccolo was back on the bench when the season started. Sayers rushed for 1,000 yards and earned the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. This was the ultimate display of friendship between Piccolo and Sayers, who were friends despite race differences within society during the 1960s. The Bears finished the season, even with Sayers's performance, with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. The Bears' hopes worsened due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the No. 2 pick, while the Steelers have the first overall pick (with the Bears defeating them), allowing Pittsburgh to draft future Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw.|$|E
25|$|Short for {{electronic}} sports, are video game competitions played most by professional players individually or in teams that gained pupularity {{from the late}} 2000s, the most common genres are fighting, first-person shooter (FPS), multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) and real-time strategy. There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely one choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so {{that people in the}} area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. Major League Gaming (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been {{able to come up with}} different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With strategy games, players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.|$|E

Bower also added that Natasha and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) clash because Summer is a feminist who fights for causes, while Natasha is the opposite. Novakovic is fond of the love-hate relationship Natasha shares with Summer and said that they were [...] "frenemies." [...] She further explained, [...] "They're in the same social group at school, and despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> so many differences, they're similar in a lot of ways.

500|$|This story occurs {{some time}} after {{the events of the}} kinetic novel, as human civilization struggles in a losing battle against the {{poisonous}} rain. Three of the last inhabitants of a nearly abandoned underground fallout shelter—named Levi, Ruth, and Job—find a quaint old man collapsed in the snow outside the bunker. When they bring him down, they are surprised to hear the adults calling him [...] "Man of the Stars". The children grow quite interested about his strange nickname, as well as the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> never seen a visitor from the outside world. The old man recovers a bit and has the children help him in putting together a portable planetarium projector. This story offers an ultimate conclusion to the story in the kinetic novel.|$|E
500|$|The season {{introduces}} a new title graphic for the series, replacing {{the one that}} appeared {{for the first two}} seasons, as well as a new aircraft for the team called Zephyr One, designed by series visual effects vendor FuseFX. Glenn Hetrick again worked with the make-up and visual effects departments to design and create the more [...] "unique"-looking Inhumans, such as Lash, after having worked on Raina during season two. Willig's Lash make-up initially took 6 hours to apply, but the make-up team was able to reduce the time to 4.5 hours. Before a new Inhuman character can be introduced, the cost of creating their powers must be weighed, with Bell saying, [...] "Can we afford to produce this effect? Because every time last year Gordon [...] we went, 'Wow, that was [...]'" [...] For the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents' costumes, series costume designer Ann Foley made sure to reflect the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> [...] "graduated from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to the more precise militaristic outfit they always imagined they were." ...|$|E

500|$|The socio-linguistic {{situation}} of Tamil is characterised by diglossia: {{there are two}} separate registers varying by socioeconomic status, a high register and a low one. Tamil dialects are primarily differentiated from each other by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. For example, the word for [...] "here"— in Centamil (the classic variety)—has evolved into [...] in the Kongu dialect of Coimbatore, inga in the dialect of Thanjavur, [...] and [...] in some dialects of Sri Lanka. Old Tamil's [...] (where [...] means place) {{is the source of}} [...] in the dialect of Tirunelveli, Old Tamil [...] is the source of [...] in the dialect of Madurai, [...] and [...] in various northern dialects. [...] Even now, in the Coimbatore area, it is common to hear [...] "" [...] meaning [...] "that place". Although Tamil dialects do not differ significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in Sri Lanka retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India, and use many other words slightly differently. The various Tamil dialects include Central Tamil dialect, Kongu Tamil, Madras Bashai, Madurai Tamil, Nellai Tamil, kumari Tamil in India and Batticaloa Tamil dialect, Jaffna Tamil dialect, Negombo Tamil dialect in Sri Lanka. Sankethi dialect in Karnataka has been heavily influenced by Kannada.|$|E
500|$|Ant-mimicking spiders face several challenges: they {{generally}} develop slimmer abdomens and false [...] "waists" [...] in the cephalothorax {{to mimic the}} three distinct regions (tagmata) of an ant's body; they wave the first pair of legs {{in front of their}} heads to mimic antennae, which spiders lack, and to conceal the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> eight legs rather than six; they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that {{they generally}} have eight simple eyes, while ants have two compound eyes; they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants. In some spider species, males and females mimic different ant species, as female spiders are usually much larger than males. Ant-mimicking spiders also modify their behavior to resemble that of the target species of ant; for example, many adopt a zig-zag pattern of movement, ant-mimicking jumping spiders avoid jumping, and spiders of the genus Synemosyna walk on the outer edges of leaves {{in the same way as}} Pseudomyrmex. Ant-mimicry in many spiders and other arthropods may be for protection from predators that hunt by sight, including birds, lizards and spiders. However, several ant-mimicking spiders prey either on ants or on the ants' [...] "livestock", such as aphids. When at rest, the ant-mimicking crab spider Amyciaea does not closely resemble Oecophylla, but while hunting it imitates the behavior of a dying ant to attract worker ants. After a kill, some ant-mimicking spiders hold their victims between themselves and large groups of ants to avoid being attacked.|$|E
500|$|A {{relatively}} new rivalry, this one {{dates to the}} 2005 NFC Championship Game, in which the Seahawks won the game 31-14. The rivalry started up again in 2012, when the Panthers lost a close regular season home game to a Seattle Seahawks team led by rookie QB Russell Wilson, 16-12. [...] In the 2013 season, the Panthers opened the season at home versus Seattle. [...] They again lost a close game, with the final score 12-7. [...] The Seahawks {{would go on to}} win Super Bowl XLVIII. [...] In the 2014 season, once more at Bank of America Stadium, the Seahawks defeated the Panthers in week eight, 13-9. [...] In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle in Seattle, notorious for being a tough opposing field to play in, and lost 31-17. [...] The Seahawks would go on to lose Super Bowl XLIX. In the 2015 season the next year, the teams faced off in Seattle, where the Panthers won another close game, 27-23. [...] In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle at Bank of America stadium, where they had yet to beat a Russell Wilson led Seahawks team. [...] By halftime they led 31-0, but the Seahawks rebounded and scored 24 unanswered points before the Panthers were able to seal the victory, 31-24. [...] The Panthers would go on to lose Super Bowl 50. [...] In the 2016 season, the teams met in Seattle, where the Panthers were beaten 40-7. Since the 2012 season, Carolina is [...] overall against Seattle and [...] in the playoffs. [...] The rivalry aspect stems from how close the majority of the matches have been and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> played each other seven times between 2012 and 2017—at least once a year. [...] Unless they meet in the playoffs, the teams will not face each other during the 2017 season.|$|E
