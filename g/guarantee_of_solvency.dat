40|$|A popular {{narrative}} amongst European policymakers is that Eurozone members facing {{problems in}} the bond market are {{paying the price for}} past budgetary excess. Fiscal consolidation in these countries is seen as the principal remedy for the crisis. It is clear however that Ireland’s problems derive mainly from a banking bust exacerbated by weaknesses in the design of Europe’s monetary union and the policy response of both the Irish authorities and the European Central Bank. From the Euro’s inception in 1999 up to 2007, both debt and deficit ratios in Ireland were comfortably within the Stability and Growth Pact ceilings. The gross debt ratio was only 25 % of GDP at the end of 2007. The Stability and Growth Pact was the only macroprudential measure in place at Eurozone level, and Irish adherence reflected public finances flattered by a credit-fuelled property bubble. The banks experienced intense liquidity pressures in September 2008 and the Irish government provided a blanket liability guarantee. The banks were in reality badly insolvent, the bank guarantee has cost 40 % of GDP and Ireland was forced from the bond market and into an EU/IMF programme just over two years later. There can be no presumption that it will emerge, and re-enter the bond market, on schedule at the end of 2013. This paper argues that the incomplete design of the currency union, with free capital movement and trans-border banking, but no centralised banking policy, contributed to the Irish debacle. The absence of bank resolution and any centralised system of liability insurance threw the burden of bank rescue on sovereigns. Countries in currency union are vulnerable to sovereign default, since they must borrow in what is, in effect, a foreign currency. Resort to official lenders enjoying seniority, combined with ECB insistence on sovereign repayment of bank senior bondholders, even in banks insolvent many times over, has undermined confidence in Irish sovereign debt. Closer fiscal union may prove necessary if the Eurozone is to survive. To avoid future sovereign debt crises, there is also a need for centralised bank supervision and resolution, as well as for a centralised system of liability insurance for banks. What happened in Ireland shows that sticking to purely fiscal rules is no <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> for the sovereign in a currency union with inadequate mechanisms for the prevention and resolution of banking crises...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a critique <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> regulation such as imposed on banks by Basel I and II. It argues that banks seeking to maximize {{rate of return}} on risk-adjusted capital (RORAC) aim at an optimal level <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> because on the one hand, solvency S lowers the cost of refinancing; on the other, it ties costly capital. In period 1, exogenous changes in mean returns dµ and in volatility occur, causing optimal adjustments dS * / dµ and dS * / ds in period 2. Since banks reallocate their assets with certain µ and s values in response to the changed solvency level, an endogenous trade-off with slope dµ / ds results in period 3. Both Basel I and II are shown to modify this slope, inducing at least some banks to opt for a higher value of s in certain situations. Therefore, this type <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> regulation can prove counter-productive...|$|R

40|$|The equity {{portfolio}} selection {{problem is the}} subject of a substantial literature. Though equally important in practice, the optimization problem for a fixed-income portfolio, which may contain corporate and government bonds, industrial loans and credit derivatives such as credit swaps, is less well-understood. The fixed-income portfolio problem presents unique challenges: the risk of issuer default induces skewed return distributions, the correlation of defaults significantly influences portfolio returns, and credit derivative positions have complex risk/return implications. This paper formulates and solves the static selection problem for a fixed-income portfolio. It proposes to optimize the portfolio mark-to-market profit or loss at the investment horizon, which incorporates the premium and default cash flows of long and short cash and derivative positions, and the survival-contingent market value of these positions at the horizon. The selection problem is cast as a polynomial goal program that involves a two-stage constrained optimization of preference weighted moments of the portfolio mark-to-market. The decision variable is the vector of contract notionals. A capital constraint <b>guarantees</b> the <b>solvency</b> <b>of</b> the portfolio manager during the investment period. The multi-moment formulation takes account of the non-normal distribution of the portfolio mark-to-market. It also leads to a computationally tractable problem for the large portfolio...|$|R
