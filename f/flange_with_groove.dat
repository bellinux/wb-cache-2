40|$|The {{evolution}} of snakes (Squamata: Serpentes) represents a major transition in squamate reptiles and involves extensive modifications {{in the body}} plan. Functional morphology and phylogeny are integrated to discuss adaptive morphological traits in the origin of snakes and in the {{evolution of}} the venom-injecting apparatus among lizards, which is convergent with that in snakes. The focus of these analyses is to determine how to best optimize morphological traits on the phylogeny and to use character distribution in terminal taxa to estimate ecological adaptation in ancestral nodes. To study the locomotion transition from lizards to snakes, 45 virtual models of the squamate bony labyrinth in the inner ear were reconstructed. The results show morphological diversifications of the vestibular region among burrowers, generalists and marine swimmers. The vestibule is enlarged in fossorial species, and reduced in marine snakes and the marine lizard Platecarpus coryphaeus. To quantify the morphological differences and provide tractable methods to reconstruct locomotion in ancestral snakes, I performed three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of the 45 samples, using six landmarks and 22 semilandmarks. ANOVA tests on the Procrustes coordinates supported differences among fossorial, generalist, and aquatic locomotion categories. Phylogenetic signal was insignificant in the Procrustes coordinates. Using a phylogeny with the 44 extant samples as terminal taxa, I reconstructed shape coordinates of all internal nodes. Reconstructed shape of the vestibular region of key ancestral nodes in snakes preferred a terrestrial origin for crown-group snakes. Morphological proxies used in this study can be applied to stem snakes to estimate locomotion. Methodologically, this study provides a novel approach to resolve the question whether snakes become limbless on land or in the oceans. Evolution of the venom-injection apparatus in lizards is discussed, based on new material of Estesia mongoliensis. A total-evidence phylogenetic analysis of anguimorph lizards is performed with 86 anguimorph taxa coded to 435 morphological characters and four genes. The matrix includes eight new morphological characters. The total-evidence phylogeny suggests that Estesia Mongoliensis is a basal monstersaur whose crown groups are Heloderma, the only living venomous lizards. Presence of tooth <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> venom <b>grooves</b> is recognized as a new monstersaurian synapomorphy in this study. Estesia mongoliensis has venom grooves comparable to extant Heloderma, but has a deeper root-to-tip groove in the caudal tooth carina, revealing morphological variations of lizard venom delivery apparatus that are not recorded in extant species...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{involved}} the parametric analysis of bolted flange connections of eighteen different circular monopoles. The parameters considered were {{the number of}} bolts (8, 6, and 4) and thickness of flange plate [25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.), 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) ]. These were analyzed under stiffened and unstiffened conditions. Four, two and four stiffeners, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick, were used with 8 -, 6 - and 4 -bolt arrangements. Each finite element model {{is made up of}} a small diameter (171. 5 mm) circular pipe and a large diameter (327 mm) circular pipe both welded to circular flanges. The outer and inner diameters of the flange plates were 327 mm and 171. 5 mm respectively. Each bolt was 25. 4 mm (1 in.) diameter and was pretensioned to 227 kN (51 kips); and an external load of 45 kN (10 kips) was applied at the free end of the monopole, 1804 mm (71 in.) from the bolted joint, in the Riks analysis load step of ABAQUS (version 6. 3) computer program. From the finite element analysis, it was found that monopoles (8 bolts, 6 bolts and 4 bolts) with unstiffened 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick flange plates experienced a large deformation because of the thin flange plate. Optimum solutions to stiffened and unstiffened connections were found to be among those monopoles with minimal gap, deflection and deformation, i. e., 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for unstiffened case; and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 8 bolts, 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for stiffened case. In addition to the parametric study, T-Stub and yield line analytical procedures were also presented with examples; and {{it was found that the}} analytical methods provide good preliminary guidance regarding connection parameters when designing bolted flange connections for circular monopoles.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new metal forming process for producing two-step external flanges on hollow parts. With this method, the flange is extruded by a movable sleeve, which {{moves in the}} opposite direction to the punch. This reduces the phenomenon of buckling of the tube wall, which allows extruding <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> relatively large volumes. The new method was applied to produce a two-step flange {{on the end of a}} tubular billet made of 6060 aluminum alloy. This cold metal forming process was designed based on numerical simulations and experimental tests. The effect of the basic technological parameters on metal flow was investigated and limitations of the process were identified. The experimental results confirmed the possibility of forming a two-step <b>flange</b> <b>with</b> a diameter that is approximately twice as big as the external diameter of the tubular billet...|$|R

30|$|The entire {{setup is}} housed in a four-fold {{differentially}} pumped vacuum chamber. The four chambers, {{described in more detail}} in the next sections, are a source chamber, a chamber housing the guides, a chamber where the collisions are detected, and a chamber to characterise the two molecular beams. Source and guide chamber are constructed using ISO-F and ISO-K type <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> Viton or other rubber gaskets. The last two use CF <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> copper gaskets. The adapter tube to make the transition between these standards is also the one that provides the kink, which is necessary because of the bend in the guides. A commercial half-nipple <b>with</b> an ISO-F <b>flange</b> was welded to a CF <b>flange</b> <b>with</b> a 10 -degree tilt between the flange faces. This separation in two standards was chosen for simplicity (and cost), and because other than continuity {{there is no reason to}} use the CF standard on a source chamber where the pressure during operation usually lies above 10 − 5 mbar. Our target pressure for the guide and collision chambers was in the range of 10 − 8 mbar. Even in that range no significant losses are to be expected from collisions of guided molecules with background gas. Bake-out of the apparatus is not only not required, it also is not possible because the permanent magnets must be expected to start demagnetising at temperatures above ≈ 60 °C.|$|R

The music examples were 100 samples from 5 distinct music styles, which were all unfamiliar to the listeners. Listeners’ ratings of <b>groove</b> were correlated <b>with</b> aspects of rhythmic patterning for Greek, Indian, Samba, and West African music.
