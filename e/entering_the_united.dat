5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E

From 1929, the United States Public Health Service used Zyklon B to disinfest freight trains and clothes of Mexican immigrants <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Uses in Germany included delousing clothing (often using a portable sealed chamber invented by Degesch in the 1930s) and disinfesting ships, warehouses, and trains. By 1943, sales of Zyklon B accounted for 65 per cent of Degesch's sales revenue and 70 per cent of its gross profits.|$|E

On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel.

5|$|From 1927 {{through to}} 1946 {{he worked as}} the Abercromby Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, and then from 1947 to 1957 as {{director}} of the Institute of Archaeology, London. During this period he oversaw excavation of a number of archaeological sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland, focusing in particular on the society of Neolithic Orkney by excavating the settlement of Skara Brae and the chambered tombs of Maeshowe and Quoyness. Throughout, he continued to publish prolifically, producing excavation reports, journal articles, and books. With Stuart Piggott and Grahame Clark he co-founded The Prehistoric Society in 1934, becoming its first president. Remaining committed to his socialist ideals, he embraced Marxism, and used Marxist ideas as an interpretative framework for archaeological data. He also became a noted sympathiser with the Soviet Union and visited the country on a number of occasions, although grew sceptical of Soviet foreign policy following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. His beliefs resulted in him being legally barred from <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, despite being repeatedly invited to lecture there. Upon retirement, he returned to Australia's Blue Mountains, there committing suicide.|$|E

Cornette did not reveal when the tournament would be held or who would be involved. On the May1 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced that the tournament was planned for the summer. In mid-May, {{it was reported that}} New Japan Pro Wrestling was sending Milano Collection A.T. and Taichi Ishikari to be featured in the tournament. TNA was also interested in bringing in British wrestler Doug Williams. Averno, Rey Bucanero, Último Guerrero, Volador Jr., Naruki Doi, and Masato Yoshino were revealed at the end of May to be involved. In June, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that Daivari, Tyson Dux, Williams, and Alex Koslov would make up Team International, while Averno, Bucanero, Guerrero, and Volador Jr. would be Team Mexico, and Team Japan would consist of Milano Collection AT, Ishikari, Doi, and Yoshino. The finals of the tournament were also planned to be held at TNA's Victory Road pay-per-view (PPV) event on July13. It was announced on the June19 episode of Impact! that the finals would be contested in an Ultimate X match. Team Mexico had trouble <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, resulting in the tournament starting without them and the team appearing late in the festivities. Team TNA was revealed on the June12 episode of Impact!, with Kaz as the team captain and Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, and Curry Man rounding out the team. Despite the report by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Ishikari did not compete in the tournament; instead, Puma filled out Team Japan.|$|E

5|$|When Kurt Waldheim {{was named}} {{secretary-general}} of the United Nations in 1971, Wiesenthal reported—without checking very thoroughly—that {{there was no evidence}} that he had a Nazi past. This analysis had been supported by the opinions of the American Counterintelligence Corps and Office of Strategic Services when they examined his records right after the war. However, Waldheim's 1985 autobiography did not include his war service following his recuperation from a 1941 injury. When he returned to active duty in 1942, he was posted to Yugoslavia and Greece, and had knowledge of murders of civilians that took place in those locations during his service there. The Austrian news magazine Profil published a story in March 1986—during his campaign for the presidency of Austria—that Waldheim had been a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The New York Times soon reported that Waldheim had failed to reveal all of the facts about his war service. Wiesenthal, embarrassed, attempted to help Waldheim defend himself. The World Jewish Congress investigated the issue, but the Israeli attorney general concluded that their material was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Waldheim was elected president in July 1986. A panel of historians tasked with investigating the case issued a report eighteen months later. They concluded that, while {{there was no evidence that}} Waldheim had committed atrocities, he must have known they were occurring, yet did nothing. Wiesenthal unsuccessfully demanded that Waldheim resign. The World Jewish Congress successfully lobbied to have Waldheim barred from <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
