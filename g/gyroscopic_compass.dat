5|$|The {{ships of}} the San Giorgio class were {{designed}} as improved {{versions of the}} Pisa-class design. San Marcos design featured several new innovations that differentiated her from her sister ship San Giorgio. San Marco was given the first steam turbines fitted in a large Italian ship {{and she was the}} first turbine-powered ship in any navy to have four shafts, the first with a <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compass,</b> the first with antiroll tanks, and the first not to use wood in any way.|$|E
500|$|The San Giorgio {{class was}} ordered almost {{immediately}} after the preceding [...] ships, and was an improved version of that design. The forecastle was extended to improve seaworthiness, turret armor was increased, habitability was improved and the propulsion machinery was redistributed. San Marco was given the first steam turbines fitted in a large Italian ship for comparative purposes with San Giorgio, which retained the traditional vertical triple-expansion steam engines (VTE). San Marco was a very innovative ship as {{she was the first}} turbine-powered ship in any navy to have four propeller shafts, the first with a <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compass,</b> the first with antiroll tanks, and the first not to use wood in any way.|$|E
60|$|And {{presently}} {{over the}} cloud-banks that lay above Westphalia and Saxony the swift aeroplane, with its atomic engine as noiseless as a dancing sunbeam and its phosphorescent <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compass,</b> flew like an arrow {{to the heart}} of the Central European hosts.|$|E
50|$|Sperry in Britain {{started with}} a factory in Pimlico, London in 1913, {{manufacturing}} <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compasses</b> for theRoyal Navy. It became the Sperry Gyroscope Co Ltd in 1915. In 1923, Lawrence Sperry {{was killed in an}} air crash near Rye, Sussex. The company subsequently expanded to the Golden Mile, Brentford in 1931, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire in 1938, and Bracknell in 1957. By 1963, these sites employed some 3,500 people. The Brentford site closed in 1967, with the expansion of Bracknell. Stonehouse closed around 1969. By 1969, the Sperry Gyroscope division of Sperry Rand Corporation employed around 2,500.|$|R
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compasses.</b> Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|R
5000|$|In 1900 Sperry {{established}} an electrochemical laboratory at Washington, D.C., {{where he and}} his associate, Clifton P. Townshend, developed a process for making pure caustic soda and discovered a process for recovering tin from scrap metal. Sperry experimented with diesel engines and <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compasses</b> and <b>gyroscopic</b> stabilizers for ships and aircraft. Perry's work eventually resulted in a gyroscope that could replace the magnetic compass. In 1910 he founded the Sperry Gyroscope Company in Brooklyn, New York {{on the basis of this}} innovation. His first navigational gyroscope was tested that same year in [...] During both world wars, Sperry's company profited from military demand for gyroscopes. His technology was used in torpedoes, ships, airplanes, and spacecraft. Sperry moved into related devices such as bombsights, fire control, radar, and automated take off and landing.|$|R

50|$|Between {{the wars}} he trialled the first <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compass</b> for {{aircraft}} in the RAF and became Air Attaché to Turkey in the run up to the Second World War. In January 1940 returned to the Air Ministry as Deputy Director of Intelligence.|$|E
40|$|At {{the behest}} of Angus L. Macdonald, the Minister of National Defence for Naval Services, John Joseph Connolly {{conducted}} a secret investigation in October 1943 into the state of equipment on Canadian warships. Connolly, who was Macdonald’s executive assistant, traveled to St. John’s, Londonderry and London where he discovered that the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was far behind its allies in the modernization of its escort fleet. Canadian ships lacked <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compasses,</b> hedgehog, effective radar and asdic, {{as well as other}} technical gear that was essential in the Battle of the Atlantic. These deficiencies should not have come as a surprise. Inadequate equipment on RCN ships had already become obvious during the intense convoy battles of 1941, and had been confirmed yet again by those of 1942. Insufficient training and manning policies also played their part in Canadian problems at sea. However, it was to be the technical aspects that Macdonald focused upon once Connolly returned from overseas, leading not only to a disruptive feud with the naval staff, but also, in their way, to the eventual replacement of Vice Admiral Percy W. Nelles as the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) in January 1944...|$|R
5000|$|Measuring the {{inclination}} of a wellbore (its {{deviation from the}} vertical) is comparatively simple, requiring only a pendulum. Measuring the azimuth (direction {{with respect to the}} geographic grid in which the wellbore was running from the vertical), however, was more difficult. In certain circumstances, magnetic fields could be used, but would be influenced by metalwork used inside wellbores, as well as the metalwork used in drilling equipment. The next advance was in the modification of small <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compasses</b> by the Sperry Corporation, which was making similar compasses for aeronautical navigation. Sperry did this under contract to Sun Oil (which was involved in a lawsuit as described above), and a spin-off company [...] "Sperry Sun" [...] was formed, which brand continues to this day, absorbed into Halliburton. Three components are measured at any given point in a wellbore in order to determine its position: the depth of the point along the course of the borehole (measured depth), {{the inclination}} at the point, and the magnetic azimuth at the point. These three components combined are referred to as a [...] "survey". A series of consecutive surveys are needed to track the progress and location of a wellbore.|$|R
5000|$|On March 22, 1941 Ambra {{together}} with [...] and [...] {{was sent to}} patrol along Alexandria - Cape Krio line and arrived in her assigned area on March 24, 1941. The submarines deployed as a defensive screen for the Operation [...] "Gaudo", an anticipated sortie by the Italian fleet into the Aegean which would end with a catastrophe in the Battle of Cape Matapan. On March 27, 1941 Ambra discovered that her hydrophones did not work. At 2:37 on March 31, 1941she sighted a large escorted ship moving at an estimated speed of 10 knots. At 2:44 she launched three torpedoes at the target and remained on the surface to observe the results. Two torpedoes hit the ship in the middle, and Arillo, in the dark, assumed he had torpedoed a large tanker. The ship hit was actually British light cruiser [...] escorting convoy GA8 from Greece to Alexandria along with destroyers , [...] and [...] Hit in both of her engine rooms [...] quickly sank within five or six minutes in the position [...] with 139 casualties and 310 survivors. After observing the success of her attack, Ambra moved away. While [...] was rescuing the survivors, , who was missed by the third torpedo, detected Ambra with ASDIC and commenced a series of depth charge attacks against the submarine. [...] soon joined in, and attacks lasted for several hours until approximately 6:30. The submarine suffered damage {{to a variety of}} her equipment, including both <b>gyroscopic</b> and magnetic <b>compasses.</b> Once the escorts moved away, Ambra surfaced and using Celestial Navigation made her way back to Augusta. Captain Arillo received Silver Medal of Military Valor for his performance during this patrol.|$|R

50|$|Aramis {{reached the}} Marine Basin {{late on the}} 28th and shifted to Seabury's Shipyard, Morris Heights, on 5 March. She {{remained}} there into April undergoing repairs and shifted to the New York Navy Yard on the 9th. On 16 May, while the ship was at Section Base No. 6, Bath Beach, Brooklyn, Rear Admiral Usher and Captain Louis de Steiguer inspected the ship. On 21 June, while the ship was undergoing a refit at Shewan's Shipyard, Brooklyn, Elmer A.

50|$|S. G. Brown Ltd was {{established}} in 1903 by British engineer Sidney George Brown, to manufacture scientific instruments, its best known product was the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>compass.</b> When World War II started, {{in order to increase}} the company's productive capacity, the Admiralty financed an extension to the factory which the company ran on the Admiralty's behalf. By 1940, relations between the company and the Admiralty had become strained. The reason for the deterioration in the relations between the company and the Admiralty was a conflict over war-time priorities and the unwillingness of the company to carry out the Admiralty's wishes.At the end of the war, the Labour Government retained control because of the importance of gyroscopic instruments in the development of postwar defence programmes.|$|E
