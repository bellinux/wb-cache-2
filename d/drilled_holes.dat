5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E

The authors found the tibias in the small <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> group (5 -mm <b>drill</b> <b>holes)</b> had more cycles to failure and a greater load to failure in the groups with Steinmann pin reconstruction. They found no such difference between pin reconstruction and no-pin reconstruction when 10 -mm <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> were placed into the intact portion of the proximal tibia.

40|$|While <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> it is {{extremely}} important that the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> are <b>drilled</b> as straight as possible. Even with the advances in drilling technology over the years it is still almost impossible. This is especially the case as the drilling depth increases. <b>Drill</b> <b>hole</b> deviation is affected {{by a variety of}} factors including drilling techniques such as weight on bit (WOB) or drill string diameter and rock properties such as density and crystal structure. It is important to study the deviation of the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> to ensure that the borehole is aligned correctly. When there is deviation within a boreholes major negative consequences can occur. This thesis describes the results from deviation measurements of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> from two different drifts within the ore body ”Alliansen” in the LKAB mine in Malmberget (MUJ). In the first drift, the production <b>holes</b> were <b>drilled</b> with a 115 mm drill bit, and in the second a drill bit of 105 mm. This is based on a project “Klenare borrhål” initiated by LKAB Wassara, a subsidiary of LKAB. LKAB Wassara wished to evaluate a possible reduction of <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> diameter from the current 115 mm, to 105 mm. If the project had positive outcome, further attempts with an even smaller borehole diameter of 89 mm would be tested. There will also be curvature measurements as part of the evaluation of Wassaras new drill hammer, W 90. The results of the measurements show that the average deviation of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> with a larger diameter drill bit had much higher deviation than for the smaller diameter <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> with a smaller drill bit...|$|R

25|$|In addition, the Geotechnical Commission of the Swedish State Railways {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the cause of the accident, albeit from a geological perspective. The embankment had been built on top of several layers of clay and gravel deposited there during the Ice Age. The commission <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> to the bedrock in a number of places. These revealed the remains of a prehistoric landslide under the place where the train derailed. This prehistoric landslide had increased the flow of water in that spot, which had, in turn, contributed to the landslide that had caused the accident. These exceptional circumstances might have caused the engineers building the line to believe that the bearing capacity of the soil was greater than it actually was. In 1923, another landslide occurred in the same place, this time causing the road running along Bråvik Bay to collapse.|$|E
40|$|Yucca Mountain in {{southern}} Nye County, Nevada, {{has been proposed}} as a potential site for the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste. An exploratory <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> designated UE 25 p# 1 was drilled 3 km east of the proposed repository site to investigate the geology and hydrology of the rocks that underlie the Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rock sequence forming Yucca Mountain. Silurian dolomite assigned to the Roberts Mountain and Lone Mountain Formations was intersected below the Tertiary section between a depth of approximately 1244 m (4080 ft) and {{the bottom of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> at 1807 m (5923 ft). These formations are part of an important regional carbonate aquifer in the deep ground-water system. Tertiary units deeper than 1139 m (3733 ft) in <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> UE 25 p# 1 are stratigraphically older than any units previously penetrated by <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> at Yucca Mountain. These units are, in ascending order, the tuff of Yucca Flat(?), an unnamed calcified ash-flow tuff, and a sequence of clastic deposits. The upper part of the Tertiary sequence in <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> UE 25 p# 1 is similar to that found in other <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> at Yucca Mountain. The Tertiary sequence is in fault contact with the Silurian rocks. This fault between Tertiary and Paleozoic rocks may correlate with the Fran Ridge fault, a steeply westward-dipping fault exposed approximately 0. 5 km east of the <b>drill</b> <b>hole.</b> Another fault intersects UE 25 p# 1 at 873 m (2863 ft), but its surface trace is concealed beneath the valley west of the Fran Ridge fault.

25|$|Sometimes viaducts {{may fail}} in the {{connections}} between components. This {{was seen in the}} failure of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland, California, during the Loma Prieta earthquake. This viaduct was a two-level structure, and the upper portions of the columns were not well connected to the lower portions that supported the lower level; this caused the upper deck to collapse upon the lower deck. Weak connections such as these require additional external jacketing – either through external steel components or by a complete jacket of reinforced concrete, often using stub connections that are glued (using epoxy adhesive) into numerous <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b> These stubs are then connected to additional wrappings, external forms (which may be temporary or permanent) are erected, and additional concrete is poured into the space. Large connected structures similar to the Cypress Viaduct must also be properly analyzed in their entirety using dynamic computer simulations.|$|E
25|$|The wreck {{is rapidly}} {{disintegrating}} due to natural rusting. The dive boats {{that rely on}} the wreck for their livelihood are also tearing the wreck apart by mooring the boats to weak parts of the wreck, leading to parts of the wreck collapsing. For this reason, in December 2007 the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA) a non-governmental organisation installed 32 permanent mooring buoys and <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> in the wreck to allow trapped air to escape. During this work, the vessel was closed off to recreational diving. However, as of 2009, none of these moorings remain as the blocks themselves were too light (resulting in ships dragging them), and the lines connecting the moorings to the wreck were too long (meaning with the strong currents in the area, people would find it impossible to transfer from the mooring to the actual wreck). As a result, all boats now moor off directly to the wreck again.|$|E

500|$|William Abler {{observed}} in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble {{a crack in}} the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, [...] "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity" [...] to wood they work.
