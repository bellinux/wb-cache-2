5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer and other drug addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have a taste of the meth (which he thinks <b>is</b> <b>food</b> produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie bags from the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple pie. With the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E

50|$|The term health <b>food</b> has <b>been</b> {{used since}} the 1920s {{to refer to}} {{specific}} <b>foods</b> claimed to <b>be</b> especially beneficial to health, although the term has no official definition. Some terms {{that are associated with}} health <b>food</b> <b>are</b> macrobiotics, natural <b>foods,</b> organic foods and whole <b>foods.</b> Macrobiotics <b>is</b> a diet focusing primarily on whole cereals. Whole cereals, along with other whole <b>foods,</b> <b>are</b> <b>foods</b> that <b>are</b> minimally processed. Whole cereals have their fiber, germ and hull intact and are considered more nutritious. Natural <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> simply <b>foods</b> that contain no artificial ingredients. Organic <b>foods</b> <b>are</b> <b>foods</b> that <b>are</b> grown without the use of conventional and artificial pesticides and must meet certain organic standards.|$|R

25|$|Frozen food <b>is</b> <b>food</b> {{preserved}} {{by the process}} of freezing. Freezing food is a common method of food preservation which slows both food decay and, by turning water to ice, makes it unavailable for most bacterial growth and slows down most chemical reactions. Clarence Birdseye offered his quick-frozen foods to the public. Birdseye got the idea during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use freezing to preserve foods.|$|E
25|$|Industry {{accounts}} for about {{eighty percent of the}} economy and is mostly based in {{the outskirts of the city}} as well as in some surrounding municipalities. Main products include basic metals, chemicals, electrical items and textiles. The main employers are Hylsa and the Volkswagen automotive plant. A growing sector <b>is</b> <b>food</b> processing. Many industries are consolidated into parks such as the 5 de Mayo Industrial Park, the Resurrección Industrial Zone and the Puebla 2000 Industrial Park.|$|E
25|$|Cat food <b>is</b> <b>food</b> for {{consumption}} by cats. Cats have requirements for their specific dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency. The amino acid taurine, for example, which is found within meat, is degraded during processing, so synthetic taurine is normally added afterwards. Long-term taurine deficiency {{may result in}} retinal degeneration, loss of vision, and cardiac arrest.|$|E

25|$|A common metric used to {{quantify}} food web trophic structure <b>is</b> <b>food</b> chain length. Food chain length {{is another way}} of describing food webs as a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators. There are different ways of calculating food chain length depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web.|$|E
25|$|The next {{pillar of}} food {{security}} <b>is</b> <b>food</b> utilization, {{which refers to}} the metabolism of food by individuals. Once food is obtained by a household, {{a variety of factors}} affect {{the quantity and quality of}} food that reaches members of the household. In order to achieve food security, the food ingested must be safe and must be enough to meet the physiological requirements of each individual. Food safety affects food utilization, and can be affected by the preparation, processing, and cooking of food in the community and household. Nutritional values of the household determine food choice, and whether food meets cultural preferences is important to utilization in terms of psychological and social well-being. Access to healthcare is another determinant of food utilization, since the health of individuals controls how the food is metabolized. For example, intestinal parasites can take nutrients from the body and decrease food utilization. Sanitation can also decrease the occurrence and spread of diseases that can affect food utilization. Education about nutrition and food preparation can affect food utilization and improve this pillar of food security.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, writer Peter Benchley {{published}} Jaws, a {{novel about}} a rogue great white shark that terrorizes the fictional coastal community of Amity Island. Chief of police Martin Brody, biologist Matt Hooper, and fisherman Quint hunt the shark after it kills four people. The novel was adapted as the film Jaws by Steven Spielberg in 1975. Spielberg's film makes reference {{to the events of}} 1916: Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) urge Amity's Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) to close the beaches on the Fourth of July after the deaths of two swimmers and a fisherman. Hooper explains to the mayor, [...] "Look, the situation is that apparently a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island. And he's going to continue to feed here as long as there <b>is</b> <b>food</b> in the water." [...] Brody adds, [...] "And there's no limit to what he's gonna do! I mean we've already had three incidents, two people killed inside of a week. And it's gonna happen again, it happened before! The Jersey beach!... 1916! Five people chewed up on the surf!" [...] Richard Ellis, Richard Fernicola, and Michael Capuzzo suggest that the 1916 Jersey Shore attacks, Coppleson's rogue shark theory, and the exploits of New York fisherman Frank Mundus inspired Benchley. While Benchley states Mundus was an inspiration for Quint, he has denied the book was inspired by attacks off New Jersey in 1916. [...] The attacks are also briefly referred to in Benchley's novel White Shark (1994).|$|E
500|$|African {{lions and}} spotted hyenas occupy a similar {{ecological}} niche and compete for prey and carrion {{in the areas}} where they coexist. A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas unless the lions are on a kill or are being harassed by the hyenas, while the latter tend to visibly react {{to the presence of}} lions whether there <b>is</b> <b>food</b> or not. Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas: in the Ngorongoro crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate. On the other hand, in Northern Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed: hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills: they obtain food from 63% of all lion kills. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of [...] until the lions have finished, but they are also bold enough to feed alongside lions, and even force the lions off a kill. The two species may attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason. Lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent. The size of male lions allows them occasionally to confront hyenas in otherwise evenly matched brawls and so to tip the balance in favour of the lions.|$|E
