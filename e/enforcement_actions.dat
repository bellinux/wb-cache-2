5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E

5|$|On 14–19 December 1970 mass demonstrations {{against the}} price rises {{broke out in}} the {{northern}} coastal cities of Gdańsk, Gdynia, Elbląg and Szczecin. In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including the party headquarters in Gdańsk and Szczecin. The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomułka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property. Nevertheless, Gomułka remained determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict. Among the leaders of the party who arrived on the coast and directed the local <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions,</b> initially in Gdańsk, were Zenon Kliszko and Stanisław Kociołek. In Gdynia, the soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. The exact number of people killed in the region in December is not known, but is believed to be higher than the officially given figure of 44.|$|E

It traces the evolution of discretionary enforcement in British planning legislation and relates this to the formally stated purposes of <b>enforcement</b> <b>action,</b> as well as the various considerations of local planning authorities in determining whether it is expedient to take <b>enforcement</b> <b>action.</b> The paper concludes that there is a significant degree of ambiguity in the purposes of <b>enforcement</b> <b>action</b> in Britain, each with their own characteristic basis for discretionary decision-making...|$|R
