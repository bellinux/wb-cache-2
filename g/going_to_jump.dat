500|$|The {{last few}} seasons were criticized for {{a dip in}} quality. The sixth season {{received}} criticisms {{for a lack of}} stakes for the characters. Other critics and fans have also criticized the dragging out of the Jim and Pam romance. The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais wrote in his blog, referring to [...] "Search Committee," [...] particularly Warren Buffett's guest appearance, [...] "If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> a shark, jump a big one", and compared the episode to the Chris Martin episode of Gervais's other series, Extras (although he later said on his website, [...] "I fucking didn't , that's for sure"). Some critics said the series should have ended after the departure of Steve Carell. Rainn Wilson felt that the eighth season possessed some mistakes [...] "creatively", such as the chemistry between Spader and Helms, which he called [...] "a bit dark" [...] and argued that the show should have gone for a [...] "brighter and more energized" [...] relationship. Despite this, there are later-series episodes that have received critical acclaim, including [...] "Stress Relief", [...] "Niagara", [...] "Garage Sale", [...] "Goodbye, Michael", [...] "Dwight Christmas", [...] "A.A.R.M.", and [...] "Finale".|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from review website The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, {{saying that it}} was [...] "a funny episode that managed to be only fitfully satisfying." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White commented that [...] "it's more apparent than ever that 'Goodbye, Michael' should have ended the season, if not the series," [...] and that [...] "the show is just spinning its wheels now". Despite this, she praised the scenes featuring Creed Bratton and James Spader, believing Bratton's performance consisted of [...] "the funniest scenes of the episode", and that Spader [...] "was given the meatiest part, gamely channeling his dominating boss role from Secretary". White ultimately gave the episode a 6.5/10, calling it [...] "Okay". TV Squad writer Joel Keller criticized the episode for not featuring a true plot, writing that [...] "this felt like a series of sketches in search of a plot." [...] The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais also commented on the outlandishness, particularly Warren Buffett's appearance, saying [...] "If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> a shark, jump a big one." [...] He also compared the episode to the Chris Martin episode of Gervais's other series, Extras. The shark quote was repeated multiple times on other media outlets; Gervais eventually commented that [...] "I fucking didn't , that's for sure." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2002 elections, Wamalwa formed a {{political}} alliance with Mwai Kibaki and Charity Ngilu {{to come up with a}} winning side.

5000|$|... 21 Jump Street is an American police {{procedural}} {{television series}} that aired on the Fox network and in first run syndication from April 12, 1987, to April 27, 1991, {{with a total}} of 103 episodes. The series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. It was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be titled <b>Jump</b> Street Chapel, after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters, but was changed at Fox's request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program.|$|R
500|$|Before {{starting}} filming {{or making}} an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: [...] "my own technique <b>to</b> get myself <b>going</b> was... <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> {{in the air}} and execute a few dance steps". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in Private's Progress, a close-up was needed showing his character [...] "registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in"; he [...] "just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work". Terry-Thomas said [...] "I like to do my own stunts", which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and Bachelor Flat. This included some dangerous work; for example, during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, he ran along the roof of a moving train.|$|R
5000|$|And they're away — oh, {{and once}} again the tape has snagged, and it's a recall... It was caught round Richard Dunwoody's neck, the tape. And they've been {{recalled}} — but the majority don't realise {{that it is a}} recall! They're <b>going</b> down <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> the first, they're <b>going</b> <b>to!</b> The BBC's lead commentator Peter O'Sullevandescribes the second false start. The meeting at Aintree had been beset by problems before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also happened at the 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — around the neck of jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|R
