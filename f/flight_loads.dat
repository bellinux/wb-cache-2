25|$|A {{possible}} {{upgrade to}} the Delta IV {{family is the}} creation of new variants by the addition of extra solid motors. One such modification, the Medium+(4,4), would pair the four GEM-60s of the M+(5,4) with the upper stage and fairing of the (4,2). This would theoretically provide a GTO payload of 7,500kg (16,600lb) and an LEO payload of 14,800kg (32,700lb). This is the simplest variant to implement and is available within 36 months of the first order. Two other possible versions, the Medium+(5,6) and (5,8), would add two or four extra GEM-60s to the (5,4) variant, respectively. These would provide significantly higher performance (up to 9,200kg/20,200lb to GTO for the M+(5,8)) but would require more extensive modifications to the vehicle, such as adding the extra attach points and changes to cope with the different <b>flight</b> <b>loads.</b> They would also require pad and infrastructure changes. The Medium+(5,6) and (5,8) could be available within 48 months of the first order.|$|E

50|$|Like most {{aircraft}} of the period, the Mallard {{was built}} using an aluminium stressed skin construction. Unlike earlier fabric covered aircraft where the fabric covering is merely for aerodynamic purposes and contributes {{little to the}} overall strength of the airframe, the metal skin itself carries part of the <b>flight</b> <b>loads</b> and is stressed during flight.

50|$|The {{approach}} to structural design varies widely between {{different types of}} aircraft. Some, such as paragliders, comprise only flexible materials that act in tension and rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape. A balloon similarly relies on internal gas pressure but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload. Early aircraft, including airships, often employed flexible doped aircraft fabric covering to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame. Later aircraft employed semi-monocoque techniques, where {{the skin of the}} aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the <b>flight</b> <b>loads.</b> In a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on the 250 -passenger BWB {{configuration}}, {{the effect}} of the configuration of flap on BWB civil aircraft <b>flight</b> <b>loading</b> during takeoff and landing is studied by computational fluid dynamics. <b>Flight</b> <b>loading</b> varied with the flap deflection, area and the layout is discussed. It is shown the existence of flap makes the angle of attack smaller in takeoff and landing and aerodynamic forces and moment larger. In addition, it can change the loading distribution along span wise of the wing and affect the structural safety. Especially, increased pitch moment can make flight safety worse in takeoff and landing. In some cases, {{it is important that the}} function of flap is to improve the drag significantly and reduce the distance of taxiing to benefit to safety in landing. The airworthiness will have to be re-evaluated before the flaps are used in BWB on basis of the structural and flight safety considerations according to CCAR 25...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{computational}} intelligence approach to estimate fatigue usage in rotating components based on real aircraft data (Australian Black Hawk S- 70 A- 9 <b>flight</b> <b>load</b> survey data). The load time signal for the main rotor pushrod in forward level flight is first predicted using only input data from the flight state and control system parameters through a computational intelligence model. The subsequent fatigue usage is then estimated using adaptations of standard techniques, such as the Rainflow cycle counting method. More accurate fatigue accumulation and remaining life predictions can possibly be made considering the real operational <b>flight</b> <b>load</b> spectra and not just based on design mission estimations, accounting for the change in use of platforms during their in-service lives. This approach is particularly devoted to rotating components and avoids the use of additional sensors, specifically challenging when dynamic components are considered.

50|$|In a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, the spar {{is often}} the main structural member of the wing, running spanwise at right angles (or thereabouts depending on wing sweep) to the fuselage. The spar carries <b>flight</b> <b>loads</b> {{and the weight of}} the wings while on the ground. Other structural and forming members such as ribs may be attached to the spar or spars, with stressed skin construction also sharing the loads where it is used. There may be more than one spar in a wing or none at all. However, where a single spar carries the majority of the forces on it, it is known as the main spar.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Airbus {{announced}} a new A380 build standard, incorporating a strengthened airframe structure and a 1.5° increase in wing twist. Airbus will also offer, as an option, an improved maximum take-off weight, thus providing a better payload/range performance. Maximum take-off weight is increased by 4 t, to 573 t and the range is extended by 100 nmi km; this is achieved by reducing <b>flight</b> <b>loads,</b> partly from optimising the fly-by-wire control laws. British Airways and Emirates are the first two customers to have received this new option in 2013. Emirates has asked for an update with new engines for the A380 to be competitive with the 777X around 2020, and Airbus is studying 11-abreast seating.|$|E

Falcon Heavy will be more capable than any other operational rocket, with a payload of 64000 kg to low earth orbit and 16800 kg to trans-Mars injection. The rocket was designed to meet or exceed all current requirements of human rating. The structural safety margins are 40% above <b>flight</b> <b>loads,</b> higher than the 25% margins of other rockets. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and it would restore the possibility of flying crewed missions to the Moon or Mars.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe study {{deals with}} an {{integral}} skin-stringer wing panel made of AA 7475 -T 7351. DT solutions for fatigue life prediction {{are based on}} computational methods. Crack growth is analysed under the <b>flight</b> by <b>flight</b> <b>loading</b> representative for a commuter aircraft. Crack growth predictions are performed by using both the linear damage accumulation principle and the FASTRAN retardation model. Different solutions of crack and structural geometry, which are expressed by the β correction factor related to stress intensity factor assessment, are compared. The predicted crack growth and original data for the integral wing panel are discussed. The influence of geometry correction factors, which are defined by considering different hypotheses of their determination, is not significant for the integrally stiffened panel. In contrast, the retardation effect for the <b>flight</b> by <b>flight</b> <b>loading,</b> investigated alloy and structural part is significant. The FASTRAN retardation model gives underestimated predictions of approximately 10 % compared with the experimental data. The reason underlying the increasing difference between the experimental data and numerical predictions of longest crack length propagation is discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of Vulcain, {{carried out by}} a European partnership, began in 1988 with the Ariane 5 rocket program.

In 2002 the upgraded Vulcain 2 with 20% more thrust first flew on flight 517, although a problem with the engine turned the flight into a failure. The cause was due to <b>flight</b> <b>loads</b> being much higher than expected, as the inquiry board concluded. Subsequently the nozzle was redesigned to include mechanical reinforcement of the structure and improvement of the thermal situation of the tube wall through enhancing hydrogen coolant flow as well as applying a thermal barrier coating to the flame-facing side of the coolant tubes. The first successful flight of the (partially redesigned) Vulcain 2 occurred in 2005 on flight 521.|$|E
