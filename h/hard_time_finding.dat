In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>finding</b> trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E

Endler employed Graf as a salesman in his company, and Graf eventually advanced to branch leader in Baden-Württemberg and Sales Manager. The link to Bayern Munich allowed him to enjoy his long love of football, although his injuries never let him play competitively again. He did however, return to flying, joining the Zürich branch of the Swiss Aero Club in 1951.

5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators, although they may have had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>finding</b> enough meat to scavenge, being outnumbered by smaller theropods. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to California Monte {{returned}} to his education. In high school, he was exceeding all standards and having a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>finding</b> new academic challenges. Instead of graduating high school early, as was suggested by his principal, Monte found an alternative thanks to his father: a study abroad program in East Asia. At the age of 15 Monte traveled to Japan for {{a new chapter in}} his young life, namely to study martial arts and Japanese language. While there he began making money teaching English which helped finance his travels through several Southeast Asian countries. This introduced him to several new cultures, new philosophies, new languages, and in several cases, like his travels through Vietnam (just before the North would defeat the South), new skills that would become immensely valuable in his later life as a soldier. Returning to the United States, he graduated from high school and entered the University of California, Berkeley with Regents Scholarship, majoring in ancient Asian history and Archeology. In 1978 he helped to organize an exhibition of Armenian cultural artifacts at one of the university’s libraries. The section of the exhibit dealing with the 1915-23 genocide was removed by university authorities, {{at the request of the}} Turkish consul general in San Francisco. The display that was removed was eventually reinstalled following a campus protest movement. Monte eventually completed his undergrad work in under three years. Upon graduating, he was accepted into the archeology graduate program at the University of Oxford. However, Monte chose to forgo this opportunity, and instead chose to begin his lifelong struggle for the Armenian Cause.|$|E
25|$|After {{losing the}} trios title Black Warrior had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>finding</b> any direction, {{at one point}} he {{publicly}} pleaded with CMLL to turn him rudo via an interview for Box y Lucha magazine. In early 2006 Warrior began working with Místico and the two quickly earned a shot at the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, held by Averno and Mephisto. During the third fall of the match Místico accidentally collided with Black Warrior causing their team to lose. Weeks later, during a rematch, Black Warrior turned on Místico, attacking him during the match and then walking out. The storyline with Místico was further intensified when Black Warrior defeated Místico for the NWA World Middleweight Championship on May 12, 2006. After months of scripted hostility between Warrior and Místico the two faced off in a Luchas de Apuestas (bet fight), mask versus mask match at CMLL's 73rd Anniversary show. The match saw Místico defeat Black Warrior, two falls to one, to win Black Warrior's mask. For {{the first time in his}} career Warrior was forced to unmask and show his face in public. Following the loss of his mask Black Warrior made several successful title defenses against Místico until finally losing the NWA World Middleweight Title back to him on April 29, 2007. After the feud with Místico ended Black Warrior worked as an upper-card rudo although not with any major storylines. In late 2007 Black Warrior became involved in a storyline that saw Warrior and Rey Bucanero team up to take on Shocker and Lizmark Jr. in a tag team Luchas de Apuestas with the hair of the losing team on the line. On December 7, 2007 Warrior and Bucanero lost and had their heads shaved completely bald as a result of the stipulation, in the main event of CMLL's pay-per-view Sin Piedad (Without Mercy).|$|E

500|$|Hetfield and Ulrich fired Mustaine on {{the morning}} of April 11 after a gig in New York, because of his drug and alcohol problems, overly {{aggressive}} behavior, and clashes with bandmates. On Whitaker's recommendation, Metallica recruited Kirk Hammett, who played in Exodus and was a one-time student of Joe Satriani. Hammett learned the songs on his flight to New York, and started recording the album with Metallica barely a month later. Metallica met producer Paul Curcio at Music America studios in Rochester, and recorded the album in two weeks. Unable to afford a hotel during the recording sessions, the band members lived in people's houses in Rochester and at the Music Factory in Jamaica, Queens, where Anthrax held rehearsals. Curcio had set the studio equipment as if he were recording an ordinary rock band. He thought the initial tapes sounded very distorted, and tried to compensate by turning down the knobs. Metallica resented Curcio's involvement because he seemed uninterested and had little impact on the sound. Although Zazula wanted Hammett to replicate Mustaine's solos, Hammett's guitar solos on the album were partially based on Mustaine's original solos, with the first four bars of most solos written by Mustaine before his departure. Despite their differences, Mustaine's contributions to the early years of Metallica were still acknowledged, and he received four co-writing credits on Kill 'Em All. Zazula was not satisfied with the initial mix because he thought the drums were too loud and the guitars were too low in the mix. The remix was done by sound engineer Chris Bubacz, according to Zazula's instructions. The final cost for the record was $15,000, which nearly bankrupted Zazula. [...] "This was mortgage money I'm spending, not something I've got put by I'm going to invest," [...] he said later. Zazula had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>finding</b> a distributor for the record, but he eventually convinced Relativity Records to distribute the album in the U.S. and Canada, and Music for Nations in Europe.|$|E

30|$|The strong, {{positive}} relationship between parasitism rate and parasitoid load (Figure  8), {{as well as the}} significant difference between the mean parasitoid load of field-collected hosts and the mean clutch size of larvipositing females (4.97 and 2.53 larvae/host, respectively), can both be explained as a consequence of superparasitism in the field. If at least some host cicadas are superparasitized in the field, then we should expect the mean parasitoid load of host cicadas to be larger than the mean clutch size of individual female flies. Furthermore, for gregarious parasitoids such as E. erro, superparasitism is expected to be more common when unparasitized hosts are rare, simply because female parasitoids have a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>finding</b> hosts that have not already been infected (Godfray 1994). Unparasitized hosts are rare when parasitism rates are high, so higher parasitism rates should correspond with increasing rates of superparasitism. Increased superparasitism would, in turn, likely result in larger parasitoid loads per host, which means that higher population parasitism rates should correspond with higher parasitoid loads. This prediction matches the pattern of the data quite well (Figure  8).|$|R
