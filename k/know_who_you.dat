500|$|Harriet Jones is {{a fictional}} {{character}} played by Penelope Wilton in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Having worked previously with lead writer {{and executive producer}} Russell T Davies, Wilton was keen to involve herself with his 2005 revival of Doctor Who after he sought to cast her. Jones is introduced in the two-part story [...] "Aliens of London" [...] and [...] "World War Three" [...] as a Member of Parliament who aids the Ninth Doctor against an alien invasion of London. The episode introduces a running joke associated with the character which would see her frequently introduce herself by holding up her ID and stating her name and rank; in subsequent episodes this was usually met with the response [...] "Yes, I/we <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] even occurring with The Daleks and The Sycorax.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} , author J. Randy Taraborrelli {{describes}} the song as a [...] "somber, sarcastic, all-the-world's-a-stage song about unrequited love... whose phoniness might have fooled everyone else, but not her." [...] He {{goes on to}} say that in the song Madonna tells the subject of her unrequited love to take a bow for [...] "rendering a great, transparent performance in life and love." [...] Alongside the betrayal of her lover, the lyrics also talk about Madonna trying to understand the reasons behind adultery. As the song progresses, the listener realizes that through the lyrics the singer was talking about herself—"One lonely star and you don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are". According to Musicnotes.com, the song has a moderate calypso feel and is set in the time signature of common time and progresses in 80 beats per minute. The composition is set in the key of A major with Madonna's vocal ranging from E3 to C5. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] contains a basic sequence of A–Bm7/E–A–Fmaj7 during the opening strings, and A–A/G–Fm7 during the verses as its chord progression.|$|E

[...] Ueshiba replied: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] to which Abbe {{modestly}} retorted: [...] "Everyone knows me, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Champion of All Japan." [...] Ueshiba then introduced himself as the Founder of Aikido, and was told by Abbe that he didn't look strong enough to be a martial arts master. Ueshiba then offered Abbe his little finger, and said: [...] "But young man, you look very strong indeed. Please break my finger." [...] Abbe at first declined, but eventually accepted the challenge, presumably to shut the old man up. Abbe claimed that, as he took hold of the old man's finger and tried to break it, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} carriage and totally immobilised. Whilst on the floor Abbe asked Ueshiba for permission to study under him.|$|E

Though tired of a running joke throughout the series where Jones would introduce herself only to be told [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] Anders remarks that in the face of her demise [...] "she was able to turn her usual schtick into a moving speech of defiance." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Chris Hastings felt that by the time she is killed off, Harriet was [...] "one of the show’s most popular characters". SFX placed the character of Harriet Jones at number 12 in a 2009 article listing the 27 things they loved best about the revival of Doctor Who, citing the running joke associated with the character.

500|$|Mars {{revealed}} to Billboard in September 2012 on {{a preview of}} his cover story that he recorded an album that represented his freedom. On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and what he stands for, mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy when I could let it go. I didn't give it another thought when it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, EGM {{commented that}} the {{graphics}} are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and [...] "unbearable" [...] slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but felt that with Mortal Kombat II having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand out. Next Generation felt that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the Mortal Kombat series {{as a whole was}} grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that [...] "if you are a fan of the game (and you <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are), then the Saturn version is everything you can hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - and yet, there is nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it." [...] Scary Larry of GamePro agreed that the Saturn port [...] "duplicates the arcade version perfectly", but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 hit the Saturn, but fails to measure up to Mortal Kombat 3 on the PlayStation. Sega Saturn Magazine was extremely disappointed with {{the final version of the}} Saturn port, calling it [...] "much worse than any of the versions seen on the cartridge format," [...] as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.|$|E

Cavill is the first British and non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in , which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns, but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, [...] "There's a very real story behind the Superman character." [...] He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, [...] "He's alone and there's no one like him," [...] referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. [...] "That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are or what you are, and {{trying to find out what}} makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? Where do you draw a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness." [...] In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakaway" [...] {{has also}} been covered by contestants from reality {{television}} singing competitions. Katie Stevens covered the song on the ninth season of American Idol. Despite listening to the judges' comments to sing a contemporary song, her rendition was criticized from the judges; Randy Jackson thought the note was too big for Stevens while Ellen DeGeneres felt Stevens did not sell the lyrics. Kara DioGuardi said, [...] "I don't think you <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are yet as an artist", an opinion agreed by Simon Cowell. Jim Cantiello of MTV noted that Stevens' performance of the song was her weakest performance in the show, stating [...] "Unfortunately, her uneven vocals on 'Breakaway' exposed her youthful inexperience." [...] The same opinion was echoed by Eric Ditzian of MTV who opined that Stevens failed to resonate her youthful energy favouring the song choice. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was performed by Julie Zorrilla in the semi-finals of American Idol season 10. Samantha Stephens of The Republican felt Zorrilla's performance was mediocre. Gil Kaufman of MTV remarked that Zorrilla's voice was shaky and it lacked personality. After landing in the bottom two, Belle Amie, an English pop quartet contestant on the seventh season of The X Factor, decided to perform [...] "Breakaway" [...] as their survival song. Nevertheless, they were eliminated in the episode. Swedish Idol contestant, Alice Hagenbrant covered the song which appeared in Det bästa från Idol, an album released from the musical competition.

Matt Tucker of KSiteTV.com thought the performance was [...] "lovely", describing {{it as one of}} the things that stood out in the episode.
