Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E

5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting.

5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E

To help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, which grew wild in the area. Although <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> to be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding the}} fifth and final Scroll, the Sky Scroll, Musashi discovers Thirstquencher's base, a {{floating}} ship known as the Soda Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher's leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina {{in exchange for the}} Princess, and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes the Wizard of Darkness, who was sealed within Brave Fencer Musashi's sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave Fencer Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave Fencer Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard's seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi's quest merely aided The Dark Wizard's revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and uses it to defeat The Dark Wizard.

He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to go without his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were though relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall back on, and nothing in writing.|$|E
