40|$|Global {{energy sector}} carbon dioxide {{emissions}} between 2007 and 2010 have been growing much faster than projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IEA 2011). Roughly 75 % of this growth {{can be attributed to}} developing countries that are increasingly manufacturing goods destined for consumption in the developed world (Peters et al. 2011). This study examines the energy sector carbon dioxide <b>emissions</b> and <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> of 64 developing countries from 1980 to 2006. Approximately 50 % of these countries have relatively flat slopes when their emissions are plotted over time or against gross domestic product per capita. To shed some light on how this is possible, two competing theories of globalization are tested. World-systems theory argues that global economic integration is predicated on core-periphery exploitation, which leads to unsustainable development. World-society theory, on the other hand, contends that global social integration diffuses modern environmental values, which leads to structural isomorphism and sustainable development. World-society diffusion in this study is approximated by the network measure of degree centrality, which is calculated from shared ratifications of international environmental treaties. To find out if these opposing dynamics significantly impact <b>emissions</b> and <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> independently, or in conjunction, three different methods are used: Prais-Winsten panel regression with panel-corrected standard errors, cross-section ordinary least squares regression and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Findings from the panel regressions indicate that network centrality in global environmental treaty regimes has a significant, albeit weak, negative effect on {{carbon dioxide emissions}}. This effect is further attenuated by high levels of world-system exploitation, as measured by International Monetary Fund (IMF) credit. The first set of cross-section regressions indicate that network centrality has a significant, but weak, negative effect on <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted against GDP per capita when restricted to those countries that have low levels of IMF credit. The second set of cross-section regressions indicate that network centrality has a significant, but once again weak, negative effect on <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted over time when restricted to those countries that have low levels of foreign direct investment (FDI). The fuzzy set qualitative comparative analyses reveal that world-society diffusion is only implicated in two out of five sufficient configurations for membership in the outcome set of countries with relatively flat <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted against GDP per capita. Furthermore, world-society diffusion, at least as approximated in terms of network centrality in international environmental treaty regimes, is not implicated in any of the sufficient configurations when the outcome involves membership in the set of countries with relatively flat <b>emission</b> <b>trajectories</b> plotted over time. In these analyses it is the absence of economic growth that is most often implicated, followed by low levels of FDI and IMF credit...|$|R

40|$|We modeled and mapped, {{using the}} {{predictive}} data mining tool Random Forests, 134 tree species {{from the eastern}} United States for potential response to several scenarios of climate change. Each species was modeled individually to show current and potential future habitats according to two emission scenarios (high emissions on current trajectory and reasonable conservation of energy implemented) and three climate models: the Parallel Climate Model, the Hadley CM 3 model, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model. Since we model potential suitable habitats of species, our results should not be interpreted as actual changes in ranges of the species. We also evaluated both emission scenarios under an ‘‘average’ ’ future climate from all three models. Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in the eastern United States, especially under a high <b>emissions</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Of the 134 species, approximately 66 species would gain and 54 species would lose at least 10 % of their suitable habitat under climate change.

One of the most pronounced effects may be a decline in resistance to chronic change and resilience to acute disturbances. The capacity for forests to persist and/or adapt to climate change remains largely unknown, in part because there is not broad agreement how to measure and apply resilience concepts. Objectives: We assessed the interactions of climate change, resistance, resilience, diversity, and alternative management of northern Great Lake forests. Methods: We simulated two landscapes (northern Minnesota and northern lower Michigan), three climate futures (current climate, a low <b>emissions</b> <b>trajectory,</b> and a high <b>emissions</b> <b>trajectory),</b> and four management regimes [business as usual, expanded forest reserves, modified silviculture, and climate suitable planting (CSP) ].

Results: Results indicate {{a positive relationship between}} diversity and resistance within low diversity areas. Simulations of the high emission climate future resulted in a decline in both resistance and resilience.

40|$|AbstractContemporary {{increases}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration are {{in large part}} the result of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Scenario analysis is commonly used to generate projections of future carbon dioxide emissions, the resulting atmospheric concentrations and climate impact. In most scenario modelling published to date, carbon dioxide emission scenarios are based on demand-side (socioeconomic and technology) factors. The fossil fuel resource is assumed ample enough that supply-side factors do not drive future emission scenarios. This {{review of the literature}} on non-renewable resource extraction rate modelling and empirical studies of the global fossil fuel resource base suggests this assumption is unsafe. Supply-side factors can be expected to drive extraction rates and therefore carbon dioxide emissions as fossil fuel resources become significantly depleted. It is likely that the future carbon dioxide <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory</b> will become dominated by supply-side factors during the 21 st century. By omitting this possibility, most scenario analysis is too narrow. An implication of such narrow scenario analysis is that policy driven by the UNFCCC‟s agreement to “avoid dangerous climate change” targets only demand-side factors to the exclusion of supply-side factors.

This paper describes an exercise where the costs of infrastructure deployment for the transport sector have been incorporated into the IMACLIM-R Global E 3 IAM. In addition to adding these costs, the modelling of the criteria for the deployment of infrastructure for roads has also been improved. It is found that this model recalibration results in a more accurate baseline as compared to historically observed data (2001 – 2013) for investments in energy demand, road infrastructure, and passenger kilometers travelled. Regarding macroeconomic effects, it is found that the imposition of a carbon <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory</b> to 2100 cause GDP to decrease relative to the newly calibrated baseline – this is a standard IAM result. However, when the deployment of infrastructure for roads and air travel is further constrained, the GDP loss is less than with a fixed carbon <b>emission</b> <b>trajectory</b> only. This is because early restriction of infrastructure for roads and air travel allows an expansion of public transport infrastructure which is adequate to meet low-carbon transport service demand whereas when less public transport infrastructure is available, more costly mitigation investments must be made in other parts of the economy.
