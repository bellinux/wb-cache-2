50|$|Seines {{have been}} used widely in the past, {{including}} by stone age societies. For example, {{with the help of}} large canoes, pre-European Māori deployed seine nets which could be over one thousand metres long. The nets were woven from <b>green</b> <b>flax,</b> with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul.|$|E
50|$|Fibres {{of various}} {{strengths}} {{were used to}} fashion eel traps (hinaki), surprisingly large fishing nets (kupenga) and lines, bird snares, cordage for ropes, baskets (kete), bags, mats, clothing, sandals (paraerae), buckets, food baskets (rourou), and cooking utensils etc. The handmade flax cording and ropes had such great tensile strength that {{they were used to}} successfully bind together sections of hollowed out logs to create huge ocean-going canoes (waka). With the help of wakas, pre-European Māori deployed seine nets which could be over one thousand metres long. The nets were woven from <b>green</b> <b>flax,</b> with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul. It was also used to make rigging, sails and lengthy anchor warps, and roofs for housing. Frayed ends of flax leaves were fashioned into torches and lights for use at night. The dried flower stalks, which are extremely light, were bound together with flax twine to make river rafts called mokihi.|$|E
50|$|Fishing nets {{have been}} used widely in the past, {{including}} by stone age societies. The oldest known fishing net is the net of Antrea, found with other fishing equipment in the Karelian town of Antrea. The net was made from willow, and dates back to 8300 BC. The remnants of another fishing net {{dates back to the}} late Mesolithic, and were found together with sinkers {{at the bottom of a}} former sea. Some of the oldest rock carvings at Alta (4200-500 BC) have mysterious images, including intricate patterns of horizontal and vertical lines sometimes explained as fishing nets. American Native Indians on the Columbia River wove seine nets from spruce root fibers or wild grass, again using stones as weights. For floats they used sticks made of cedar which moved in a way which frightened the fish and helped keep them together. With the help of large canoes, pre-European Maori deployed seine nets which could be over one thousand metres long. The nets were woven from <b>green</b> <b>flax,</b> with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul.|$|E

50|$|Seeking {{alternative}} export {{products to}} supplement tobacco, {{which had become}} the Colony's mainstay, <b>Green</b> Spring produced <b>flax,</b> fruits, potash, rice, silk, and spirits, which were shipped to markets in North America, the West Indies, Great Britain, and Holland.|$|R
50|$|Pregnant {{woman should}} get enough omega-3s, vitamin B12, and calcium. All these {{elements}} {{could be found}} in vegetarian meals and products. Omega-3s are found in dark leafy <b>green</b> vegetables, <b>flax</b> seed, walnuts, kidney and pinto beans, broccoli and squash. Milk and fermented soy are perfect sources of vitamin B12. Calcium is found in cottage cheese and soy milk. Moreover, pregnant woman should get enough zinc, protein, and iron. These elements are found in peas and beans. Vegetables and fruits should be eaten every day more than five times in order to get enough vitamins.|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} degradation behaviour of flax fibres and their polymer composites are explored. New upgraded Duralin flax fibres, {{which have been}} treated by a novel treatment process for improved moisture and rot sensitivity were studied. Environmental studies showed that these upgraded Duralin flax fibres absorb less moisture than untreated <b>Green</b> <b>flax</b> fibres, whereas the mechanical properties of the treated fibres were retained, if not improved. The effect of this novel flax fibre treatment on the environmental behaviour of natural-fibre-mat-reinforced thermoplastics (NMTs) is investigated by monitoring the moisture absorption and swelling, and measuring the residual mechanical properties of the flax/polypropylene composites at different moisture levels. The moisture absorption and swelling of the upgraded flax fibre composites is approximately 30 % {{lower than that of}} composites based on <b>Green</b> <b>flax</b> fibres...|$|E
40|$|During {{in vitro}} {{cultivation}} of <b>green</b> <b>flax</b> embryos excised 14 days after fertilization on White's medium the chloraphylls a and b are gradually destroyed and the lamellar system of plastids is disintegrated. It was possible, to prolong somewhat {{the presence of}} chlorophyll and to enhance embryo growth by culture {{in the dark and}} by adding kinetin. Light has a stimulating effect on the germination of embryos. Streptomycin inhibits chlorophyll synthesis not earlier than at germination. Young, green embryos are unable to sumvive and develop on media without sucrose. It is supposed that photosynthesis does not occur in flax embryos in vitro, and that green embryos are not more autotrophic in vitro than those of leucoembryophytes...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the present PhD project were to study the interface in flax/iPP composites, to develop and optimise an appropriate surface treatment for improving the interface in flax/iPP composites, and to assess {{the effect of the}} applied surface treatments on the properties of flax fibres (both physical and chemical). Two surface treatments, acetylation and stearation, were developed and optimised in the present study. The effect of these two surface treatments upon the structure of flax fibres was studied using XRD, SEM, ATR-FTIR, ToF-SIMS, XPS, IGC, DVS and single fibre tensile testing. It was found that the treatments did not significantly change the fibre strength, but they altered the fibre surface characteristics (chemical and physical). The water absorption was also significantly reduced after treatment, especially for <b>green</b> (as-received) <b>flax,</b> as was shown using DVS. In all cases the fibre surfaces were found to be very heterogeneous (from a chemistry point of view). The effect of the treatments and the processing conditions on the interfacial bond was studied using the single fibre fragmentation test, and it was shown that both treatments resulted in a stronger interface. The development of transcrystallinity was also found to produce a stronger interface, along with the use of slower cooling rates. However, an examination of the tensile properties of short flax fibre composites revealed that acetylation did not significantly change the tensile strength, in comparison with the untreated fibres, probably due to the manufacturing route followed in the present study that resulted in fibre lengths lower than the critical length. SEM post-mortem examination of the composites' fractured surfaces revealed that acetylation improved adhesion with iPP...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{research}} was {{the evaluation of}} growing technology effect on flax cultivar development (ontogenesis), fibre yield and its quality. The baseline {{of the study were}} pot and field trials carried out during period 2002 - 2007 in two INF Experimental Farms (EF) – EF Pętkowo and EF Sielec Stary. The experiments were performed by the method of randomized blocks arranged simply with 4 replications. The experimental factors were: 4 fibre flax cultivars [Agata (NL), Artemida (PL), Hermes (F), Modran (PL) ], sowing density (2 200 - 2 800 flax seeds m- 2; 110 - 140 kg/ha), techniques of flax seeds sowing (drilling and strie sowing), time of flax harvesting (full flowering- BBCH 65, <b>green</b> maturity of <b>flax</b> straw – BBCH 75, BBCH 79 and green-yellow of flax – BBCH 83). The results of pot and field trials showed that the highest dynamics in plant shoot development and flax fibres formation took place between the 30 th and 57 th day of flax growth, i. e. from BBCH 32 to BBCH 65 stages. The highest yield of fibre and its best quality had been obtained when flax was sown in rows at the density of 2 800 seeds m- 2 (140 kg/ha) and when flax was harvested in green-yellow maturity phase (BBCH 83) ...|$|R
50|$|The Allanté for 1992 was {{priced at}} $58,470 for the convertible, and $64,090 for the hardtop/convertible. Both prices {{included}} the mandated gas guzzler tax, {{which was now}} at $1,300. As {{it had been the}} custom for a few years now, price drops were announced midyear, $57,170 for the convertible, and $62,790 with the removable hardtop. The optional digital cluster was priced at $495 (available at no charge on the removable hardtop model), however, only 187 cars were equipped with the standard analog cluster this year. Also available on the convertible at extra-cost, a pearl white paint group (option YL3) priced at $700 (found on 443 models for 1992). This was the last year of the multi-adjustable Recaro seating design, as 1993 would go into production with less expensive Lear-designed eight-way dual power seats. Of the 1,698 produced this year, only four of them were specifically built for export - all of them to Canada. As with the previous year, the most popular exterior, found on 549 models, was 47U - Euro Red, while only 15 were made in 49U - Light Blue Metallic. Three shades of leather were available for the interior, the colors and production totals are: Charcoal (859), Natural Beige (652), and Maroon (187).and (50) Polo <b>Green</b> and Pearl <b>Flax,</b> (O4U) which there was only one produced in 1992, and its owned by an auto enthusiast from Tawas City, Michigan.|$|R
