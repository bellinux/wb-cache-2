P. de Vos. One of these, F. ovata, based on Moraea ovata Thunb. (1800), was only discovered to be a species of Ferraria in 2001, and three more are the result of our different view of De Vos’s taxonomy. In tropical Africa, F. glutinosa is recircumscribed to include only mid- to late summer-flowering plants, usually with a single basal leaf and with purple to brown flowers often marked with yellow. A second summer-flowering species, F. candelabrum, includes taller plants with several basal leaves. Spring and early summer-flowering plants lacking foliage leaves and with yellow flowers from central Africa are referred to F. spithamea or F. welwitschii respectively...|$|E
40|$|Awareness of {{potential}} water {{quantity and quality}} problems has risen with recent drought conditions throughout the U. S. In 2011, Texas experienced the most intense year of drought on record and mandatory water restrictions were enacted. Residential landscapes are a primary target of such restrictions. Selection of drought tolerant native Texas groundcovers began in College Station, TX in 2009. Species included Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC., Erigeron procumbens (Houst. <b>ex</b> <b>Mill.)</b> G. L. Nesom., Mimosa strigillosa Torr. & A. Gray, Oenothera drummondii Hook. and Phyla nodiflora (L.) Greene var. nodiflora. A suite of studies was designed to investigate potential commercial viability, propagation and production in conventional systems, and relative drought tolerances of the species. A market {{study was conducted to}} assess if consumers? horticultural purchasing behaviors influenced their behaviors and attitudes regarding water conservation. Effects of propagation seasons (warm and cool), bottom heat regimes (none, 26. 7, and 35. 0 ?C), and K-IBA concentrations (ranging from 0 to 9000 mg?L^- 1) on cuttings were investigated. Viability of conventional production of the natives was studied by testing effects of seven substrates (pine bark, perlite, peat moss, and mixtures thereof) and three controlled release fertilizer levels (low, medium, and high) on growth and biomass. Mimosa strigillosa was omitted from the propagation and production experiments while all other species were propagated and produced effectively using conventional methods. Acute and chronic drought experiments tested the tolerance of distinct provenances of native species along with commercially popular exotic species. Native species were divided into use-groups such that E. procumbens, M. strigillosa, O. drummondii, and P. nodiflora were studied as groundcovers and B. frutescens was studied as a shrub. Strong tolerances to water deficits were displayed by B. frutescens, M. strigillosa, and O. drummondii. Market study research was conducted by surveying participants in Michigan and Texas. Participants provided their recent horticultural purchasing history and attitudes and behaviors toward water conservation. Eight segments were found based on plant purchases including ?avid plant purchasers?, ?tree purchasers?, ?intermediate plant purchasers?, ?culinary plant purchasers?, ?indoor plant purchasers?, ?flowering perennial purchasers?, ?herb plant purchasers? and ?non-plant purchasers?. Few differences among water conservation attitudes were detected...|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} demand for high quality irrigation water and coastal development, new plants {{need to be}} developed that thrive with the use of saline irrigation and provide an alternative to invasive exotic landscape plants. Accessions of Erigeron procumbens (Houst. <b>ex</b> <b>Mill.)</b> G. L. Nesom, Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC., Sesuvium portulacastrum (L.) L., and Oenothera drummondii Hook. were collected along the Texas coast from Port Isabel to Port Arthur. Then taxa were screened for phenotypic variability, responses to plant growth regulators, and tolerances to saline irrigation water. Phenotypic variability appeared most promising in O. drummondii and B. frutescens for future breeding efforts. There were differences among accessions for all four species and there were regional differences in flowering and height for B. frutescens and O. drummondii. For B. frutescens height was reduced 54. 9 % by paclobutrazol at 40 mg a. i. ?pot^- 1 and 34. 9 % by uniconazole at 2 mg a. i. ?pot^- 1 when applied as a drench. Height and plant growth in O. drummondii was controlled with paclobutrazol drenches of 30 mg a. i. ?pot^- 1 and uniconazole drenches of 1. 5 mg a. i. ?pot^- 1. Similar results were found in E. procumbens and S. portulacastrum, with spray applications of PGRs being generally ineffective on all four taxa. All four taxa were irrigated with four concentrations of saline water, with electrical conductivities (EC) of 0. 8, 15. 1, 23. 8, 51. 3, and 92. 5 mS?cm^- 1, either applied sub-canopy or over the foliage. Concentrations above the control roughly represented the salinity of quarter, half, full, and double the salinity of seawater, respectively. All four species survived irrigation water with an EC of 23. 8 mS?cm^- 1 and showed minimal damage with 15. 1 mS?cm^- 1. Growth responses, mineral nutrient content, and K/Na ratios were consistent with reports of the halophytic nature of S. portulacastrum, which tolerated the greatest salinity exposure. Due to commercial interest, mating system and pollen storage studies were carried out on O. drummondii. In mating system experiments, out crossed flowers had a mean seed count of 240. 5 (? 17. 5) seed?fruit^- 1 and selfed flowers across all dates and treatments had a mean seed count of 285. 0 (? 14. 1) seeds?fruit^- 1 after 10 d on filter paper. This indicates a facultative out-crossing species and emasculation of flowers is not necessary in pollinator excluded environments...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{reconstruct}} spatiotemporal patterns of past landslide reactivation in a forested area of the Barcelonnette Basin (Bois Noir landslide, Southern French Alps). Analysis of past events was based on tree ring series from 79 heavily affected Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata <b>Mill.</b> <b>ex</b> Mirb) trees growing near or next to the landslide body. Dendrogeomorphic analysis focused on the presence of compression wood and growth reductions, with the first reaction being used for a dating of past reactivations with seasonal precision. A total of 151 growth disturbances were identified in the samples representing eight different stages of reactivation of the landslide body between 1874 and 2008. The spatiotemporal accuracy of the reconstruction is confirmed by historical records from neighboring sites and by aerial photographs. The onset of compression wood formation allows identifying five stages of landslide reactivation during the dormant season or the very beginning of the growing season of trees, i. e., between early October and late May, and three stages toward the end of the growth period. Monthly rainfall data from the HISTALP database demonstrate that the rainfall during four out of the eight reactivations are characterized by summer rainfall totals (July-August) exceeding 200 mm, pointing to the important role of summer rainstorms in the triggering of events at the Bois Noir landslide body...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{embodies the}} results of a taxonomic {{investigation}} of tribe Cynoglosseae of Boraginaceae subfamily Boraginoideae. The classification is a synthetic one based on maximum correlation of characters drawn primarily from studies of morphology and palynology, but also from reviews of available anatomical, embryological, cytological and chemo-taxonomic information. The thesis is divided into 28 chapters. Chapter 1 considers the position and limits of the Cynoglosseae in relation to the other tribes of subfamily Boraginoidea. Chapter 2 outlines aspects of vegetative, floral and fruit morphology. Chapter 4 consists of a discussion of the palynology of the tribe in relation to that of the family as a whole. Five major pollen groups are recognised, being those first described by Barbier & Mathez in Candollea 28 : 281 - 323 (1973) with modification in the light of n data. The putative line of palynological evolution in the tribe ls discussed. Chapter 7 considers phytogeographical aspects, the importance and diversity of the Cynoglosseae in each continent being analysed in turn. Anatomy and embryology (Ch. 3), cytology (Ch. 5) and chemotaxonomy (Ch. 6) are also reviewed. Chapters 28 constitutes the formal systematic treatment of the tribe, beginning with a description and dichotomous key to genera (Ch. 8). Nineteen genera and 233 species are recognised (Chs. 9 - 27). Five genera are excluded (Ch. 28) and five described for the first time (Austrocynoglossum, Desmolopha, Eleutherostylum, Madrea, Paracaryopsis). Major revisions of the limits of Cynoglossum, Omphalodea and Paracaryum are proposed. Mattiastrum Brand is included in Parascaryum (DC.). Boiss. to form one large genus hose four constituent subgenera are linked by intermediate species. Cynoglossom is restricted to 17 species (mainly in Europe & C. Asia); most Asian and all African species are transferred to Paracynoglossom M. Popov, with three Indian species being separated as Paracaryopsis (H. Riedl) R. Mill and the Australian C. latifolium R. Br. segregated as Austrocynoglossom M. Popov <b>ex</b> R. <b>Mill.</b> Five N. American species and the Chinese C. triste Diels constitute the new genus Eleutherostylum (Brand) R. Mill. Five Mexican species of Omphalodes Miller are referred to Mimophytum Greenman, while O. erecta Johnston is elevated to generic rank as Madrea R. Mill. New infrageneric taxa are described in Rindera, Solenanthus, Pardoglossum, Cynoglossum, Paracaryum, Paracynoglossum, Omphalodes and Mimophytum, and 4 new species of Tysonia and Paracynoglossum are proposed; 85 new combination are made. The thesis is illustrated by 3 colour and 3 monochrome plates, 48 line figures, 18 maps and 52 tables...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to explore and {{illustrate}} the potential of exposed roots to reconstruct larger-scale landslide activity and thus to complement tree-ring data gathered from stems to reconstruct spatio-temporal patterns of landslide reactivation. Work was undertaken in a forested area of the Davids-Bas landslide, Barcelonnette (Southeastern French Alps) and based on growth disturbances (GD) from 48 stems and on anatomical changes (decrease of cell lumina) in 20 exposed root sections of heavily affected Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata <b>Mill.</b> <b>ex</b> Mirb.) trees growing on the scarps and upon the landslide body. A total of 95 GD and 20 anatomical changes were identified in the samples pointing to 7 movements of the landslide body since AD 1977. The study demonstrates that reconstructions of landslide reactivations obtained from exposed roots samples are not significantly different from those gathered from stems, but that the inclusion of exposed roots permits realization of frequency maps in sectors which could not be documented with classic dendrogeomorphic approaches focusing on tree-ring records from stems (scars, cracks). In addition, and even more importantly, the inclusion of exposed roots allowed assessment of the geomorphic evolution of the landslide at the local scale and to detect precursor signals of major reactivations in the form of crack widening before the main movement was registered in the tree stems. In that sense, the combined approach presented in this paper can be considered as a valuable tool for land-use planners and emergency cells in charge of forecasting future events and in protecting people and their assets from the negative effects of landslides...|$|R
