She enjoyed the position she was in at the time, in another judge's section, and feared that if she were transferred she would have to recuse herself from cases where she had counseled defendants in the program.

25|$|<b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Training</b> Center problems. After {{demotion}} of Colonel Karpov, {{the first}} head of Cosmonaut Training Center, Kamanin initially supported nomination of General Odintsov. Odintsov was approved 5 April 1963, {{and in a}} few weeks proved himself completely incompetent to the task - a view allegedly supported by Korolyov and Marshal Rudenko. 17 July AirForce Military Council dismissed Odintsov; Kamanin campaigned to nominate 29-year-old Yuri Gagarin, but was stonewalled by his superiors Vershinin and Rudenko. However, in September Rodion Malinovsky reinstalled Odintsov; the situation normalized in November 1963 with appointment of General Nikolai Kuznetsov. After the death of Gagarin, Kamanin (himself ultimately responsible for all cosmonaut training) blamed Kuznetsov for a sequence of errors that allowed Gagarin and Seregin to take off on their fatal flight. Replacing Kuznetsov, again, became a long bureaucratic struggle.|$|E
500|$|A {{review of}} {{undergraduate}} flying training, {{commissioned by the}} Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Ray Funnell, and aimed at reducing failure rates and improving cost-effectiveness, saw the retirement of the CT-4s in December 1992, followed by the closure of No.1 FTS. The last RAAF flying course completed on 12June 1992, and the last Army pilots' course in December. The school was disbanded on 31January 1993, bringing to an end almost 80 years of military flying training at Point Cook, Australia's oldest military air base. The occasion was marked by a parading of the Queen's Colour and a flypast by six CT-4s {{in front of the}} new CAS, Air Marshal Barry Gration. This was followed by a service at the RAAF Chapel of the Holy Trinity overflown by four Winjeels and a Tiger Moth, and later an all-ranks dining-in night. Concurrent with the phase-out of training at No.1 FTS, British Aerospace was contracted to conduct flight grading at its base in Tamworth, New South Wales. Subsequent all-through flight training on the Pilatus PC-9 took place at No.2 FTS, Pearce. In 1998, British Aerospace was granted a contract to supply tri-service basic flying instruction at the newly formed Australian Defence Force Basic Flying Training School (ADFBFTS) in Tamworth, the first course commencing in January 1999 on CT-4B Airtrainers, and No.2 FTS again became responsible for advanced flying training only. ADFBFTS thus became, according to the school's <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> [...] "the No.1 Flying Training School you have when you don't have a No.1 Flying Training School".|$|E

2500|$|The school traces {{its origins}} to the {{creation}} of the Nizhny Novgorod Infantry Courses of the Red Army command staff on 16 November 1918 during the Russian Civil War. The courses were taught in the building of the city's former eparchal school. Among the first cadets were workers from the city's Krasnoye Sormovo Factory. The faculty were taken from experienced former Imperial Russian Army officers, known as Military specialists. Ippolit Zhilinsky taught tactics, B.N. Moravsky engineering, and K.I. Bussov shooting. The first head of the courses was former Colonel A.I. Goryachev, and the first <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> was Nikolay Pukhov. During the summer of 1919, the first group of cadets graduated and were sent into combat on the Southern Front. In 1921, the courses became the 11th Nizhny Novgorod Infantry School and the training period at the school expanded to three years.|$|E
