5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his <b>deputy</b> <b>clerk.</b> Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk. Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, {{it is likely that}} Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E

Davis {{is the mother of}} twin sons, who were born five months after her divorce from her first husband. Her third husband is the biological father of the twins who were adopted by her second husband, Joe Davis, who is also her fourth and current husband; he supports her stance against same-sex marriage. One of Davis' sons, Nathan, works in her office as a <b>deputy</b> <b>clerk</b> and has taken the same position of denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples.|$|E

He was educated in the public schools, then studied law under Judge Rice Maxey.

5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any <b>deputy</b> <b>clerk</b> who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E

The <b>deputy</b> <b>clerks</b> released statements pledging to continue issuing licenses after Davis' release and to ignore any order from her to do otherwise, complying with the federal judge's order. Licenses issued since Davis' refusal state that they are authorized by [...] "the office of the Rowan County Clerk" [...] but no longer bear her name. Davis' supporters, gathered at the Rowan County Courthouse since her first day in custody, said that her deputies were unlawfully issuing licenses and should resign or be fired.|$|R
