5|$|Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire win {{a costume}} contest as {{characters}} from The A-Team (because {{they had an}} actual black <b>guy</b> <b>as</b> B. A. Baracus and the other team had a Jewish man for the same role). The four men find Brian, {{who is writing a}} report for the local newspaper. When Peter and his friends win the costume contest, Brian writes a report about it, and is later telephoned by a member of The New Yorker, who tell him they would like him to work for their magazine. Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff, but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college. Meanwhile, disappointed at no longer being able to be The A-Team, Peter decides to become an unofficial A-Team alongside Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire, and decide to help their local community.

25|$|Their early {{attempts}} to pitch the show failed and, though they remained {{committed to the}} concept, Povenmire and Marsh began to drift apart after their work on Rocko's. Marsh moved to London and worked on shows including Postman Pat and Bounty Hamster. Povenmire began working on the primetime Fox series Family <b>Guy,</b> <b>as</b> well as Nickelodeon series SpongeBob SquarePants, always carrying a Phineas and Ferb portfolio for convenient pitching to networks like Cartoon Network and Fox Kids. These networks passed on the show, believing the series' premise was too complex to succeed.|$|E
25|$|Isabella's {{marriage}} was annulled by Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, who was Papal legate, and Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais. The Bishop of Beauvais then married her to Conrad (controversially, since {{his brother had}} been married to her half-sister and it was uncertain whether he had been divorced by his Byzantine wife). The succession dispute was prolonged {{by the arrival of}} Richard I of England and Philip II of France on the Third Crusade: Richard supported <b>Guy,</b> <b>as</b> a Poitevin vassal, while Philip supported Conrad, his late father's cousin.|$|E

25|$|Tyre, on {{the coast}} of modern-day Lebanon, was the last major Crusader city that was not {{captured}} by Muslim forces. Strategically, it would have made more sense for Saladin to capture Tyre before Jerusalem; Saladin, however, chose to pursue Jerusalem first because {{of the importance of the}} city to Islam. Tyre was commanded by Conrad of Montferrat, who strengthened its defences and withstood two sieges by Saladin. In 1188, at Tortosa, Saladin released Guy of Lusignan and returned him to his wife, Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem. They went first to Tripoli, then to Antioch. In 1189, they sought to reclaim Tyre for their kingdom but were refused admission by Conrad, who did not recognize <b>Guy</b> <b>as</b> king. Guy then set about besieging Acre.|$|E
25|$|Raymond III of Tripoli, {{first cousin}} {{of their father}} Amalric I of Jerusalem, had been bailli or regent for Baldwin IV while the latter was a child, but once the king {{came of age in}} 1176 his power began to recede. He had a claim to the throne in his own right, but his childlessness {{hindered}} him advancing it. Instead, he acted as a power-broker, and aided the interests of the Ibelin family. Amalric's widow (Isabella's mother) Maria Comnena had married Balian of Ibelin, and Raymond attempted to regain influence with a project to marry Sibylla to Balian's older brother Baldwin of Ibelin. The king countered this by marrying her to Guy of Lusignan instead in 1180. <b>Guy,</b> <b>as</b> a vassal of the Angevins, from Poitou, had the potential to attract aid from Baldwin IV's cousin Henry II of England to the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Othon's wife {{name was}} Isabel (and its variant Elisabeth). She is {{generally}} {{described as the}} daughter and heiress of Guy, lord of Ray-sur-Saône in the Free County of Burgundy. According to Longnon however, she {{was the daughter of}} Clarembaud IV of Chappes, a lord from Champagne. She gave birth to two sons, Guy and Othon. Othon inherited the lordship of Ray. Guy is traditionally held to have inherited La Roche, while the duchy is said to have passed to a nephew of Othon's also named Guy. Longnon has challenged this view according to a chart in which Othon of Ray, son of Othon de la Roche, presents the duke <b>Guy</b> <b>as</b> his brother - meaning that Guy would be Othon's son and not his nephew. While most members of the La Roche family lived in the Free County of Burgundy, some of them settled in Athens. For instance, a great-grandson of his, Walter, {{was a member of the}} Chapter of the Parthenon in 1292.|$|E

500|$|Prinz was an [...] "idea man" [...] {{rather than}} as a choreographer, {{creating}} lavish production numbers and using simple steps and dance routines.

500|$|Journalist Luke Ford {{writes that}} sex is given {{emphasis}} over story in A Free Ride. The film uses humor in its opening credits through false cast and crew names, such as A. Wise <b>Guy</b> <b>as</b> director, Will B. Hard as photographer, and Will She as the title writer. Williams describes this as [...] "crude humor" [...] and asserts it was common in American stag films produced from this time. Professor Frank A. Hoffman of University at Buffalo writes that the film's production standard indicates {{that there had been}} previous experimentation with stag films. O'Toole writes that despite the elementary nature of movies like A Free Ride, stag films became [...] "rigidified into a restricted visual experience" [...] {{in a short period of}} time.|$|E

The song also {{garnered}} Mercury a posthumous Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes Mr. Bad <b>Guy</b> <b>as</b> [...] "outstanding from start to finish" [...] and expressed his view that Mercury [...] "did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory". In particular, the album is heavily synthesiser-driven {{in a way that is}} not characteristic of previous Queen albums.|$|E

500|$|The {{patriotic}} song [...] "Gandhiyin Kai Rattiname" [...] ("The Charkha that [...] Gandhi handles"), {{also known}} as [...] "Raattinamam... Gandhi Kai Bhanamaam...", was sung by T. P.

Rajalakshmi also performed two of Tyagaraja's compositions, [...] "Enta Nerchina" [...] and [...] "Suraragadhara", the latter of which was based on the Shankarabharanam raga, for the film. Another song which Rajalakshmi performed, [...] "Manmada Baanamadaa", became immensely popular, and was described by <b>Guy</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the emotional outburst of love by the heroine". Another song, [...] "Indhiyargal Nammavarkkul Eno Veen Sandai", spoke about the Indian independence movement and the need for unity among Indians. Guy described [...] "Manmada Baanamadaa" [...] as the [...] "first hit song of Tamil Cinema". No songbook of the film is known to survive.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Grant reprised {{his role}} as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in , which, like its predecessor, made more than $262million commercially. Gone from the screen for two years, Grant next reteamed with Paul Weitz (About a Boy) for the black comedy American Dreamz (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an American Idol-like reality show where, {{according}} to Caryn James of the New York Times, [...] "nothing is real ... except the black hole at {{the centre of the}} host's heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell's villainous act to its limit." [...] American Dreamz failed financially but Grant was generously praised. He played his self-aggrandising character, an amalgam of Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, with smarmy self-loathing. The Boston Globe proposed that this [...] "just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant," [...] and critic Carina Chocano said, [...] "He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad <b>guy</b> <b>as</b> he was as the bumbling good guy." ...|$|E
