5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 7th centuryBC, the Iron-Age Etruscan civilization (Latin: Etrusci) was <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Like most of the other peoples in the region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.|$|E

5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|In 244 CE, Philip the Arab {{transformed}} Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status {{until the}} rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE.

As yet, {{there is no evidence}} attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas {{metal arc welding}} has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of internet environmental disclosure (IED) amongst Malaysian listed companies.

However, <b>dominant</b> personalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audit committee, chairman of audit and nomination committees, <b>dominant</b> personalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audit and nomination committees, and leverage did not show a significant relationship {{with the level of}} IED <b>in</b> Malaysia. <b>The</b> study provided some evidence to support signaling theory, shareholder accountability theory, and cost and benefit hypothesis in relation to internet disclosure...|$|R

5|$|The boys' {{basketball}} team was <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. Coached by Tony Queen, the team won eight of ten Minneapolis City Conference championships {{and went to}} the state tournament eight times, winning in 1980 and placing second in 1984 and 1985. In 1988 Queen was suspended from coaching for one year following attempts to recruit basketball players, which is illegal under Minnesota State High School League rules. He lost a battle to be rehired in U.S. District court. Queen was fired in 1990 for having sex with a student in the early1980s. In the mid-1990s the boys' team had a dominating resurgence. Led by Khalid El-Amin, North tied a state record with three state championships in a row, from 1995 to 1997. The boys' teams have also won championships in 2003, 2016, and 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E
