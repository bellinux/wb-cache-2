(2005) but is here somewhat revised. Nutrient balances (farm-gate balance, surface balance 1 and cattle balance) only indicate an absolute load of nutrients as a difference between input nutrients and output nutrients (kg or kg/ha). Basically they do not say anything about the efficiency of nutrient utilization. It is also possible to calculate a ratio between output and input. This type of ratio {{can be used as a}} measure of nutrient utilization efficiency. As long as the system is simple enough, i. e. a <b>farm</b> <b>without</b> <b>livestock</b> and with no recycling of nutrients, the output/input ratio indicates the efficiency of nutrient utilization.

Practical recommendation •	In conventional cultivation, the nitrogen uptake of winter oilseed rape amounts to 140 kg N per ha for a yield expectation of 35 dt per ha. In organic agriculture, about 100 kg suffice for a yield expectation of 20 - 25 dt. •	The ideal time for cultivating oilseed rape is after grass-clover or legumes. After grains, apply about 30 tonnes per ha of manure or manure compost before cultivating rapeseed. •	In dry conditions in spring, an early single application of nitrogen is preferable to two smaller applications. In the case of slurry with a low N content, two applications are often required because maximum of 40 m 3 of slurry can be applied at once. Regularly analyse the N content of slurry (regular content: 1 kg of N per m 3 of slurry or tonne of manure, respectively; range: 0, 3 kg N per m 3 for cow slurry to 3 kg N per m 3 for pig slurry).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{protective}} effect of farm upbringing on allergic rhinitis is well known, but how upbringing in other environments influences {{the development of}} allergic rhinitis is scarcely investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association between place of upbringing and pet keeping in childhood and allergic rhinitis and nasal symptoms in adulthood. METHODS: The population-based Respiratory Health in Northern Europe study includes subjects from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Estonia born in 1945 - 1973. This paper analyses 13, 376 participants of the third study wave. Six categories of place of upbringing were defined: <b>farm</b> with <b>livestock,</b> <b>farm</b> <b>without</b> <b>livestock,</b> village in rural area, small town, city suburb, and inner city. Pets in the home at birth and during childhood were recorded. Data were analysed using adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: Livestock farm upbringing predicted less adult allergic rhinitis [odds ratio (OR) 0. 68, 0. 54 - 0. 85] and nasal symptoms (OR 0. 82, 0. 68 - 0. 99) than city upbringing, and an urban-rural gradient with decreasing risk per level of urbanisation was observed (OR 0. 92, 0. 88 - 0. 94). Pets in the home at birth (OR 0. 78, 0. 68 - 0. 88) and during childhood (OR 0. 83, 0. 74 - 0. 93) were associated with less subsequent allergic rhinitis. Pet keeping did not explain the {{protective effect}} of place of upbringing. CONCLUSION: Risk of allergic rhinitis and nasal symptoms in adulthood was inversely associated with the level of urbanisation during upbringing. Pets at birth decreased the risk further, but did not explain the urban-rural gradient. Persistent beneficial effects of microbial diversity in early life might be an explanation for the findings. The two last authors contributed equally. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{production of}} mineral N and P fertilisers is unsustainable due {{its reliance on}} fossil fuels {{in the case of}} N, and on limited mineral resource stocks in the case of P. The use of alternative or complementary fertilisers that originate from organic waste materials is gaining interest. Organic farms, especially arable organic <b>farms</b> <b>without</b> <b>livestock,</b> need usable sources of plant nutrients. Meat bone meal (MBM), a potential organic fertiliser for agricultural crops, contains considerable amounts of nutrients (on average 8 % N, 5 % P, 1 % K and 10 % Ca). In EU countries, Commission regulation (EC) No 181 / 2006 authorised the use of MBM as an organic fertiliser. In this study, MBM was compared to conventional mineral NPK fertiliser. Two randomised complete block split-plot field experiments were conducted: one with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) in two years; and another with oat (Avena sativa) for three years, including a fourth year of testing for residual effect. Compared to mineral fertiliser (20 % N, 3 % P and 9 % K), MBM was applied at three N levels: 60, 90 and 120 kg N ha- 1. The grain yield of both cereal species supported by MBM, did not differ from the yield obtained with the mineral fertiliser at any N level. At 120 kg N ha- 1, the grain yield level with either type was ca. 4500 kg ha- 1 of barley and 5000 kg ha- 1 of oat, representing fair averages for Finnish conditions. Moreover, MBM and mineral fertilisation showed no differences in quality in terms of 1000 -grain weight, test-weight, protein content and protein yield. Since MBM has a low N/P ratio, P was applied in surplus to attain comparable N levels. Therefore MBM fertilisation should be fitted for crop rotation and for meeting environmental requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{of organic}} waste can improve its {{nutrient}} availability and content, and thereby increases the agricultural {{value of the}} waste when used as fertilisers, while contributing to a more bio-based, ‘circular’ economy. It is therefore important to guide future policies on waste management and {{on the development of}} industries related to processing of organic wastes from agriculture, industry and households. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the decision-making processes underlying the use of processed and unprocessed organic waste-based fertilisers by farmers. We conducted a survey asking farmers in Denmark about their current use of organic fertiliser, their interest in using alternative types in the future, and their perception of most important barriers or advantages to using organic fertilisers. A representative sample of farmers with > 10 ha of land were sent a questionnaire; in total 452 responses (28 % response rate) were received. Almost three quarters of respondents (72 %) used organic fertiliser, and half of the arable/horticultural <b>farms</b> (<b>without</b> <b>livestock)</b> used unprocessed manures, suggesting significant manure exchange from animal production farms to arable farms in Denmark. Looking forward three years from the time of the survey, respondents did not expect to increase the amount of organic fertiliser they used. However, future interest in using processed manures (PRO) and urban waste-derived fertiliser (URB) was greater than their use at the time of the survey (66 % interest vs 19 % current use of PRO and 32 % vs 9 % current use of URB). Anaerobically-digested slurry, acidified slurry, and composted/thermally-dried manure or slurry were products of particular interest. A large percentage (40 %) of farmers did not have access to processed forms of organic fertiliser, particularly PRO (35 % of respondents). Farm and farmer characteristics such as farming activity, farmer age, farm size, and conventional/organic farming influenced the likelihood of future interest in alternative organic fertilisers. The most important barriers to the use of organic fertiliser identified among respondents were: unpleasant odour for neighbours, uncertainty in nutrient content, and difficulty in planning and use. Improved soil structure was clearly chosen as the most important advantage or reason to use organic fertiliser, followed by low cost to buy or produce, and ease of availability. Danish government policies aim to increase in manure processing (e. g. increasing anaerobic digestion for bioenergy recovery). A mix of industry and government-led measures could potentially increase availability and farmer-use to meet these targets. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{nitrogen}} requirement {{varies depending on}} variety and usage. The conventional fertilisation amounts to 120 kg of N per ha in table potatoes and potatoes for processing. Early potatoes and seed potatoes require slightly less nitrogen at about 100 kg of N per ha. The nitrogen supply strongly depends on the conditions for N mineralisation (weather, humus content of the soil, preceding crop residues). Thus, optimising the N supply is complex. Nitrogen from the preceding crop: Grain legumes or cereals in combination with green manure are favourable preceding crops. Field peas may leave behind up to 50 kg net weight of available nitrogen, a mixture of grain legumes and barley up to 30 kg. Depending on the preceding crop and the soil, the nitrogen left behind may amount to zero. Using grass-clover ley as a preceding crop {{is not an option}} due to the high risk of wireworm infestation. Manure as basic fertiliser: A dosage of 15 to maximum 30 tonnes of manure per ha (1 - 2 kg of available N per t) in autumn during the preceding crop serves as basic nitrogen fertilisation. Mineralisation occurs slowly during the entire growth period. A dosage of manure also covers the high potassium demand of potatoes. <b>Farms</b> <b>without</b> <b>livestock</b> need to cover the K supply by using approved mineral fertilisers. Due to the risk of Rhizoctonia, only well-rotted or composted manure should be used. Manure compost has, like other composts, a low N effect. Undiluted cattle slurry: Depending on the slurry’s N content (1 - 3 kg of available N/m 3), 30 - 90 m 3 of slurry {{can be applied to the}} preceding crop or at a plant height of 10 - 20 cm the latest (i. e. before creating the ridges) and worked into the soil. Later applications of slurry only promoted haulm growth and delay the maturation of the tubers. Commercial fertiliser: An additional dosage of fertiliser of about 30 - 60 kg of N per ha with a granulated, quickly mineralising commercial N fertiliser can complement the missing nitrogen supply. It should be applied during spring at planting or at the first round of hoeing the latest. In case of lacking farm manure, up to 90 kg of total N can be applied per ha. The coarser the grains, the earlier the commercial fertiliser needs to be applied. In Swiss trials, the yield of potatoes was increased by up to 30...|$|R
40|$|In organic <b>farming</b> systems <b>without</b> <b>livestock</b> some {{problems}} arise concerning the nitrogen management: On the one hand, {{there is a}} lack of transportable nitrogen fertilisers, on the other hand there is a potential for high losses with the usual management. The biological N 2 fixation is decreased, when clover grass is mulched. If the biomass of intercrops and clover grass gets mineralised in autumn, it can be leached in winter. In the trial referred to here, the impact of fermentation of biomass on some agricultural parameters like yield etc. are investigated within a crop-rotation of clover grass, potatoes, winter wheat, peas, winter wheat and summer wheat with undersown clover grass. Intercrops are sown after winter wheat and peas. In the control variant the coupled products (clover grass, straw and intercrops) are left on the field as mulch. In the biogas system this material is harvested for digesting. The remaining products are used as fertilisers. There are liquid products which were used to fertilise the winter wheat and solid ones, which were used for fertilizing potatoes and summer wheat. This system allows a higher efficiency of the nitrogen management: The yield and the content of raw protein in winter wheat increased. The solid material did not mineralise as fast as necessary. It would be better to add this material to the intercrops. ...|$|R

We determined statistically significant (P 0. 01) higher concentration of IgG at the beginning of farrowing, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours from beginning of farrowing in favour of <b>farm</b> <b>without</b> presence of PRRS.
