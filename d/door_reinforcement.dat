40|$|Full-scale {{wind tunnel}} {{experiments}} and analysis using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) are already developed {{and applied to}} {{the research and development}} processes of current passenger vehicles. (^ 1) But from the viewpoint of the indoor aspiration noise during high speed driving, the vibration of a passenger vehicle's door frame is a major influence. The vibrational deformation gives rise to aspiration noise, which is airborne sound transmitted through the gap between the door panel frame and the sealing system mounted on the body panel. The optimised design of a passenger vehicle’s door frame can lead us to the minimisation of aspiration noise. The optimisation is carried out by the finite element analysis of the vibration of the passenger vehicle's door panel assembly under steady-state sinusoidal dynamic air pressure. The commercial analysis package ABAQUS((^ 5 - 9)) is applied to all analyses in this thesis. The thesis concludes with recommendations for <b>door</b> <b>reinforcement</b> configurations to reduce aspiration wind noise, but such an optimum must be considered in relation to the associated financial costs and weight penalties...|$|E
40|$|A major {{challenge}} of lightweight construction of car bodies, particularly with materials with high density, such as steel, {{is the need}} to use a very low wall thickness. This makes the structures sus-ceptible to buckling, especially in crash load cases. The DLR’s institute of vehicle concepts therefore investigates the use of hybrid structures, for exam-ple by reinforcing the steel shell of a beam with lightweight cores. This leads to a higher stability of the structure, especially for the side impact or the pole crash, which results in a much higher weight specific energy absorption. In order to maximize the performance, a specific balance between several parameters such as the wall thickness, the material properties of the core and material properties of the shell, must be achieved. A multi-parameter optimization was therefore conducted, using LS-Dyna and LS-Opt, in order to maximize the weight specific energy absorption. Also, the impact of different materials on the performance of such structures was investigated. Possible uses for metal-hybrid structures are a rocker rail, or a <b>door</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> for example. They are also extensively used in the car body of a lightweight vehicle which is currently under de-velopment at the institute of vehicle concepts...|$|E
40|$|Uma forma encontrada na indústria automobilística de reduzir os consumos associados à fabricação é a utilização de chapas de diferentes espessuras soldadas a laser. Essas chapas são comercialmente denominadas de {{tailored}} blanks, onde os principais objetivos são as reduções do peso e do custo final do produto. As abordagens da análise do valor em tailored blanks se tornam cada vez mais adequada visto esta ser uma tecnologia cada vez mais usada na produção de veículos. A peça em estudo foi o reforço interno da porta dianteira de um veículo quatro portas nacional. O objetivo deste trabalho foi à utilização da metodologia da Análise do Valor, na obtenção de resultados financeiros que possam tornar o produto mais competitivo, segundo a análise das funções do produto. Como resultado destaca-se que o custo no Brasil da utilização de tailored blanks, para a peça de tamanho médio que foi estudada em 2004, mostrou-se financeiramente inviável. O custo de manufatura por estampagem é muito superior à economia gerada pela redução de consumo da matéria-prima. Nowadays, {{the automobile}} industry is using blanks with different thickness denominated tailored blanks. The main objectives are {{the reduction of the}} weight and of the final cost of the product. The use of tailored blanks is a technology more and more used in the vehicle production. The Analyses of the Value approaches in the tailored blanks technology used in automobile industry are becoming even more adequate. The studied product was the internal front <b>door</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of a four doors national vehicle. The objective of this work was the use of the Analysis of the Value methodology in order to obtain financial results that can propitiate a more competitive product, according to the analysis product functions. The results showed that the tailored blank cost in Brazil is financially unviable for the medium piece that was studied in 2004. The manufacture cost is very superior in relation to the economy generated by the raw material consumption reduction...|$|E

Similar renovations and reconstructions were carried out in 1939 (new roof and <b>doors)</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> of the chapel cracks with six boxes of wire mesh in 1963.|$|R

50|$|The Russian {{standard}} design practice also usually mandated fully shuttered engines {{in order to}} cope with the extreme temperatures. A slightly shorter span was incorporated but many of the other alterations were less evident. The passenger door was moved to {{the right side of the}} fuselage, with a top-opening cargo door on the left side in place of the original passenger <b>door.</b> The structural <b>reinforcement</b> included slightly heavier skins necessitated since the metric skin gauges were not exact duplicates of the American alloy sheet metal. Standard Russian metric hardware was different and the various steel substructures such as engine mounts and landing gear, wheels, and tires were also quite different from the original design. Later modifications allowed the provision of ski landing gear in order to operate in remote and Arctic regions. The first PS-84s began to emerge from the GAZ-84 production line by 1939.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of the battle, Roger speaks over the radio to the marines, {{explaining}} why he'd been so angry at his mother and the reasons that they found themselves on Marduk, stating that he still loves her both as a mother and as an empress and pledging to get all of them back home to Earth and to discuss the matter with his mother. The marines, encouraged by this, set off to the battle field while Roger, Pahner {{and the rest of the}} guards are ordered to join Radj in viewing the battle from the palace balcony. As arranged, the plasma cannon team carries the weapon into range and fires it at the Pasulian guards on the other side, who jump at first sight of the weapon. Once the bridge is clear, the rest of the marines and the Marshadan army cross to the Pasulian side and begin the assault on the city while the plasma cannon is hauled to the top of a hill (followed by a group of soldiers Radj has sent to keep an eye on them). Soon after, the smaller Pasulian army is spotted coming out of the city. Just as the two forces are about to meet, the marines spring their trap. The plasma cannon is turned upon the Marshadan army while the forces guarding the marines manning the cannon are blown apart by directional mines and the bridge explodes, cutting off their line of retreat. Pahner takes the king down while Roger and his bodyguards quickly dispatch with the king's guards and use their bodies to block the <b>door</b> until their <b>reinforcements</b> in the barracks get there.|$|R
