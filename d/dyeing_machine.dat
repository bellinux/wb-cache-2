40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of dyeing, the {{temperature}} control of <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> plays a decisive role on the stand or fall quality of fabric. The establishment of the traditional PID controller’s parameters {{needs a lot of}} test, which brings many inconvenience. Therefore, it is proposed to control <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> temperature by fuzzy controller. Based on the principle of fuzzy logic control, the model of the temperature control system of <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> is built. At the same time, through the fuzzy logic toolbox in matlab software, fuzzy controller of temperature is designed. Then a comparative simulation of the temperature control system of <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> with matlab has been accomplished. Through the analysis of the results, it is concluded that the temperature system can achieve the higher steady precision...|$|E

50|$|Fabric dyeing, {{also known}} as piece dyeing, is dyeing fabric {{after it has been}} constructed. It is {{economical}} and the most common method of dyeing solid colored fabrics. The decision regarding color can be made after the fabric has been manufactured. Thus, it is suitable for quick response orders. Dye penetration may not be good in thicker fabrics, so yarn dyeing is sometimes used to dye thick fabrics in solid colors. Various types of <b>dyeing</b> <b>machines</b> are used for piece dyeing. The selection of the equipment is based on factors such as dye and fabric characteristics, cost, and the intended end use.|$|R

40|$|Polyester dyeing in {{atmospheric}} machinery {{relies on}} the use of carriers. Carriers suffer from a number of disad-vantages. The use of some carriers is also inappropriate due to their toxicity or polluting effects. The more environmen-tally benign carriers are generally less effective in promoting dye diffusion in polyester, The beck <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> is still widely used for dyeing piece goods, although the inherent heating and flow patterns limits the average temperature achievable to 200 °F or less. A modifica-tion to beck machines is being patented which ensures full boiling throughout the machine, and allows and achieves faster ramp rates. A series of experiments has been conducted to examine the effectiveness two carriers on the yields of disperse dyes at temperatures typical of tradition-al becks, and modified “Maxitemp”” becks. For a given carrier, small increas-es in temperature give notable increas-es in yield, the effect being greater for the “greener ” carrier, and more notice-able when the dyeing was conducted in open vessels. The patent pending Maxitemp* machine/modification allows significant-ly higher temperatures to be achieved in beck machines, and allow for the use of “greener ” carriers with no loss of yield or increase in dyeing time. For existing systems, such a modification allows shorter dyeing cycles and increased yields. Table I: Temperature variation within beck <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine.</b> ...|$|E
