5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Anne {{formally}} {{married on}} 25 January 1533, after a secret wedding on 14 November 1532. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Anne's marriage valid. Shortly afterwards, the Pope decreed sentences of excommunication against <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Cranmer. As {{a result of}} this marriage and these excommunications, the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King's control. Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533. On 7 September, she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. Anne subsequently had three miscarriages, and by March 1536, Henry was courting Jane Seymour. In order to marry Jane Seymour, Henry had to find reasons for his marriage with Anne to end.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with his two surviving heirs was fraught, for, while the King had great affection for his youngest son John, he showed little warmth towards Richard and indeed seems to have borne him a grudge after their argument in 1184. The bickering and simmering tensions between <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Richard were cleverly exploited by the new French king, Philip Augustus. Philip had come to power in 1180 and he rapidly demonstrated {{that he could be}} an assertive, calculating and manipulative political leader. Initially <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Philip Augustus had enjoyed a good relationship. Despite attempts to divide the two, <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Philip Augustus agreed a joint alliance, even though this cost the French king the support of Flanders and Champagne. Philip Augustus regarded Geoffrey as a close friend, and would have welcomed him as a successor to Henry. With the death of Geoffrey, however, the relationship between <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Philip broke down.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Matilda and William, Henry may possibly {{have had a}} short-lived son, Richard, from his first marriage. <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> his second wife, Adeliza, had no children.|$|E
5|$|John flirts with Catherine at a ball, {{but she is}} more {{interested}} in meeting with <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> his sister, Eleanor (Catherine Walker). Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made plans for a walk with <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Eleanor love books as much as she does.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Dover, <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Anne married in a secret ceremony on November 14, 1532. She soon became pregnant and, to legalise the first wedding considered to be unlawful at the time, {{there was a second}} wedding service, also private in accordance with The Royal Book, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. Events now began to move at a quick pace. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer (who had been hastened, with the Pope's assent, into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the death of Warham) sat in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He thereupon declared the marriage of <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Catherine null and void. Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Anne to be good and valid.|$|E

5|$|By early 1862, {{a single}} general, Albert Sidney Johnston, {{commanded}} all the Confederate forces from Arkansas to the Cumberland Gap, but his forces were spread too thinly {{over a wide}} defensive line. Johnston's left flank was Polk, in Columbus with 12,000 men; his right flank was Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 4,000 men; the center consisted of two forts, Forts <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Donelson, {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, also with 4,000 men. Forts <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Donelson were the sole positions defending the important Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively.

5|$|During {{the first}} four years of Henry's reign Gerard was one of the king's chief advisors, along with Robert of Meulan, Count of Meulan in Normandy and later Earl of Leicester. Gerard was one of Henry's {{greatest}} supporters among the bishops during the Investiture Crisis. In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Robert, the Count of Flanders, which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> King Philip I of France. After Gerard's return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham. In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused. From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join Bohemond of Antioch, who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure. In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did. At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few months, Cranmer and the king worked on {{establishing}} legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts of the procedures have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once the procedures were agreed, Cranmer opened his court on 10 May, inviting <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> Anne's marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod. Pope Clement VII was furious at this defiance, {{but he could not}} take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated <b>Henry</b> <b>and</b> his advisers (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth. Cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.|$|E
