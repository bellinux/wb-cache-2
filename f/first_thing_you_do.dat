2500|$|One of the suspects' supporters, Reverend Calvin O. Butts of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, told The New York Times, [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in the United States of America when a {{white woman}} is raped is round up a bunch of black youths, and I think that's what {{happened}} here." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{awaiting}} sentencing, Madoff {{met with}} the SEC's Inspector General, H. David Kotz, who conducted an investigation into how regulators had failed to detect the fraud despite numerous red flags. Madoff said {{he could have been}} caught in 2003, but that bumbling investigators had acted like [...] "Lt. Colombo" [...] and never asked the right questions: I was astonished. They never even looked at my stock records. If investigators had checked with The Depository Trust Company, a central securities depository, it would've been easy for them to see. If you're looking at a Ponzi scheme, it's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Madoff said in the June 17, 2009, interview that SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro was a [...] "dear friend", and SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter was a [...] "terrific lady" [...] whom he knew [...] "pretty well".|$|E

6000|$|... "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> must <b>do,</b> my boy," [...] said North, kindly, [...] "is {{to return}} to your father's 'ouse; an' that advice cuts two ways--'eaven-ward an' earth-ward." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 205, after Cao Cao had {{defeated}} the Yuan brothers and taken over Ji Province, {{he wanted to}} recruit Cui Yan {{to serve as an}} Attendant Officer (別駕從事; an aide-de-camp) under him. He told the latter, [...] "According to official records, there are 300,000 troops under my command now. (Ji Province) is indeed a large province." [...] Cui Yan replied, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state of}} chaos and the Nine Provinces are divided, while the Yuan brothers fight among themselves and the bodies of the dead are scattered throughout the wilderness. The people have yet to see how your forces will bring benevolent rule and relief aid to them and liberate them from war and disaster, but now the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is to check the records for the numbers of troops and military equipment you've obtained. Is this what the people in this province expect of you?" [...] Those present at the scene were all startled by Cui Yan's response. Cao Cao's facial expression changed and he thanked Cui Yan for his advice.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
5000|$|... "She's in Fashion" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the most summery-sounding pop song Suede have recorded." [...] Obtaining this sound required months of heavy production work, several re-recordings and a lot of experimentation. Co-writer and keyboardist Neil Codling said the song was recorded in four different styles, in order [...] "to have that summer feel." [...] According to Osborne, the recording process took six months and several studios were used. [...] "It happens quite often that you go on a journey, attempt various things and end up preferring the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> 'Fashion' was a song that we started {{in the first week of}} recording -- but we didn't finish it until the very last week!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Gillie, my boy," [...] {{interrupted}} the Captain, [...] "one o' the very <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have to <b>do</b> in larnin' to behave yourself is to clap a stopper on your tongue--it's far too long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{plunge into}} the woods for change, for solitude," [...] the girl said, [...] "and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is to find me waylaying you {{in the depths of}} the forest. But I really couldn't--if you'll reflect upon it--know you were coming this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't fail {{to deliver}} it the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> on landing. And hark'ee, Spink, go to Mrs Brand's cottage, and tell them there why I went away. Be sure you see them all, and explain why it was. Tell Minnie Gray that I will be certain to return, if God spares me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But not alone," [...] said I. And {{together}} {{we walked through}} the woods, over the little field and across the Havelot lawn to the house. We {{were told that the}} old gentleman was in his library, and {{together we}} entered the room. Mr. Havelot was sitting by a table on which were lying several open volumes of an encyclopedia. When he turned and saw us, he closed his book, pushed back his chair and took off his spectacles. [...] "Upon my word, sir," [...] he cried; [...] "and so the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> after they pull you out of the earth is to come here and break my commands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's Tom, {{wanting to}} see it all before he sleeps!" [...] cried Sam Rover with a grin. [...] "You look out, Tom, that you don't get into disgrace the <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> when we went to Putnam Hall Don't you {{remember}} that giant firecracker, and how Josiah Crabtree locked you up in a cell for setting it off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{whatever}} else comes of it, you see," [...] cried Hadden, [...] "we get our keep for nothing.--Come, buy some togs, that's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> have to <b>do</b> of course; and then we'll take a hansom {{and go to}} the 'Currency Lass.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> must <b>do,</b> Mr. Byrne," [...] she said, [...] "is {{to learn}} to speak correctly. You mustn't say 'youse' for 'you,' or 'wot' for 'what'---you must try to talk as I talk. No {{one in the world}} speaks any {{language}} faultlessly, but there are certain more or less obvious irregularities of grammar and pronunciation that are particularly distasteful to people of refinement, and which are easy to guard against if one be careful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir!" [...] said Willis, slowly. [...] "I thought I {{had to do}} with a gentleman: but I have {{my doubts}} of it now. A poor girl risks her life to drag you out of that sea, which but for her would have hove your body up to lie along with that line there,"--and Willis pointed to the ghastly row--" [...] and your soul gone to give in its last account--You only know what that would have been like--And the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in payment is to accuse her of robbing you--her, that the very angels in heaven, I believe, are glad to keep company with;" [...] and the old man turned and paced the beach in fierce excitement.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the course}} of his talk he rambled into a {{criticism}} upon New England degrees of merit in ship building. Said he, [...] "You get a vessel built away down Maine-way; Bath, for instance; what's the result? <b>First</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you want to heave her down for repairs--that's the result! Well, sir, she hain't been hove down a week till you can heave a dog through her seams. You send that vessel to sea, and what's the result? She wets her oakum the first trip! Leave it to any man if 'tain't so. Well, you let our folks build you a vessel--down New Bedford-way. What's the result? Well, sir, you might take that ship and heave her down, and keep her hove down six months, and she'll never shed a tear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care {{if she is}} pretty. What's that to me? I've got {{you through}} college, Joseph; and a hard time I've had of it, a-delvin' and slavin'; and here you come, and the very <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> you must take and court that 'ere 'Squire Jones's daughter, who was always putting himself up above me. Besides, I mean to have the law on that estate yet; and Deacon Dudley, he will have the law, too; and it will cut off the best piece of land the girl has; {{and when you get}} married, I mean you shall have something. It's jest a trick of them gals at me; but I guess I'll come up with 'em yet. I'm just a-goin' down to have a 'regular hash' with old Silence, to let her know she can't come round me that way." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thalberg suggested, [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> should <b>do</b> is {{establish}} a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations." [...] Laemmle immediately agreed, [...] "All right. You're it." [...] In shock, Thalberg replied, [...] "I'm what?" [...] Laemmle told him {{to take charge of}} the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919. At age 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development.|$|R
40|$|What was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> when <b>you</b> {{found out}} that you were HIV positive? I was in a {{combination}} of shock and denial. If it weren't for the mixed emotions, I would have probably cried. I believe that I did cry eventually. I {{had been sitting in}} this nurse's office waiting for a while, thinking that it shouldn't be taking this long. Then, I realized that I already knew that I was HIV positive. The nurse who took my blood two weeks before came into the small office, said hello without looking at me and sat at the desk. He put my file on the desk, sat in the swivel chair and turned to face me. He smiled; I smiled. I could tell from the way he was acting that he wasn't going to tell me anything that I didn't already know. Finally, after listening to his well-rehearsed lines about sex, safer sex, my limited treatment options (in November of 1990) and whether or not I had any questions, I was in a daze. So, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I did when I {{found out that}} I was HIV positive was walk out of the walk-in clinic...|$|R
5000|$|In their later years, Joe and Mary K. Shell {{became a}} {{political}} [...] "power couple" [...] in Bakersfield and were often sought out for advice and friendship by aspiring Republican candidates for office. At {{the funeral of}} Joe Shell on April 11, 2008, former Kern County Sheriff Carl Sparks recalled that [...] "when I ran for sheriff people told me, ‘The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> gotta <b>do</b> is go see Mary and Joe.' That {{he was willing to}} see you at all and talk to you as a person was a privilege." ...|$|R
6000|$|Judge Douglas {{also makes}} the {{declaration}} that I say the Democrats are bound by the Dred Scott decision, while the Republicans are not. In {{the sense in which}} he argues, I never said it; but I will tell you what I have said and what I do not hesitate to repeat to-day. I have said that as the Democrats believe that decision to be correct, and that the extension of slavery is affirmed in the National Constitution, they are bound to support it as such; and I will tell you here that General Jackson once said each man was bound to support the Constitution [...] "as he understood it." [...] Now, Judge Douglas understands the Constitution according to the Dred Scott decision, and he is bound to support it as he understands it. I understand it another way, and therefore I am bound to support it {{in the way in which}} I understand it. And as Judge Douglas believes that decision to be correct, I will remake that argument if I have time to do so. Let me talk to some gentleman down there among you who looks me in the face. We will say you are a member of the Territorial Legislature, and, like Judge Douglas, you believe that the right to take and hold slaves there is a constitutional right The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is to swear you will support the Constitution, and all rights guaranteed therein; that you will, whenever your neighbor needs your legislation to support his constitutional rights, not withhold that legislation. If you withhold that necessary legislation for the support of the Constitution and constitutional rights, do you not commit perjury? I ask every sensible man if that is not so? That is undoubtedly just so, say what you please. Now, that is precisely what Judge Douglas says, that this is a constitutional right. Does the Judge mean to say that the Territorial Legislature in legislating may, by withholding necessary laws, or by passing unfriendly laws, nullify that constitutional right? Does he mean to say that? Does he mean to ignore the proposition so long and well established in law, that what you cannot do directly, you cannot do indirectly? Does he mean that? The truth about the matter is this: Judge Douglas has sung paeans to his [...] "Popular Sovereignty" [...] doctrine until his Supreme Court, co-operating with him, has squatted his Squatter Sovereignty out. But he will keep up this species of humbuggery about Squatter Sovereignty. He has at last invented this sort of do-nothing sovereignty,--that the people may exclude slavery by a sort of [...] "sovereignty" [...] that is exercised by doing nothing at all. Is not that running his Popular Sovereignty down awfully? Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death? But at last, when it is brought to the test of close reasoning, there is not even that thin decoction of it left. It is a presumption impossible in the domain of thought. It is precisely no other than the putting of that most unphilosophical proposition, that two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time. The Dred Scott decision covers the whole ground, and while it occupies it, there is no room even for the shadow of a starved pigeon to occupy the same ground.|$|E

5000|$|Archer said, [...] "When {{you first}} buy a mobile phone what's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> Most {{of the traffic}} on mobile phones is {{obviously}} pornography, and we're just filling the niche between pornography and music, put them together and there you find the alternative Cash Machine video." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, George! It {{is of no}} use for you to talk big in that way. You {{would not}} dare to fire a gun in such a case, still less, to shoot a man. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> would be to run away and hide. And then, besides, {{it would be very}} wicked for you to kill a man in that way. You would be very likely to get {{yourself}} hung for murder. Besides, the Bible says that we must not resist evil; so you should not talk so coolly about shooting a man." ...|$|R

[...] "I was listening for a count. That's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> but I never heard a count because Clay never went to a neutral corner." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shawn Michaels' {{loss was}} criticized by Triple H the {{following}} night on Raw Is War, blaming him for overlooking Tyson's potential double-cross.

You look to your buddies. You look to your friends.
