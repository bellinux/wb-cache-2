40|$|Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act is the Supreme Court of Canada’s most {{important}} ruling on {{the criminal law}} power {{in more than a}} decade. It demonstrates that the Court has become uncomfortable with the federal government’s use of section 91 (27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 as Parliament’s <b>general</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>power.</b> The paper begins with a review of the Assisted Human Reproduction Act, with particular reference to those aspects of the statute at issue in the Reference. Next, the three opinions delivered in the Reference are analyzed and their doctrinal significance identified. Finally, consideration is given to the implications for future federalism cases of the principles flowing from the Reference and how in its wake the regulation of health generally and of assisted reproduction technologies particularly should proceed. The author argues that the federalism principles emerging from the Reference are to be welcomed as they will assist in ensuring that the criminal law power does not become the source of wide-ranging civic regulation...|$|E

40|$|Background: Reducing {{nicotine}} content in cigarettes and other combustible products to levels {{that are not}} reinforcing or addictive {{has the potential to}} substantially reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. The authority to reduce nicotine levels as a regulatory measure is provided in the U. S. Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and is consistent with the <b>general</b> <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> envisioned under the relevant articles of the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Many experts have considered reducing nicotine in cigarettes to be a feasible national policy approach, but more research is necessary. Purpose: This article describes proceedings from a conference that had the goals of identifying specific research gaps, describing methods and measures to consider for addressing these gaps, and considering ways to foster collaboration. Results and Conclusion: Identified research gaps included determining the dose of nicotine that would be optimal for reducing and extinguishing cigarette use, examining approaches for reducing nicotine levels in the general and special populations of smokers, understanding how constituents other than nicotine may contribute to the reinforcing effects of tobacco, and identifying unintended consequences to determine ways to mitigate them. Methods that can be used ranged from brain imaging to large human clinical trials. The development and availability of valid biomarkers of exposure and effect are important. Infrastructures to facilitate collaboration need to be established. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.

The analysis shows that sophisticated combinations of harmonised European rules along with sufficient scope for decentralised decisions of national regulators seem to be optimal. Especially interesting is that networks of regulatory authorities (as BEREC in telecommunications) can play an important role in regard to balancing the advantages and disadvantages of (de) centralisation. Whereas in regard to telecommunication a further shifting of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> to the EU level cannot be recommended, both in energy and railway markets it might still be necessary to strengthen the <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> of the EU...|$|R

40|$|In the post‐liberalization era, {{regulation}} of network utilities {{has often been}} entrusted to independent regulatory agencies (or IRA’s), which have since {{become one of the}} main institutional features of the rising regulatory state (Gilardi 2002). These institutions, however, do not exist in a regulatory vacuum: they operate in a context of a wider set of authorities with <b>general</b> or sector‐based <b>regulatory</b> competencies. As in most sectors, the regulatory tasks – comprised of rule implementation and standard setting, licensing, monitoring and enforcement (Hood et al. 2001) – are distributed or shared among several public actors. This network of public actors can be seen to form a regulatory constellation or arrangement. Sector‐specific regulatory agencies are but one component of this regulatory arrangement, which can have different features depending on the country and/or sector analyzed. This paper explores to what extent and in what way the autonomy of independent regulatory agencies towards government relates t the <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> and position of these agencies in the broader regulatory arrangement. A sector‐specific IRA has a strong <b>regulatory</b> position and <b>power</b> when (1) it can take most or all decisions on sector‐related regulatory issues, independently from influence from external actors (i. e. formal position and <b>regulatory</b> <b>power),</b> and (2) when the IRA is perceived by all relevant actors (regulatees and other regulatory bodies involved in the {{regulation of}} a sector) to be the most central, important and influential actor for the regulation of the market at stake (i. e. perceived position and <b>regulatory</b> <b>power)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of mutual recognition is almost universally acclaimed for removing barriers to trade, for enabling regulatory competition, and for preserving scope for regulatory autonomy instead of {{embarking on a}} path to harmonisation and centralisation. By using economic theories of legal federalism and regulatory competition, this paper shows that mutual recognition leads {{to a number of}} inconsistencies, which question its suitability as a conflict of law rule that guarantees a stable allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> within a two-level system of regulations. Mutual recognition should be understood more as a dynamic principle, which triggers a reallocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> between different jurisdictional levels. It leads either back to the country of destination principle, to a free market for regulations, or to harmonisation. The European experience suggests that a regime of mutual recognition is primarily another path to convergence and harmonisation, instead of being an instrument that preserves decentralised <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> or even <b>regulatory</b> competition. The welfare gains from achieving market integration should be balanced against the welfare losses of an inefficient allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers.</b> Copyright 2008 The Authors.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of organizational variety in regulatory governance must recognize that, {{contrary to the}} classical agency model, regulatory functions are commonly diffused {{among a number of}} public and sometimes private bodies. A regimes approach assists in understanding the ways in which diffuse <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> is exercised and in identifying central issues for analysis. In this article, six parameters for classifying organizations in regulatory regimes are addressed: ownership, legal form, funding, functions, powers, and governance level. An exploration of these parameters is suggestive of novel approaches to questions of independence and accountability. With wide diffusion of <b>regulatory</b> <b>power,</b> interdependence is as much a hallmark of the regulatory state as the application of any strong independence doctrine. Accountability may be better conceived as consisting both of formal judicial and political mechanisms and of informal day-to-day ways in which those exercising <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> have to account to others co-located within the space of a particular regulatory regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{investment}} of a regulated firm affects the service/good provided on many dimensions. Should an integrated regulator {{take care of}} them all? Or is it better to have separate regulators responsible for them? We analyze the effect of the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> on the regulated firm's ex ante incentive to invest in a "cooperative" innovation. The effects of the innovation are not verifiable and the cost of investing is sunk, hence, there is a problem of hold-up. We find that when the innovation produces opposite effects the ex ante firm's incentive to invest is larger in the case of separation than in the case of integrated regulation. We also stress the risk of over-investment that the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> may induce. We maintain that along with classical incentive regulation-which mainly provides incentives for the firm to be efficient-the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> {{may play a role in}} providing an incentive for cooperative innovations.
