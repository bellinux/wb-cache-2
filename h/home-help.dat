40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{study the effects of}} {{preventive}} and rehabilitative interventions for employees at work despite pain at predominantly female workplaces, and further development of analysis methods. The study had two intervention groups and two non-randomised reference groups. Hospital cleaners and <b>home-helps</b> were selected as intervention and reference groups for the empirical studies. In the first three studies the subjects were women with pain problems. In the last two studies only hospital cleaners were involved, but the selection was broadened to include everyone employed at the workplaces at the time. The hospital cleaners' intervention programme comprised occupational organisational measures, competence development, physical and psychosocial working environmental and rehabilitation measures on both an individual and a group basis. The <b>home-help's</b> programme comprised a 2 -week stay at an orthopaedic rehabilitation unit, training of supervisors, massage by colleagues, purchase of training equipment and stress management. The intervention lasted 12 months for the hospital cleaners and 8 months for the <b>home-helps.</b> A classical model for quasi-experimental design was used in the first three studies. In the last two studies, statistical control was applied as a complement. In Study 1, all four groups experienced substantial lowering in quality of life related to the three dimensions: bodily pain, general health perception and vitality. No effects of the intervention were demonstrated. In the hospital cleaners' intervention group, the introduction of new cleaning materials and methods seemed to contribute to a reduction in workload, allowing them to take more rest breaks during working time (Study 11). In the home-helps' intervention group, a reduction both in workload and in more responsible tasks were shown, together with reduced psychosomatic stress reactions. Study III showed a very high prevalence of rotator cuff myalgia/tendinitis, myalgia/tendinitis of the dorsal neck and relatively high prevalence of myalgia/tendinitis in hip muscles. Neurogenic pain was rare. No fibromyalgia syndrome was found. Limited effects were shown on the pain outcome measures. After the intervention, more intervention than reference group subjects had an improved clinical picture. In Study IV a simple comparison did not demonstrate differences, but the intervention produced a difference in total absenteeism in the younger age group when a number of covariates were included. Those with previously high sickness absence reduced their total absence most. The interchangeability of short-term sickness absence and short- term leave was reduced. The intervention was shown to contribute to preventing an increase in sickness absence costs at the company level (Study V). The two models of analysis gave approximately the same monetary outcome. An integrated model showed that the intervention had a greater net effect on the younger group, with a number of significant interactions. The pay-back time for the younger group was just under one year, but with a very wide spread. These particular interventions gave only moderate outcomes. The validity of the intervention effects is discussed, together with the importance of matching the intervention measures to the needs at the workplaces...|$|R

40|$|Dependency or independence? A {{qualitative}} {{study of how}} elderly <b>home-help</b> recipients regard having help and support Knowledge on elderly people’s understandings of dependence and independence is relatively scarce {{even though there is}} plenty of gerontological research on related topics. Although we know how to define and measure different types of dependency, we know, in fact, very little about how elderly <b>home-help</b> recipients themselves regard their situation in terms of dependency, independence and autonomy. This article aims to shed light on <b>home-help</b> recipients’ understandings of these constructs and on how they make sense of their situation. The analysis is based on 29 semi-structured interviews with people between the ages of 77 and 93. The findings show how these home help recipients differentiate between having help and support and being dependent on other people. Through the separation of aspects of these understandings, such as the reason why they accept help and support and how they regard the situation of being helped and assisted, three ways of regarding the situation have been identified, which stress the variability of the social construction of dependency and independence that these elders uphold. Some <b>home-help</b> recipients construct themselves as independent, others as autonomous and able selves, while a third group construct themselves as powerless.

This study aimed to describe the cognitive and functional abilities of solitary-living AD patients, and the potential predictors of their usage of community-based services. Methods: This 3 -year, prospective, multicenter study included 1, 021  participants with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10 – 26) treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor in a routine clinical setting. At baseline and every 6  months, patients were assessed using cognitive, instrumental, and basic {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) scales, and service utilization was recorded. Logistic regression models were used to predict the usage of community-based services. Results: At the start of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy (time of AD diagnosis), 355  individuals (35 %) were living alone. They were mainly female, older, had more impaired basic ADL capacity, and had a larger number of concomitant medications when compared with those living with family. Regarding the solitary-living patients, lower instrumental ADL (IADL) ability and more medications were independent predictors of usage of <b>home-help</b> services, whereas more impaired IADL at baseline and faster IADL deterioration were predictors of nursing home admission. For those living with family, older age, lower basic ADL, and a greater number of medications predicted <b>home-help</b> services, whereas a larger amount of home help predicted nursing home placement. In addition, female sex was a risk factor for both the utilization of <b>home-help</b> services and nursing home placement.

40|$|This thesis investigates health trends among {{very old}} {{people and the}} {{allocation}} of public <b>home-help</b> services. A further aim is to examine methodological issues in mortality analysis. Three data sources are used: (1) The Tierp study of community-dwelling persons (n= 421, ages 75 +), (2) the SWEOLD nationally representative samples (n= 537 in 1992 and n= 561 in 2002, ages 77 +), and 3) SNAC-K comprised of <b>home-help</b> recipients in a district of Stockholm (n= 1108, ages 65 +). Study I suggests that {{the length of the}} follow-up period may explain some of the differences found in predictor strength when comparing mortality studies. Predictors that can change rapidly (e. g., health) were found to be strongest for the short term, with a lower average mortality risk for longer follow-ups. Stable variables (e. g., gender) were less affected by length of follow-up. Studies II and III present a measure of complex health problems based on serious problems in at least two of three health domains. These were diseases/symptoms, mobility, and cognition/communication. Prevalence of complex health problems increased significantly between 1992 and 2002. Older age, female gender, and lower education increased the odds of having complex problems. Complex problems strongly predicted 4 -year mortality. Controlled for age, gender, health, and education, mortality decreased by 20 % between 1992 and 2002. Men with complex problems accounted for this decrease. Thus, in 2002 the gender difference in mortality risk was almost eliminated among the most vulnerable adults. Study IV revealed that physical and cognitive limitations, higher age, and living alone were significantly related to <b>home-help</b> allocation, with physical and cognitive limitations dominating. Psychiatric symptoms did not affect the assessment. The increased prevalence of complex health problems and increased survival among people with complex needs have important implications concerning the need for collaboration among service providers...|$|E

Three forms of publicly provided OAC are distinguished: independent living in ordinary home without public support, independent living in ordinary home or special accommodations with home help and home health care, and living in special accommodations with round-the-clock-care. Our results suggest, given the level of ADL and age, that the propensity {{to move to a}} more intensive mode of care was higher for women compared to men. There was, however, also an effect of the availability of informal care support that moved in the opposite direction; men with a partner were more likely to move from <b>home-help</b> service to a living in special accommodation, while women with a partner were more likely to remain with the same care mode than women without a partner.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{frequency}} of malnutrition risk and associated risk of falling, social and mental factors among elderly without <b>home-help</b> service. The aim was also to explore factors associated with risk of falling. A cross-sectional design was used. Elderly persons own homes. Data were collected during preventive home visits to 565 elderly (age range 73 - 90 years) without <b>home-help</b> service. Those with complete SCREEN II forms were included in the study (n= 465). Measurements included rating scales regarding malnutrition risk (SCREEN II) and risk of falling (Downton). In addition, single-items: general health, satisfaction with life, tiredness, low-spiritedness, worries/anxiety and sleeping were used. According to the SCREEN II, 35 % of the sample had no malnutrition risk, 35 % had moderate risk and 30 % had high malnutrition risk. In an ordinal regression analysis, increased malnutrition risk was associated with being a woman living alone (OR 4. 63), male living alone (OR 6. 23), lower age (OR 0. 86), poorer general health (OR 2. 03 - 5. 01), often/always feeling tired (OR 2. 38), and an increased risk of falling (OR 1. 21). In a linear regression analysis, risk of falling was associated with higher age (B 0. 020), not shopping independently (B 0. 162), and low meat consumption (B 0. 138). There are complex associations between malnutrition risk and the gender-cohabitation interaction, age, general health, tiredness, and risk of falling. In clinical practice comprehensive assessments to identify those at risk of malnutrition including associated factors are needed. These have to be followed by individual nutritional interventions using a holistic perspective which may also contribute to reducing the risk of falling...|$|E

Users of these technologies can be divided into three groups: informal caregivers (family members and friends), formal caregivers (medical staff, social workers, <b>home-help),</b> and the elderly themselves. In this paper we present the results of a series of focus groups conducted between March and May 2012.

Five enrolled nurses in three of Stockholm's districts related their experiences of participation and influence at work in the qualitative interviews that were conducted. The result was then analyzed with the help of two theories, Karasek's and Theorell´s Demand- Control Model and Antonovsky's theory regarding ”a Sense of Coherence (SOC) ”. The analyzes show that the enrolled nurses have a low sense of participation and influence regarding decisions relating to their work situation. Decisions that affect the enrolled nurses are made by politicians, directors, and care managers of the city districts (biståndshandläggare). On the other hand, the enrolled nurses felt strong support from their peers at work. They could socialize and discuss issues with them.

40|$|Abstract- One of the {{research}} goals in robotics {{is the development of}} <b>home-help</b> robots. The development of a control approach for a novel lightweight and multifunctional shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator scalable in force and length for robots is presented in this paper. The SMA actuator is based on lightweight bundles of thin wires of prestrainend shape memory alloy that change their length when heated above their transformation temperature. The design approach of the actuator allows arranging the point of actuation in any direction and ensures a short cool down time to guarantee a frequency of contraction/stress cycles that is high enough to allow fast joint motions. This is needed for the generation of fast joint motions. For the use of the actuator the novel control approach has been experimentally validated. The approach uses the resistance of the actuator as a linear position encoder and there are no additional external sensors needed. The application of the new actuator to a novel lightweight humanoid robot is outlined. One advantage of the actuator over electric motors lies in the large variety of user-defined points of actuation of the in pull-force and length free scalable actuators and the high power-to-weight ratio. The result show {{that it is possible to}} build a large humanoid robot actuated with SMA actuator in a new way. Index Terms – sensor systems, smart sensors, artificial muscles I...|$|E

Many have been worried that the increasing number of very old people will create (too) heavy a strain on the Swedish economy. But the main problem will be not the economy but rather the scarcity of personnel. Even the most optimistic prognosis indicates that within the next 10 years, the number of personnel employed in the care of the elderly will no longer be sufficient. Heavy burdens will be placed on families and on women. The potential labour force of the newly retired will be needed, the private sector will expand, etc. Sweden will still be a welfare state, but the fundamental concept of a society where services and care are provided for all citizens on equal terms will change. welfare state care of the elderly crises informal care...|$|E
40|$|Changing {{forms of}} care work: New class distinctions and old gender {{patterns}} in {{care for the}} elderly Comparative welfare state research has only recently broadened the sphere of interest from income transfers to include social care services as well; i. e., to consider the welfare state {{not only as a}} social insurance state but also as a social service state. In the article a typology of care work is suggested and used as a tool to analyse changes in the provision and financing of care for the elderly in Sweden in the 90 s. Publicly financed care work, such as the municipal <b>home-help</b> services equally distributed among all socio-economic groups, has declined. The decrease in coverage is related both to stricter need assessments and to reduced demands due to raised user fees and changes in the content and organisation of the services; i. e. both exclusion and exit. At the same time, unpaid family care as well as care purchased on the market and paid entirely by the elderly themselves seem to be increasing. These boundary shifts lead to an increased class-related dualisation of cares ystems - an informalisation of care for less well-off groups and a marketisation for those better-off. These changes are effects of changing practice rather than explicit policy changes, and can be seen as signs of a creeping selectivisation of the universal welfare system.

40|$|One of {{the major}} policy trends in recent decades has been the {{privatization}} of social services. This trend has also reached Sweden, a welfare state with health care and social service sectors that previously had almost no private providers. One of the most affected areas is elderly care, i. e. <b>home-help</b> services and residential care provided to citizens older than 65 years, where the proportion of private providers increased from 1 % in 1990 to 16 % in 2010. The ongoing privatization in Sweden and many other countries has raised important questions regarding {{the consequences of this}} policy transformation. In this paper, we present a cross-sectional study comparing the quality of services in private and public elderly care. Using statistics from 2007 displaying a variety of quality dimensions covering over 99 % of all elderly care residents in Sweden, we were able to show that privatization is indeed associated with significant quality differences. Structural quality factors such as the number of employees per resident was significantly smaller (- 9 %) in private elderly care. On the other hand, the proportion of residents participating in the formulation of their care plan (+ 7 %), the proportion of elderly with a reasonable duration between evening meal and breakfast (+ 15 %), and the proportion of elderly offered different food alternatives (+ 26 %) were significantly in favour of private contractors. Our conclusion is that private care providers seem to emphasize service aspects rather than structural prerequisites for good care.

40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were 1) to confirm that {{combinations}} of brief geriatric assessment (BGA) items were significant risk factors for prolonged LHS among geriatric patients hospitalized in acute care medical units after their admission to the emergency department (ED); and 2) to determine whether these combinations of BGA items {{could be used as a}} prognostic tool of prolonged LHS. Methods: Based on a prospective observational cohort design, 1254 inpatients (mean age 6 standard deviation, 84. 965. 9 years; 59. 3 % female) recruited upon their admission to ED and discharged in acute care medical units of Angers University Hospital, France, were selected in this study. At baseline assessment, a BGA was performed and included the following 6 items: age $ 85 years, male gender, polypharmacy (i. e., $ 5 drugs per day), use of <b>home-help</b> services, history of falls in previous 6 months and temporal disorientation (i. e., inability to give the month and/or year). The LHS in acute care medical units was prospectively calculated in number of days using the hospital registry. Results: Area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of prolonged LHS of different combinations of BGA items ranged from 0. 50 to 0. 57. Cox regression models revealed that combinations defining a high risk of prolonged LHS, identified from ROC curves, were significant risk factors for prolonged LHS (hazard ratio. 1. 16 with P. 0. 010). Kaplan-Meier distributions of discharge showed that inpatients classified in high-risk group of prolonged LHS were discharged later tha...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare {{mortality}} {{and costs of}} health and social care between participants with access to care based on Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in an out-patient care setting with a control group receiving usual care only. The comparison was done 36 months after inclusion. Methods: Randomized controlled trial. Inclusion criteria: community-dwelling, aged ≥ 75 years, ≥ 3 hospitalisations {{the last year and}} ≥ 3 medical diagnoses. Mean age 82. 5 years. Results: A total of 208 participants in the intervention group (IG) and 174 in the control group (CG). Participants in the IG lived longer than the participants in the CG. 27. 9 % (n = 58) in the IG versus 38. 5 % (n = 67) in the CG had died. HR= 1. 49; CI; 1. 05 - 2. 12; P = 0. 026. Mean number of inpatient days was lower in the IG (intervention 15. 1 (SD 18. 4), control 21. 0 (SD 25. 0), P = 0. 01. No differences in the overall costs between the IG and CG including costs for <b>home-help</b> service and nursing home. Mean cost during the 36 -month period after baseline assessment expressed as USD/patient (SD) in the IG was 71905 (85560) versus 65626 (66338) in the CG: P = 0. 43. Conclusion: Better survival and fewer days in hospital three years after baseline assessment without increasing costs. This strengthens the positive results of a care based on CGA not only in acute care settings but also in outpatient care. A change of to-days health care organization focused on a one organ/disease is needed to a more comprehensive and preventive care of the oldest old...|$|E
40|$|Social {{services}} are {{a relatively new}} field of comparative welfare state research. Though comparative studies on the whole area of social {{services are}} still rare, good studies and data are available on services for elderly people and children. In almost all European countries services for the elderly are an established part of the welfare state. Countries have developed similar policies in meeting rising demands: diversification of services, investment in <b>home-help</b> services or privatization etc. Still, service provision and organization largely vary between countries. Child-care services are not in all countries regarded as public responsibility. There are big variations between countries with respect to services for children below three years, variations are smaller for children between three and six years. Increasing service provision has gone {{hand in hand with}} a pluralization of provider structures. In historical perspective, non-profit organizations often were pioneers in developing social services. In countries like Germany, Belgium and France non-profit organizations have become partners in public social service systems, in others like England, they are not as much integrated in public systems and often fulfil complementary functions in providing services for groups with special risks. In Scandinavian countries, where public services dominate, non-profit organizations have mainly advocacy functions. In recent years in some countries we observe a growing share of commercial service providers. The analysis of supply and provider structures reveals four distinct European social service systems: Scandinavia with highly developed public service systems, Southern Europe with low-developed services, a liberal type with a basic provision structure and a conservative type characterized by an institutionalized contribution of non-profit organizations to social service deliveryFrance; Germany; Netherlands; provision of services; social policy; Spain; subsidiarity; Sweden; welfare state...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{have chosen}} {{to figure out why}} a {{majority}} in a <b>home-help</b> service group in west of Sweden is, or has been sick-listed. The purpose with our work has been to investigate our area {{to be able to come}} up with different factors which can have contributed to the high numbers of this particular group. We have worked with qualitative method and conversation-interviews to be able to answer our purpose at the best way. We had separate interviews with the ten employees at their work and these interviews we chose to record with a computer. The result we got were that the group had existed for about four years and since then, they have had several different directors. The result of this has been that two of the employees have been taken the role of a director. From the beginning they were four employees and today they are ten. The fact that the group has become bigger have contained that new individuals with strong wills have began. The employee feels that there are luck of trust and open communication within the group. This causes problems in the way that some of the employees are controlling the others that they do their work correctly and you can se a tendency to seek mistake at your co-workers. The new employees fells that they are being attacked for things that they have done wrong, at the same time as the one who have been there since the beginning feels that there are not anyone but them selves, who take care of things and do it orderly...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{need for}} a brief {{geriatric}} assessment (BGA) tool to screen elderly patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) for their risk of a long hospital stay. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a BGA administered to elderly patients admitted to the ED may predict the risk of a long hospital stay in the geriatric acute care unit. METHODS: This study had a prospective cohort study design, enrolling 424 elderly patients (mean age 84. 0 +/- 6. 5 years, 31. 6 % male) who were evaluated in the ED using a BGA composed of the following items: age, gender, number of medications taken daily, history of falls during the past 6 months, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and non-use of <b>home-help</b> services (i. e., living alone without using any formal or informal home services or social help). The length of stay (LOS) was calculated in days. Patients were separated into three groups based on LOS: low ( 13 days). RESULTS: The prevalence of male gender was higher among patients with the longest LOS compared to those with intermediate LOS (p = 0. 002). There were more patients with a history of falls in the high LOS group compared to the intermediate LOS group (p = 0. 001) and the low LOS group (p < 0. 001). The classification tree showed that male patients with an MMSE score < 20 who fell with age under 85 years formed the end node with the greatest relative risk (RR) of a long hospital stay (RR = 14. 3 with p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a history of falls, male gender, cognitive impairment, and age under 85 years identified elderly ED patients at high risk of a long hospital stay...|$|E
