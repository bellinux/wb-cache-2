5000|$|Pressured {{by dozens}} of imitations and the {{proliferation}} of blatant unlicensed copies, FN began work in earnest on a successor product to the Model 1908 Vest Pocket pistol. The basic Vest Pocket pistol design was used {{as a starting point for}} the new design. Dieudonné Saive (who would later design the Browning Hi-Power pistol and FN FAL rifle) was asked during 1926-1927 to design the new pistol. His design was smaller, lighter, and incorporated several refinements and improvements to the M1908 version. For example, the hand palm activated grip safety mechanism was eliminated and the small safety lever on the left side of the receiver was extended under the grip so that the thumb of a right-handed shooter could easily engage and disengage it using pressure applied to the side of the safety lever - rather than pushing it down into the receiver- without having to release one's grip on the pistol. This improvement was at the cost of the slide hold-back feature that was eliminated in the new design. The receiver has a full-length <b>dust</b> <b>guard</b> extending to the end of the slide and an area behind the trigger is relieved to allow a user to maintain a more substantial grip on the pistol. The Dieudonne Saive design also introduced a magazine safety mechanism similar to the one utilized on the Colt Vest Pocket pistol. Parts are not interchangeable between these pistols. [...] A cocking indicator was also incorporated on the back of the slide. This model was marketed under the name [...] "Baby" [...] - and some of the original thermal hardened plastic grips were molded with both the initials [...] "FN" [...] at the top of the grip in a circle and the word [...] "BABY" [...] at the bottom of the grip under a raised crescent. This particular pistol was and continues to be known worldwide as the [...] "Baby Browning" [...] pistol and is the pistol reflected in the picture accompanying this article, excepting the BROWNING marked grip which indicates a more recent (circa 1960 and beyond) production run utilizing nylon impregnated polymer grips.|$|E

5000|$|The wheels were {{designed}} and manufactured by General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California. Ferenc Pavlics was given special recognition by NASA {{for developing the}} [...] "resilient wheel". They consisted of a spun aluminum hub and a 32 in diameter, 9 in wide tire made of zinc-coated woven 0.033 in diameter steel strands attached to the rim and discs of formed aluminum. Titanium chevrons covered 50% of the contact area to provide traction. Inside the tire was a 25.5 in diameter bump stop frame to protect the hub. <b>Dust</b> <b>guards</b> were mounted above the wheels. Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a direct current (DC) series-wound motor capable of [...] at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical brake unit.|$|R

The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability.

Indeed, the carriers only stopped {{when they reached}} the shadow of the tree under which the Headman and the elders of the village had assembled. Then as Ormsgill raised his hand the men with rifles swung out to left and right, and stood fast, an inconsequent handful of motionless figures with the unarmed carriers clustering behind them. Their white cotton draperies, which they had put on half an hour ago, gleamed in the sun glare dazzlingly.|$|R
