25|$|Warrior died on April 8, 2014 in Scottsdale, Arizona. He {{had been}} {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, and made his first Raw appearance in almost 18 years on April 7, the day before his death. According to reports, Warrior clutched his chest and collapsed at 5:50p.m. while walking to his car with his wife outside of their hotel in Arizona. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital where he was pronounced dead at age 54. Warrior's colleagues said Warrior appeared frail during WrestleMania weekend, and said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> profusely and breathing heavily backstage.|$|E

60|$|Mr. James Nuttall {{made all}} speed, {{regardless}} of the heat, in his journey from Bridgetown to Colonel Bishop's plantation, and if ever man was built for speed in a hot climate that man was Mr. James Nuttall, with his short, thin body, and his long, fleshless legs. So withered was he {{that it was hard}} to believe there were any juices left in him, yet juices there must have been, for <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> violently by the time he reached the stockade.|$|E
6000|$|Riding postilion-wise, Jeff {{could control}} the horses. The {{dangerous}} curve was passed, {{but not the}} possibility of pursuit. The single leader he was bestriding was panting--more than that, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>SWEATING,</b> and from the evidence of Jeff's hands, sweating BLOOD! Back of his shoulder was a jagged hole, from which his life-blood was welling. The off-wheel horse was limping too. That last volley was no foolish outburst of useless rage, but was deliberate and premeditated skill. Jeff drew the reins, and as the coach stopped, the horse he was riding fell dead. Into the silence that followed broke the measured beat of horses' hoofs on the road above. He was pursued! ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few seconds}} he had the table cleared away and the scales set up. On one side he placed the stamped disks to the {{equivalent}} of fifteen ounces, and balanced it with dust on the other. Replacing the weights with dust, he then had thirty ounces precisely balanced. These, in turn, he placed together {{on one side and}} again balanced with more dust. By this time the gold was exhausted, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> liberally. He trembled with ecstasy, ravished beyond measure. Nevertheless he dusted the sack thoroughly, to the last least grain, till the balance was overcome and one side of the scales sank to the table. Equilibrium, however, was restored by the addition of a pennyweight and five grains to the opposite side. He stood, head thrown back, transfixed. The sack was empty, but the potentiality of the scales had become immeasurable. Upon them he could weigh any amount, from the tiniest grain to pounds upon pounds. Mammon laid hot fingers on his heart. The sun swung on its westering way till it flashed through the open doorway, full upon the yellow-burdened scales. The precious heaps, like the golden breasts of a bronze Cleopatra, flung back the light in a mellow glow. Time and space were not.|$|E

"Look here," [...] he said, [...] "I seldom {{interfere}} in terrestrial strife, {{but it seems}} to me that there's an opening here for a capable peace-maker, not afraid of work, and willing to give his services in exchange for a comfortable home. Comrade Adair's rather a stoutish fellow in his way. I'm not much on the 'Play up for the old school, Jones,' game, but every one to his taste. I shouldn't have thought anybody would get overwhelmingly attached to this abode of wrath, but Comrade Adair seems to have done it. He's all for giving Sedleigh a much-needed boost-up. It's not a bad idea in its way. I don't see why one shouldn't humour him. Apparently <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> <b>sweating</b> since early childhood to buck the school up.

60|$|Oliver Haddo was {{standing}} motionless behind them. It startled Susie {{that he should}} have come upon them so suddenly, without a sound. Dr PorhoÃ«t, who had not seen him for some time, was astounded at the change which had taken place in him. The corpulence which had been his before was become now a positive disease. He was enormous. His chin was a mass of heavy folds distended with fat, and his cheeks were puffed up so that his eyes were preternaturally small. He peered at you from between the swollen lids. All his features had sunk into that hideous obesity. His ears were horribly bloated, and the lobes were large and swelled. He had apparently a difficulty in breathing, for his large mouth, with its scarlet, shining lips, was constantly open. He had grown much balder and now there was only a crescent of long hair stretching across {{the back of his head}} from ear to ear. There was something terrible about that great shining scalp. His paunch was huge; he was a very tall man and held himself erect, so that it protruded like a vast barrel. His hands were infinitely repulsive; they were red and soft and moist. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> freely, and beads of perspiration stood on his forehead and on his shaven lip.|$|E
6000|$|I won't {{pretend that}} he made all these remarks at once; but there wasn't one that he didn't make {{at one time or}} another, for {{suggestion}} and occasion were plentiful enough, his life being now given up altogether to his new necessity. It wasn't a question of his having or not having, as they say, my intellectual sympathy: the brute force of the pressure left no room for judgment; it made all emotion a mere recourse to the spyglass. I watched him as I should have watched a long race or a long chase, irresistibly siding with him but much occupied with the calculation of odds. I confess indeed that my heart, for the endless stretch that he covered so fast, was often in my throat. I saw him peg away over the sun-dappled plain, I saw him double and wind and gain and lose; and all the while I secretly entertained a conviction. I wanted him to feed his many mouths, but at the bottom of all things was my sense that if he should succeed in doing so in this particular way I should think less well of him. Now I had an absolute terror of that. Meanwhile so far as I could I backed him up, I helped him: all the more that I had warned him immensely at first, smiled with a compassion it was very good of him not to have found exasperating over the complacency of his assumption that a man could escape from himself. Ray Limbert at all events would certainly never escape; but one could make believe for him, make believe very hard--an undertaking in which at first Mr. Bousefield was visibly a blessing. Limbert was delightful on the business of this being at last my chance too--my chance, so miraculously vouchsafed, to appear with a certain luxuriance. He didn't care how often he printed me, for wasn't it exactly in my direction Mr. Bousefield held that the cat was going to jump? This was the least he could do for me. I might write on anything I liked--on anything at least but Mr. Limbert's second manner. He didn't wish attention strikingly called to his second manner; it was to operate insidiously; people were to be left to believe they had discovered it long ago. [...] "Ralph Limbert? Why, when did we ever live without him?"--that's what he wanted them to say. Besides, they hated manners--let sleeping dogs lie. His understanding with Mr. Bousefield--on which he had had not at all to insist; it was the excellent man who insisted--was that he should run one of his beautiful stories in the magazine. As to the beauty of his story however Limbert was going to be less admirably straight than as to the beauty of everything else. That was another reason why I mustn't write about his new line: Mr. Bousefield was not to be too definitely warned that such a periodical was exposed to prostitution. By the time he should find it out for himself the public--le gros public--would have bitten, and then perhaps he would be conciliated and forgive. Everything else would be literary in short, and above all I would be; only Ralph Limbert wouldn't--he'd chuck up the whole thing sooner. He'd be vulgar, he'd be rudimentary, he'd be atrocious: he'd be elaborately what he hadn't been before. I duly noticed that he had more trouble in making [...] "everything else" [...] literary than he had at first allowed for; but this was largely counteracted by the ease with which he was able to obtain that his mark should not be overshot. He had taken well to heart the old lesson of the Beacon; he remembered that he was after all there to keep his contributors down much rather than to keep them up. I thought at times that he kept them down a trifle too far, but he assured me that I needn't be nervous: he had his limit--his limit was inexorable. He would reserve pure vulgarity for his serial, over which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> blood and water; elsewhere it should be qualified by the prime qualification, the mediocrity that attaches, that endears. Bousefield, he allowed, was proud, was difficult: nothing was really good enough for him but the middling good; but he himself was prepared for adverse comment, resolute for his noble course. Hadn't Limbert moreover {{in the event of a}} charge of laxity from headquarters the great strength of being able to point to my contributions? Therefore I must let myself go, I must abound in my peculiar sense, I must be a resource in case of accidents. Lim-bert's vision of accidents hovered mainly over the sudden awakening of Mr. Bousefield to the stuff that in the department of fiction his editor was palming off. He would then have to confess in all humility that this was not what the good old man wanted, but I should be all the more there as a salutary specimen. I would cross the scent with something showily impossible, splendidly unpopular--I must be sure to have something on hand. I always had plenty on hand--poor Limbert needn't have worried: the magazine was forearmed each month by my care with a retort to any possible accusation of trifling with Mr. Bousefield's standard. He had admitted to Limbert, after much consideration indeed, that he was prepared to be perfectly human; but he had added that he was not prepared for an abuse of this admission. The thing in the world I think I least felt myself was an abuse, even though (as I had never mentioned to my friendly editor) I too had my project for a bigger reverberation. I daresay I trusted mine more than I trusted Limbert's; at all events the golden mean in which in the special case he saw his salvation as an editor was something I should be most sure of if I were to exhibit it myself. I exhibited it month after month in the form of a monstrous levity, only praying heaven that my editor might now not tell me, as he had so often told me, that my result was awfully good. I knew what that would signify--it would signify, sketchily speaking, disaster. What he did tell me heartily was that it was just what his game required: his new line had brought with it an earnest assumption--earnest save when we privately laughed about it--of the locutions proper to real bold enterprise. If I tried to keep him in the dark even as he kept Mr. Bousefield there was nothing to show that I was not tolerably successful: each case therefore presented a promising analogy for the other. He never noticed my descent, and it was accordingly possible that Mr. Bousefield would never notice his.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the course}} of the next {{fortnight}} the lady made several surprise visits to see that her champion was being properly prepared for the contest which lay before him. At the most unexpected moments she would burst into the training quarters, but never again had she to complain of any slackness upon his part or that of his trainer. With long bouts of the gloves, with thirty-mile walks, with mile runs at the back of a mailcart with a bit of blood between the shafts, with interminable series of jumps with a skipping-rope, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sweated</b> down until his trainer was able to proudly proclaim that [...] "the last ounce of tallow is off him and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> ready to fight for his life." [...] Only once was the lady accompanied by any one upon these visits of inspection. Upon this occasion a tall young man <b>was</b> her companion. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> graceful in figure, aristocratic in his bearing, and would have been strikingly handsome had it not been for some accident which had shattered his nose and broken all the symmetry of his features. He stood in silence with moody eyes and folded arms, looking at the splendid torso of the prize-fighter as, stripped to the waist, he worked with his dumbbells.|$|R
60|$|When {{the man in}} {{the black}} coat reached the top he found himself {{at the end of a}} long {{apartment}} as large as a chapel and as low as a malt-room, across which ran parallel carpenters' benches to the number of twenty or more, a gangway being left at the side for access throughout. Behind every bench there stood a man or two, planing, fitting, or chiselling, as the case might be. The visitor paused for a moment, as if waiting for some cessation of their violent motions and uproar till he could make his errand known. He waited ten seconds, he waited twenty; but, beyond that a quick look had been thrown upon him by every pair of eyes, the muscular performances were in no way interrupted: every one seemed oblivious of his presence, and absolutely regardless of his wish. In truth, the texture of that salmon-coloured skin could be seen to be aristocratic without a microscope, and the exceptious artizan has an offhand way when contrasts are made painfully strong by an idler of this kind coming, gloved and brushed, into the very den where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>sweating</b> and muddling in his shirt-sleeves.|$|R

Forced alkaline diuresis is advocated to hasten renal elimination of the drug when plasma salicylate levels exceed 500 mg/l, whilst charcoal haemoperfusion is the treatment of choice when plasma salicylate levels exceed 900 mg/kg. ' This severity of poisoning causes gross respiratory, metabolic and coagulation disturbances, usually requiring cardiovascular and respiratory support. 2 Conventional low frequency, high volume ventilation is known to impair venous return and cardiac output, so that if respiratory support is needed this type of ventilation may further compromise the cardiovascular system. 3 4 High frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is {{an effective means of}} controlling ventilation without impairing cardiac output and was successfully used in this case to support respiration in a hypotensive patient suffering from aspirin poisoning. 5 Day 1 : CASE HISTORY A 55 year old man suffering from a depressive illness was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital, having consumed 240 aspirin tablets (72 g). <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sweating</b> and unresponsive to verbal commands.
