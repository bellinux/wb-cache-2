25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch disengages, turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E

The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In diesel engines, NOx {{formation}} {{is a highly}} temperature-dependent phenomenon and takes place when {{the temperature in the}} combustion chamber exceeds 2000 K. Therefore, in order to reduce NOx emissions in the exhaust, it is necessary to keep peak combustion temperatures under control. One simple way of reducing the NOx emission of a diesel engine is by late injec-tion of fuel into the combustion chamber. This technique is effective but increases fuel consumption by 10 – 15 %, which necessitates the use of more effective NOx reduction techniques like <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation (EGR). Re-circulating part of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> helps in reducing NOx, but appreciable particulate emissions are observed at high loads, hence there is a trade-off between NOx and smoke emis-sion. To get maximum benefit from this trade-off, a particulate trap may be used {{to reduce the amount of}} unburnt particulates in EGR, which in turn reduce the particulate emission also. An experimental investigation was conducted to observe the effect of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> re-circulation on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> and <b>exhaust</b> opacity. The experi-mental setup for the proposed experiments was developed on a two-cylinder, direct injection, air-cooled, compression ignition engine.

40|$|Progressively stricter {{emission}} {{regulations have}} compelled diesel engine manufacturers {{to develop new}} technologies that reduce harmful pollutants like NOx and soot. While manufacturers have previously been able to meet these regulations {{through the use of}} on engine technology such as <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation and multiple pulse injections, exhaust after treatment systems such as diesel particulate filters and selective catalytic reduction systems have become necessary to meet recent stricter policies. While these after treatment systems are incredibly effective at reducing harmful emissions, to operate effectively the system needs to be above a certain temperature level typically between 250 and 300 °C. Many methods such as additional fueling or electrical heaters have been explored and used to increase the <b>temperature</b> of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> passing through these systems to heat them faster or maintain temperature. ^ The effect of cylinder deactivation, CDA, and late intake valve closing, LIVC, on raising <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> was studied by performing load sweeps at 1200 RPM. The effect of CDA, CDA and LIVC, and CDA meeting specific NOx targets was analyzed. At low loads, CDA proved to be effective at raising exhaust temperature as well as providing an improvement in brake thermal efficiency, BTE. At higher loads, <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> were also improved, but with a fuel consumption penalty. The introduction of LIVC in combination with CDA increased exhaust temperatures above 250 °C, but did not improve BTE. The last sweeps, which targeted low NOx emissions, required the use of EGR and were able to raise temperatures above 250 °C across all loads while meeting the targets. While meeting the targets, BTE was only improved at low loads. ^ The sweeps demonstrated that CDA and CDA combined with LIVC can be an extremely effective technology for raising <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>temperatures</b> even at low loads where exhaust temperatures are usually lowest. In many cases, an improvement in BTE can be accomplished as well. ...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Environmental Resource Engineering, 2013 Natural gas {{internal}} combustion engines release {{over half of}} the fuel???s energy as waste heat and emit pollution that harms human health and accelerates climate change. Enriching natural gas with hydrogen has been shown to mitigate these impacts by reducing emissions and increasing engine efficiency. Thermal energy in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from natural gas engines can be used to drive chemical reactions to reform a biomass-derived feedstock into a hydrogen-rich gas. This gas can be blended with the primary fuel to enhance combustion and displace some of the natural gas demand. Two types of chemical reformation processes, aqueous-phase reformation (APR) and vapor-phase reformation (VPR), have been identified which can convert a biomass-derived sugar feedstock solution into a hydrogen-rich gas by recovering waste heat from engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas.</b> VPR operates at higher temperatures than APR, which limits the amount of heat that can be transferred from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> to the reaction temperature.

40|$|Combustion of fuels {{with fuel}} bound oxygen is of {{interest}} from both a practical and a fundamental viewpoint. While {{a great deal of}} work has been done studying the effect of oxygenated additives in diesel and gasoline engines, much less has been done examining combustion characteristics of fuels with extremely high mass fractions of fuel bound oxygen.

Glycerol was chosen as a model fuel with a fuel bound oxygen mass fraction of 52 %, and was compared with emissions measured from diesel combustion at similar conditions in a high swirl turbulent spray flame.
