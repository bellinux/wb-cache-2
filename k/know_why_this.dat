Either he was drunk or he enjoyed killing civilians." [...] Abdul Samad, a 60-year-old farmer who lost eleven family members, eight of whom were children, spoke about the incident: [...] "I don't know why they killed them. Our government told us {{to come back to}} the village, and then they let the Americans kill us." [...] One grieving mother, holding a dead baby in her arms, said, [...] "They killed a child, was this child the Taliban? Believe me, I haven't seen a two-year-old member of the Taliban yet." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E

2500|$|Following battery re-generation {{problems}} {{on his car}} that left him unable to finish the event after having led the first 16 laps, Abt spoke of his annoyance and revealed he had some issues with his first car: [...] "But still {{we were in a}} position to at least take a podium here which would have been good points. Still good, and then last lap my car shuts off with a battery failure or whatever. It’s annoying." [...] He was also disappointed over losing the possibility of finishing on the podium, but said it was continually satisfying to compete {{at the front of the}} pack but it felt more satisfying to be the first driver to finish the race: [...] "I don’t <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> always happens to me, so many times. It’s just really annoying because in the end people forget what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{working at}} Google, Schmidt was {{involved}} in activities that later {{became the subject of}} the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation case that resulted in a settlement of $415 million paid by Adobe, Apple, Google and Intel to employees. In one incident, after receiving a complaint from Steve Jobs of Apple, Schmidt sent an email to Google's HR people saying; [...] "I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple and this is a direct inbound request. Can you get this stopped and let me <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> is happening? I will need to send a response back to Apple quickly so please let me know as soon as you can. Thanks Eric". Schmidt's email led to a recruiter for Google being [...] "terminated within the hour" [...] for not having adhered to the illegal scheme. Under Schmidt, there was a [...] "Do Not Call list" [...] of companies Google would avoid recruiting from. According to a court filing, another email exchange shows Google's human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold call agreements with competitors. Schmidt responded that he preferred it be shared [...] "verbally, since I don't want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later?" ...|$|E

D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel.

2500|$|The {{album was}} penned in the summer, with Doyle {{stating that the}} band {{were trying to make}} an [...] "upbeat, optimistic, summertime record". Goddard said that in {{previous}} work, the band were [...] "nervous about being open or emotionally honest" [...] and would sometimes [...] "have a jokiness or guarded sense to some of the words" [...] whereas the new album is more open lyrically. In response to a description of the album as the band's most serious yet, Taylor said, [...] "there was no decision to be more or less comic. I don't feel more or less humorous in my day-to-day" [...] but stated that he could hear melancholy, of which he said was in [...] "almost everything" [...] he writes. He explained that he did not <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> was the case and said, [...] "I can't ever write a song that just sounds completely saccharin. Even if I'm singing about someone being my complete love life, I'm singing about my own inabilities to be as bright as that person." [...] Like Taylor, Doyle said he felt that there was [...] "a certain vein of disquiet and melancholy that runs through the record". Another emotion that the band felt was present in One Life Stand was love. Goddard stated that the band did not set out to write an album about love but due to them feeling [...] "quite settled and happy", he admitted that it had come through in their song writing. In particular, Taylor wrote some of the songs whilst holding his newborn daughter. Taylor felt that due to their growth as songwriters and producers the band had progressed over time, resulting in improved [...] "clarity, melodic simplicity and strength" [...] in their song writing.|$|E
