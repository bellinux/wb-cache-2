5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
25|$|This an {{opportunity}} to put people who would normally <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> {{interact with each other}} on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, {{and all of a sudden}} they're together.|$|E
25|$|With the Flower Maiden gone, {{the wolves}} <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> {{stay in the}} city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to stay {{together}} and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city's army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher's ex-husband Hubb Lebowski searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless pursuit of the wolves. When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and take on her own human form. She joins the wolves and travels {{with them for a}} while, developing an intense and close romantic relationship with Hige, and meanwhile Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now searching for Blue as well as the wolves. Hubb eventually finds Cher and from there they continue their pursuit of the wolves to find Cheza.|$|E

[...] He could not associate with convicted mafiosi during his probation. [...] While the FBI suspected Vitale was a mafioso, {{he had never}} been convicted of a crime, and the FBI would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be suspicious of him associating with Massino since they were brothers-in-law. He returned to his job at King Caterers, and in 1996 became co-owner of Casablanca, a well-reviewed Maspeth Italian restaurant.|$|E
500|$|With reports speculating that Costa {{wanting to}} leave Chelsea, Costa affirmed on 2 June 2015 after Chelsea's post-season tour {{that he had}} no desire to leave London, saying, [...] "It's always a bit more {{difficult}} in the first season for adaptation, but I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> leave this place, I love it, the fans love me, and I want to stay. It’s really good to come in the first season [...] and win two things [...] Next year I’ll be ready to come back and, hopefully, win a couple more trophies." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalists have {{commented that}} Anonymous' secrecy, fabrications, and media {{awareness}} pose an unusual challenge for {{reporting on the}} group's actions and motivations. Quinn Norton of Wired writes that [...] "Anons lie when they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> lie. They weave vast fabrications {{as a form of}} performance. Then they tell the truth at unexpected and unfortunate times, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. They are unpredictable." [...] Norton states that the difficulties in reporting on the group cause most writers, including herself, to focus on the [...] "small groups of hackers who stole the limelight from a legion, defied their values, and crashed violently into the law" [...] rather than [...] "Anonymous’s sea of voices, all experimenting with new ways of being in the world".|$|E

500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is no {{liability}} to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf principle to mean that [...] "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break... They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> worry about the welfare of Mrs. Palsgraf." ...|$|E
500|$|MacMillan {{himself had}} been {{involved}} in the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship in the 1940s, though he had since quit that organization. In 1950, with an eye to taking the orchestra on international tours, he had written a letter to the American consul in Toronto admitting his former affiliation. He received his visa in November 1951 without any difficulties. After the six musicians were denied entry and before the orchestra had left for the United States, MacMillan solicited help for them from the Canadian ambassador in Washington, but his plea was unsuccessful. In January 1952 he wrote to US immigration officials trying to clear Staryk's name, lauding him as [...] "an exceptionally talented violinist and valuable member of the orchestra. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt that he has no Communist affiliations other than that he played from ages twelve to fourteen with a Ukrainian orchestra that is under some suspicion". [...] His entreaties on behalf of Staryk did not help to exonerate the musician.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, FDR's son Elliott {{published}} An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, {{in which}} he recalled seeing LeHand in his father's lap and alleged that she [...] "shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father". His eldest brother Jimmy disagreed, arguing that FDR's illness had made sexual function too {{difficult for him to}} have a physical affair. [...] "I suppose you could say they came to love one another", he wrote, [...] "but it was not a physical love." [...] Kathryn Smith, the author of the only biography of LeHand, could come to no conclusion, but wrote, [...] "As far as evidence goes, {{there is not a single}} written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position, despite the hundreds of Secret Service agents, staff members, political cronies, family members and friends who traipsed through FDR's bedrooms—which he used as an auxiliary office—during their twenty-one years together." [...] She quotes LeHand's great-niece, Jane Scarbrough, who said, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe they did , but we don't know." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, Pascu sparked {{criticism}} in the media when he agreed to perform at a Timişoara rally of Gregorian Bivolaru's Yoga movement (MISA). Bivolaru's legal troubles and allegations regarding MISA's sexual policies were the center of public debates; when contacted by reporters, Pascu stressed {{that it was a}} regular gig and stated, [...] "Those people have never harmed me and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be avoiding their company." [...] Pascu's activities for that year included other live concerts, including one held during the Bookfest event of June. In November, he was a guest at the Mircea Baniciu tribute concert, entertaining the public with musical impressions of folk singers Nicu Alifantis and Victor Socaciu, and performing Pasărea Colibri classics. Pascu also purchased his own drinking establishment and live music venue, a Bucharest tavern he named Gyuri's Pub, which hosted performances by the Moldovan folk singer Radu Captari. A collaborator of Pascu on solo music projects during spring 2010, Captari sang and played the guitar while riding a horse.|$|E
500|$|Insurance is a {{contract}} based upon speculation. The special facts, {{upon which the}} contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in {{the knowledge of the}} insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law, and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use uberrima fides), it is still used in insurance contracts. In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably knows more about the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual [...] "good faith," [...] the insuree would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.|$|E
500|$|All data {{gathering}} involves difficulties {{with the potential}} inaccuracy of research subjects' reports. For instance, when [...] "people doing domestic labor <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> {{pay close attention to}} the amount of time tasks take ... they [...] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities." [...] Measuring time can also be problematic because [...] "the slowest and most inefficient workers [...] the greatest workload." [...] Time use in assessing childcare is criticized as [...] "easily obscur gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in {{the same amount of time}} being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Men's standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns." [...] A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: [...] "It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies." [...] In general, measurement of time causes [...] "some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [...] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged." [...] Surveys have also been criticized for lacking [...] "depth and complexity" [...] as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.|$|E
