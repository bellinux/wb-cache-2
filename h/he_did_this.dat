5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> because he had left his keys in London and needed some papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{part of the}} {{woodland}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust by the tobacco company owner George Alfred Wills. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> to prevent housing development {{on the western side}} of the gorge as Bristol grew in size and population. In 1974 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food bought the woodland associated with the Leigh Court estate. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the Forestry Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to determine how much food the animals required to function. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food intake and used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|French chemist Bernard Courtois {{discovered}} Iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as {{the central}} ingredient in the thryoid gland. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand sheep, and named the precipitate, {{a combination of the}} thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'. David Marine in 1907 provided iodine is necessary for thyroid function. Thyroxine itself was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and trirodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century. TRH was discovered by Polish endocrinologist Andrew Schally in 1970, contributing in part to his Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Flower {{was created by}} Vincent Diamante, a video game music {{composer}} and professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin {{when they were both}} at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and adjusting the music dynamically to correspond to changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.|$|E
5000|$|... "Combining Western and non-Western {{instruments}} Demirel explores a {{wide variety}} of timbres. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> with a keen intellectual understanding of the various elements he works with, achieving an extraordinary freshness in his music." ...|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} 20 head coaches for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). The Raiders {{franchise}} {{was founded in}} Oakland, California in 1959 and became the eighth member of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960 {{as a replacement for}} the Minnesota Vikings, who had moved to the NFL. The Raiders joined the NFL in 1970, after the AFL–NFL merger. They played in Los Angeles between 1982 and 1995, before returning to Oakland. As {{of the end of the}} 2015 season, the Raiders have played 852 games in a total of 56 seasons in the AFL and NFL. In those games, two coaches have won the Super Bowl with the team: John Madden in 1976 and Tom Flores in 1980 and 1983. One coach, John Rauch in 1966, won the AFL Championship. Three other coaches, Art Shell, Jon Gruden and Bill Callahan, have also taken the Raiders to the playoffs. Callahan led the Raiders to the Super Bowl. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> in his first year as head coach of the team.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to London in August 1917, Nevinson first completed six lithographs {{on the subject of}} Building Aircraft for the War Propaganda Bureau portfolio of pictures, Britain's Efforts and Ideals, and then spent seven months in his Hampstead studio working up his sketches from the Front into finished pieces. A number of officials from the Department of Information visited the studio and soon began complaining about these new works. Nevinson was now focused on individuals, either as people displaying heroic qualities or as victims of warfare. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by painting in a realistic manner using a limited colour palette, sometimes only mud-brown or khaki. Whereas for his 1916 exhibition Nevinson had displayed both realistic works and pieces using Cubist and Futurist techniques, for his 1918 exhibition all the works were realistic in style and composition.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E

5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>this,</b> in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E
