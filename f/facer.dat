40|$|The {{face-to-face}} (F 2 F) {{strategy is}} a method which entails groups of so-called ‘facers’ standing in a public space trying to recruit people to the organisation and informing about the organisation’s work. In combination {{with the possibility of}} reaching large numbers of people, this technique provides a steady and ongoing flow of money, something which is vital for the NGO’s when planning future activities. In spite of ethical regulations the use of <b>facers</b> is a very controversial strategy and it is widely discussed in the media as well as on a governmental level. The issue seems to revolve around whether the strategy is too aggressive and contribute to the overloading of the city space. According to the discipline of planning, space and resources, the rise of globalisation has increased the pressure on ‘space’ as such and with this the spatiality of relations and interactions. Therefore some of the antipathy towards the <b>facers</b> can be understood by studying Goffman’s personal territories and Bauman’s uncivil spaces as the <b>facers</b> come to represent the violation of the social rules that exist according to these...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at the National Research Council (NRC) Canada-Construction Portfolio in {{association}} with the Canadian Polyisocyanurate Council conducted collaborative research activities on the long-term thermal resistance (LTTR) of polyisocyanurate (polyiso) foam insulation with impermeable <b>facers.</b> Polyiso boards are commonly used in building envelope constructions (roofs and walls) in cold regions. The primary objective of the research project was to contribute towards the development of a comprehensive test procedure {{that could be used to}} measure the LTTR of polyiso foam insulation products with impermeable <b>facers.</b> As a part of that initiative, a project was initiated in 2001 that consisted of accelerated aging tests using thin slices in parallel with a field investigation in which polyiso boards were installed in a purpose-built test hut at the NRC's Ottawa campus. The polyiso boards installed in the field were monitored for a period of 6 years and subsequently removed from the test hut and tested in the laboratory. This paper presents the field thermal performance of the rigid polyiso foam boards with impermeable <b>facers</b> and critically examines its relationship with the laboratory-measured thin slice aging data.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although most {{closed cell}} foams {{incorporate}} barriers at the surface, {{most of these}} barriers {{have been found to}} do little, if anything, to improve the long term performance of foams The cause of the barrier failures will be explained in terms of the author’s previous research. The advantage of properly applied barriers can be shown by use of the MIT aging model along with measured values of diffusion coefficients. The model shows that the time averaged insulation performance can be substantially enhanced by use of proper use of barriers. For example, a foam panel filled with CO 2 having proper bar-riers on the top and bottom surface has an equivalent average R-value over the time span of decades when compared to a CFC filled panel without <b>facers.</b> Means to measure the performance of a barrier when applied to a foam panel m-clude a qualitative dye technique. The dye technique allows the existence of open pathways at the interface of a foam and barrier to be easily visualized. Early test work with the dye technique indicates that many barrier/foam combinations give poor per-formance even when the barrier is impermeable. Experimental means to quantitatively measure barrier-foam behavior are needed to determine the potential of new barrier foam combinations and allow the long term performance to be predicted without the need for long term aging tests. A new mea-surement technique involves the use of transient tests of a foam sample with a barrier applied from the production process. The comparison of the experimental transient performance with the barrier in place and the transient performance of a similar un-faced foam will allow the barrier performance to be calculated using the transient analysis applied to the test data. The quantitative results of the barrier performance will allow the long term aging of a foam sample protected by barriers to be accurately predicted. The barrier characteristics of dense foam polymer material at the surface of th...|$|R
6000|$|The {{foregoing}} is a {{trick of}} erroneous human reasoning that works very successfully in the United States these days. It is certainly {{a trick of}} Mr. Burroughs, {{of which he is}} guilty with distressing frequency. When a poor devil of a writer records what he has seen, and when what he has seen does not agree with Mr. Burroughs's mediaeval theory, he calls said writer a nature-faker. When a man like Mr. Hornaday comes along, Mr. Burroughs works a variation of the trick on him. Mr. Hornaday has made a close study of the orang in captivity and of the orang in its native state. Also, he has studied closely many other of the higher animal types. Also, in the tropics, he has studied the lower types of man. Mr. Hornaday is a man of experience and reputation. When he was asked if animals reasoned, out of all his knowledge on the subject he replied that to ask him such a question was equivalent to asking him if fishes swim. Now Mr. Burroughs has not had much experience in studying the lower human types and the higher animal types. Living in a rural district in the state of New York, and studying principally birds in that limited habitat, he has been in contact neither with the higher animal types nor the lower human types. But Mr. Hornaday's reply is such a <b>facer</b> to him and his homocentric theory that he has to do something. And he does it. He retorts: [...] "I suspect that Mr. Hornaday is a better naturalist than he is a comparative psychologist." [...] Exit Mr. Hornaday. Who the devil is Mr. Hornaday, anyway? The sage of Slabsides has spoken. When Darwin concluded that animals were capable of reasoning in a rudimentary way, Mr. Burroughs laid him out in the same fashion by saying: [...] "But Darwin was also a much greater naturalist than psychologist"--and this despite Darwin's long life of laborious research that was not wholly confined to a rural district such as Mr. Burroughs inhabits in New York. Mr. Burroughs's method of argument is beautiful. It reminds one of the man whose pronunciation was vile, but who said: [...] "Damn the dictionary; ain't I here?" ...|$|E
60|$|Cockshot {100} is a {{different}} article, but vastly entertaining, and has been meat and drink to me for many a long evening. His manner is dry, brisk and pertinacious, and the choice of words not much. The point about him is his extraordinary readiness and spirit. You can propound nothing but he has either a theory about it ready-made, or will have one instantly on the stocks, and proceed to lay its timbers and launch it in your presence. “Let me see,” he will say. “Give me a moment. I should have some theory for that.” A blither spectacle than the vigour with which he sets about the task, it were hard to fancy. He is possessed by a demoniac energy, welding the elements for his life, and bending ideas, as an athlete bends a horse-shoe, with a visible and lively effort. He has, in theorising, a compass, an art; what I would call the synthetic gusto; something of a Herbert Spencer, who should see the fun of the thing. You are not bound, and no more is he, to place your faith in these brand-new opinions. But {{some of them are}} right enough, durable even for life; and the poorest serve for a cock shy—as when idle people, after picnics, float a bottle on a pond and have an hour’s diversion ere it sinks. Whichever they are, serious opinions or humours of the moment, he still defends his ventures with indefatigable wit and spirit, hitting savagely himself, but taking punishment like a man. He knows and never forgets that people talk, first of all, for the sake of talking; conducts himself in the ring, to use the old slang, like a thorough “glutton,” and honestly enjoys a telling <b>facer</b> from his adversary. Cockshot is bottled effervescency, the sworn foe of sleep. Three-in-the-morning Cockshot, says a victim. His talk is like the driest of all imaginable dry champagnes. Sleight of hand and inimitable quickness are the qualities by which he lives. Athelred, on the other hand, presents you with the spectacle of a sincere and somewhat slow nature thinking aloud. He is the most unready man I ever knew to shine in conversation. You may see him sometimes wrestle with a refractory jest {{for a minute or two}} together, and perhaps fail to throw it in the end. And there is something singularly engaging, often instructive, in the simplicity with which he thus exposes the process as well as the result, the works as well as the dial of the clock. Withal he has his hours of inspiration. Apt words come to him as if by accident, and, coming from deeper down, they smack the more personally, they have the more of fine old crusted humanity, rich in sediment and humour. There are sayings of his in which he has stamped himself into the very grain of the language; you would think he must have worn the words next his skin and slept with them. Yet it is not as a sayer of particular good things that Athelred is most to be regarded, rather as the stalwart woodman of thought. I have pulled on a light cord often enough, while he has been wielding the broad-axe; and between us, on this unequal division, many a specious fallacy has fallen. I have known him to battle the same question night after night for years, keeping it in the reign of talk, constantly applying it and re-applying it to life with humorous or grave intention, and all the while, never hurrying, nor flagging, nor taking an unfair advantage of the facts. Jack at a given moment, when arising, as it were, from the tripod, can be more radiantly just to those from whom he differs; but then the tenor of his thoughts is even calumnious; while Athelred, slower to forge excuses, is yet slower to condemn, and sits over the welter of the world, vacillating but still judicial, and still faithfully contending with his doubts.|$|E
