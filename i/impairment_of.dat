5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E

5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> oxidative metabolism.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action.

Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares.

5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, which {{have been shown to}} play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that knocking out ApoER2 or just the alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> LTP than knocking out VLDLR.|$|E

40|$|Objective We {{compared}} {{the levels of}} academic, physical, and social functioning {{of children and adolescents}} with chronic physical diseases with those of healthy peers or test norms. Methods A random effects meta-analysis was computed to integrate the results of 954 studies. Results <b>Impairments</b> <b>of</b> physi-cal functioning (g 0. 82 standard deviation units) were stronger than <b>impairments</b> <b>of</b> academic (g 0. 53) and social functioning (g 0. 43). Children with cerebral palsy and spina bifida showed the largest levels <b>of</b> functional <b>impairments.</b> The levels <b>of</b> functional <b>impairments</b> also varied by year of publication, source of information, ethnicity, country, and sociodemographic equivalence of the compared groups.

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E

5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> feather {{waterproofing}} {{can lead}} to hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of treatment <b>of</b> cognitive <b>impairments</b> <b>of</b> people with schizophrenia {{has long been}} established. Among many pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical ap-proaches, cognitive remediation offers {{one of the best}} promises for the rehabilitation <b>of</b> cognitive <b>impairments</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce one such approach, the Neuropsychological Educational Approach to Remediation (NEAR). NEAR has been utilized as a leading treatment model for cognitive <b>impairments</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation including NEAR is administered within a frame-work of psychiatric rehabilitation program. Cognitive remediation is most effectively administered when the rehabilitation goals in the social and domain are clarified. Social functions associated with the cognitive <b>impairments</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia are discussed in the specific categories of independent living skills, vocational skills and social problem-solving. Highlights of various models of cognitive remediation are presented to illustrate the unique features of NEAR. In the theoretical framework of NEAR, intrinsic motiva-tion, personalization and contextualization are the central concepts, and the patients are regarded as learners aiming for independent living. In order to provide a clinical over-view, specific treatment issues, staff training and patient characteristics are discussed. A summary of the NEAR outcome studies with a diverse psychiatric population is pre-sented to demonstrate its effectiveness. Functional measures associated with cognitive impairments are presented to suggest directions for future studies.
