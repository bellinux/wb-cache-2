The aim of the workshops is to introduce school-aged pupils to the concepts of plant imaging, and to image processing by building up a set of python programs that can open and investigate properties of images. The images in question are images of plants as they grow. Workshop one concerns the creation of such datasets {{and can be found}} here: [URL] Workshop two concerns investigating light changes in such datasets, introducing the concept of a "colour space" and can be found here: [URL] These files allow students to skip workshop one and use our pre-recorded timelapse sequences.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on and {{describe}} the use of MediaWiki and <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> at undergraduate level as online collaboration tools for co-constructing knowledge in group project work. Design/methodology/approach - Participants included 22 undergraduate students from the Information Management Programme at the University of Hong Kong. All the students had used MediaWiki for the major project in their knowledge management course and <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> for their final year project. Questionnaires and semi-structured telephone interviews were administered after completion of the course/final year project. All interview conversations were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis. Each transcript was e-mailed to the interviewee for accuracy review. The qualitative data supplemented, enriched and clarified the quantitative responses from the online surveys. Findings - The results indicated that some of the students had positive experiences using the tools for online collaboration in the group projects. Although more students found MediaWiki an effective knowledge management tool than <b>Google</b> <b>Docs,</b> many students highlighted the user-friendly features of <b>Google</b> <b>Docs.</b> Originality/value - These platforms (MediaWiki and <b>Google</b> <b>Docs)</b> gave teachers the facility to closely monitor student progress, and to provide feedback to assist in the effective management of the report-writing process. Moreover,the use of <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> in an academic setting remains largely unexplored in the literature, even though the collaborative features of MediaWiki and <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> are relatively comparable...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of writing process in <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> environment on Iranian EFL learners’ writing performance. It also examined students’ perceptions towards the effects of <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> and their perceived causes of success or failure in writing performance. In this regard, 48 EFL students were chosen based on their IELTs writing test scores. During the treatment, the students were taught {{how to write a}} formal five-paragraph essay in the class, but they were supposed to practice writing process and give feedback to their peers’ essays through <b>Google</b> <b>Docs.</b> At the end of the treatment phase, the participants received another sample of IELTs writing test (posttest). Moreover, 20 participants were interviewed for their perceptions regarding the causes for their success and failure and the influence of <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> on their writing performance. The analysis of a Paired-Sample t-test revealed that <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> played an effective role in improving students’ writing performance. In addition, the analysis of interview revealed that the students perceived both internal and external causes for their success and failure; but in case of failure, internal factors were cited more often than external ones. Also, it was revealed that students generally showed positive attitude towards the implication of <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> as a factor leading to success in their writing performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- With {{the advent}} of Web 2. 0, end users {{generate}} and share more and more content. One such service {{in this context is}} the collaborative edition of online documents. This service is commonly provided through Cloud Computing as Software as a Service. However, the Cloud paradigm still requires users to place their trust in Cloud providers with regard to privacy. This is the case of <b>Google</b> <b>Docs,</b> a very popular service without privacy support for the documents stored on its servers. So here we discuss the issues and propose the add-on utility. The add-on utility guarantees privacy of shared documents in <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> as <b>google</b> <b>docs</b> is used as collaboration tool. It also generates the audit report to avoid repudiation while group collaboration. Keywords-Repudiation, cloud, collaboration, <b>Google</b> <b>Docs,</b> Time key...|$|R
40|$|The {{students}} mostly use {{web based}} services for achieving their goals in education. They need these services for different purposes. The usability aspect {{is a need}} to design these services to be more interactive in order to support the students at their work. <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> is the link to the concept Software as a service i. e. a type of cloud computing. A web based application that provides online resource to the users for creating, editing and storing their documents online. The author particularly discusses it from the Student’s perspective. Usability evaluation of the <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> is to find the students needs and requirements and also to investigate the usability issues in <b>Google</b> <b>Docs.</b> In this thesis the author is trying to uncover the usability and privacy related problems faced by the students. This is helpful in analyzing the <b>Google</b> <b>Docs</b> (Software as a service) and its importance, by considering the students perspective. Different usability methods and techniques are available for usability evaluation.
