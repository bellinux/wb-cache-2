The time between the life explosion <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> existed on an exoplanet and the dawn of civilizations is thus very large and the time between civilization and radio signals evenly so.|$|E

Now, Tawana Brawley was 15 {{at the time of the}} incident. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been done... early on, the agency would have given her psychiatric attention and preserved evidence of rape, if there was evidence, and Mason and Maddox would have been deprived of their pawn.|$|E

As Adalvard was back in Bremen already by 1069 and is mentioned as one of Adam's sources of information, it would have been expected that word about Birka's destruction had reached also Adam before he published his work half a decade later.|$|E

25|$|Union College owns {{several of}} the houses, and in the late 20th century decided to convert {{some of them to}} {{administrative}} offices and student housing. Residents objected, citing the deed covenants and zoning that prohibited business uses, and filed suit. In 2001 a state appeals court upheld a lower-court ruling in the college's favor. As a nonprofit the college was not a business, and its presence predated the creation of the Plot and its deed covenants, so the framers of those covenants would have likely included language explicitly restricting college-related activities <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been their intent. It converted the Parker-Rice estate at 1128 Lenox Road into offices for its fundraising and alumni relations departments. An attempt to have the state's Court of Appeals, its highest, hear the case was denied.|$|E
25|$|The drop in SAT verbal scores, in particular, {{meant that}} the {{usefulness}} of the SAT score scale (200 to 800) had become degraded. At the top end of the verbal scale, significant gaps were occurring between raw scores and uncorrected scaled scores: a perfect raw score no longer corresponded to an 800, and a single omission out of 85 questions could lead to a drop of 30 or 40 points in the scaled score. Corrections to scores above 700 had been necessary {{to reduce the size of}} the gaps and to make a perfect raw score result in an 800. At the other end of the scale, about 1.5 percent of test takers would have scored below 200 on the verbal section <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> not been the reported minimum score. Although the math score averages were closer to the center of the scale (500) than the verbal scores, the distribution of math scores was no longer well approximated by a normal distribution. These problems, among others, suggested that the original score scale and its reference group of about 10,000 students taking the SAT in 1941 needed to be replaced.|$|E

Originally planned to comprise ten ships, only two were completed; [...] and [...] Five more were launched, but not completed: Wiesbaden, Magdeburg, Leipzig, Rostock and Frauenlob, while another three were laid down but not launched: Ersatz Cöln, Ersatz Emden and Ersatz Karlsruhe (for the last three, the names quoted were only provisional titles {{to be used}} during construction, and the three would have received other names at their launch <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> taken place).

500|$|The St Nazaire raid had the {{objective}} of destroying the Normandie dry dock, which would prevent its use by any large German warship <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been damaged or in need of repair. [...] The majority of land force for the raid was supplied by No. 2 Commando, led by Lieutenant Colonel Newman. However the Special Service Brigade headquarters, used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from, No's 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 12 Commandos {{to go on the}} raid. The No. 4 Commando contingent was 12 other ranks commanded by Lieutenant H Pennington. They had all previously served in the Royal Engineers and left under the impression they were going on a Harbour Demolition Course. After their training at Cardiff and Southampton Docks only six of the 12 were selected to go on the raid. Three of the six including Lieutenant Pennington were killed before they were able to land, when their Motor Launch was engaged by the German coastal defence batteries. The other men who had not been selected for the raid were returned to No. 4 Commando.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{came along}} {{late into the}} {{production}} of Fearless. Swift wrote [...] "Love Story" [...] {{about a man who}} was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him. [...] "His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care", said Swift. Swift also felt like {{it was the first time}} she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, [...] "The only people who wanted them to be together were them." [...] She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: [...] "I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it matters—it's not simple or easy but it's real'." [...] She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the [...] "Love Story"'s second refrain. All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy." [...] Instead, she chose to write a happy ending. She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved. She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself. [...] "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." [...] Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about. Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.|$|E
