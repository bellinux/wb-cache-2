5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an <b>immunological</b> response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the <b>immunological</b> mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with <b>immunological</b> processes which promote disease progression.|$|E
5|$|My {{part in the}} {{discovery}} of acquired <b>immunological</b> tolerance was a very minor one—it was the formulation of an hypothesis that called for experiment.|$|E
5|$|Pneumococcus is {{characterized}} by smooth colonies and has a polysaccharide capsule that induces antibody formation; the different types are classified according to their <b>immunological</b> specificity.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on <b>immunological</b> problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, <b>immunological</b> surveillance and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{alveolar}} macrophages have {{an important}} <b>immunological</b> role. They remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vesels.|$|E
5|$|Transgenic mice with {{homozygous}} {{depletion of}} NEDD9 are vital and fertile, but have <b>immunological</b> abnormalities {{that result in}} pre-malignant conditions later in life, defects are initially subtle, but increase in later life; B cell homing to the spleen and lymphocyte trafficking are deficient.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, <b>immunological</b> tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland is {{increased}} in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal thyroid function but have <b>immunological</b> evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism {{before or after}} giving birth.|$|E
5|$|Some self {{reactive}} T cells {{escape the}} thymus {{for a number}} of reasons, mainly {{due to the lack of}} expression of some self antigens in the thymus. Another type of T cell T regulatory cells can down regulate self reactive T cells in the periphery. When <b>immunological</b> tolerance fails, autoimmune diseases can follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{behaviour}} {{was common}} throughout human history and societies and observed in non-human animals. While premastication is less common in present-day Western societies it was commonly practiced, {{and is still}} done in more traditional cultures. Although {{the health benefits of}} premastication are still being actively studied, the practice appears to confer certain nutritional and <b>immunological</b> benefits to the infant, provided that the caretaker is in good health and not infected by pathogens.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} group's principal investigations concerned <b>immunological</b> tolerance (the body's {{acceptance of}} tissues, {{as opposed to}} rejection), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a vascular surgery program and worked {{with the use of}} immunotherapy as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and <b>immunological</b> protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Compounds from T. felleus {{have been}} {{extracted}} and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a beta-glucan that was {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non-specific <b>immunological</b> response. In particular, it enhances phagocytosis, {{the process by which}} macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, N-γ-glutamyl boletine, has mild antibacterial activity.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of <b>immunological</b> self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an <b>immunological</b> memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
5|$|The quagga was {{the first}} extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study {{launched}} the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was {{more closely related to}} zebras than to horses, with the quagga and mountain zebra (Equus zebra) sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An <b>immunological</b> study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{divergence}} time {{of humans}} from other apes {{is of great}} interest. One of the first molecular studies, published in 1967 measured <b>immunological</b> distances (IDs) between different primates. Basically the study measured the strength of <b>immunological</b> response that an antigen from one species (human albumin) induces in the immune system of another species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla and Old World monkeys). Closely related species should have similar antigens and therefore weaker <b>immunological</b> response to each other's antigens. The <b>immunological</b> response of a species to its own antigens (e.g. human to human) was set to be 1.|$|E
25|$|Concerning <b>immunological</b> adaptation, it was {{discovered}} that wild common ostriches have a pronounced non specific immunity defense, with blood content reflecting high values of lysosome, and phagocyte cells in medium. This is in contrast to domesticated ostriches, who in captivity develop high concentration of immunoglobulin antibodies in their circulation, indicating an acquired <b>immunological</b> response. It is suggested that this <b>immunological</b> adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology {{suggested}} a classification {{on the basis}} of the responsible pathogenetic mechanism; according to this classification, non-toxic reactions can be divided into 'food allergies' when they recognize <b>immunological</b> mechanisms, and 'food intolerances' when there are no <b>immunological</b> implications. Reactions secondary to food ingestion are defined generally as 'adverse reactions to food'.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immunological</b> {{responses}} are mediated by non-IgE immunoglobulins, where {{the immune system}} recognises a particular food as a foreign body.|$|E
25|$|Later work by Ferguson {{and colleagues}} adopted an {{agent-based}} approach to better identify the <b>immunological</b> and ecological determinants of influenza evolution.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{data support}} the hygiene hypothesis. Studies {{have shown that}} various <b>immunological</b> and {{autoimmune}} diseases are much less common {{in the developing world}} than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop <b>immunological</b> disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world. Longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in <b>immunological</b> disorders as a country grows more affluent and, it is presumed, cleaner. The use of antibiotics {{in the first year of}} life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases. The use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of asthma, as has birth by Caesarean section rather than vaginal birth.|$|E
25|$|Immunology is {{the branch}} of {{medicine}} dealing with disorders of the <b>immunological</b> system that helps the body protect itself from foreign substances and illnesses.|$|E
25|$|In {{other studies}} {{naturally}} occurring anti-Ge antibodies {{have been found}} and appear to be of no clinical significance. <b>Immunological</b> tolerance towards Ge antigen has been suggested.|$|E
25|$|The {{lymphatic system}} {{plays a major}} role in body's immune system, as the primary site for cells {{relating}} to adaptive immune system including T-cells and B-cells. Cells in the lymphatic system react to antigens presented or found by the cells directly or by other dendritic cells. When an antigen is recognized, an <b>immunological</b> cascade begins involving the activation and recruitment of more and more cells, the production of antibodies and cytokines and the recruitment of other <b>immunological</b> cells such as macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Genetic and <b>immunological</b> studies {{over the}} past two decades have failed to yield {{evidence}} of precolumbian African contributions to the indigenous populations of the Americas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immunological</b> {{compromise}} - Those on immuno-suppressive {{treatment or}} those with HIV and low CD4 T cell counts, frequently show negative results from the PPD test.|$|E
25|$|Transfusions {{of blood}} {{products}} {{are associated with}} several complications, many {{of which can be}} grouped as <b>immunological</b> or infectious. There is controversy on potential quality degradation during storage.|$|E
25|$|The model {{showed the}} {{reproduction}} of influenza's ladder-like phylogeny depended critically on the mutation rate of the virus {{as well as the}} <b>immunological</b> distance yielded by each mutation.|$|E
25|$|Their study showcased three {{features}} of viral phylogenies, which {{may serve as}} rules of thumb for identifying important epidemiological, <b>immunological,</b> and evolutionary processes influencing patterns of viral genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|Measurement is {{done from}} {{a sample of}} venous blood using <b>immunological</b> {{measuring}} mechanisms like ELISA, RIA, etc. Often these are done by automated machines to minimize human error.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an <b>immunological</b> demyelinating polyneuropathy. As {{a result}} of increased paranodal capacitance from demyelination, patients experience increased stimulation threshold, shorter strength-duration time constant, and increased rheobase.|$|E
25|$|In theory, fever can aid in host defense. There are {{certainly}} some important <b>immunological</b> reactions that are sped up by temperature, and some pathogens with strict temperature preferences could be hindered.|$|E
25|$|Viral phylodynamics {{is defined}} as the study of how epidemiological, <b>immunological,</b> and {{evolutionary}} processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies. spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics, zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism, and antigenic drift.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{there is}} {{indication}} that the mother's zinc levels may affect the developing baby's <b>immunological</b> state {{that may lead to}} autism and could be again an {{indication that the}} Metallothionein system has been affected.|$|E
25|$|Postmortem {{studies of}} the BBB, {{especially}} the vascular endothelium, show <b>immunological</b> abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1.|$|E
