5000|$|In the meantime, Pêro de Anaia's son, Francisco de Anaia invokes his {{commission}} {{as head of}} the Sofala coastal patrol (capitão-mor do mar de Sofala) and takes command of the two remaining caravels - the São João ( [...] Francisco de Anaia's own) and São Paulo (now under Pêro Teixeira). Young Anaia immediately sets about cruising the coast, and captures two local Muslim fustas - one loaded with <b>Indian</b> <b>calico,</b> another with ivory - and mercilessly puts their crews to death. But it all ends rather poorly. Navigationally inept, the younger Anaia loses the calico prize and then ends up crashing both his caravels - the first off Mozambique Island, the second at the rocks of São Lazaro banks (Quirimbas Islands). [...] Anaia ends up having to row his way to Kilwa on his remaining captured fusta, arriving there in a sorry shape on March 25, much to the surprise of the Portuguese garrison. He is immediately placed under arrest by the Kilwa governor Pêro Ferreira Fogaça.|$|E
60|$|We {{concealed}} our {{having any}} gold or pearls {{as much as}} we could, and therefore sold three or four bales of China silks and <b>Indian</b> <b>calicoes,</b> to raise money to buy camels and to pay the customs which are taken at several places, and for our provisions over the deserts.|$|R

Copperplate- and roller-printed {{plain weave}} cotton in a {{characteristic}} somber ramoneur (chimney sweep) print {{on a dark}} ground. Capes of similar fabrics based on floral-printed <b>Indian</b> <b>calicoes</b> were popular in Provence from about 1770 to 1830. Los Angeles County Museum of Art M.2007.211.669.|$|R
2500|$|Chintz, Indian {{cotton fabric}} with block-printed imaging {{on a white}} base, was wildly fashionable. [...] Bans against their {{importation}} to protect the British silk, linen and woolen industries did nothing to reduce their desirability. [...] Brocaded silks and woolens had similar colorful floral patterns on light-colored grounds. [...] Blends of wool and silk or wool and linen (linsey-woolsey) were popular. Until the 1730s, European textiles were of inferior quality that could not match the complex fashionable designs of <b>Indian</b> <b>calicoes.</b> Europe was able to produce high quality petit teints (colors that faded with light and washing), but {{they were unable to}} produce grand teints (permanent colors resistant to light and wear).|$|R
5000|$|Bengal {{accounted}} for more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks imported by the Dutch from Asia, Bengali silk and cotton textiles were exported in large quantities to Europe, Indonesia, and Japan, and Bengali muslin textiles from Dhaka were sold in Central Asia, where they were known as [...] "daka" [...] textiles. Indian textiles dominated the Indian Ocean trade for centuries, were sold in the Atlantic Ocean trade, and had a 38% share of the West African trade in the early 18th century, while <b>Indian</b> <b>calicos</b> were major force in Europe, and Indian textiles {{accounted for}} 20% of total English trade with Southern Europe in the early 18th century.|$|R

50|$|Examples of such {{luxury goods}} would include Chinese silks, exotic herbs, coffee, cotton, iron, <b>Indian</b> <b>calicoes,</b> Arabian horses, gems and spices or {{drugs such as}} nutmeg, cloves, pepper, {{ambergris}} and opium. The thirteenth century as well as present day favor luxury items {{due to the fact}} that small high-value goods can have high transport costs but still have a high value attached to them, whereas low-value heavy goods are not worth carrying very far. Purchases of luxury items such as these are described as archaic consumption since trade was largely popular for these items as opposed to everyday needs. The distinction between food, drugs and materia medica is often quite blurred in regards to these substances, which were valued not only for their rarity but because they appealed to humoral theories of health and the body that were prevalent throughout premodern Eurasia.|$|R
50|$|On February 27, 1973, {{at large}} public meeting of 600 <b>Indians</b> at <b>Calico</b> Hall {{organized}} by Pedro Bissonette of Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) and addressed by AIM leaders Banks and Russell Means. Demands {{were made for}} investigations into vigilante incidents and for hearings on their treaties, and permission given by the tribal elders to make a stand at Wounded Knee.|$|R
50|$|Indian {{textiles}} were traded {{from ancient}} times with China, Southeast Asia and the Roman Empire. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions mallow cloth, muslins and coarse cottons. Port towns like Masulipatnam and Barygaza won fame for its production of muslins and fine cloth. Trade with the Arabs who were middlemen in the spice trade between India and Europe brought Indian textiles into Europe, {{where it was}} favored by royalty in the 17th-18th century. The Dutch, French and British East India Companies competed for monopoly of the spice trade in the Indian Ocean, but were posed {{with the problem of}} payment for spices, which was in gold or silver. To counter this problem, bullion was sent to India to trade for the textiles, a major portion of which were subsequently traded for spices in other trade posts, which then were traded along with the remaining textiles in London. Printed <b>Indian</b> <b>calicos,</b> chintz, muslins and patterned silk flooded the English market and in time the designs were copied onto imitation prints by English textile manufacturers, reducing the dependence on India.|$|R
60|$|The kind liberty granted us {{of wearing}} <b>Indian</b> stuffs, and <b>calicoes,</b> to gratify the vanity and folly of our women; which, beside the profit to England, is an unconceivable loss to us; forcing the weavers to beg in our streets, or {{transport}} themselves to foreign countries.|$|R
50|$|For half a century, {{under the}} {{stewardship}} of Ambalal Sarabhai, the Calico Mills {{became one of}} the most modern and extensively diversified pacesetters of the <b>Indian</b> cotton industry. <b>Calico</b> was the first Indian mill to give shareholders cloth at concessional rates. It was the first Indian textile mill to make cotton sewing thread, and later 100% synthetic sewing thread.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 18th century the British had become, well, very materialistic, they craved exotic goods, sugar, porcelain, fine cotton, {{but it was}} tea that {{particularly}} took their fancy. Mid-18th century people of taste liked {{nothing more than to}} sip this Oriental import sweetened with Caribbean sugar, they drank from the finest Chinese porcelain and dressed in <b>Indian</b> cottons including <b>calicos</b> and chintzes, this was the good life and everyone wanted a taste. How this dream became a reality {{is one of the most}} fascinating adventures in British history. Dan Cruickshank ...|$|R
50|$|On May 12 {{the whites}} were {{attacked}} and routed by Paiute forces {{under the command}} of Chief Numaga approximately five miles south of the lake. The whites were poorly armed, badly mounted, and almost completely unorganized. They had encountered a small party of Paiutes; they attacked the Indians, who fled after returning a few shots. The Indians continued firing sporadically as they fled into the ravine with the whites in pursuit. Once in the ravine a large group of Indians appeared, closing the escape route and firing on the whites from all sides. The survivors escaped into a patch of woods; they were pursued for some 20 miles. Seventy-six whites were dead, including Ormsby; and many of the others were wounded. According to Angel's first History of Nevada, three Indians were killed in the battle. However Paiute <b>Indian,</b> Johnny <b>Calico</b> who was 12 at the time told a historian in 1924 that only 3 were injured and no one died.|$|R
60|$|Thirdly, That {{the sense}} of both Houses of Parliament, at least of the House of Commons, were {{declared}} by some unanimous and hearty votes, against wearing any silk or woollen manufactures, imported from abroad, as likewise against wearing <b>Indian</b> silks or <b>calicoes,</b> which are forbidden under the highest penalties in England: And it behoves us, to take example from so wise a nation; because we are under a greater necessity to do so, since we {{are not allowed to}} export any woollen manufactures of our own; which is the principal branch of foreign trade in England.|$|R
2500|$|By 1844 the anti-rent {{movement}} had {{grown from a}} localized struggle against the van Rensselaer family to a full-fledged revolt against leasehold tenure throughout eastern New York, where other major manors existed. Virtual guerrilla warfare broke out. Riders disguised as <b>Indians</b> and wearing <b>calico</b> gowns ranged through the countryside, terrorizing the agents of the landlords. In late 1844, Governor William Bouck sent three companies of militia to Hudson, where anti-renters threatened to storm the jail and release their leader, Big Thunder (Dr. Smith A. Boughton, in private life). The following year Governor Silas Wright was forced to declare Delaware County {{in a state of}} insurrection after an armed rider had killed undersheriff [...] August 7, 1845 at an eviction sale.|$|R
60|$|It is certain, that a firm {{union in}} any country, where every man wishes {{the same thing}} with {{relation}} to the public, may, in several points of the greatest importance, in some measure, supply the defect of power; and even of those rights which are the natural and undoubted inheritance of mankind. If the universal wish of the nation upon any point, were declared by the unanimous vote of the House of Commons, and a reasonable number of Lords; I should think myself obliged in conscience to act in my sphere according to that vote; because, in all free nations, I take the proper definition of law to be the will of the majority of those who have the property in land; which, if there be a monarchy, is to be confirmed by the royal assent. And, although such votes or declarations have not received such a confirmation, for certain accidental reasons; yet I think they ought to be of much weight with the subject; provided they neither oppose the King's prerogative, endanger the peace of the nation, nor infringe any law already in force; none of which, however, can reasonably be supposed. Thus, for instance, if nine in ten of the House of Commons, and a reasonable number of native temporal peers, should declare, that whoever received or uttered brass coin, except under certain limitations and securities, should be deemed as enemies to the King and the nation; I should think it a heinous sin in myself to act contrary to such a vote: And, if the same power should declare the same censure against those who wore <b>Indian</b> stuffs and <b>calicoes,</b> or woollen manufactures imported from abroad, whereby this nation is reduced to the lowest ebb of misery; I should readily, heartily, and cheerfully pay obedience; and to my utmost power persuade others to do the like: Because, there is no law of this land obliging us either to receive such coin, or to wear such foreign manufactures.|$|R
