Results of the study confirm that the impact of increasing prices of rice and fuel vary across different groups of households depending on the sector of employment, level of urbanity, income group and geographical location. In fact, there are losers and gainers from the recent increases in the prices of rice and fuel. In response to higher prices, households adopted different coping mechanisms, some of which are damaging and counter-productive in the medium- and long-run. The Philippine government has also responded by implementing programs that would mitigate the negative impact of soaring prices. It is recommended that household level data for all households in the community, such as those being generated by the community-based monitoring system (CBMS) being implemented by local government units, be used to identify eligible beneficiaries through some proxy means test model. This would help reduce leakage of program benefits to the non-poor as well as ensure that the poor benefit from these programs. poverty, community-based monitoring system, impact analysis, prices, rice, fuel, coping mechanisms, pass-through rates, net benefit ratio...|$|R

This authoritative book brings together international experts to describe both direct (such as heat waves) and indirect (such as vector-borne disease incidence) impacts of climate change, set in a broad, international, economic, political and environmental context. This unique book also expands on these issues to address a third category of potential longer-term impacts on global health: famine, population dislocation, and conflict. This lively yet scholarly resource explores these issues fully, linking them to health in urban and rural settings in developed and developing countries.

40|$|Adaptation {{dynamics}} of communities to environmental change, such as rainfall, forest stocks, fish stocks and flooding, have {{a multitude of}} consequences for livelihood choices, poverty and natural resource use. Emerging properties of such household level behaviour are analysed {{in the context of}} energy related policy changes in an agent-based model implemented in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The underlying hypothesis is that complex systems modelling can help decision makers to better understand the responses of a socio-ecological system to macro-policy changes, for example fuel subsidy reductions. The participatory model development process revealed that many decision makers implied linear responses of poverty indicators to policy interventions (“if we double cash payments we can double our impact on poverty”). The agent-based model offered the opportunity to consider feedbacks created by interactions in the socio-ecological system. Model results indicate that poverty responses to changes in <b>fuel</b> subsidies and <b>poverty</b> cash payments are highly non-linear. Three important messages emerge from the model results. Firstly, petrol price reductions have a rather low impact on poverty alleviation. Secondly, diminishing marginal returns have to be expected as poverty levels do not seem to respond linearly to fuel subsidy changes. Thirdly, model results suggest that not just marginal but also absolute returns can decrease due to environmental feedbacks...|$|R
