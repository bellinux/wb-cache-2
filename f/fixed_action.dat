40|$|We {{propose a}} {{systematic}} procedure for extracting gauge invariant and gauge <b>fixed</b> <b>actions</b> for various higher-spin gauge field theories from covariant bosonic open string field theory. By identifying minimal gauge invariant {{part for the}} original free string field theory action, we explicitly construct a class of covariantly gauge <b>fixed</b> <b>actions</b> with BRST and anti-BRST invariance. By expanding the actions {{with respect to the}} level N of string states, the actions for various massive fields including higher-spin fields are systematically obtained. As illustrating examples, we explicitly investigate the level N<= 3 part and obtain the consistent actions for massive graviton field, massive 3 rd rank symmetric tensor field, or antisymmetric field. We also investigate the tensionless limit of the actions and explicitly derive the gauge invariant and gauge <b>fixed</b> <b>actions</b> for general rank n symmetric and anti-symmetric tensor fields.

2500|$|An {{important}} development, {{associated with}} the name of Konrad Lorenz though probably due more to his teacher, Oskar Heinroth, was the identification of <b>fixed</b> <b>action</b> patterns (FAPs). Lorenz popularized FAPs as instinctive responses that would occur reliably in the presence of identifiable stimuli called sign stimuli or [...] "releasing stimuli". FAPs are now considered to be instinctive behavioural sequences that are relatively invariant within the species and almost inevitably run to completion.|$|E
2500|$|Non-giant-mediated {{responses}} are initiated after the tail flip, creating cycles of flexion followed by extension. This non-giant system is activated {{parallel to the}} LGI circuit when the hair cells receive input. However, this behavior has a longer delay that allows the onset of swimming to occur {{after the completion of}} the tail flip. The non-giant swimming occurs independently of the [...] LGI response since direct stimulation of the LGI with the electrodes results in a tail flip but not the subsequent non-giant swimming. This swimming response seems to be a <b>fixed</b> <b>action</b> pattern mediated by a central pattern generator since it does not require sensory feedback for physical and temporal maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|Behavioral neurobiologists in {{the field}} of neuroethology have {{researched}} this behavior extensively for over fifty years in the crayfish species Procambarus clarkii. Based on studies of P. clarkii it was discovered that the tail- flip mechanism is characterized by a decisive, all-or-nothing quality that inhibits [...] all unnecessary behaviors while generating a <b>fixed</b> <b>action</b> pattern for escape swimming. The type of escape response depends on the region of the crayfish that is stimulated but all forms require abdominal contractions. When a strong, unpleasant tactile stimulus is presented, such as a burst of water or the prod of a probe, a stereotyped behavior occurs in which the muscular tail and wide tail fan region of the telson are used like a paddle to propel the crustacean away from harm using a powerful abdominal flexions. [...] The entire process occurs in {{a fraction of a second}} as movements are generated within two hundredths of a second (20 milliseconds) from the original trigger stimulus and the period of latency after a flexion is a hundredth of a second (10 milliseconds). Finally, the caridoid escape reflex requires that neurons be able to complete the arduous task of synchronizing the flexion of several abdominal segments. [...] The speed, coordination, and decisiveness of the process seem to be the main attributes to its success.|$|E

50|$|Instincts are inborn complex {{patterns}} of behavior that exist in {{most members of the}} species, and should be distinguished from reflexes, which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to modify <b>fixed</b> <b>action</b> patterns.
