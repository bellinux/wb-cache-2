40|$|Abstract — Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) is a {{well known}} method for <b>fault</b> location, especially <b>in</b> power distribution networks. This paper presents the application of TDR for detecting <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> fieldbus wiring, {{since most of the}} <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> fieldbuses that are detected during initiation of operation are simply <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> wiring. These <b>faults</b> can be identified in the pulse reflection image by recognition of basic pulse reflection patterns. Because, this method is faced with a lot of practical problems, this paper introduces simulation as a new way to find <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> wiring in fieldbuses before the initiation of operation. During operation, <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> wiring can be detected in realtime with a differential method, if a TDR-function is integrated into the fieldbus.

40|$|The most {{reliable}} of the globally available relative data {{have been used}} to derive empirical for-mulas which relate the subsurface fault length, L, the fault area, S, and fault width, w, with the mo-ment magnitude, M. Separate such formulas have been derived for earthquakes generated by strike-slip faulting, by dip-slip <b>faulting</b> <b>in</b> continental regions and by dip-slip <b>faulting</b> <b>in</b> lithospheric subduction regions. The formula which relates the fault area with the magnitude is combined with the definition formulas of seismic moment and moment magnitude to derive also relations between the fault slip, u, and the moment magnitude {{for each of the three}} seismotectonic regimes. For a cer-tain magnitude, the fault length is larger for strike-slip faults than for dip-slip faults, while the fault width is small for strike-slip faults, larger for dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> continental regions and much larger for dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> regions of lithospheric subduction. For a certain magnitude, fault slip is about the same for strike-slip faults and dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> continental regions and smaller for dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> regions of lithospheric subduction. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{different}} schemes based on observers {{to detect and}} isolate <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> dynamic processes. In the case of <b>fault</b> diagnosis <b>in</b> instruments (FDI) there {{are different}} diagnosis schemes {{based on the number}} of observers: the Simplified Observer Scheme (SOS) only requires one observer, uses all the inputs and only one output, detecting <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> one detector; the Dedicated Observer Scheme (DOS), which again uses all the inputs and just one output, but this time there is a bank of observers capable of locating multiple <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> sensors, and the Generalized Observer Scheme (GOS) which involves a reduced bank of observers, where each observer uses all the inputs and m- 1 outputs, and allows the localization of unique faults. This work proposes a new scheme named Simplified Interval Observer SIOS-FDI, which does not requires the measurement of any input and just with just one output allows the detection of unique <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> sensors and because it does not require any input, it simplifies in an important way the diagnosis of <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> processes in which it is difficult to measure all the inputs, as in the case of biologic reactors...|$|R
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the penalty was {{in the form of}} time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted <b>fault</b> <b>in</b> awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E

Compared to other tectonic settings (for example <b>fault</b> zones <b>in</b> the continental crust, as recently reviewed by Faulkner et al. 2010), studies of <b>fault</b> rocks <b>in</b> subduction zones are still immature. Studies of the physical and chemical processes that occur during subduction earthquakes also remain in their infancy (see the detailed review of earthquake physics and chemistry based on the integrated field and laboratory approach by Niemeijer et al. 2012).

Another operation a month later, the Second Battle of Givenchy, cost 366 casualties for no appreciable gain. Again, Alderson was not solely at <b>fault</b> <b>in</b> these actions and he remained popular with British Army Headquarters, Prime Minister Borden and with his men, resulting in promotion to command the entire Canadian Expeditionary Force when a second Division arrived late in 1915. Despite this popularity, Sam Hughes continued to hold a grudge against Alderson and opposed him in political circles, taking offense at Alderson's refusal to accept promotions made by Hughes or Carson of untried Canadian officers and instead promoting veteran British officers in their place.

The forensic reconstruction effort had just begun when the Abell Committee reported its findings. No apparent <b>fault</b> <b>in</b> the aircraft was found, and the British government decided against opening a further public inquiry into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British aerospace industry, and the financial impact of the aircraft's grounding on BOAC's operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} faults and five of Fowler et al. 's least-studied smells in code: Data Clumps, Switch Statements, Speculative Generality, Message Chains, and Middle Man. We developed a tool to detect these five smells in three open-source systems: Eclipse, ArgoUML, and Apache Commons. We collected fault data from the change and fault repositories of each system. We built Negative Binomial regression models to analyse the relationships between smells and faults and report the McFadden effect size of those relationships. Our results suggest that Switch Statements {{had no effect on}} <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> any of the three systems; Message Chains increased <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> two systems; Message Chains which occurred in larger files reduced faults; Data Clumps reduced <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> Apache and Eclipse but increased <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> ArgoUML; Middle Man reduced <b>faults</b> only <b>in</b> ArgoUML, and Speculative Generality reduced <b>faults</b> only <b>in</b> Eclipse. File size alone affects <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> some systems but not in all systems. Where smells did significantly affect faults, the size of that effect was small (always under 10 percent). Our findings suggest that some smells do indicate fault-prone code in some circumstances but that the effect that these smells have on faults is small. Our findings also show that smells have different effects on different systems. We conclude that arbitrary refactoring is unlikely to significantly reduce fault-proneness and in some cases may increase fault-proneness...|$|R

Owing to {{the interaction of}} the major Pacific and Australia Plates, much of the regional plate boundary along central South Island is characterised by land deformation. The earthquake was a direct result of strike-slip faulting at the eastern end of the rupture zone of another strong magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake, which occurred on 22 February 2011 along the Port Hills Fault. The June earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor with a similar focal mechanism that struck 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier. Experts believe the quakes were triggered by a previously undiscovered <b>fault</b> <b>in</b> the region, located several kilometres south of the Port Hills Fault.
