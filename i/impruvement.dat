40|$|We {{have some}} methods {{for the power}} factor <b>impruvement</b> which are {{compensating}} capacitors, higher harmonics filters, polyphase-multistep and ac-chopper PWM etc. Then the equipment in circulating circuit which spends or absorbes electric power is inserted and electric power aren't regnerated in case of the inductive load. Thus reactive power are decrease and the input power factor are improved very much. Namely the "method of forced circulating" are thought. On the paper, power factor and higher harmonics are analyzed and illustrated with an example of 3 f power changers in case of the method of forced circulating. In futuer, GTO typed 3 f power changers are intended to control by micro-computer and improve output waveform by a power filter...|$|E

By surrendering to plowghing with moldboard plow {{in whole or in}} part by streamlining periodic tillage and keep at the ground surface of at least 15 - 30 % of all plant debris, protect soil the sheeterosion, it also eliminating at the same time the phenomenon of soil compaction. A proper crop rotation is alternating in culture plants with strong rooting with shallow rooting plants, leguminous plants have favorable effect for the successor cultures, soil nitrogen <b>impruvement</b> and contributing to the development of the root system. In research conducted at ARDS Turda on 2012 - 2013, in the cultivation of maize in the system with minimal compared to classic productions obtained system reϐlects the fact that maize is still a pretentious plant both climatic conditions and approach towards soil requirements. The inϐluence of the year are very strong for corn production, he differences being of 689 kg/ha in the variant with a seeding and fertilization along with 414 kg/ha in the variant with additional fertilization. By applying minimum tillage system soil aims primarily to combat soil erosion and water retention in the soil so it is so specially important to watch the long term effect of applying them to the environment...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we give {{a partial}} {{description}} of the sandpile group of the cone of the cartesian product of graphs in function of the sandpile group of the cone of their factors. Also, we introduce the concept of uniform homomorphism of graphs and prove that every surjective uniform homomorphism of graphs induces an injective homomorphism between their sandpile groups. As an application of these result we obtain an explicit description {{of a set of}} generators of the sandpile group of the cone of the hypercube of dimension d. Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures. The title was changed, other <b>impruvements</b> were made throughout the article. To appear in Linear Algebra and Its Application...|$|R
