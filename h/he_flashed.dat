500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. <b>He</b> <b>flashed</b> his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrical use of {{the word}} midons, {{borrowed}} from Guilhem de Poitou, allowed troubadours to address multiple listeners—the lords, men, and women of the court alike. A sort of hermaphroditic code word, or senhan, scholar Meg Bogin writes, the multiple meanings behind this term allowed a covert form of flattery: [...] "By refusing to disclose his lady's name, the troubadour permitted every woman in the audience, notably the patron's wife, to think that it was she; then, besides making her the object of a secret passion—it was always covert romance—by making her his lord <b>he</b> <b>flashed</b> her an aggrandized image of herself: she was more than 'just' a woman; she was a man." [...] These points of multiple meaning and ambiguity facilitated a [...] "coquetry of class", allowing the male troubadours to use the images of women as a means to gain social status with other men, but simultaneously, Bogin suggests, voiced deeper longings for the audience: [...] "In this way, the sexual expressed the social and the social the sexual; and in the poetry of courtly love the static hierarchy of feudalism was uprooted and transformed to express a world of motion and transformation." ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen-rich matter {{has been}} added to a CO white dwarf of initial mass 0. 516 at the rates 10 ^- 8 and 2 × 10 ^- 8 1, and results are {{compared}} with those for a white dwarf of the same initial mass which accretes pure helium at the same rates. For the chosen accretion rates, hydrogen burns in a series of recurrent mild flashes and the ashes of hydrogen burning build up a helium layer at the base of which a <b>He</b> <b>flash</b> eventually occurs. In previous studies involving accretion at higher rates and including initially more massive WDs, the diffusion of energy inward from the H shell-flashing region contributes to the increase in the temperature {{at the base of the}} helium layer, and the mass of the helium layer when the <b>He</b> <b>flash</b> begins is significantly smaller than in a comparison model accreting pure helium; the <b>He</b> shell <b>flash</b> is not strong enough to develop into a supernova explosion. In contrast, for the conditions adopted here, the temperature at the base of the He layer becomes gradually independent of the deposition of energy by H shell flashes, and the mass of the He layer when the <b>He</b> <b>flash</b> occurs is a function only of the accretion rate, independent of the hydrogen content of the accreted matter. When the <b>He</b> <b>flash</b> takes place, due to the high degeneracy at the base of the He layer, temperatures in the flashing zone will rise without a corresponding increase in pressure, nuclear burning will continue until nuclear statistical equilibrium is achieved; the model will become a supernova, but not of the classical type Ia variety.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether the observed {{high number of}} carbon- and nitrogen-enhanced extremely metal-poor stars {{could be explained by}} peculiar evolutionary properties during the core <b>He</b> <b>flash</b> {{at the tip of the}} red giant branch. For this purpose we compute a series of detailed stellar models expanding upon our previous work; in particular, we investigate if during the major <b>He</b> <b>flash</b> the penetration of the helium convective zone into the overlying hydrogen-rich layers can produce carbon- and nitrogen-rich abundances in agreement with current spectroscopic observations. The dependence of this phenomenon on selected model input parameters, such as initial metallicity and treatment of convection is examined in detail.
