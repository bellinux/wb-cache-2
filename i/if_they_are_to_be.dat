25|$|The {{earliest}} express-service refrigerator cars entered service around 1890, {{shortly after}} the first express train routes were established in North America. The cars did not come into general use until the early 20th century. Most units designed for express service are larger than their standard counterparts, and are typically constructed more {{along the lines of}} baggage cars than freight equipment. Cars must be equipped with speed-rated trucks and brakes, and— <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run ahead of the passenger car, must also incorporate an air line for pneumatic braking, a communication signal air line, and a steam line for train heating. Express units were typically painted in passenger car colors, such as Pullman green.|$|E

25|$|If an {{aircraft}} wreck is over fifty years old, which includes all aviation wreck sites from WWII, and crashed {{on what is}} currently federal lands, the sites are automatically protected under National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1 against disturbance of any kind without a permit. Sites on federal land are further protected under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 throughout a determination process. The act stipulates that all historic sites must undergo a Section 106 review to determine eligibility for the National Register of Historical Places prior to being disturbed. Federal lands include, among others, National Parks, National Forests, National Marine Sanctuaries, and land owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Aviation sites, for example a vintage hangar on an airport or a wreck site {{on the path of}} a proposed highway, are also immediately subject to Section 106 review <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disturbed by a project that either requires a federal permit or uses federal funds. In most cases, the State Historic Preservation Officer will determine whether or not an aviation site is eligible for the register.|$|E
25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's {{hierarchy of}} needs, created the ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing our basic material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts {{and there are a lot}} of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.|$|E
500|$|American policy {{during the}} Vietnam war was to destroy crops, {{accepting}} the sociopolitical impact {{that that would}} have. The RAND Corporation's Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA states: [...] "the fact that the VC [...] obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops... <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hampered by the crop destruction program, {{it will be necessary}} to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably 50% or more". Crops were deliberately sprayed with Agent Orange, areas were bulldozed clear of vegetation, and the rural population was subjected to bombing and artillery fire. In consequence, the urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled, growing from 2.8 million people in 1958 to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums due to people moving to cities.|$|E

500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E

Munro did not set any measure of topographic prominence by which a peak qualified as a separate mountain, so there has been much debate about how distinct two hills must be <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> counted as two separate Munros.|$|E

[...] Although she encountered constant objections to her public activism as a woman working closely with and presenting public lectures to men, Kelley continued her work. [...] She often shared her platform with ex-slaves despite disapproval by some in the audience. [...] "I rejoice {{to be identified with}} the despised people of color. [...] <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> despised, so ought their advocates to be".

2500|$|The {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} re-stated as [...] "commercial sporting organizations need close competition <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able {{to maximize their}} income", {{as a result of}} Neale's further conclusion that [...] "demand for competition will decrease if the spectators can predict the outcome of the game". However, this has been challenged by Roger G. Noll, who noted in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy in 2003 that [...] "a team that has dropped out of contentions for a championship will generally draw poorly, but it is likely to sell more tickets if it is playing a team that is at or near that top of the standings than if it is playing another weak team, even though the outcome of the latter game is more uncertain".|$|E

Reviews were mixed. Most of the critics who attended the first night felt it was a failure, and it looked as if the English Stage Company was going to go into liquidation. The Evening Standard, for example, called the play [...] "a failure" [...] and [...] "a self-pitying snivel". But the following Sunday, Kenneth Tynan of The Observer – the most influential critic of the day – praised it to the skies: 'I could not love anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger,' he wrote, [...] "It is the best young play of its decade". Harold Hobson of The Sunday Times called Osborne [...] "a writer of outstanding promise".
