While the unions had their own reservations about arbitration, they also agreed to it rather than find themselves forced to strike.

40|$|LLM (Labour Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Section 23 (2) of the Constitution gives every worker {{the right}} to strike and the LRA gives effect to that right. Section 64 of the LRA, however, {{requires}} that the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> first be referred to a bargaining council or the CCMA before a strike can be called. A certificate declaring that the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> was not resolved or 30 days or, alternatively, any extension must lapse and notice {{must be given to}} the employer before a strike can commence. Generally, the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> referred to conciliation must be the same <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> over which that the strike was called. The question that arises is {{what will happen to the}} status of the strike if the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> or the demand changes during the course of the strike. Reference was made to literature study in which the criteria were set out on how to determine the true <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b> Suggestions were also made on how to declare strike action unprotected should an employer be of the view that its workers are striking over a different <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> or demand than the one that was referred to conciliation.

5000|$|It is not {{necessary}} to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most salient}} {{feature of the}} rules of the ICC is its use of the [...] "terms of reference."

5000|$|The LRA defines an [...] "issue in dispute" [...] as [...] "the demand, the grievance, or {{the dispute}} {{that forms the}} subject matter of the strike or lock-out." [...] The <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> must fall within the {{definition}} of a strike (or lock-out). In other words, the demand, grievance or dispute about which the employees strike (or the employer locks out) must relate to a matter of mutual interest.|$|R
50|$|But {{there are}} clear {{situations}} where the evidence which {{formed the basis for}} the assignment of perjury is clearly unconnected to the main <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b> <b>In</b> that case the materiality requirement as a criterion for culpability is then justified. In the case of Omoregie v D.P.P, three assignments were made against the accused (appellant) in a civil case and, the question arose as to whether those assignments were material to main <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute,</b> and whether the appellant made the false statements knowingly. The dispute centered on whether or not the appellant held himself out or was employed as an agent personally responsible for monies on all cement sold out to customers on credit. The first count of the perjury charge was with regard to the money the Plaintiff (a company in Germany) transferred to the appellant in Lagos. The appellant said in his evidence that the alleged money had been transferred before his return to Lagos from Germany. Exhibit ‘AA’ and ‘BB’ which were letters written by the appellant corroborated his evidence that he was still awaiting a transfer of the money two weeks after his return to Lagos. In view of the time lapse between the period these letters were written and the period the appellant gave his oral evidence the Supreme Court was of view that the appellant memory might have been playing him false. Apart from the lapse of time which affects memory the court was also of the opinion that even if the evidence on this point was false {{it may not be a}} basis for culpability unless it is shown that such evidence was deliberately made with knowledge of its falsehood. And more importantly the court found that even if the evidence was false it was not material to the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Contracts enforce [...] "labor peace" [...] {{through a}} clause that prohibits strikes for the {{duration}} of the contract. Some unions agree to a no-strike clause in exchange for a grievance arbitration provision, or some similar concession. Not all labor contracts have no-strike clauses. On some occasions, no-strike clauses have become a contract <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute,</b> with workers refusing to accept the no-strike clause, and employers refusing to agree to a contract without same.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} initial {{documents}} upon which a case is founded: a Claim and (in most cases) the Particulars of Claim, and the Defence. These are broadly {{equivalent to the}} Summons, Complaint and Answer filed in some other jurisdictions. They set out the case to be presented by each party, briefly but in sufficient detail to understand the legal <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> and claims made by each party as a result.|$|E
50|$|The court {{noted that}} even if the applicants' request were to be {{regarded}} as an application for further particulars, it would only have delimited the <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> between those who requested the further particulars, namely the first three applicants, and the respondent. It was not clear how it could be said that it also bound the respondent with respect to the other accused who had not requested the further particulars.|$|E

5000|$|Evesham Abbey's {{rights in}} this church's donations, tithes and lands were an <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>disputes</b> between the abbey and the bishop and in 1208 it was {{proposed}} {{to resolve the}} difficulties by appropriating the church. [...] By then the abbey possessed two-thirds of the great tithes of Donnington and perhaps also of Maugersbury. In 1291 the Abbey also received a pension of £1 5s. 0d. from the church. The Abbey's attempts to appropriate subsided and the living (benefice) stayed as a rectory.|$|R
50|$|The State {{bears the}} onus of proving that the accused’s conduct was voluntary. If, however, the accused alleges that he acted involuntarily, he must lay an evidential {{foundation}} for that defence. It {{is not sufficient}} for him simply to place the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> and leave it at that. Furthermore, even if the accused’s act or omission was involuntary, he may yet be held criminally liable if the involuntary conduct {{was made possible by}} some prior voluntary conduct on his part.|$|R
50|$|Collateral {{estoppel}} cases raise constitutional {{due process}} problems, {{particularly when it}} is applied to a party that {{did not participate in}} the original suit. Due process mandates that collateral estoppel not be applied to a party that has not litigated the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute,</b> unless that party is in legal privity to a party that litigated it. In other words, every disputant is entitled to a day in court and cannot ordinarily be bound by the negative result of another disputant's suit, even if that other disputant had exactly the same legal and factual arguments.|$|R
50|$|Sometime between 1850 and 1912, when New Mexico gained statehood, the Rio Grande shifted course. How much it shifted, where, and {{in which}} {{direction}} were the central <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute,</b> as both sides agreed that the Rio Grande, as it existed in 1850, was the true boundary. By 1912, the de facto western boundary of Texas was well beyond the Rio Grande in most places. Deeds for lands over a half-mile west of the Rio Grande were filed in Texas, taxes for these lands were paid in Texas, and the residents voted in Texas.|$|E
50|$|Oral {{arguments}} are spoken {{to a judge}} or appellate court by a lawyer (or parties when representing themselves) of the legal reasons why they should prevail. Oral argument at the appellate level accompanies written briefs, which also advance the argument of each party in the legal dispute. Oral arguments can also occur during motion practice {{when one of the}} parties presents a motion to the court for consideration before trial, such as when the case is to be dismissed on a point of law, or when summary judgment may lie because there are no factual <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In New South Wales, a {{court may}} {{set aside the}} whole, or part of, a {{subpoena}} {{on the basis that}} it is a [...] "fishing expedition". In Lowery v Insurance Australia Ltd, the NSW Court of Appeal held that where documents requested in the schedule of a subpoena are deemed to have no relevance to the proceedings in dispute, the subpoena may be set aside as it has no legitimate forensic purpose. It was also held that it was not the role of the Court to redraft the subpoena and narrow its scope to those <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Archibald Williams argued a {{case before}} the United States Supreme Court on December 6 and 7, 1855. Orville Browning, Williams's good friend from Quincy, Illinois, was the {{opposing}} lawyer. The <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute</b> dealt with rival claims for lands and centered on whether the question of [...] "bad faith" [...] in the matter should be decided by a judge or by a jury. The Court ruled in Wright v. Mattison that [...] "bad faith" [...] should not {{be decided by the}} judge but by the jury, which had been the precedent. The Court ordered the case to be retried in a lower court. The outcome was a victory for Browning and a loss for Williams.|$|R
50|$|The first affirmative and {{negative}} speeches are constructive speeches, intended {{to put forth}} the arguments which will comprise the <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b> A cross-examination period of three minutes follows each of these speeches in order to clarify arguments and gain information relevant to each competitor's position. Each competitor is then given a six-minute rebuttal in which their responses {{and development of the}} arguments are finalized. At the end of the round, the affirmative is given one final three-minute speech to review why their plan ought to be passed in support of the resolution. An assigned judge will then cast a ballot to affirm or negate the resolution.|$|E

50|$|Legal {{representation}} is not permitted, except when special permission is granted {{in cases where}} the dispute raises complex questions of law. The written procedure is simplified. The judges explain the rules of evidence and procedure to the parties. They direct the proceedings, question witnesses, hear the parties, and decide the <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b> They provide each party with fair and impartial assistance, so as to render the substantive law effective and ensure that it is carried out. Where circumstances allow, the judges endeavour to bring the parties to an agreement. When judgment is rendered, it is a reasoned decision and cannot be appealed. Judges in this division also decide tax-related summary appeals.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{exercise}} in adversarial collaboration. An adversarial collaboration is an investigation carried out jointly by two individuals or research groups who, having proposed conflicting hypotheses, seek to resolve the <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>dispute.</b> The experiment reported was designed to reconcile differences between the apparently conflicting results of two previous experiments, one carried out by Kahneman, the other by the other authors. Specifically, it investigates whether, when consumers consider giving up money in exchange for goods, they construe potential money outlays as losses. This issue bears on the explanation of the widely observed disparity between willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept valuations of costs and benefits, which has proved so problematic for contingent valuation studies. The results of the experiment do not decisively resolve the question <b>in</b> <b>dispute,</b> but they are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that money outlays are perceived as losses...|$|R
