40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{theoretical and}} empirical research on the roles and functions of emerging <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets</b> and the resulting implications on policy and regulations. Previous studies revealed that commodity <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets</b> offered an effective and welfare-improving method to deal with price volatility. Financial <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets</b> have helped to support capital inflows into emerging market economies. On the other hand, the use of financial derivatives has led to exacerbated volatility and accelerated capital outflow. There is a consensus that derivatives are seldom {{the cause of a}} financial crisis but they could amplify the negative effects of the crisis and accelerate contagion. Previous studies of <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets</b> have supported the hedging role of emerging <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets.</b> Empirical results from a few emerging countries suggest a price discovery function of emerging futures markets. The findings on the price stabilization function of emerging <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets</b> are mixed. Finally, recent research has documented that constructive development of <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets</b> in emerging market economies needs to be supported by sound macroeconomic fundamentals as well as updated financial policies and regulations. commodity <b>derivatives,</b> emerging <b>markets,</b> financial <b>derivatives,</b> hedging, price discovery, price stabilization,...|$|R

5000|$|The court {{noted that}} the fourth factor {{was not to be}} given the {{greatest}} weight, but to be taken equally with the other three in a determination of fair use. [...] The analysis for market effect does not look to whether the secondary work detracts from market of the copyrighted work, but rather does it substitute the market of the original (the nature of copyright as a monopoly on publication does not permit a substitution). The court held that the differences in form between The SAT and Seinfeld and the lack of transformative purpose made the book a derivative work in a <b>derivative</b> <b>market.</b> Because the SAT was the only Seinfeld trivia book in existence, it completely substituted this <b>derivative</b> <b>market</b> for the show. The court further reasoned that even though Castle Rock did not intend to enter the trivia book market, the existence of The SAT effectively usurped its right to do so. If the <b>derivative</b> <b>market</b> was one that the copyright holder would generally develop or license, a secondary author would be barred from entering it. On the other hand, if the market was one generally protected by fair use, such as criticism, parody, or academic scholarship, the copyright holder could not enter those markets and attempt to preclude secondary authors from entering.|$|E

In this paper, the prospective of using weather derivatives in Portugal and why Portugal should use such instruments as well as the potential of Portugal's enterprises are presented. Design/methodology/approach - This paper attempts to distinguish the reasons for the appearance of a weather <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> and the growth potential of the European weather market. Findings - Successful development of a Portuguese weather <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> will require three things. For the successful development of weather <b>derivatives</b> <b>market,</b> a legal and economic framework is needed, as well as the development of new weather products, training of qualified specialists for working with these instruments and attracting companies interested in hedging their profits.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{off-balance}} sheet transactions on interest and exchange rate exposures has become more important for emerging market countries that are experiencing remarkable growth in <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets.</b> Using firm level data, we report a significant fall in exposure over the past 10 years and relate this to higher <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> participation. Our methodology is composed of a three stage approach: First, we measure foreign exchange exposures using the Adler-Dumas (1984) model. Next, we follow an indirect approach to infer <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> participation at the firm level. Finally, we study the relationship between exchange rate exposure and <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> participation. Our results show that foreign exchange exposure is negatively related to <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> participation, and support the hedging explanation of the exchange rate exposure puzzle. This decline is especially salient in the financial sector, for bigger firms, and over longer time periods. Results are robust to using different exchange rates, a GARCH-SVAR approach to measure exchange rate exposure, and different retur...|$|R

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} unwinding of leveraged positions {{can trigger}} financial market turbulence. Although balance-sheet measures of leverage are available, {{it is useful}} to construct a measure of leverage that incorporates both on- and off-balance-sheet activities. This paper provides measures of leverage implicit in derivative contracts by decomposing the contracts into cash market equivalent components. A leverage ratio can then be calculated for this replicating portfolio, which consists of own funds (equity) and borrowed funds equivalents (debt). Methods for aggregating leverage by institution and by markets are presented. The interaction between leverage and risk is discussed, and a modified capital adequacy ratio is calculated, which captures off-balance-sheet exposure.

South Africa''s <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> has grown rapidly in recent years, supporting capital inflows and helping market participants to price, unbundle and transfer risk. There are tight regulations on asset allocations by insurance and pension funds to prevent excessive risk taking. The development of <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets</b> in sub-Saharan African countries could enable market participants to self-insure against volatile capital flows. Theiroverdependence on bank credit as a source of funding could be reduced and their management of seasonal risk could be improved through the introduction of commodity futures. However, these markets must be appropriately regulated and supervised. Since such markets would likely be small, consideration should be given to the establishment of a regional <b>derivatives</b> <b>market.</b> Capital flows;Financial instruments;Financial risk;Liquidity management;Risk management;Securities regulations;Stock markets;derivatives <b>market,</b> futures contracts, <b>derivative,</b> currency futures, bond, <b>derivatives</b> <b>markets,</b> <b>derivative</b> instruments, stock futures, commodity futures, stock exchange, capital markets, futures market, capital market, interest rate futures, bond futures, hedge funds, volatile capital flows, futures exchange, bond options, capital inflows, financial services, financial market, hedging, interest rate derivatives, international capital, securities market, capital outflows, options on futures, currency derivatives, financial system, hedge, volatile capital, financial institutions, government bond, financial <b>derivatives,</b> capital <b>market</b> growth, access to international capital, options contracts, capital flow, capital adequacy, financial futures, financial regulations, international capital flows, open interest, stock exchanges, volatility of capital flows, bond yield curve, bond market, hedging instruments, bond yield, bond issues, financial markets, futures contract, government bond market, government bond yield, risk aversion, equity derivative, <b>derivatives</b> exchanges, bond <b>market</b> capitalization, equity <b>derivatives,</b> benchmark bond, call options, financial systems, financial regulation, derivatives trading, currency <b>derivative,</b> securities <b>markets,</b> <b>derivatives</b> <b>market</b> activities, bonds, credit rating, bond markets, financial sector, option contracts, local bond market, options futures, capital flow reversals, border capital flow, local bond...|$|R
