One of McCormack's claims to fame is his design for the inexpensive Kentucky Sanitary Privy (KSP), an important improvement on the primitive outhouses used in most rural communities during the era. It was adopted for worldwide use in rural areas by the USPHS and the IHB.|$|R

Increasing student numbers, decreasing <b>funds</b> <b>for</b> <b>staff,</b> {{and a need}} {{to encourage students to}} develop independent learning skills that will be of value throughout their professional lives, have meant that the nature of their learning in the Topographical Anatomy Laboratory has had to change.

Several innovations have been introduced at University College London, including a multimedia laboratory which is the focus of this paper.
