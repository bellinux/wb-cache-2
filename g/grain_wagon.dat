50|$|The DMI design <b>grain</b> <b>wagon</b> was {{incorporated}} into the product line, along with several lines purchased from United Farm Tool. They include the no till grain drill, the “Speedy” bean cutter, the multi crop shredder and the high dump wagon.|$|E
50|$|Back on {{the road}} to Rome, Vorenus and Pullo, still unable to figure out why they're meeting no resistance, cross paths with the {{soldiers}} and the stolen treasury gold, along with Eirene being led along tied to the wagon by her bound wrists. The soldiers explain that the lack of resistance is because Pompey and the Senate have left the city, thereby permitting Vorenus and the scouting party to proceed without caution. When Vorenus questions the lead man about the cart, he's told that it's just a <b>grain</b> <b>wagon.</b> But when Vorenus points out that they're all wearing soldiers' sandals and that soldiers would have no business guarding a <b>grain</b> <b>wagon,</b> a fight ensues and all the men but the driver, who has taken refuge in the woods, are driven off and killed while Eirene remains tied to the wagon.|$|E

50|$|Early Dodge Center was a farming {{community}} known for growing <b>grain.</b> <b>Grain</b> <b>wagons</b> lined {{up and down}} Main Street and into the surrounding countryside waiting their turn at either of two grain elevators.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{funding for the}} bogie <b>grain</b> <b>wagon</b> {{construction}} program was drying up, but demand for available rolling stock demanded faster loading and unloading times. Additionally the Victorian Railways had a long-held tradition of restoring and upgrading existing rolling stock, rather than purchasing new vehicles, because that allowed funding to come from maintenance budgets rather than new allocations from the Government; regardless of whether that would provide a better long-term outcome; and that attitude persisted through the early VicRail years.|$|E
5000|$|Bruce Fuller, Proprietor of Rustico Farm & Cellars is {{a passionate}} {{collector}} of Canadian and American [...] "old-west" [...] artifacts and has showcased a collection on the property. The sampling room {{located in the}} winery behind a western-style false-front is aptly called a tasting [...] "saloon" [...] and displays much of his ongoing collection and is a welcome site for visitors looking to travel back in the area's ranching, mining and agricultural history. An integral part of his collection includes three authentic wagons: a canvas-covered prairie <b>grain</b> <b>wagon,</b> an operational chuck wagon and a 1902 Doctor's Buggy (runabout).|$|E
50|$|In 1948, Gary Vermeer {{created a}} {{mechanical}} hoist {{to ease the}} process of unloading his <b>grain</b> <b>wagon</b> during harvest. Farm neighbors observed his wagon hoist in operation and were soon asking for the implement. At his request, a local machine shop fabricated {{a number of these}} hoists to meet the demand. In the spring of 1948, it was evident that the unit could be produced and marketed on a larger scale. Consequently, as word spread, Gary (along with his cousin and local banker Ralph Vermeer) started Vermeer Manufacturing Co. Shortly thereafter, they began manufacturing the mechanical hoist in their newly built factory. However, the introduction of competitive hydraulic wagon hoists made it obvious that new products must be developed for the young company to survive.|$|E
50|$|The Avoca-Ararat {{section of}} the line has been unused {{for a number of}} years and Pacific National used it to store over 100 surplus <b>grain</b> <b>wagons,</b> until many of them were {{reactivated}} to carry the 2011-2012 harvest.|$|R
50|$|In December 2010, CBH awarded Watco WA Rail {{a ten-year}} {{contract}} to operate {{services in the}} south of Western Australia. To operate the services, CBH purchased 22 CBH class locomotives from MotivePower, Boise and 574 <b>grain</b> <b>wagons</b> from Bradken, Xuzhou.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were rendered obsolete by new bogie <b>grain</b> <b>wagons</b> introduced {{from the late}} 1980s, and scrapping ran through to the early 1990s making the class {{one of the last}} fixed-wheel vehicles to run in revenue service on the V/Line network.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the work summarized in this report and in the interim report was to {{study the effects of}} targeted implement-of-husbandry loads. This report is to complement phase I of this work, which was summarized in the interim report, entitled Response of Iowa Pavements to Heavy Agricultural Loads (December 1999). The response of newly constructed Portland cement concrete (PCC) and asphalt cement concrete (ACC) pavements under semitruck, single-axle single-tire <b>grain</b> <b>wagon,</b> single-axle dual-tire <b>grain</b> <b>wagon,</b> tandem and tridem tank wagons were summarized in the interim report. Phase II of this project, presented herein, was to complete the study in terms of how tracked agricultural vehicles relate to the reference 20, 000 -pound single-axle semi-truck. In this report the response of these two pavements under a tracked <b>grain</b> <b>wagon</b> is documented...|$|E
50|$|Externally {{the wagon}} was largely {{identical}} to the <b>grain</b> <b>wagons,</b> but painted brown, coded FH1 and marked for superphosphate traffic. In May of the following year a further five wagons were converted to match. They were used for traffic between Corio and Wodonga until the early 1990s.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, CBH {{decided to}} put its rail grain haulage {{services}} out to tender for the first time. It aimed {{that the amount of}} grain transported by rail rise from 50% to 70%. CBH settled on a business model that saw it invest in new locomotives and <b>grain</b> <b>wagons,</b> with day-to-day operations contracted out.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do {{not conform}} to the UIC standard wagon or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special <b>wagons.</b> Many French <b>grain</b> <b>wagons</b> therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their wagon numbers.|$|R
50|$|In October 1966 {{the line}} was reopened, and in 1996 it was {{converted}} to standard gauge, along with the main Melbourne-Adelaide railway. The Avoca-Ararat section of the line has been unused {{for a number of}} years, and Pacific National used it to store over 100 surplus <b>grain</b> <b>wagons</b> until many of them were reactivated to carry the 2011-2012 harvest.|$|R

50|$|On 2009, CBH Group {{decided to}} put its rail grain haulage {{services}} out to tender for the first time. This work had previously been performed by the Western Australia Government Railways, Australian Western Railroad and QR National (now Aurizon).

CBH settled on a business model that saw it invest in new locomotives and <b>grain</b> <b>wagons,</b> with day-to-day operations contracted out.|$|R
50|$|ATN Access {{purchased}} seven L class locomotives from Westrail in July 1999 (251, 253, 254, 265, 270, 271 and 276) {{with four}} being overhauled by National Railway Equipment Company, Whyalla. In June 2000, three 830 class (833, 838 and 845) locomotives were purchased from Australian Southern Railroad. These were often supplemented by locomotives hired from Chicago Freight Car Leasing Australia and Great Northern Rail Services. ATN Access also imported 44 new <b>grain</b> <b>wagons</b> from China. These were constructed at the Qiqihar Railway Workshops in Northern China.|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, a hopper wagon {{involves}} an open frame with sloped sheets, giving a wider {{area at the}} top and a smaller area at the bottom. The type of intended traffic usually guides both the slopes and whether or not the wagon has a roof to keep the freight dry (for example, with cement or <b>grain</b> <b>wagons).</b> Later designs experimented with pressurised drums to store various powdered goods, pumped {{into and out of the}} wagons using external high-pressure air supplies. The traffic will also dictate the design of the unloading mechanism for the wagon, as usually found between the axles.|$|R
50|$|Routes {{can become}} {{congested}} where {{only a fraction}} of routes can accept certain traffic types. For example, a road may have a low bridge that restricts the height of any trucks (lorries), or a rail line may be unable to accept wagons loaded beyond a certain axle load. This will result in any route that can accept a wider range of vehicles being congested, and other more restrictive routes be underutilised. Rail traffic between the US and Mexico is limited by the types of vehicles, especially <b>grain</b> <b>wagons,</b> and as 2009 the only routes that could accept newer rail wagons passed through Texas.|$|R

50|$|Further {{conversions}} {{occurred in}} 2001-2003, when Freight Australia contracted ANI Bradken (Mittagong, NSW) to rebuild 22 of the VHEF class and 20 of the VHGF class {{to achieve a}} 100 LT capacity; the former were rebuilt into VHNY-class 100 LT <b>grain</b> <b>wagons,</b> becoming 1000-1021, while the latter kept their numbers (in the 230-296 range) but were reclassed to VHLY. The modifications were achieved by adding pneumatic roof hatches and discharge doors, strengthened side sills, a higher roof and stronger bogies. Around the same time, for comparison purposes, Alstom was contracted to new-build nine 100 LT grain hoppers at its Ballarat North Workshops; these became VHKY 1151-1159.|$|R
50|$|A chaser bin, {{also called}} grain cart or (<b>grain)</b> auger <b>wagon,</b> is a trailer towed by a tractor with a {{built-in}} auger conveyor system, usually with a large capacity (from several hundred to over 1000 bushels; around 15 t is average).|$|R
50|$|In general, open wagons {{have been}} painted in Victorian Railways Wagon Red livery. The grain-proofed wagons had a {{diagonal}} yellow stripe in opposite corners to readily identify these vehicles from non <b>grain</b> proofed <b>wagons,</b> and from 1970 the GY wagons were painted Hansa-Yellow.|$|R
50|$|An {{order was}} placed for three vehicles, and RTL1 began tests in 1995. It was tested north of Bendigo, but was {{only able to}} haul up to seven loaded bogie <b>grain</b> hopper <b>wagons.</b> Tyre failure became a {{constant}} problem, and so RTL2 and RTL3 have not been built.|$|R
50|$|It {{was quickly}} found that other states used the gauge {{conversion}} {{capability of the}} wagons to their advantage, and quite often <b>grain</b> <b>wagons</b> of this type would vanish beyond the border, only reappearing when in need of repair. In response to this issue, nearly all the wagons were recoded from GJX to GJF in 1972, indicating that {{they were no longer}} suitable for gauge conversion but still able to travel at up to 50 mph. The exception was twenty wagons; at first these were selected at random but this was quickly changed to have GJX 1-20 and GJF covering the rest of the class. One of the easiest ways to tell is whether the wagon had a circle or square next to its number; if a square then the wagon would be fitted with load-compensating brake equipment, whereas a circle would mean that as well as grade control equipment, the standard for gauge-convertible rollingstock.|$|R
50|$|The Carlingford Produce Store {{is located}} {{adjacent}} to the station. It included facilities to load <b>grain</b> onto railway <b>wagons.</b> Some of this infrastructure is still extant today. A large amount of land lies behind the station, for future extensions of the line.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the system {{outlined}} here {{is to increase the}} operational efficiency of multi-vehicle agricultural operations, such as harvest and planting. The system will incorporate hardware and software that communicates to the vehicle operator the status and position of other vehicles and their grain bin fill levels and grain attributes. The system will also provide assistance to the operator to optimize the movement between combines, <b>grain</b> <b>wagons</b> and road transport so that any bottlenecks and time the combines are waiting to be unloaded in the field are minimized. The real-time information provided to the operators of each machine will lead to a much more effective use of resources in the field, thus increasing productivity. As an example for grain harvest, the system will include communication between multiple combines, tractor/grain carts, transport trucks and the point of harvested grain delivery. Information exchanged between various agricultural equipment will include current location, speed, grain level status, time to bin full levels, scheduled unloading time and location. A new vehicle cab display will be developed that will improve communication of the status information to the driver and will show the location of the vehicles and their scheduled unload points. A survey instrument is also developed to assess the value of the system and identify appropriate parameters for communicating between the various vehicles...|$|R

50|$|In the mid-1850s, small gristmills {{began to}} spring up along several creeks {{that ran through}} the land {{where much of the}} area's grain was grown. This was {{a direct result of the}} fact that prior to these mills, farmers had to haul their <b>grain</b> in horse-drawn <b>wagons</b> over long {{distances}} to the mills at Saint Anthony Falls along the Mississippi River.|$|R
6000|$|Another day, as I {{was riding}} on the load of wheat-sheaves, one of the men, in {{pitching}} the <b>grain</b> to the <b>wagon</b> lifted a rattlesnake with his fork.

50|$|In 1905, {{the vast}} prairie land {{was covered with}} long grass {{referred}} to as 'prairie wool'. There were few trees or bluffs. The fertile black soil attracted many first settlers to the area and soon farms developed with sod and log homes. Farmers turned sod with horse and ox teams, sometimes using a walking plow (sulky) to prepare the ground for grain sowing. Grain was cut with binders, stooked, and threshed. Farmers hauled <b>grain</b> by <b>wagon</b> or horse-drawn sleigh to Zumbro and Artland. In the winter months, grain was hauled across the ice of Manitou Lake. Early settlers purchased groceries and supplies at Lashburn, Artland, or Chauvin, Alberta. A popular shopping method of the time was the Eaton's catalogue.|$|R
