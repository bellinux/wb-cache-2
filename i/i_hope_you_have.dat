A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E

Dickinson thanked the publisher Thomas Niles for including her poem, to which he responded somewhat apologetically: [...] "you have doubtless perceived [...] was slightly changed in phraseology." ...|$|E
