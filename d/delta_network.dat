The results indicate that both the tidal forces in Jiaomen and Humen and the runoff power in Modaomen are intensified, {{which leads to a}} fresh water movement from the northeast to the southwest side of the West and North River <b>Delta</b> <b>Networks.</b> However, the water distributions in the East River <b>Delta</b> <b>Networks</b> remain almost the same. The residual currents in the RNPRD decreased dramatically in the West and North River <b>Delta</b> <b>Networks</b> due to the increasing volume of the river channels.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{definition}} of a class of NxN multistage interconnection networks called Generalized Parallel <b>Delta</b> <b>Networks</b> (GPDNs). This class includes the already known Replicated <b>Delta</b> <b>Networks</b> (RDNs) and Parallel <b>Delta</b> <b>Networks</b> (PDNs). For the GPDNs the rearrangeability condition is given and a routing algorithm for the establishment of any set of connection requests is presented. The proposed algorithm operates in case of GPDNs composed of 2 Qx 2 Q swtching elements and it is able to set-up any permutation with a time complexity equal to O(Nlog 2 N). As far as the implementation of rearrangeable topologies is concerned, the fields of applicability of RDNs, PDNs and other GPDNs have been investigated. In particular, it has been proved that, if large networks (N) 256) have to be implemented, GPDNs structures requires a lower number of switching elements with respect to RDNs and PDNs. This features can be obtained without any impairment on the complexity of the routing algorithm...|$|R

In this paper, we compare three delta-based networks (namely, the replicated <b>delta</b> <b>network,</b> the dilated <b>delta</b> <b>network,</b> and the expanded <b>delta</b> <b>network),</b> with two crossbar-based networks (namely, the replicated crossbar switch and the expanded crossbar switch).

Two policies for packets successfully reaching the output side of a network are considered: singleand multiple-acceptance. Many interesting findings are reported. First, the expanded <b>delta</b> <b>network</b> appears {{to be a very good}} choice in terms of crosspoint complexity.

It operates for any value of n and shows a polynomial time complexity equal to O(N 3 / 2). Moreover, in case of the setup of a single connection request, this algorithm assures a time complexity equal to O(VN). This property makes it well suitable to an asynchronous telecommunication environment...|$|E
40|$|Many neural {{networks}} exhibit stability in their activation patterns {{over time in}} response to inputs from sensors operating under real-world conditions. By capitalizing on this property of natural signals, we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture called a <b>delta</b> <b>network</b> in which each neuron transmits its value only when the change in its activation exceeds a threshold. The execution of RNNs as delta networks is attractive because their states must be stored and fetched at every timestep, unlike in convolutional {{neural networks}} (CNNs). We show that a naive run-time <b>delta</b> <b>network</b> implementation offers modest improvements {{on the number of}} memory accesses and computes, but optimized training techniques confer higher accuracy at higher speedup. With these optimizations, we demonstrate a 9 X reduction in cost with negligible loss of accuracy for the TIDIGITS audio digit recognition benchmark. Similarly, on the large Wall Street Journal speech recognition benchmark even existing networks can be greatly accelerated as delta networks, and a 5. 7 x improvement with negligible loss of accuracy can be obtained through training. Finally, on an end-to-end CNN trained for steering angle prediction in a driving dataset, the RNN cost can be reduced by a substantial 100 X...|$|E

40|$|As {{multiprocessor}} architectures {{become more}} prevalent, understanding {{the performance of}} interconnection networks becomes more critical. Because the cost of these networks is high, it is desirable to use the least sophisticated network which will not degrade system performance. By considering a more general model of <b>delta</b> <b>networks</b> it is shown that the full bandwidth of these networks cannot be utilized in many situations and {{that the amount of}} network bandwidth that can be utilized varies from application to application. Because the bandwidth required to support a given application does vary, it is desirable to evaluate the performance of a family of networks whose members have lower bandwidths than do <b>delta</b> <b>networks.</b> From this family of hybrid networks the choice of interconnection network can be made such that system cost is minimized while system performance remains unchanged. Since VLSI is the predominant implementation technique in current computer systems the constraints imposed on network design by VLSI must also be considered. In particular, the I/O bottleneck caused by pin limitations may force the network to be partitioned over multiple VLSI packages. How the network is partitioned greatly impacts the level of system performance. Additionally, implementation of networks in VLSI presents an alternative method of reducing system cost. This is accomplished through reduction in network data path width. Under some conditions this technique is a better method of reducing system cost than is the use of hybrid networks...|$|R

40|$|The <b>DELTA</b> <b>network</b> in Geneva groups 54 {{primary care}} {{physicians}} working in partnership with 3 insurance companies and covers approximately 12, 000 affiliates. In 2000, the network received a capitation for 4, 500 of these affiliates for all their health care, starting at the first franc of cost. The care included all out-patient care (emergency visits, doctor office visits, laboratory studies, x-ray, prescription medicines, physiotherapy) as well as 50 % of in-hospital costs. The capitation was calculated from the estimated patient risk based on sex, age {{and a history of}} prior hospitalization. The insurance partners projected a 37 % cost savings. This expectation was exceeded, thus allowing a rebate of 100 Swiss francs (68 euros) to each affiliate who had paid the entire, non-taxable, health care premium (approximately 300 Swiss francs [204 euros] per month per affiliate). This article attempts to explain the resulting reduction in costs. Due to inadequate funding, the network was unable to study statistics or diagnoses in order to analyze this experiment.

During the course of these meetings, the specificity of out-patient medicine was stressed (decisional analysis, subjectivity and the management of uncertainties).
