40|$|An {{oscillator}} {{based on}} distributed amplifier realized by using CRLH (Composite Right-/Left-Handed) unit cells is designed and experimentally validated. The positive feedback {{consists of a}} transmission line which connects the input port and drain <b>idle</b> <b>port</b> of the amplifier. The remaining two ports of the distributed amplifier are the oscillator output ports. For this oscillator topology, the transistors give the same contribution to the output power. The measured powers at the two output ports are equal to 12. 6 dBm and 10. 4 dBm. The experimental frequency of oscillation is 2. 77 GHz, the difference compared to the simulated value being less than 1 %...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{work done}} in developing instrumentation for mm-wave radio astronomy. The main subject of the thesis is a sideband separating (2 SB) receiver for 85 - 115 GHz based on a quadrature scheme with two identical SIS mixer junctions pumped by a LO applied with 90 ° phase difference. The design {{is based on a}} layout where the quadrature scheme is implemented using waveguide based and integrated on chip components. This type of scheme requires balanced power division for both LO and RF channels. The key component in the mixer is a waveguide to microstrip double probe transition used as a power divider to split the input RF signal and to provide transition from waveguide to microstrip line. The double probe transition enables the integration of all mixer components on a single compact substrate. The design also involves coupled lines directional couplers to introduce the LO power to the mixer junctions with the required phase delay. Additional SIS junctions are used to provide termination load for the <b>idle</b> <b>port</b> of the couplers. The design of all mixer components is presented in detail together with different techniques used in the calculations. The measurement methods specific for the 2 SB mixer are described and illustrated with examples from real mixer measurements. Extensive mixer tests were carried out to characterize the mixer by measuring its single sideband noise temperature and sideband separation. The best single sideband noise temperature is below 40 K with a sideband suppression ratio above 12 dB for upper and lower sidebands. A method to deduce the IF chain noise contribution vs. the IF frequency by using the SIS junction as a hot/cold load is also presented. This work addresses also specific problems and challenges encountered during the measurement of the 2 SB mixer...|$|E
40|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>port</b> {{scanning}} uses side-channel {{attacks to}} bounce scans {{off of a}} “zombie” host to stealthily scan a victim IP address and determine if a port is open or closed, or infer IP-based trust relationships between the zombie and victim. In this paper, we present results from building a transition system model of a network protocol stack for an attacker, victim, and zombie, and testing this model for non-interference properties using model checking. We present two new methods of idle scans in this paper that resulted from our modeling effort, {{both of which have}} been verified through implementation. One is based on TCP RST rate limiting and the other on SYN caches. The latter does not require the attacker to send any packets to the victim on the port to be scanned, not even forged packets. This gives the attacker additional capabilities beyond known idle scan techniques, such as the ability to scan ports that are blocked by a firewall or locate hosts on trusted networks, to which the attacker is not able to route packets, and infer their operating system. This is in contrast to the one currently known method of idle scan in the literature, which is based on non-random IPIDs. For the future design of network protocols, we suggest that a notion of trusted vs. untrusted networks and hosts be made explicit in the protocol stack {{all the way down to}} the IP layer. This will enable shared, limited resources to be divided in a way that achieves non-interference and makes idle scans impossible. Using symbolic model checking, we verify that separate RST rate limitations for trusted vs. untrusted hosts achieves non-interference (without the SYN cache). Using bounded model checking we model a split SYN cache structure with separate buffers for trusted and untrusted hosts and prove non-interference to a depth of 1000 transitions. Because each transition is roughly a packet, this means that idle scans are eliminated by the split SYN cache for all practical purposes...|$|E
30|$|Most {{existing}} proposals apply device-level {{power conservation}} strategy, which intends {{to switch off}} the entire device (router/switch) including fixed overheads (like fans, linecards, transceivers, etc.) only when all ports on the device are idle. This means even if only one port has data to transfer, the device (including <b>idle</b> <b>ports)</b> should be kept alive all the time. Comparatively, in our energy-aware heuristic schemes we apply the component-level strategy, which intends to power down the unused ports, and switch off the linecard if all the ports on this linecard are idle or disabled. If all linecards on a device are idle then to power off the entire device. Clearly, the component-level strategy achieves the most power savings.|$|R

40|$|A novel RF {{interconnect}} configuration for highdensity broad-band mixed-signal silicon monolithic microwave {{integrated circuits}} (MMIC's) is presented. The proposed silicon [...] metal [...] polyimide (SIMPOL) structure {{is based on}} multilayer polyimide technology with self-packaging features, and is extremely effective in reducing the noise crosstalk as well as overall size of MMIC chips. Moreover, since the SIMPOL interconnect can be built on low-cost silicon substrate using standard CMOS processing techniques, it is very cost-effective and applicable to current products without major cost addition. Measured results of a prototype test wafer demonstrate that the SIMPOL interconnect has reasonably low insertion loss (0. 62 dB/mm at 30 GHz), which agrees well with theoretical prediction (0. 5 dB/mm). The line loss can be reduced significantly (! 0. 1 dB/mm) by a using thicker dielectric layer. The measured crosstalk {{is at the same}} level as the background noise floor up to 30 GHz (! 060 dB), and limited primarily by imperfect termination of <b>idling</b> <b>ports</b> in the test structure. Full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulations indicate that SIMPOL could achieve an extremely high level of signal isolation, above 100 dB, at frequencies up to 50 GHz or beyond...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{results of}} the development and measurements of a heterodyne sideband separating SIS mixer for 85 - 115 GHz band. The sideband separation is achieved by using a quadrature scheme where a local oscillator (LO) pumps two identical mixer junctions with 90 0 phase difference.

40|$|Multistage switch {{interconnects}} like banyan switches are preferred in {{high speed}} networks for their cascadable structure and suitability for VLSI implementation. However {{most of these}} switch implementations are monolithic in nature and do not provide flexibility of dynamic re-routing of cells from active <b>ports</b> through <b>idle</b> <b>ports.</b> In this paper we take a critical look at a basic 8 × 8 benes switch {{from the perspective of}} identifying smaller blocks which can be pipelined in space and temporally multiplexed to exploit hardware reuse. A topological analysis of a 8 × 8 benes switch is carried out to identify mutually exclusive path sets that can be overlayed for hardware reuse. Based on this analysis we arrive at a basic building block called X-Structure, using which a 8 × 8 switch is constructed. The X-structure supports dynamic re-routing of cells and power down mode. A communication controller is designed using the the X-Structure based ATM switch at its core. A performance evaluation of the switch indicates a power saving of 66. 66 % due to hardware reuse, an 18. 6 % increase in hardware utilization and an aggregate throughput of 2. 66 Gbps for a 8 × 8 switch...|$|R

40|$|Dengue virus (DENV) is an {{extraordinary}} health burden on global scale, but still lacks effective vaccine. The Philippines is endemic for dengue fever, but massive employment of insecticides favored the development of resistance mutations in its major vector, Aedes aegypti. Alternative vector control strategies consist in releasing artificially modified mosquitos in the wild, but knowledge on their dispersal ability is necessary for a successful implementation. Despite being documented that Ae. aegypti can be passively transported for long distances, no study to date has been aimed at understanding whether human marine transportation can substantially shape the migration patterns of this mosquito. With thousands of islands connected by a dense network of ships, the Philippines is an ideal environment to fill this knowledge gap. Larvae of Ae. aegypti from 15 seaports in seven major islands of central-western Philippines were collected and genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. Low genetic structure and considerable gene flow {{was found in the}} area. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses suggested that anthropic factors (specifically the amount of processed cargo and human population density) can explain the observed population structure, while geographical distance was not correlated. Interestingly, cargo shipments seem to be more efficient than passenger ships in transporting Ae. aegypti. Bayesian clustering confirmed that Ae. aegypti from busy ports are more genetically similar, while populations from <b>idle</b> <b>ports</b> are relatively structured, regardless of the geographical distance that separates them.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation study of an input buffered Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch running the Request-Grant-Status (RGS) iterative scheduling algorithm. The RGS algorithm {{can reduce the}} effects of head-of-line blocking on the throughput and delay performance of an input buffered ATM switch. During a cell slot interval, the RGS algorithm performs a fixed number (n) of iterations. At each iteration step, the RGS algorithm determines a match between buffered cells and corresponding <b>idle</b> output <b>ports.</b> After the last iteration step, all matched cells are routed through the switch fabric. The simulation {{results show that the}} RGS algorithm can significantly improve the throughput and delay performance of an input buffered ATM switch under a high load. When independent and identical Bernoulli traffic sources are used, the input queues of a 16 x 16 ATM switch, using a strict first-in first-out queueing discipline, saturate at an offered load of approximately 60 %.

40|$|Instruction {{supply is}} a crucial {{component}} of processor performance. Instruction prefetching has been proposed as a mechanism to help reduce instruction cache misses, which in turn can help increase instruction supply to the processor. In this paper we examine a new instruction prefetch architecture called Fetch Directed Prefetching, and {{compare it to the}} performance of next-line prefetching and streaming buffers. This architecture uses a decoupled branch predictor and instruction cache, so the branch predictor can run ahead of the instruction cache fetch. In addition, we examine marking fetch blocks in the branch predictor that are kicked out of the instruction cache, so branch predicted fetch blocks can be accurately prefetched.

2500|$|The Irish began {{arriving}} in Miramichi in numbers after 1815 {{at the end}} of the Napoleonic War and with a few exceptions ceased coming to the area before the great Irish famine of 1847. They came to the area voluntarily to better their lives. Contrary to prevailing belief, not all of them were Catholic though very few Protestants among them identified openly as Irish and most of their descendants in Miramichi do not do so even to this day. Most arrived form the ports of Belfast and Cork each of which had strong commercial ties with Miramichi. Like the Scots they came on timber ships as individuals or in small family groups and the average age upon arrival was twenty-four. There was some chain emigration whereby additional family members joined the emigrant later but this was minimal. The Miramichi River valley was not settled by large transplantations of Scottish clans or large scale movements of starving and evicted Irish. Though there are one or two interesting exceptions. In 1815 after trade had developed with Newfoundland, Miramichi was surprised and shaken by the arrival of the so-called [...] "Two Boaters", perhaps as many as 2000. These were the Irish who had taken advantage of cheap fares to St.Johns in the spring and summer of 1815. They were mostly poor laborers and farmers and it seems that initially they settled mainly in the Chatham/Douglastown area. With no prospect of obtaining a land grant jobs in the woods or in the mills were the only means of getting established. Most of them were able to get at least temporary employment upon arrival, but it was short lived. In 1819 a sharp decline in timber prices resulted in massive layoffs in Miramichi including most of the [...] "Two Boat" [...] Irish of the Chatham area. Following their grueling experience in St. Johns and now unemployed they became disenchanted by their new found misery so many miles from home. They began to create disturbances in the village of Chatham. Violent outrages were committed in broad daylight, property was stolen and in the worst cases houses and barns were burned to the ground. The people of the area soon dubbed then [...] "those uncivilized immigrants from Ireland", whom local magistrates were powerless to control. But the Irish were not the only troublemakers along the river at that time. They were often mistakenly blamed for outrageous disturbances caused by unruly sailors <b>idling</b> about the <b>port</b> during the spring and summer months. These idle sailors whooped it up at Miramichi particularly on Sundays when the taverns were closed but often the Irish got the blame. In 1822 a detachment of the 78th regiment stationed in Fredericton was temporarily sent to Chatham to keep the peace. But it was not the soldiers of 78th regiment who quieted the Irish. It took an improved economy, jobs and new found opportunity to do the trick.|$|R
