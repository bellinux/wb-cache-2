25|$|On May 1, 2004, Yzerman {{was hit in}} the eye by a {{deflected}} slapshot by the Calgary Flames defenceman Rhett Warrener in {{a playoff}} game, breaking his orbital bone and scratching his cornea. Yzerman underwent eye surgery following the incident, and was sidelined {{for the rest of the}} 2004 post-season. The eye injury also forced Yzerman to miss the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. Fellow Canadians Joe Thornton (then of the Boston Bruins) and Joe Sakic (Colorado), who each wore the number 19 for their respective NHL clubs and who were now eligible to wear it for team Canada due to Yzerman's enforced absence, both refused the number out of respect for their injured countryman.

Unit downtime {{to prepare for a}} full unit turnaround can take longer for HF units, since the reactor-settler system and all the fractionators must be neutralized before maintenance work can proceed. In H2SO4 units, only the reactor-settler system requires neutralization. In addition, extensive safety equipment (breathing apparatus, etc.) is required whenever maintenance is performed with a potential of HF release. Once work is completed, the maintenance worker must go through a neutralization chamber to cleanse the safety equipment.

2500|$|Chlorine is a {{relatively}} common gas in industry {{with a variety of}} uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a <b>face</b> <b>shield</b> and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form hypochlorous acid, which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure. Chlorine’s odor provides early warning signs of exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and broncospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level[...] Severe exposure may result in [...] changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in Pune, India, landed 20 individuals in the hospital. Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas {{has been used as a}} weapon of warfare since World War I, most recently in 2007 in Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the isolation ward, Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a <b>face</b> <b>shield</b> to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E
