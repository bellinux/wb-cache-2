5|$|Duke is {{the tenth}} studio album by English rock band Genesis, {{released}} in March 1980 on Charisma Records. The album followed {{a period of}} inactivity for the band in early 1979. Phil Collins moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{in an effort to}} salvage his failing first marriage, while Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford recorded solo albums. Collins returned to the UK after his marriage ended and wrote a significant amount of material, some of which was used for Duke and some was later reworked for his first solo album, Face Value. Duke contained a mix of individually-written songs and tracks that evolved from jam sessions in mid-1979, while recording took place {{at the end of the}} year. The break in activity rejuvenated the band, and they found the album an <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> to work on.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began their}} 2007football season with emotion and remembrance. As Virginia Tech {{recovered}} from the worst school shooting in American history, football served {{as a way to}} help the university community emotionally heal. The opening game of the season, on September 1, 2007, was against East Carolina University and featured numerous remembrance ceremonies and commemorations. Buoyed by the emotion of the day, the Hokies earned a 177 victory. Their next game would not be as <b>easy.</b> <b>One</b> week later, Virginia Tech traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to face the No.2 Louisiana State University Tigers. The Tigers were widely regarded in pre-season polls as favorites to play in the National Championship Game and overwhelmed the Hokies in front of a home crowd, 487.|$|E
5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E
50|$|Points for the {{mountains}} classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. There were {{two types of}} mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the <b>easier</b> <b>ones,</b> in category 2, gave 5 points to the first cyclist, and the <b>easiest</b> <b>ones,</b> in category 3, gave 3 points.|$|R

50|$|Points for the {{mountains}} classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first. The system {{was almost the}} same as in 1950: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the <b>easier</b> <b>ones,</b> in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the <b>easiest</b> <b>ones,</b> in category 3, gave 3 points. Raphaël Géminiani won this classification.|$|R
25|$|Cavour {{formed a}} {{coalition}} with Urbano Rattazzi {{known as the}} Connubio ("union"), uniting the moderate men of the Right and of the Left, and brought about {{the fall of the}} d'Azeglio cabinet in November 1852. The King reluctantly accepted Cavour as prime minister, the most conservative possible choice, but their relationship was never an <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to playing football in high school, Crabtree {{was also on}} the basketball team and ranked among the top 51 recruits {{in the state of}} Texas going into college. During a visit in 2004, Texas Tech basketball coach Bob Knight asked Crabtree which sport he was going to choose. Though the decision was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> he opted to play college football exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Techniques for {{resisting}} emotional blackmail, including strengthening personal boundaries, resisting demands, {{developing a}} power statement—the determination to stand the pressure—and buying time to break old patterns: she accepted nonetheless that re-connecting with the autonomous {{parts of the}} self the blackmailer had over-ruled was not necessarily <b>easy.</b> <b>One</b> may for instance feel guilty even while recognizing the guilt as induced and irrational; but {{still be able to}} resist overcompensating, and ignore the blackmailer's attempt to gain attention by way of a tantrum.|$|E

25|$|Thanks to this tactic, the Ulivo {{coalition}} won {{the elections}} and Prodi became prime minister. Bertinotti's {{relationship with the}} centre-left leader was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> and in 1998, when Prodi proposed a new budget, incorporating {{a vote of confidence}} in his government, Bertinotti and the Rifondazione voted against it, causing the fall of the government. Cossutta's faction refused to vote against the government and left the party. They subsequently established a new party, the Party of Italian Communists (Partito dei Comunisti Italiani, PdCI).|$|E
25|$|Travelling {{south in}} the summer, she met Charles at Kineton, near Edgehill, before {{travelling}} on to the royal capital in Oxford. The journey through the contested Midlands was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> and Prince Rupert was sent to Stratford-upon-Avon to escort her. Despite the difficulties of the journey, Henrietta Maria greatly enjoyed herself, eating {{in the open air}} with her soldiers and meeting friends along the way. She arrived in Oxford bringing fresh supplies to great acclaim; poems were written in her honour, and Jermyn, her chamberlain, was given a peerage by the King at her request.|$|E
25|$|In June 1915, the British {{government}} appointed Wessels {{administrator of}} the Orange Free State, seeing in him a loyal ally. The job was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> and asked all of Wessels' diplomatic skills. As a British appointee {{and a member of}} the South African Party he initially ran into considerable opposition and enmity from both the Executive Committee and the Provincial Council, of which most of the members supported the National Party. Nevertheless, Wessels succeeded in making his administration a success, and in 1919 the Union government proposed him for a knighthood, which he received in the 1920 New Year Honours.|$|E

25|$|Points for the {{mountains}} classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first.

Louison Bobet won this classification after having led the classification almost the entire race, although he only reached 2 of the 14 mountain tops first.|$|R

25|$|After {{the siege}} of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander {{entrusted}} his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland. Hephaestion's task was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> for {{this was not the}} Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Papa Roach {{released}} {{their first}} EP titled Potatoes for Christmas. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending {{the year in}} Seattle studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled Caca Bonita. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bass guitarist Will James, who had become heavily involved in a church summer camp, with Tobin Esperance, because James' absence would limit the band's summer practicing and touring. As Esperance {{had been with the}} band as a roadie for a while, the transition was an <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, and with war looming, the Canadian chief of Naval Staff had {{designated}} the three 'Prince' ships as candidates for conversion to armed merchant cruisers, {{for the task}} of convoy escort. During the protracted negotiations for the CN ships, all three vessels had been inspected by the Naval Service and specifications drawn up. It was recognized that the task of converting the fast liners {{would not be an}} <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b> Their hulls and engines were basically sound. Prince Robert, which had had no accidents and had been well maintained, was to present no problems. Her sister ships, on the other hand, were a different story: both were in need of major repairs.|$|E

25|$|Wilt Chamberlain {{played his}} varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> {{for the first}} two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, {{breaking}} both all-time college records in an 87–69 win against Northwestern. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against North Carolina, coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54–53 in triple overtime. The game {{is considered one of the}} greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E
25|$|In 1759, Gainsborough and {{his family}} moved to Bath, living at number 17 The Circus. There, he studied portraits by van Dyck and was {{eventually}} able to attract a fashionable clientele. In 1761, he began to send work to the Society of Arts exhibition in London (now the Royal Society of Arts, of which {{he was one of the}} earliest members); and from 1769 he submitted works to the Royal Academy's annual exhibitions. He selected portraits of well-known or notorious clients in order to attract attention. The exhibitions helped him acquire a national reputation, and he was invited to become a founding member of the Royal Academy in 1769. His relationship with the academy was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> and he stopped exhibiting his paintings in 1773.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1918 Mannock {{was sent}} to England on leave. He {{travelled}} to Birmingham to visit his mother. The visit was not an <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> as she had become an alcoholic. On this visit family friends reported on his state of mind. Mannock broke down on one occasion and seemed full of nervous tension. This was possibly due to combat fatigue. Commander Caldwell noted Mannock never took time off unless it was officially scheduled leave and he never reported sick, but saw not signs that Mannock was about to crack-up. Mannock also did not want a command and preferred to remain on operations with 74 Squadron. As a senior flight commander Mannock never showed weakness {{in front of his}} men.|$|E

He said that villain characters and ones with distinct personalities were <b>easier</b> than <b>ones</b> with not much personality {{as they can be}} shaped and changed up. He later reprised his role as Alucard in the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs.|$|R

25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b> Wellington's superiors were equally surprised {{to hear about the}} defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|E
25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E
25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b> But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, {{it would seem that the}} Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E
