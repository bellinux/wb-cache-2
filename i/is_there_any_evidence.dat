5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|While the {{original}} Eastern liturgies {{begin with a}} confession of sin made by the celebrant alone, the earliest records of the Roman Rite all describe the Mass as beginning at the Introit, but the celebrant may have used a Confiteor-like confession of sinfulness {{as one of the}} private prayers he said in the sacristy before he began Mass.

25|$|In one method, the {{practitioner}} places crystals on {{different parts of}} the body, often corresponding to chakras; or else {{the practitioner}} places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an energy grid, which is purported to surround the client with healing energy. Despite this, scientific investigations have not validated claims that chakras or energy grids actually exist, nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo; for these reasons it is considered a pseudoscience.|$|E

The investigators narrowed the cause down to the firing of some combustible substance, either accidentally by a passenger or crew member or through vibration or some other natural occurrence, or deliberately by bombing.|$|R
25|$|As for {{the canal}} company's claims, the {{majority}} held that since {{none of the}} private landowners held riparian rights, the company could not obtain such rights from the private landowners. Nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> that Congress <b>was</b> relinquishing its rights to Water Street or the river. The court dismissed {{the claims of the}} last landowners, whose property lay between Water Street and the shore, as being improperly based on unofficial land records and for being based on maps and other documents which did not accurately reflect the physical land.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{not known}} to what {{statement}} by Braham Lamb refers in this passage; no document or publication has been identified in which Braham writes of his religion. Nor, as Lamb hints, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> of Braham's actual conversion. However the passage is undoubtedly associated with Braham's marriage to (the Gentile) Miss Bolton of Manchester in 1816. This followed a traumatic period for Braham in which his personal affairs were often before the public. Having fallen out with, and abandoned, Nancy Storace, he had travelled to France in 1815 with a Mrs. Wright, whose husband sued him for criminal conversation (and eventually was awarded £1000). While the suit was pending, Braham had the unusual experience of being hissed during a performance of Handel's Israel in Egypt (the very piece cited by Lamb in his 1821 essay), on which he stepped forward and addressed the audience: ...|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the nineteenth}} century, {{it was common}} for heraldic writers to cite {{examples}} such as these, and metaphorical symbols such as the [...] "Lion of Judah" [...] or [...] "Eagle of the Caesars" [...] {{as evidence of the}} antiquity of heraldry itself; and to infer therefrom that the great figures of ancient history bore arms representing their noble status and descent. [...] The Book of Saint Albans, compiled in 1486, declares that Christ himself was a gentleman of coat armour. [...] But these fabulous claims have long since been dismissed as the fantasy of medieval heralds, for {{there is no evidence of}} a distinctive symbolic language akin to that of heraldry during this early period; nor do many of the shields described in antiquity bear a close resemblance to those of medieval heraldry; nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> that specific symbols or designs were passed down from one generation to the next, representing a particular person or line of descent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} mixing and {{assimilation}} of immigrant and native populations {{is virtually impossible}} to elucidate with material culture, but the skeletal evidence may shed some light on it. The 7th/8th-century average stature of male individuals in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries dropped by 15mm (⅝ in) compared with the 5th/6th-century average. This development is most marked in Wessex where the average dropped by 24mm (1in). This drop is not easily explained by environmental changes; there is no evidence for a change in diet in the 7th/8th centuries, nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> of a further influx of immigrants at this time. Given the lower average stature of Britons, the most likely explanation would be a gradual Saxonisation or Anglicisation of the material culture of native enclaves, an increasing assimilation of native [...] populations into Anglo-Saxon communities, and increasing intermarriage between immigrants and natives within Anglo-Saxon populations. Skeletal material from the Late Roman and Early Anglo-Saxon period from Hampshire was directly compared. It was concluded that the physical type represented in urban Roman burials, was not annihilated nor did it die-out, but it continued to be well represented in subsequent burials of Anglo-Saxon date.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of serum IgM and IgG antibodies against IgA is common among individuals with IgA deficiency. The route of immunization is still unknown, {{but it is}} possible that immunization occurs through the gut. We analysed anti-IgA antibody production in gastrointestinal lavage, saliva and breast milk from patients with IgA deficiency. In no case <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> of local production of anti-IgA antibodies. Immunization may thus be due to exposure to endogenous IgA and therefore represent a 'true' autoimmune phenomenon which may possibly be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|R

60|$|In his {{official}} report General Buller states that {{were it not}} for the action of Colonel Long and the subsequent disaster to the artillery he thought that the battle might have been a successful one. This is a hard saying, and throws perhaps too much responsibility upon the gallant but unfortunate gunner. There have been occasions in the war when greater dash upon the part of our artillery might have changed the fate of the day, and it is bad policy to be too severe upon the man who has taken a risk and failed. The whole operation, with its advance over the open against a concealed enemy with a river in his front, was so absolutely desperate that Long may have seen that only desperate measures could save the situation. To bring guns into action in front of the infantry without having clearly defined the position of the opposing infantry must always remain one of the most hazardous ventures of war. 'It would certainly be mere folly,' says Prince Kraft, 'to advance artillery to within 600 or 800 yards of a position held by infantry unless the latter were under the fire of infantry from an even shorter range.' This 'mere folly' is exactly what Colonel Long did, but it must be remembered in extenuation that he shared with others the idea that the Boers were up on the hills, and had no inkling that their front trenches were down at the river. With the imperfect means at his disposal he did such scouting as he could, and if his fiery and impetuous spirit led him into a position which cost him so dearly it is certainly more easy for the critic to extenuate his fault than that subsequent one which allowed the abandoned guns to fall into the hands of the enemy. Nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> that the loss of these guns did seriously affect the fate of the action, for at those other parts of the field where the infantry had the full and unceasing support of the artillery the result was not more favourable than at the centre.|$|E

Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup.
