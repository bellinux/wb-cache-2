After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
25|$|The third {{method is}} the {{inversion}} method, which works best when the DV is flipped {{over to the}} right side of the cylinder. The diver simply rolls forward into a head down position with the body near vertical, and relies on gravity to bring the DV <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> it can be reached.|$|E
25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Tech's Logan Thomas fumbled on {{the first}} play from {{scrimmage}} when he was sacked by Sylvester Williams. This set up UNC with a 3 play, 20 yard drive that concluded with a Giovani Bernard 4 yard touchdown. After preventing Virginia Tech from converting a 4th down on the UNC 26 yard line, the Heels drove {{the length of the}} field to the 5 yard line where Ryan Houston fumbled the ball and it was recovered by the Hokies. The last time that UNC and Virginia Tech played on Thursday night was in 2009 when Virginia Tech fumbled the ball on a drive in the fourth quarter that eventually lead to a UNC victory. After coming 5 yards from taking a 14-0 lead, UNC found itself giving up 24 unanswered points to the Hokies by the fourth quarter. However, with 7:06 left in the game, Bryn Renner completed a pass to Erik Highsmith to reduce the lead to 10 points. After forcing the Hokies to punt on their next possession, Renner completed a 25 yard pass to Dwight Jones, then a 64 yard pass to Erik Highsmith to the 2 yard line where Houston punched the ball into the endzone to cut the lead to 3 with 2:32 left in the game. The Heels recovered the onside kick on the subsequent kick-off, but upon further review, it was judged that the ball did not travel the required 10 yards on the kickoff which gave the Hokies the ball. They were able to run the clock <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> only one play would be left for UNC, who was not able to convert it into a touchdown.|$|E

2500|$|The Multiverse {{system was}} {{discarded}} {{in the aftermath}} of Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series (1986) by rebooting all of DC's various stories and continuities into one timeline taking place on a single Earth (later described as New Earth). A more modern adaptation of the mainstream [...] "Earth-One" [...] Superman debuted in John Byrne's The Man of Steel miniseries in 1986. The post-Crisis Superman was the Superman from 1986 to 2011. Superman's backstory was heavily revised and many Silver Age elements, such as his career as Superboy, were removed. Significant changes included a reimagining of all Kryptonians being genetically bound to Krypton, making it fatal for them to leave the planet. Jor-El devises a serum to counter this, which he administers to baby Kal-El. DC used this plot device to make Superman Krypton's sole survivor until this was retconned in the mid 2000s to introduce the post-Crisis Kara Zor-El. Krypton was also reimagined as an emotionless and sterile society where all their babies were grown in a birthing matrix as Kryptonians found sexual reproduction to be barbaric. Clark never becomes Superboy, with his powers manifesting gradually as he matures in age. His power level is also toned <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> he is no longer able to travel through time with his super speed, can effortlessly withstand a nuclear explosion or strong enough to push planets out of orbit like his Silver-Age incarnation. Clark also spends some years traveling the globe trying to find himself after leaving Smallville and before settling in Metropolis. Other differences include Lex Luthor as a business mogul rather than a supergenius scientist; both of his parents alive and well in the present; only green kryptonite existing (until the mid 2000s) and Superman thinking of himself as Clark Kent first, with [...] "Superman" [...] being a persona he adopts to preserve his privacy. [...] Clark Kent eventually married Lois Lane, much like his Golden Age counterpart. Nuances in the characters mythos were later defined in various Superman origin stories, such as [...] Where Mark Waid retooled Superman's origin in 2003. The trend continued after Infinite Crisis; when Superman's backstory was retooled once again by Geoff Johns, with [...] in 2009.|$|E
