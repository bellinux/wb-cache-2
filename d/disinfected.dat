5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and <b>disinfected,</b> and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were <b>disinfected.</b> Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, the US Department of Treasury {{called for}} all {{drinking}} water to be <b>disinfected</b> with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as in water treatment plants), in disinfectants, and in bleach. As a disinfectant in water, chlorine {{is more than}} three times as effective against Escherichia coli as bromine, and more than six times as effective as iodine.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further <b>disinfected</b> by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E

5|$|A 3km {{protection}} zone, 10km {{surveillance zone}} and a restricted zone encompassing 2000km2 were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken. Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly <b>disinfected,</b> with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E
5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be <b>disinfected,</b> had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the breed}} {{are not usually}} ridden until they are four years old, and {{structural}} development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, {{reached the age of}} 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend to be friendly, docile and easy to handle, although also enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, disease in the breed within Iceland is mostly unknown, except for some kinds of internal parasites. The low prevalence of disease in Iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully <b>disinfected.</b> As a result, native horses have no acquired immunity to disease; an outbreak on the island would be likely to be devastating to the breed. This presents problems with showing native Icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country, as no livestock of any species can be imported into Iceland, and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return.|$|E

40|$|Acanthamoeba cysts {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions. Acanthamoeba cyst wall is partially made of 1, 4 β-glucan (i. e., cellulose) and other complex polysaccharides {{making it a}} hardy shell that protects the resident amoeba. Here, we hypothesize that targeting the cyst wall structure in addition to antiamoebic compound would improve the efficacy of marketed contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions. Using chlorhexidine as an antiamoebic compound and cellulase enzyme to disrupt cyst wall structure, the findings revealed that combination of both agents abolished viability of Acanthamoeba castellanii cysts and trophozoites. When tested alone, none of the agents nor contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions completely destroyed A. castellanii cysts and trophozoites. The absence of cyst wall-degrading enzymes in marketed contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions render them ineffective against Acanthamoeba cysts. It is concluded that the addition of cyst wall degrading molecules in contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions will enhance their efficacy in decreasing the incidence of Acanthamoeba effectively...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{multipurpose}} {{solutions for}} cleaning and <b>disinfecting</b> rigid gas permeable lenses has replaced single purpose solutions, {{but there are}} no reports of the efficacy of these multipurpose solutions, or of the effects of storage conditions on their <b>disinfecting</b> capacities. This study investigated activity against four bacterial and two fungal species, and the effects of storage in a refrigerator, at room temperature, at elevated temperature in both dry and humid conditions and with exposure to sunlight. The <b>disinfecting</b> solutions were challenged with the micro-organisms initially upon opening and then at 2 -weekly intervals up to 12 weeks after being stored under the different conditions. Solutions were opened daily to simulate use. One solution failed to meet Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria to reduce numbers of bacteria by three log dilutions and of fungi by one log dilution. Storage reduced activity of all solutions over the 12 -week period, but not below the requirements of the FDA. Storage in the refrigerator tended to reduce <b>disinfecting</b> capacity more quickly. Multipurpose solutions for rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses lose activity over the 3 months recommended time of use but remain satisfactory for use over this time in the conditions tested. Practitioners need to remind patients to replace their solutions regularly and should advise against storage in the refrigerator. Multipurpose solutions for RGP lenses have simplified cleaning and <b>disinfecting</b> processes and the current formulations have improved <b>disinfecting</b> capacity compared to former <b>disinfecting</b> solutions, which is particularly important for wearers of orthokeratology lenses.
