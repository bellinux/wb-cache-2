500|$|One {{formality}} left were New York's late-in-the-season primary {{elections on}} September 12, {{which in this}} case merely served to ratify the state party conventions' choices. [...] Lazio won unopposed, while Clinton won 82percent of the vote in easily defeating unknown Manhattan doctor Mark McMahon, who ran on the grounds that [...] "the Clintons have tried to hijack the Democratic Party." [...] For her part, Clinton said that she was [...] "surprised, in a way [...] <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> for a minute, staring at my name." [...] In any case, the general election was already well underway.|$|E
500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Springsteen and Pete Seeger, accompanied by Seeger's grandson, Tao Rodríguez-Seeger, at [...] on January 18, 2009. [...] The song was restored to the original lyrics (including the 'There was a big high wall there' and 'Nobody living can ever stop me' verses) for this performance (as per Pete Seeger's request) {{with the exception of}} a change in the end of the 'Relief Office' verse to [...] "As they stood hungry, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> whistling, This land was made for you and me." [...] The original lyrics are [...] "As they stood there hungry, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> asking, Is this land made for you and me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, when Jane Fonda asked her father how he {{prepared}} {{before going on}} stage, she was baffled by his answer, [...] "I don't know, <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> think about my wife, Afdera, I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Elijah the Tishbite; who {{was of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Gilead, said unto Ahab, [...] "As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom <b>I</b> <b>stand,</b> <b>there</b> shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word." ...|$|R
60|$|I laughed; I couldn't 'elp it. <b>I</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{and laughed}} at 'im.|$|R
2500|$|Actor Fenella Fielding, {{who worked}} with him on Follow a Star, commented “Not a very {{pleasant}} man. Always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning. Not exactly a lovely way to start a day’s filming.” while Lynda Bellingham said with reference to A Little Bit of Wisdom [...] "I did a comedy series where Norman Wisdom, bless his little cotton socks, said, [...] "We're going to do this scene now where I drop a pencil down the front of your dress and I look for it." [...] "Oh, I see, is that funny?" [...] "Oh, it'll be hysterical." [...] So for ten minutes <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> while he basically touched me up and you couldn't say anything because he was the master of comedy." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{helpless}} terror <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> forgetting weapon, fearing {{only the}} beast would fall over on me.|$|E
60|$|And as <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in the {{darkness}} I could almost fancy that I heard it crack.|$|E
60|$|I laughed; I couldn’t ’elp it. <b>I</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{and laughed}} at ’im.|$|R
5000|$|It was the {{beginning}} of the end, but when afterwards his wife gently chided him for his rashness, he said, [...] "Could <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and see a man drown?" [...] and in his last hours he told her he did not regret that he had done his duty to the end. Isn't that splendid? Isn't that true heroism? Isn't that complete self-sacrifice? ...|$|R
60|$|You {{have no idea}} of the {{difficulty}} of getting in the end of Sikes. As to the man with the invaluable composition! my dear fellow, believe me, no audience on earth could be held for ten minutes after the girl's death. Give them time, and they would be revengeful for having had such a strain put upon them. Trust me to be right. <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there,</b> and <b>I</b> know.|$|R
60|$|For a time <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> too {{overwhelmed}} by this new development {{to think of}} the people.|$|E
60|$|What had {{happened}} to Cavor? All through that tolling <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> stupidly, and at last the tolling ceased.|$|E
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. Every symptom of fatal relapse. I {{could not imagine}} what card Hilda held in reserve. But <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{still got}} the hunch." [...] Kearns fingered his cards a long time. [...] "And I'll play it, but you've got to know how <b>I</b> <b>stand.</b> <b>There's</b> my steamer, the Bella--worth twenty {{thousand}} if she's worth an ounce. There's Sixty Mile with five thousand in stock on the shelves. And you know I got a sawmill coming in. It's at Linderman now, and the scow is building. Am I good?" ...|$|R
60|$|He cowered {{before my}} furious wrath; for I {{must have seemed}} terrific as <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> thundering <b>there,</b> my face wild, my eyes bloodshot, half mad from pain and rage and sleeplessness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, but I am {{positive}}, or {{as positive}} {{as one can}} be, in the circumstances. However, {{that is not what}} <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> on. <b>There</b> was a witness who saw the marquis go.' ...|$|R
60|$|Going to {{the corner}} cupboard, in which Mrs Willis kept her little store of food and physic, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> pondering what I should do.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{watching}} with Dian at my side. Then, to my utter amazement, I saw Juag {{rise to the}} surface and swim strongly toward the boat.|$|E
6000|$|I {{crossed the}} room, and, drawing the blind aside carefully, looked out. The street {{was packed with}} people! Even as <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> I heard the crash of {{breaking}} glass below! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] Heliodore went on, [...] "not {{knowing what}} to do, <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> still <b>there</b> against the rockwork and the flowers till presently, round the bushes, {{appeared}} the splendid lady and Martina." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{gazed at}} her with unwearying eyes. Her bosom rose and fell {{as if she had}} been running, and she said in her heart: [...] "I can do that! <b>I</b> could <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and do that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He nipped off {{and tumbled}} aboard the ship afore I could say a word. <b>I</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> staring arter 'im and feeling the money, and afore I {{could make up}} my mind Mrs. Plimmer came up.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{mother who}} flung the shutter into place softly and {{replaced}} the bars, and <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> like a stupid until {{the house was}} barricaded once more, when I said stupidly: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{staring at}} those {{beautiful}} blind {{eyes and the}} blind eyes stared back at me. Presently a look of understanding gathered on the face and Quilla spoke, or rather murmured to herself.|$|E
6000|$|And that calm eve {{when you}} walked up the stair, After a gaiety {{prolonged}} and rare, [...] No thought soever [...] That you might never Walk down again, struck me as <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
60|$|Down he went. Before ever {{he could}} {{scramble}} up again I was {{on him and}} had buried my knife in his heart. Then <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> up--and <b>there</b> was Dian facing me and peering at me through the dense gloom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and {{let them}} see me looking at them as if I couldn't bear them {{out of my sight}} for a moment," [...] said Kate, whisking herself out of the room. [...] "They're {{conceited}} enough, Heaven knows, already." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{got tired}} of it at last {{and came back to}} where <b>I</b> was and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> shaking their 'eads at me.|$|R
60|$|I didn't answer him. I {{might have}} told 'im that there's about five million Bills in England, but I didn't. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{with my arms}} folded acrost my chest, and looked at him, superior.|$|E
6000|$|I don't know why, but I couldn't utter it. It was {{but to say}} [...] "I love you," [...] yet I hadn't the courage. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> like a fool, {{looking at}} her irresolutely, and then-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took a step}} forward, {{but before}} I could gain the threshold, the door was slammed in my face, and as <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> quivering with anger and disappointment, I heard the bolts being shot within.|$|E
6000|$|... "For, in sooth," [...] said he to Gascoyne, {{as the two}} {{talked the}} matter over, [...] "she hath, in a certain way, {{accepted}} me for her knight, and yet <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> me <b>there</b> without saying so much as one single word in her behalf." ...|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> waiting, <b>there</b> broke upon my ears {{the sound}} of an {{approaching}} cavalcade: the noise of voices and the soft fall of hoofs upon the thick snow carpet. The company halted at the door, and a loud, gruff voice was raised to cry: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{began to}} nose about. He pulled out drawer after drawer, pottering around {{like an old}} bloodhound, and {{babbling}} {{from time to time}} about Berkeley and his cigarette-case in a way that struck me as perfectly ghastly. <b>I</b> just <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> losing weight every moment.|$|R
