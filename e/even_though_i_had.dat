500|$|American street artist Fairey guest {{starred in}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] as himself. The {{graffiti}} art featuring Homer's {{face and the}} word [...] "dope" [...] that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey's Barack Obama [...] "Hope" [...] poster and his OBEY Giant image. Fairey has said that The Simpsons {{has been one of}} his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its [...] "blend of humor and social commentary", and he felt [...] "deeply honored" [...] to be included in an episode. Fairey wrote on his website that [...] "Part of being on The Simpsons, is you’re being honored as a reference point in culture." [...] He described the plot of the episode as [...] "great", adding that the staff members of the show [...] "were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (<b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make fun of myself to do so)." [...] This was Fairey's first acting performance. Street artists English, Scharf, and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves.|$|E
500|$|Slash's Snakepit's {{music was}} often {{described}} as hard rock and blues rock with elements of southern rock. The band were also {{often described as}} Slash's solo or side project though Slash maintained {{that they were a}} band, stating [...] "everybody wrote, everybody had equal input <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my name on it." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer J.D. Considine noted the differences between Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit on their first album, stating that [...] "Guns ' Roses typically treat the melody as {{the most important part of}} the song, most of what slithers out of the Snakepit emphasizes the playing." [...] He noted that singer Eric Dover [...] "conveys the raw-throated intensity of a hard-rock frontman" [...] and [...] "he avoids the genre's most obvious excesses." [...] The riff to [...] "Good to Be Alive" [...] drew a comparison to Chuck Berry while the musicianship on the album was praised. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that [...] "there's little argument that Slash is a great guitarist" [...] who is [...] "capable of making rock and blues clichés sound fresh". Reviewing Ain't Life Grand for Allmusic, Steve Huey described second singer Rod Jackson as [...] "a combination of '80s pop-metal bluster and Faces-era Rod Stewart" [...] with a [...] "touch of Aerosmith", a description that he felt also fitted the band as a whole. He noted, though, that Slash's guitar playing was [...] "tame" [...] and stated that the main problem of the album was the songwriting, though it was [...] "still a passable, workmanlike record that will definitely appeal to fans of grimy, old-school hard rock." [...] Malcolm Dome of Classic Rock stated that [...] "from the moment that [...] "Been There Lately" [...] opens, there's a vibe here that was missing before" [...] and that Ain't Life Grand showed [...] "purpose, direction and individuality." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world. But crucially, her love of 'the world above' is established long before she sets eyes on the prince" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Laura Stampler, writing for Time, agreed that the character [...] " [...] in love with the human world before she even knew who Eric was" [...] because [...] "she has always dreamed of being a 'part of your world'". Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (<b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E
2500|$|Collins later {{admitted}} having suffered from bulimia after she quit {{smoking in the}} 1970s. [...] "I went straight from the cigarettes into an eating disorder", she told People magazine in 1992. [...] "I started throwing up. I didn't know anything about bulimia, certainly not {{that it is an}} addiction or that it would get worse. My feelings about myself, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been able to give up smoking and lose 20 lbs., were of increasing despair." [...] She has written at length of her years of addiction to alcohol, the damage it did to her personal and musical life and how it contributed to her feelings of depression. Collins admits that although she tried other drugs in the 1960s, alcohol had always been her drug of first choice, just as it had been for her father. She entered a rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania in 1978 and has maintained her sobriety ever since, even through such traumatic events as the death of her only child, Clark, who committed suicide in 1992 at age 33 after a long bout with clinical depression and substance abuse. Since his death, she has also become an activist for suicide prevention.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{ending to}} the Cain novella {{called for the}} characters to commit double suicide. Suicide, however, was strictly forbidden at the time by the Hays Production Code {{as a way to}} resolve a plot, so Wilder wrote and filmed a different ending in which Neff goes to the gas chamber while Keyes watches. This scene was shot before the scenes that eventually became the film's familiar ending, and once that final intimate exchange between Neff and Keyes revealed its power to Wilder, he began to wonder if the gas chamber ending was needed at all. [...] "You couldn't have a more meaningful scene between two men", Wilder said. As he would later recount, [...] "The story was between the two guys. I knew it, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already filmed the gas chamber scene... So we just took out the scene in the gas chamber," [...] despite its $150,000 cost to the studio. Removal of the scene, over Chandler's objection, also removed the Hays Office's single biggest remaining objection to the picture, since they regarded it as [...] "unduly gruesome" [...] and predicted that it would never be approved by local and regional censor boards. The footage and sound elements are lost, but production stills of the scene still exist.|$|E

40|$|I faced {{a dilemma}} when invited to {{participate}} in this seminar. What contribution could I make? What insights could I offer? There were several dangers I wanted to avoid. One was to preach to the converted. We are all strong believers {{in the value of the}} arts, humanities, and social science disciplines. There does not seem to be much point in trotting out long-winded justifications. Similarly I wanted to avoid addressing broad issues on which I am insufficiently informed.

I am not an educationalist, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been teaching in tertiary institutions on three continents for thirty-five years. Who then am I and what can I say of relevance to a seminar of this kind? The best way for me to answer these questions is I think to tell my story. If nothing else my testimony can offer yet another perspective on the plight of arts and humanities in Australian universities...|$|R

Unformed suspicions to a similar effect had sometimes passed through my mind in my earlier school-days, and had always caused me great distress; for they were worldly in their nature, and wide, very wide, of the spirit that had drawn me from Sylvia. They were sordid suspicions, without a shadow of proof. They were worthy to have originated in the unwholesome cellar. They were not only without proof, but against proof; for was I not myself a living proof of what Brother Hawkyard had done? and without him, how should I ever have seen the sky look sorrowfully down upon that wretched boy at Hoghton Towers? ...|$|E
