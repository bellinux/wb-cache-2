500|$|Jane Krakowski, {{who plays}} Jenna Maroney, {{revealed}} to Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello her character's plot in which Jenna becomes a television producer {{as part of}} her contract as TGS begins its fifth season. [...] " [...] has all these wacky things built into her contract , because nobody thought we'd still be on the air. So <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a producer." [...] Series producer Paula Pell reprised her role as Paula Hornberger, the wife of Scott Adsit's character Pete Hornberger. The episode references the ongoing storyline of Liz's desire to become a mother when she tells Carol that she is on a waiting list to adopt a child. This story first began in the show's first season, and continued in the third season.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Sci Fi Wire, Sanderson stated {{it was a great}} honor to be given the chance to complete the series but conceded he was unable to fill Jordan's shoes. Some parts of the book were nearly finished by Jordan, while others have only a couple of paragraphs to describe a twenty-page scene, but he describes Jordan's notes as [...] "amazing." [...] He later elaborated that [...] "the amount of material [...] left behind is what makes this book possible." [...] Speaking to The Guardian, he stated that although some people wouldn't like the book, and any failures would be blamed on him, [...] "I say that I win because <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of this." [...] Through February 2008 Sanderson reread the entire series, posting his impressions of each book on his blog. The reread lasted until March 2008, at which point he [...] "began to grasp the daunting nature of this book," [...] with so many plot lines that needed to be resolved.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of her {{appearances}} in Angel, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because {{there have been so many}} chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny [...] <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did. Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to [...] "selfish, superficial Los Angeles", which turned out to be her [...] "trial by fire".|$|E

2500|$|Cobra Commander {{appears in}} the movie [...] played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt wore a mask and {{prosthetic}} makeup underneath. Upon seeing concept art of the role he was being offered, Gordon-Levitt signed on because; [...] "I saw the designs and drawings {{of the way they}} interpreted my character for this movie - the costume, the whole getup - and I was like, 'Oh, wow. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that guy? Fantastic. Sign me up. Please. Thank you.'" [...] Gordon-Levitt described his vocal performance as being half reminiscent of Chris Latta's voice for the 1980s cartoon, but also half his own ideas, because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous. The hood was not used in the movie, due to concerns that it would resemble the hood used by the KKK.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give {{you the right to}} be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away? Do <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rude then?", and shuts the door in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E
2500|$|The actress later {{reflected}} on Grace's transformation. She told Ellie Hooper from Closer that Grace was a [...] "one dimensional" [...] character when she debuted. She observed a [...] "big old change" [...] and viewers could finally see her heart amongst the evil. She became friendlier {{as a result}} of mothering Curtis and writers ensured Grace had more comedy about her character. She dreams of a normal life even though it is not achievable for her given her past. She can be [...] "a little bit of a freak" [...] in her pursuit of the perfect family life, but ultimately Wall believed Grace would never get her [...] "happily ever after". Wall enjoyed the complexities of Grace, adding [...] "the best thing about her is that I still get to be the big evil baddie who’s not very nice, but at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funny and I get to have a love story." [...] Kirkwood later said that the newly family oriented Grace [...] "will be fighting for love and loyalty rather than bags of money." ...|$|E
