25|$|Despite this, {{the birds}} are not {{classified}} as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained {{to do so and}} the animal must {{be able to do this}} without human assistance: it must also be shown that {{the birds are}} able to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild with no experience, just on their own intelligence. But even when an animal is trained to do this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.|$|E
25|$|Aragorn {{also reveals}} himself to Sauron after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the {{extended}} version of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. It is unclear {{in the films}} whether Aragorn uses the palantír of Minas Anor or Orthanc to <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> book the revelation was the primary factor for Sauron's assault on Minas Tirith before he had fully readied his forces. This plot element is partially transferred to Pippin's use of the palantír in the films. Here, Aragorn is luring Sauron to the Battle of the Morannon, and Sauron responds by showing him {{a vision of a}} dying Arwen.|$|E

25|$|Steinbeck's {{characters}} are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish {{a sense of}} respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established {{as many of the}} ranch hands are victims of the Great Depression. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie {{is the only one who}} is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{concentrates}} on witchcraft to such degree that {{she goes to}} live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess. Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still {{will be able to}} control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere. After Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there, Morgan shows them to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they do not <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Vulgate La Mort le Roi Artu (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just Mort Artu), Morgan vanishes {{for a long time and}} stops troubling Arthur, who assumes her to be dead. One day, he wanders into Morgan's remote castle while on a hunting trip, and they instantly reconcile with each other. Morgan welcomes him warmly and the king is overjoyed of their reunion and allows her to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon to live there with other sorceresses. However, the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces Arthur about the truth to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Sir Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. The goddess Fortune, who appears to Arthur to foretell his death towards the end the Vulgate Cycle, is regarded by some as a double for Morgan. At the end of Mort Artu, Morgan is the first among the black-hooded ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest in Avalon.|$|E

The following year, she participated at the [...] "Girls' rights summit" [...] in London, where she called for more progress {{toward the end of}} female genital mutilation and child marriage. In March 2015, she spoke out against the Indian government's ban on India's Daughter, Leslee Udwin's documentary on the 2012 Delhi gang rape. During its premier at the United States, she said the film needs to reach the public as it is not a [...] "shame-India documentary". In a 2015 interview, she stated: [...] "This film in no way is propagating violence in order to solve the problem. In fact, what we're saying is let's <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most civilized possible way ever".|$|E

500|$|The jumping prowess of the indriids {{have been}} well {{documented}} and are popular among ecotourists visiting Madagascar. Using their long, powerful back legs, they catapult themselves {{into the air and}} land in an upright posture on a nearby tree, with both hands and feet tightly gripping the trunk. Indriids can leap up to 10m (33ft) rapidly from tree trunk to tree trunk, an ability referred to as [...] "ricochetal leaping". Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) manages to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spiny forests of southern Madagascar. It is unknown how it avoids impaling its palms on the thorn-covered trunks of large plants such as Alluaudia. When distances between trees are too great, sifakas will descend to the ground and cross distances more than 100m (330ft) by standing upright and hopping sideways with the arms held to the side and waving up and down from chest to head height, presumably for balance. This is sometimes described as a [...] "dance-hop".|$|E

The UCM (Unsupervised Color Correction Method), for example, <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following steps: It firstly reduces the color cast by equalizing the color values. Then it enhances contrast by stretching the red histogram towards the maximum and finally Saturation and Intensity components are optimized.|$|R

Bowles concluded that [...] "Nehru is acting in a wholly unreasonable manner and will probably continue to do so... definitely hopes the whole situation can be made to go away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before it}} became {{possible}} to simulate molecular dynamics with computers, some undertook {{the hard work of}} trying it with physical models such as macroscopic spheres. The idea was to arrange them to replicate the properties of a liquid. J.D. Bernal said, in 1962: [...] "... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches.

2500|$|... "The second {{key to this}} song's Enormous Chart Success," [...] Pallett continues, [...] "has to do {{with the}} {{weighting}} of the melody lines." [...] Perry begins singing each verse on the beat ("you think I'm pretty ...") but then falls off it {{before the end of the}} first line ("... makeup on"), syncopating the melody, creating additional tension. [...] "Her lines dovetail elegantly into each other. This contributes to the feeling of suspension that I mentioned above. As listeners, we're waiting for her to get to the point." [...] Pallett says she does indeed <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-chorus, when she accentuates the imperatives ("Let's go all the way tonight ...") by returning to the beat. Pallett than calls it [...] "genius" [...] that the chorus itself inverts the weighting of the verses, as the line [...] "You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream" [...] goes from off beat to on and then back again, in a single line.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the movie}} themes and mini-games were {{conceived}} by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel. Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene, which is the action we want, so try to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E
2500|$|Finland {{also has}} its share of hip-hop bands as during the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Finnish hip-hop scene has gained strength. Dating back from growing {{underground}} culture one of the first Finnish Hip Hop records with lyrics in English was recorded at Vernissa (C) Manus / (P) Johanna Kustannus 1991 by Damn The Band. Later Finland has Nuera with MC's Skem (Henry Kaprali) & Dream (Petri Laurila) from Tampere region. Nueras first release is dated to 1992. Same guys, together with DJ K2 were also behind a hip-hop based radio show on YleX. The first popular hip-hop band to break the taboo of making rap lyrics in Finnish (rapping in Finnish was not regarded as serious business because the first artists to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s such as Raptori, Nikke T and [...] Pääkköset were humorous project and were popular mostly among children) was Fintelligens arguably {{one of the most successful}} hip hop bands in Finland. [...] Let's not forget about Ceebrolistics, their first cassette single Sping was released in 1995 their lyrics has been both in Finnish and English.

2500|$|Hans Martensen was {{the subject}} of a Danish article, Dr. S. Kierkegaard against Dr. H. Martensen By Hans Peter Kofoed-Hansen (1813–1893) that was {{published}} in 1856 (untranslated) and Martensen mentioned him extensively in Christian Ethics, published in 1871. [...] "Kierkegaard's assertion is therefore perfectly justifiable, that with the category of [...] "the individual" [...] the cause of Christianity must stand and fall; that, without this category, Pantheism had conquered unconditionally. From this, at a glance, it may be seen that Kierkegaard ought to have made common cause with those philosophic and theological writers who specially desired to promote the principle of Personality as opposed to Pantheism. This is, however, far from the case. For those views which upheld the category of existence and personality, in opposition to this abstract idealism, did not <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense of an either—or, but in that of a both—and. They strove to establish the unity of existence and idea, which may be specially seen from the fact that they desired system and totality. Martensen accused Kierkegaard and Alexandre Vinet of not giving society its due. He said both of them put the individual above society, and in so doing, above the Church." [...] Another early critic was Magnús Eiríksson who criticized Martensen and wanted Kierkegaard as his ally in his fight against speculative theology.|$|E
