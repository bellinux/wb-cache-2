5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's kitchen <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> those seen by Potter in Lakeland and Sawrey, and {{presented}} no artistic difficulties. She had been sketching interiors for years.|$|E
5|$|Somerton's climate <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> {{the climate}} of {{south-west}} England which is usually cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more rain experienced in winter.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Labrador <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> that {{of similar}} areas of North America while {{the island of}} Newfoundland has {{considerably}} fewer mammals and no native amphibians.|$|E
25|$|The appearance: e.g., purpuric (<b>typical</b> <b>of</b> {{vasculitis}} and meningococcal disease), {{fine and}} like sandpaper (<b>typical</b> <b>of</b> scarlet fever); circular lesions {{with a central}} depression <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> psoriasis.|$|R
50|$|In the sonnet {{there are}} both neoclassical and romantic elements: {{references}} to the classical tradition (Aphrodite, Homer and Odysseus) <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> neoclassicism and {{the focus on the}} poet, the theme of graves and remains and the homesickness <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> romanticism.|$|R
50|$|Hwangseok-ri House has a layout that <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> commoners' houses {{found in}} this province. Only the L-shaped {{structure}} remains but, as <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> commoners' houses of the era, it most likely included a detached master's quarters {{to the front of}} the inner court.|$|R
5|$|The {{novel is}} {{regarded}} as a landmark in hard science fiction. As <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the genre, Dragon's Egg attempts to communicate unfamiliar ideas and imaginative scenes while giving adequate attention to the known scientific principles involved.|$|E
5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> India – the {{idealized}} India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world {{literature of}} the past and world {{literature of the}} future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.|$|E
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E

5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Built on former {{reservation}} {{lands of}} Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Indians, Lawton {{was founded on}} August 6, 1901, and was named after Major General Henry Ware Lawton, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient killed in action in the Philippine–American War. Lawton's landscape <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the Great Plains, with flat topography and gently rolling hills, while the area {{north of the city}} is marked by the Wichita Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings. September Morn <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> his style.|$|E

5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking. Poverty of thought {{is one of}} the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and might also be a feature of severe depression or dementia. A patient with dementia might also experience thought perseveration. Formal thought disorder is a common feature of schizophrenia. Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the north-west of Europe, {{although several}} of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds {{for a variety of}} seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.|$|E

5|$|The Country Wife is more neatly {{constructed}} {{than most}} Restoration comedies, but <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> its {{time and place}} in having three sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner's impotence trick, the married life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.|$|E

5|$|The eastern ends of English cathedrals show {{a greater}} {{diversity}} {{than those of}} any other country. Those built in the Norman era had high apsidal ends surrounded by a lower ambulatory, as <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> Northern France. This arrangement still exists at Norwich and in part at Peterborough and also, with variation, in the Early English Gothic east end at Canterbury, but in every other case has been modified.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Crucibulum, which {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the species of Basidiomycota that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Like other wood-decay fungi, this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases: the vegetative stage for the spread of mycelia, and the reproductive stage {{for the establishment of}} spore-producing structures, the fruiting bodies.|$|E
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the southwest of Scotland. There {{is a mixture of}} boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E
