40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern with air and odor {{emissions}} from agricultural facilities. A supplementary research project was conducted to complement the U. S. National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17 -month period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine finisher facility. Samples from a representative exhaust airstream at each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, guaiacol, phenol, 4 -methylphenol, 4 -ethylphenol, 2 -aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole, dimethyl disulfide, <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide,</b> dimethyl trisulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAV), defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor threshold for that compound. The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low: hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, butyric acid, isovaleric acid). The dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and in addition <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> was ranked second at one dairy site, while ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a good predictor of odor concentration (R 2 = 0. 16 to 0. 52), underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, isovaleric acid, ammonia, and <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> are the most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methyl phenol, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid are the most likely contributors to dairy odors...|$|E

The results of the research, the first Italian data-bank per variety on such volatiles, allow us to make a comparison with the data of other winegrowing areas, to investigate the aging effect on the considered volatiles, and, finally, to try a variety discrimination using statistical procedures. Dimethyl sulfide, 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol, diethyl sulfide, and <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> were found to increase with time whereas 2 -mercaptoethanol and ethylmercaptan showed a decreasing trend. Furthermore, the concentration of several compounds {{was found to be}} dependent on the variety. For instance, sulfide, disulfides, benzothiazole, and thioalcohols are at higher levels in Merlot wines, whereas thiols and thioacetates are more abundant in Marzemino and Teroldego wines. Chardonnay products, well apart from the other wines, are the poorest in 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol and rather rich in dimethyl disulfide and in <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide,</b> mostly in the aged wines. Applying the principal component analysis to the data, it was possible to demonstrate that Chardonnay and Merlot wines are well-discriminated from the Italian native varietal wines, which on their turn are only partially distinguishable among them.

40|$|Identification of {{the trace}} odorants causing the septic odors in source waters with complex matrixes {{has long been}} a big challenge. The Huangpu (HP) River, an {{important}} source water for Shanghai, has long been suffering from septic and musty odors, although major odorants have not been identified. In this study, combining the data from gas chromatography-olfactometry with mass spectrometry (GC-O/MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) using retention indices (RIs) was used for the identification of odorants in HP source water. Olfactometry peaks detected in water extracts by GC-O/MS were combined with the chromatography peaks detected by GC x GC-TOFMS based on the RIs determined using the retention times (RTs) of alkanes C 7 -C 30. A total of thirteen olfactometry peaks were obtained though GC-O/MS analysis, and potential odorants corresponding to each of the olfactometry peaks were screened based on the odor characteristics and match similarity using GC x GC-TOFMS. Finally, fourteen odorants (one odorant was detected in GC x GC-TOFMS without an olfactometry peak), including three septic odorants (bis(2 -chloroisopropyl) ether, <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> and dimethyl disulfide) and two musty ones (geosmin and 2 -MIB), were confirmed by using authentic standards. The septic and musty odorants in six source water samples taken over a period of six months were quantified. Bis(2 -chloroisopropyl) ether, with an odor activity value (OAV) of 1. 84 - 3. 2, was found to be a major septic odorant in HP source water, followed by <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> (OAV 1. 56 - 1. 96) and dimethyl disulfide (OAV 0. 37 - 2. 42), while geosmin (OAV 4. 37 - 11. 44) was the major musty odorant, followed by 2 -MIB (OAV 1. 13 - 1. 89). This is the first comprehensive study focusing on the identification of odorants in a complex source water. The integrated approach used in this study could be applied for the identification of odorants in other complex source waters suffering similar odor problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

The Huangpu and Huai rivers, as source waters in south China, have exhibited continuous swampy/septic odor over the entire year, yet the corresponding odor-causing compounds remain unclear. In order to screen the odor-causing compounds in these two rivers, a method to simultaneously determine fifty-four frequently encountered compounds with categories of thioethers, aldehydes, pyrazines, benzenes and phenols, has been developed using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) based on liquid-liquid extraction.

The use of ten degree increments {{for each of the}} parameters resulted in a continuous, fine-grained surface. This allowed us to accurately predict the relative stabilities of disulfide bonds in high resolution structures from the Protein Data Bank. The MP 2 (full) surface showed significant qualitative differences from the PES calculated using the Amber force field. In particular, a different ordering was seen for the relative energies of the local minima. Thus, Amber energies are not reliable for comparison of the relative stabilities of disulfide bonds. Surprisingly, the surface did not show a minimum associated with χ 2 − 60 °, χ 390, χ 2 ′ − 60 °. This is due to steric interference between Hα atoms. Despite this, significant populations of disulfides were found to adopt this conformation. In most cases this conformation is associated with an unusual secondary structure motif, the cross-strand disulfide. The relative instability of cross-strand disulfides is of great interest, as they have the potential to act as functional switches in redox processes. <br /...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{activated carbon}} (AC) was modified by gamma irradiation and was tested as adsorbent {{for the removal}} of ethyl mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide in wet conditions. Modifications were carried out under five different conditions: irradiation in absence of water, in presence of ultrapure water, in ultrapure water at pH = 1. 0 and 1000 mg L- 1 Cl-, in ultrapure water at pH = 7. 5 and 1000 mg L- 1 Br-, and in ultrapure water at pH = 12. 5 and 1000 mg L- 1 NO 3 -. The chemical properties of each AC were characterized by elemental analysis, temperature programmed desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Outcomes show {{that a large number of}} oxygen functional groups were incorporated in the AC surface by gamma irradiation, especially in the AC irradiated in the presence of ultrapure water. The dynamic adsorption test results reveal that the incorporation of oxygen functional groups did not enhance the adsorption capacities for dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. A significant improvement in the ethyl mercaptan adsorption capacity was correlated with the incorporation of phenolic groups in the AC surface. Moreover, <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> was detected as by-product of ethyl mercaptan oxidation process under wet conditions and its formation depended on the chemical properties of ACsR.

40|$|Concentrated {{livestock}} feeding operations {{have become a}} source of odorous gas emissions that impact air quality. Comprehensive and practical technologies are needed for a sustainable mitigation of the emissions. In this study, we advance the concept of using a catalyst for barn walls and ceilings for odor mitigation. Two catalysts, a new TiO 2 -based catalyst, PureTi Clean, and a conventional Evonik (formerly Degussa, Evonik Industries, Essen, Germany) P 25 (average particle size 25 nm) catalyst, were studied for use in reducing simulated odorous volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions on a laboratory scale. The UV source was black light. Dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> (DEDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), butyric acid, p-cresol, and guaiacol were selected as model odorants. The effects of the environmental parameters, the presence of swine dust covering the catalyst, the catalyst type and layer density, and the treatment time were tested. The performance of the PureTi catalyst at 10 µg/cm 2 was comparable to that of P 25 at 250 µg/cm 2. The odorant reduction ranged from 100. 0 ± 0. 0 % to 40. 4 ± 24. 8 % at a treatment time of 200 s, simulating wintertime barn ventilation. At a treatment time of 40 s (simulating summertime barn ventilation), the reductions were lower (from 27. 4 ± 8. 3 % to 62. 2 ± 7. 5 %). The swine dust layer on the catalyst surface blocked 15. 06 ± 5. 30 % of UV 365 and did not have a significant impact (p > 0. 23) on the catalyst performance. Significant effects of relative humidity and temperature were observed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Constituents of {{the wine}} matrix, {{including}} ethanol, affect adsorption of sulfur volatiles on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers, which can impact sensitivity and accuracy of volatile sulfur analysis in wine. Several common wine sulfur volatiles, including hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), methanethiol (MeSH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> (DEDS), methyl thioacetate (MeSOAc), and ethyl thioacetate (EtSOAc), have been analyzed with multiple internal standards using SPME-GC equipped with pulsed-flame photometric detection (PFPD) at various concentrations of ethanol, volatile-, and non-volatile-matrix components in synthetic wine samples. All compounds exhibit a stark decrease in detectability {{with the addition of}} ethanol, especially between 0. 0 and 0. 5 %v/v, but the ratio of standard to internal standard was more stable when alcohol concentration was greater than 1 %. Addition of volatile matrix components yields a similar decrease but the standard-to-internal-standard ratio was consistent, suggesting the volatile matrix did not affect the quantification of volatile sulfur compounds in wine. Non-volatile wine matrix appears to have negligible effect on sensitivity. Based on analyte:internal standard ratios, DMS can be accurately measured against ethyl methyl sulfide (EMS), the thioacetates and DMDS with diethyl sulfide (DES), and H₂S, MeSH, DEDS, and DMTS with diisopropyl disulfide (DIDS) in wine with proper dilution. The developed method was then used to quantify sulfur compounds in 21 various California wines. H₂S and MeSH were found in higher concentrations in white varietals, while DMS was slightly higher in red varietals, particularly cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Trace amounts of DEDS and MeSOAc were found in almost all wines. DMS and DMTS were found in all wines, in some instances above reported thresholds...|$|E
40|$|Volatile sulfur {{compounds}} (VSCs) are a {{major component}} of odorous emissions that can cause annoyance to local populations surrounding wastewater, waste management and agricultural practices. Odour collection and storage using sample bags can result in VSC losses due to sorption and leakage. Stability within 72 hour storage of VSC samples in three sampling bag materials (Tedlar, Mylar, Nalophan) was studied at three temperatures: 5, 20, and 30 °C. The VSC samples consisted of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), methanethiol (MeSH), ethanethiol (EtSH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), tertbutanethiol (t-BuSH), ethylmethyl sulfide (EMS), 1 -butanethiol (1 -BuSH), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> (DEDS), and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS). The results for H 2 S showed that higher loss trend was clearly observed (46 - 50 % at 24 hours) at 30 W C compared to the loss at 5 °C or 20 °C (of up to 27 % at 24 hours) in all three bag materials. The same phenomenon was obtained for other thiols with the relative recoveries after a 24 hour period of 76 - 78 % at 30 °C and 80 - 93 % at 5 and 20 °C for MeSH; 77 - 80 % at 30 °C and 79 - 95 % at 5 and 20 °C for EtSH; 87 - 89 % at 30 °C and 82 - 98 % at 5 and 20 °C for t-BuSH; 61 - 73 % at 30 °C and 76 - 98 % at 5 and 20 °C for 1 -BuSH. Results for other sulfides and disulfides (DMS, EMS, DMDS, DEDS) indicated stable relative recoveries with little dependency on temperature (83 - 103 % after 24 hours). DMTS had clear loss trends (with relative recoveries of 74 - 87 % in the three bag types after 24 hours) but showed minor differences in relative recoveries at 5, 20, and 30 °C. © IWA Publishing 2013...|$|E
40|$|Complaints due to odours are a {{major issue}} for many {{industrial}} as well as agricultural facilities. Repeated release of unpleasant odours from these facilities can constitute both a public nuisance and a possible regulatory violation. Amongst the most common odorous emissions, volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) are the most malodorous, have very low odour threshold values, {{and in many cases}} are the dominant odorants. For odour assessment, VSC containing air samples are commonly collected using plastic bags. However, VSC odorants are unstable and often suffer losses during storage in the sample bags. The degree of VSCs losses depends on many factors such as storage time, bag materials, temperature, sample relative humidity, light exposure, and the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To assess the impact of storage factors on the stability of VSC odorants, laboratory-based experiments were performed according to a factorial experimental design. Linear mixed-effects models of the storage recoveries for 10 VSC odorants in 3 different bag materials were constructed. The 10 VSCs included hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol, ethanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, tert-butylthiol, ethyl methyl sulfide, 1 -butanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide,</b> and dimethyl trisulfide. The 3 bag materials chosen in this work were Tedlar, Mylar, and Nalophan. Analyses of the results suggested Tedlar as the material of choice for the storage of VSC odorants. This material is superior over Mylar and Nalophan in maintaining the stability of all the 10 VSCs as well as the integrity of the VSC compositions. Based on the outcome of the recovery projection from the mixed models, recommendations for the handling/storage of VSC containing air sample bags are produced. It is recommended that VSC containing samples in plastic bags should not be stored at a temperature higher than 20 oC and be covered from light. Under those conditions, VSC samples in Tedlar bags can be stored up to 18 hours whereas in Mylar and Nalophan, the storage time should not exceed 12 hours...|$|E
40|$|A time-resolved gas {{electron}} diffractometer {{has been}} designed and constructed to study the photoinduced dynamics of molecular systems. An ultrafast pulsed electron beam is created by the ionisation of a thin-film gold photocathode, using the third harmonic of a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser, and accelerated across a potential of up to 100 kV. Time-averaged diffraction from a polycrystalline platinum sample {{has been carried out}} in order to calibrate the apparatus, and the results have been shown to match well with theory. In addition to the design of the apparatus, novel experimental methods and techniques have been implemented, and software for analysing and extracting data has been developed. Other calibration experiments have been carried out, including measuring the diameter of the pulsed electron beam produced, and how this varies as a solenoid magnetic lens acts to focus the beam. An optimal FWHM beam width of 1. 2 mm has been observed at the detector for pulses containing 10 ^ 4 electrons. The time-zero position between a pump laser and probe electron beam has been found by studying the laser-induced plasma emitted from a copper mesh, and methodologies have been established for grating-enhanced ponderomotive experiments to be carried out to determine the duration of the pulsed electron beam. Extensive electron pulse dynamics simulations, using SIMION and General Particle Tracer, accompany the experimental work. These have allowed for a full and thorough understanding of how both the duration and transverse size of the pulse changes as it propagates through the apparatus with and without the influence of the magnetic lens. It has also allowed for the ultimate time resolution of the apparatus to be determined as 416 fs. Quantum chemical calculations have been carried out for dimethyl disulfide and <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide,</b> molecules that readily dissociate along the S–S bond upon excitation using a low-energy ultraviolet light. This has included a full mapping of the reaction potential-energy surface, and study of the molecular dynamics of the molecules in the ground and excited states.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Sensory {{properties}} of four important volatile sulfur compounds, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), <b>diethyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> (DEDS), methanethiol (MeSH) and ethanethiol (EtSH), were determined in base Oregon Pinot noir wine {{in order to}} understand their impacts on wine aroma. Detection thresholds of these four compounds in base wine were determined first. All four compounds were found to have very low detection thresholds (in ppb) in base wine. Group thresholds of DMDS ranged from 11. 18 to 23. 57 ppb, those of DEDS ranged from 1. 45 to 2. 16 ppb, those of MeSH ranged from 1. 72 to 1. 82 ppb and those of EtSH ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 23 ppb. Subjects' abilities to detect these compounds in Pinot noir wine were very different. Aroma characteristics of the four compounds as well as their interactions in base wine were profiled via descriptive analysis. Aroma of DMDS in base wine was mainly described as old cabbage and rotten cabbage. DEDS aroma in wine was perceived as skunky, sweaty, and tire-like. Aroma of MeSH in wine was associated with stale vegetables, animal, rubbery, and slop. EtSH aroma in base wine was mainly described as durian, garlic, stale eggs, and natural gas. Odor suppression was observed when two or four sulfur compounds were mixed together in base wine. Perceiving off-odors in base wine was driven by MeSH and EtSH when both MeSH and DMDS or both EtSH and DEDS were present. EtSH affected wine aromas more when both MeSH and EtSH were present in base wine; however, MeSH governed wine off-odors more than EtSH under the influence of subthreshold levels of two disulfides. Mercaptans can significantly affect aroma quality of Oregon Pinot noir wine at very low concentrations (in ppb level); they have a stronger effect than disulfides. Regarding the impacts ofbase wine aromas caused by the four sulfur compounds, base wine lost its fruity and floral character and increased overall intensity, overall stinky, nose burn and sulfur-related odors while concentrations of the four volatile sulfur compounds in base wine increased. Aroma changes of fruity, floral and nose burn can be used by winemakers to diagnose the early presence of volatile sulfur compounds in Oregon Pinot noir wine during winemaking and wine storage...|$|E
