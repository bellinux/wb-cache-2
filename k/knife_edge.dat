5|$|Given to the City of London by Moore and the Contemporary Art Society in 1967, <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece 1962–65 is {{displayed}} in Abingdon Street Gardens, opposite the Houses of Parliament, where its regular {{appearance in the}} background of televised news reports from Westminster makes it Moore's most prominent piece in Britain. The ownership of <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece 1962–65 was disputed until its 2011 acquisition by the Parliamentary Art Collection.|$|E
5|$|By 1960 Moore {{was moving}} on from his earlier works, {{directly}} {{inspired by the}} human form and with textured surfaces, such as Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, to more rounded abstract shapes, inspired by the shapes of stones or bones. Moore made a connected work in 1961, also inspired by bone, Standing Figure (<b>Knife</b> <b>Edge)</b> (LH 482).|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event was the tag team {{encounter}} of Chris Benoit and William Regal against the team of Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista). The match started off with Batista and Chris Benoit, who brawled back and forth until Flair was tagged in. Flair and Benoit exchanged <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> chops. Batista and Regal then spar, but Batista was able to gain control over Regal, until Benoit and Flair tag in to the match. Benoit and Flair spar back and forth, until Flair applied the Figure four lock only for Benoit to reverse it into the Crippler Crossface, in which Flair submitted to, giving the win to Benoit and Regal.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Eric Bischoff and Ric Flair. The match started with Flair {{dominating}} Bischoff with <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> chops, punches and kicks. Flair performed a knee drop, and targeted Bischoff's right leg. Bischoff fought back briefly with kicks. Flair performed repeated low blows and <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> chops. Flair knocked down the referee, and performed suplexes before applying the figure four leglock. Curt Hennig came down, and handed Bischoff a weapon. Bischoff punched Flair with it, and pinned {{him to win}} the match.|$|E

25|$|The eighth {{match was}} between Lex Luger and Ric Flair. The match started {{back and forth}} until Flair {{performed}} several <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> chops in the corner. Flair kept the advantage until Luger sent Flair's head into the top turnbuckle. Luger continued to attack Flair until Flair avoided an elbow drop, and applied the figure four leglock. The time limit expired while Flair had the hold applied, and the match ended in a draw.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation to determine the critical compression load for a universal testing machine are presented for specimens loaded through <b>knife</b> <b>edges.</b> The critical load for the testing machine is the load at {{which one of the}} loading heads becomes laterally instable in relation to the other. For very short specimens the critical load was found to be less than the rated capacity given by the manufacturer for the machine. A load-length diagram is proposed for defining the safe limits of the test region for the machine. Although this report is particularly concerned with a universal testing machine of a certain type, the basic theory which led to the derivation of the general equation for the critical load, P (sub cr) = alpha L can be applied to any testing machine operated in compression where the specimen is loaded through <b>knife</b> <b>edges.</b> In this equation, L is the length of the specimen between <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> and alpha is the force necessary to displace {{the upper end of the}} specimen unit horizontal distance relative to the lower end of the specimen in a direction normal to the <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> through which the specimen is loaded...|$|R

25|$|Biological {{tissue is}} often {{embedded}} in a resin block then thinned to less than 100nm on an ultramicrotome. The resin block is fractured as it passes over a glass or diamond <b>knife</b> <b>edge.</b> This method is used to obtain thin, minimally deformed samples that allow for the observation of tissue ultrastructure. Inorganic samples, such as aluminium, may also be embedded in resins and ultrathin sectioned in this way, using either coated glass, sapphire or larger angle diamond knives. To prevent charge build-up at the sample surface when viewing in the TEM, tissue samples need to be coated with {{a thin layer of}} conducting material, such as carbon.|$|E

500|$|<b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece 1962–65 is an {{abstract}} bronze sculpture by Henry Moore. It {{is one of}} Moore's earliest sculptures in two pieces, a mode that he started to adopt in 1959. Its form {{was inspired by the}} shape of a bone fragment. Moore created the sculpture from an edition of 10 working models in 1962; these working models are now in public collections. Moore created four full-size casts between 1962-1965, with one retained by him. The three casts are on public display on College Green in Westminster, London, Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, and the garden at Kykuit, the house of the Rockefeller family in Tarrytown, New York. Moore's own cast is on display at his former studio and estate, 'Hoglands' in Perry Green, Hertfordshire in southern England. A similar work, [...] Mirror <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> 1977 (or <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Mirror Two Piece), is displayed at the entrance to I. M. Pei's east wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The Westminster cast was donated by Moore through the Contemporary Art Society to what he believed was the City of London, but its actual ownership was undetermined for many years. The Westminster cast subsequently fell into disrepair, and was restored in 2013 after it became part of the British Parliamentary Art Collection; it was granted a Grade II* listing in January 2016.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{believed}} he had donated the work to the City of London, but the Henry Moore Foundation believed it was owned by the City of Westminster, and its delivery was accepted by the Ministry of Public Building and Works. The land where it is situated was a bombsite in the Second World War, and {{is owned by the}} Parliamentary Estate; Westminster City Council operates a car park underneath. The sculpture was moved and placed on a plinth in 1969. No formal arrangements were ever made for the ownership and care of <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece, and it fell into a state of disrepair. Though it is worth an estimated £5m, no conservation work ever took place on the sculpture, and its ownership was unresolved until the House of Commons agreed to take responsibility for it. <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece entered the Parliamentary Art Collection in 2011. [...] It was granted a Grade II* listing in January 2016.|$|E

500|$|The Chair of the House of Commons Works of Art Committee, Frank Doran MP, {{had been}} {{concerned}} {{by the appearance of}} the sculpture and enquired of the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, Ed Vaizey MP, what plans there were for its care and maintenance.

Vaizey subsequently described <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece as [...] "one of the most televised works of art in London". Restoration work was originally planned to be completed in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but was not begun until February 2013.|$|E
500|$|The second cast of <b>Knife</b> <b>Edge</b> Two Piece {{is located}} in Abingdon Street Gardens, also known as College Green, {{opposite}} the Palace of Westminster in London.

The Contemporary Art Society met with Henry Moore to discuss their proposal and Moore subsequently chose the site at Abingdon Street Gardens for the sculpture. Moore waived his usual fee, and the Contemporary Art Society paid for the cost of the casting. The sculpture was unveiled by Robert Mellish, the Minister of Public Building and Works, on 1 September 1967.|$|E
