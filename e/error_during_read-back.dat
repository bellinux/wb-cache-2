The first is based on minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation {{and the second is}} based on message passing on the combined graph of the ISI and the error correction code. Low-density parity-check codes are used for error correction. For the form of the ISI considered in our simulations the best performance is achieved by using the iterative decoding and MMSE equalization method. Index Terms—Equalization, intersymbol interference, iterative decoding, message passing. I...|$|R

40|$|Two studies {{examined}} {{whether the}} number of errors made in learning a motor skill, golf putting, differentially influences the adoption of a selective (explicit) or unselective (implicit) learning mode. Errorful learners were expected to adopt an explicit, hypothesis-testing strategy to correct <b>errors</b> <b>during</b> learning, thereby accruing a pool of verbalizable rules and exhibiting performance breakdown under dual-task conditions, characteristic of a selective mode of learning. Reducing <b>errors</b> <b>during</b> learning was predicted to minimize the involvement of explicit hypothesis testing leading to the adoption of an unselective mode of learning, distinguished by few verbalizable rules and robust performance under secondary task loading. Both studies supported these predictions. The golf putting performance of errorless learners in both studies was unaffected by the imposition of a secondary task load, whereas the performance of errorful learners deteriorated. Reducing <b>errors</b> <b>during</b> learning limited {{the number of}} error-correcting hypotheses tested by the learner, thereby reducing the contribution of explicit processing to skill acquisition. It was concluded that the reduction of <b>errors</b> <b>during</b> learning encourages the use of implicit, unselective learning processes, which confer insusceptibility to performance breakdown under distraction. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|As {{pointed out}} by Gao et al., the {{stability}} and integrity {{of the human genome}} are maintained by the DNA damage repair (DDR) system. Un-repaired DNA damage is a major cause of mutations that drive carcinogenesis. [...] If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational <b>errors</b> <b>during</b> DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to <b>errors</b> <b>during</b> DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer.|$|R
