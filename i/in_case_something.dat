5|$|When the {{air-cooled}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi {{was on hand}} just <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> went wrong. The technicians {{woke him}} early {{so that he could}} see it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of many}} citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E

Gravano attempted to lie low {{for nearly three}} weeks afterwards, during which time he called his crew together and {{made the decision to}} kill Castellano if necessary. Gravano and Milito were then summoned to a meeting with Castellano at a Manhattan restaurant. Castellano had been given the details of what Fiala had done, but he was still livid that Gravano had not come to him for permission to kill Fiala first. Gravano, however, was spared execution when he convinced Castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> went wrong with the hit.|$|E

25|$|Many {{television}} stations in New Hampshire also {{reported on the}} shooting and memorial of the fallen officer. One station, WMUR, televised the funeral procession and memorial service on October 21, 2006. However, a court ruling prohibited television and radio stations performing live broadcast of the murder trial (although one camera was allowed) according to a rule started by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 2004. WMUR petitioned that ruling, and on April 13, 2007, another court ruling stated that the pre-trial hearings could be broadcast on television on a one-hour delay <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> unexpected occurs that cannot be televised. The local television station again petitioned for live, streaming coverage of the trial and the court granted their request over the defense team's objections, while limiting the scope of their coverage.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all of that stuff - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E

In July 2009, Phillies scouts evaluated Martínez in two simulated games against the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Martínez told reporters, [...] "I would just like to be the backup.

50|$|The {{legality}} {{of who is}} competent to declare war varies between nations and forms of government.

2500|$|In 1992 Stone {{founded the}} World Studio Group (WSG) {{for the purpose}} of {{bringing}} together major recording studios around the world in order to provide premium recording services to major groups while on tour. [...] World Studio Group was chosen by Larry Hamby of A Records who proposed Stone's involvement with Woodstock '94. [...] Stone arranged for four remote recording trucks, two for each stage, at Woodstock '94, as a safety backup <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> went wrong. Bearsville Studios would serve as the hub of recording. Bob Clearmountain was chosen as chief audio engineer to tie the four parts together, and to mix the resulting album. Stone arranged to have a tour bus parked between the two stages for as many as 12 audio engineers to sleep. After Peter Gabriel's concluding set ended {{in the wee hours of}} Monday, August 15, 1994, Stone's plan was carried out: all of the performances were digitally copied and backed up in the next two days. Not one song was lost.|$|E
2500|$|Mathis {{had worn}} his trunks very high, {{so that when}} Joe hit Mathis with {{legitimate}} body shots, the referee took {{a dim view of}} them. In the second round, the referee had {{gone so far as to}} penalize Joe two points for hitting below the belt. [...] "In a three-round bout a man can't afford a points deduction like that," [...] Joe would say. Joe then returned to Philadelphia feeling as low as he'd ever been and was even thinking of giving up boxing. Duke Dugent and his trainer Yank Durham were able to talk Joe out of his doldrums and even suggested Joe make the trip to Tokyo as an alternate, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> happened to Mathis. Joe agreed and while there, he was a workhorse, sparring with any of the Olympic boxers who wanted some action. [...] "Middleweight, light heavyweight, it didn't matter to me, I got in there and boxed all comers" [...] Joe would say. In contrast, Mathis was slacking off. In the morning, when the Olympic team would do their roadwork, Mathis would run a mile, then start walking saying [...] "Go ahead, big Joe. I'll catch up." [...] His amateur record was 38–2.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{takes place}} {{two years after}} the events of Ghostbusters II during Thanksgiving Day in 1991. The Ghostbusters, now {{official}} city contractors, are training a new recruit, whom Dr. Venkman insists they simply call [...] "Rookie" [...] so they don't get too attached <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>something</b> should happen to the new hire while testing out experimental equipment. A large PKE shockwave then hits New York City and sends the team on a variety of calls to capture ghosts that result from it, including Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Throughout these calls, they are hounded by Walter Peck, now head of the Paranormal Contracts Oversight Commission (PCOC, pronounced [...] "peacock") as appointed by Mayor Jock Mulligan, who warns them about causing too much damage in their ghost capturing activities. The Ghostbusters discover through a series of adventures and encounters with museum curator Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn (Alyssa Milano) that Ivo Shandor, the architect who designed the building at 55 Central Park West that was once used to summon Gozer, had also designed a network of tunnels to channel ectoplasmic slime through the city that was used by Vigo the Carpathian. The Ghostbusters also realize that Shandor placed personally-renovated buildings above the tunnels to act as nodes on a mandala to merge the real world with the Ghost World and bring forth another Great Destructor like Gozer. The Ghostbusters help to destroy the nodes and capture the node guardians at the Sedgewick Hotel, the New York Public Library, and the Museum of Natural History, which was hosting a Gozer exhibit with artifacts donated by Shandor's estate. At the last node {{in the middle of the}} Hudson River they discover a mansion on an island rising from the water. As they explore it, they find that the island belonged to Shandor and that Ilyssa is his descendant. They also discover machines pumping the slime into the tunnel network and disable them as well as the final Mandala node, and escape the island just before it sinks back into the water.|$|E
