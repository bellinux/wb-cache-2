25|$|Relevant is {{the fact}} that {{certainty}} is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's problem of induction). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This {{is an example of the}} butterfly effect, which is one of the subjects of chaos theory. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to predict or attain certainty as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of several items, including a soft-drink glass, {{a bottle of}} milk, marshmallows, and pages from a briefcase, falling onto the ground. A QR code, which was said to produce the word [...] "LOVE" [...] when scanned, can be seen printed on the glass and bottle, {{and on the ground}} during the scene of the marshmallows falling. In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the falling objects convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general idea here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the exciting thing that they have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up from the inside of a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible {{standing in the middle of}} a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E

2500|$|Stove's {{first step}} in {{refining}} the general answer is observing what he calls mixed strategy writing in the authors he is examining. He uses this expression, since {{it is not always}} clear to him whether the writing expresses [...] "equivocation" [...] or [...] "inconsistency". What is common to the examples Stove offers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> well-known is mixed with something extraordinary, without the clash being resolved; the [...] "irrationalism" [...] is introduced simultaneously with orthodoxy, rendering it more plausible to the reader—disbelief is suspended.|$|E
2500|$|The first, [...] "to repeat", seems {{connected}} with the punning phrase [...] "two rendered he" [...] and with the couplet's [...] "repetition." [...] But the other two meanings are more interesting: [...] "to melt (fat, etc.)", and to [...] "reproduce or represent, esp. by artistic means; to depict". These meanings join the tangled double entendres in [...] "Enter [...] Quietuses two [...] render thee" [...] to suggest such readings of line 12 as [...] "You're suffering melt-down over this couplet" [...] and [...] "Nature's two 'Quietuses' intrude here to depict you". Because an [...] "Audit" [...] was originally a [...] "hearing," [...] one ironic idea here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> silent (like the missing couplet) can be [...] "heard" [...] and [...] "must be answered--or can be [...] "Anne's word." [...] The pun [...] "End here" [...] (line 12) signals the poet's early ending in line 12, not 14. A different kind of runic wit occurs in the punning conceit [...] "Enter Quietuses to [...] " [...] where two abstractions—the empty couplet lines—hover like hooded figures in a medieval morality.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the ensuing}} months, Jung wrote to Freud about the relationship, at first accusing Spielrein of having {{tried unsuccessfully to}} seduce him, and then admitting that he had become romantically {{involved}} with her. [...] He sent a series of letters to Spielrein's mother, writing [...] "no one can prevent two friends from doing as they wish...the likelihood <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> more may enter the relationship". [...] Spielrein also wrote to Freud, making it clear that, for a few months, their relationship had been in some fashion physical, it had involved what Spielrein again called [...] "poetry": [...] "In the end the unavoidable happened...it {{reached the point where}} he could no longer stand it and wanted 'poetry'. I could not {{and did not want to}} resist, for many reasons' [...] Eva Spielrein threatened to report him to Eugen Bleuler and came to Zurich to do so, but in the end decided not to. [...] Meanwhile, Jung had resigned his medical post at the Burghölzli, although he continued his laboratory work and university teaching. A document-based account of these events, including the three-way correspondence between Spielrein, Jung and Freud, appears in Launer's biography.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire."

And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E
