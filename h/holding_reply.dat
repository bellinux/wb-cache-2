Asked diffidently--as diffidently as he could, that is--how many men my house would <b>hold.</b> <b>Replied</b> eight--or ten at a pinch. He gave me a surprised and beaming smile and whipped out a huge note-book. Informed him with as much regret as I could put into a voice not always under perfect control, that I had already got an officer. Q.M.S., favouring me with a look very appropriate to the Devil's Own, turned on his heel and set off in pursuit of a lady-billetee, pulling up short on the threshold of the baby-linen shop in which she took refuge. Left him on guard with a Casablanca-like look on his face.|$|R

50|$|In the X Window System core protocol, {{only four}} kinds of packets are sent, , over the network: requests, replies, events, and errors. Requests are sent by a client to the server {{to ask it}} to perform some {{operation}} (for example, create a new window) and to send back data it <b>holds.</b> <b>Replies</b> are sent by the server to provide such data. Events are sent by the server to notify clients of user activity or other occurrences they are interested in. Errors are packet sent by the server to notify a client of errors occurred during processing of its requests. Requests may generate replies, events, and errors; other than this, the protocol does not mandate over a specific order in which packets are sent over the network. Some extensions to the core protocol exist, each one having its own requests, replies, events, and errors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To achieve scalability, energy-efficiency, and timeliness, {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} deployments increasingly employ in-network processing. In this paper, we identify singlehop feedback collection as a key building block for in-network processing applications, and introduce a basic singlehop primitive, pollcast. The key idea behind this primitive is to exploit the receiverside collision detection information at the MAC-layer to speed-up collaborative feedback collection. Using pollcast, a node can get an affirmation {{about the existence of}} a node-level predicate P in its neighborhood in constant time by asking all nodes where P <b>hold</b> to <b>reply</b> simultaneously. We have implemented pollcast on Tmotes using Chipcon 2420 radio. Our results show that this primitive is indeed lightweight, resilient, and effective.

40|$|To achieve scalability, energy-efficiency, and timeliness, {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} deployments increasingly employ in-network processing. In this paper, we identify singlehop feedback collection as a key building block for innetwork processing applications, and introduce two basic singlehop primitives, pollcast and countcast. The key idea behind our primitives is to exploit the receiver-side collision detection information at the MAC-layer to speed-up collaborative feedback collection. Using pollcast, a node can get an affirmation {{about the existence of}} a node-level predicate P in its neighborhood in constant time by asking all nodes where P <b>hold</b> to <b>reply</b> simultaneously. Using countcast, a node can get an approximate count of the number CP of such nodes in log(CP) time. We have implemented pollcast and countcast on Tmotes using Chipcon 2420 radio. Our results show that these primitives are indeed lightweight, resilient, and effective. Our paper is also the first time receiver-side collision detection is achieved in a practical manner for Chipcon 2420 radio. ...|$|R
5000|$|All {{the birds}} and animals {{who lived in the}} great cloud sea were panicked. The Duck asked [...] "where can it rest?" [...] "Only the earth can <b>hold</b> it," [...] <b>replied</b> the Beaver - the oeh-dah from the bottom of our great sea - [...] "I will get some." [...] The Beaver dove down, but never came up. Then the Duck tried, but its dead body floated to the surface. Many of the other birds and animals tried and failed. Finally the Muskrat {{returned}} with some earth in his paws. [...] "It's heavy", he said, [...] "who can support it?" [...] The Turtle volunteered, and the earth was placed on top of his shell. When the earth was ready the birds flew up and carried Ata-en-sic on their wings to the Turtle's back.|$|R

But he was here always," [...] and she pressed his hand to her side. [...] "He could not be got rid of. Then I lost my voice, and was 'utterly dished,' as the {{theatrical}} people say. Then the lord went,--behaving better than I did however,--and I was alone. Oh, what bitter moments there came then,--long enough for the post to go to Ireland and to return! And now he is here. Once more at my feet again, old man, once more! And then he talks to me of money! What is money to me? I have got such a comforting portion that I care not at all for money." [...] Then she all but fainted once again, and Frank and her father both knelt over her caressing her.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} issue of this journal Campbell Craig put forward an amended version of Power Preponderance theory seeking to explain why US {{unipolar}} predominance {{has turned out to be}} not simply a ‘moment’ and as such represents ‘a serious anomaly for neorealist theory’. In using Waltz's own work on how nuclear weapons affect state behaviour, Craig appears to further bolster the case for Power Preponderance theory. Craig exploits what at first sight seems to be a contradiction in Waltz's work. However, Craig's error is that he treats security qua territorial security rather than considering a more encompassing view of state security. In the arena of ‘secondary’ security issues the usual logic of counter-balancing with conventional military forces still <b>holds</b> sway. This <b>reply</b> argues that a balance of power will return to the international system, it is just that at this moment no country or coalition of countries is quite up to the task...|$|R

I know how you must despise me; I feel you are right to do so; I am too poor a {{creature}} to occupy one thought of your mind, although, alas! you must die for me this morning. But when I asked you to marry me, indeed, and indeed, it was because I respected and admired you, and loved you with my whole soul, from the very moment that you took my part against my uncle. If you had seen yourself, and how noble you looked, you would pity rather than despise me. And now," [...] she went on, hurriedly checking him with her hand, [...] "although I have laid aside all reserve and told you so much, remember that I know your sentiments towards me already. I would not, believe me, being nobly born, weary you with importunities into consent. I too have a pride of my own: and I declare before the holy mother of God, if you should now go back from your word already given, I would no more marry you than I would marry my uncle's groom." ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{provide a}} defence of the New View, on which ignorance {{is lack of}} true belief rather than lack of knowledge. Pierre Le Morvan {{has argued that the}} New View is untenable, partly because it fails {{to take into account the}} {{distinction}} between propositional and factive ignorance. I argue that propositional ignorance is just a subspecies of factive ignorance and that all the work that needs to be done can be done by using the concept of factive ignorance. I also defend two arguments of mine in favour of the New View against Le Morvan's criticisms. As to the Linguistic Argument, I point out that the intuitions of the adherent of the New View about cases of true belief that fall short of knowledge are really intuitions about factive rather than propositional ignorance. As to the Excuse Argument, I argue that true belief is exculpatorily relevant: a true belief in a proposition p, where disbelief that p or suspension on p would provide at least a partial excuse, is relevant in that it renders one blameworthy for one's action, unless further excuses <b>hold.</b> Finally, I <b>reply</b> to two closely related objections that might be levelled against the New View, namely that it seems false that one can reduce one's ignorance by arbitrarily believing as many propositions as possible and that it seems false that an intellectually conscientious and critical person is more ignorant than an intellectually sloppy and credulous person just because the latter has more true beliefs. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R
5|$|While Keats had {{remained}} with his prize Saumarez {{had led the}} remainder of the squadron forward, although Audacious had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as Superb attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour. As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood spotted the French ship Formidable, under the command of Captain Amable Troude in the absence of Linois, to the north. Formidable was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in Conil Bay to the south of Cadiz and north of Cape Trafalgar. The wind was light and coming from the land and so Caesar and Spencer, the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to Venerable and Thames, both inshore and therefore better able {{to make use of the}} wind, to lead the attack. Formidable had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood <b>holding</b> off from <b>replying</b> until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The light breeze was at that point in Hood's favour, and Venerable was able to come close alongside Formidable and open fire with a full broadside. Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to Formidables aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.|$|R

"Oh, dear, yes," [...] Felix <b>replied,</b> <b>holding</b> {{his hand}} out as he spoke to catch his companion's arm gently, and steady her against the wave that {{was just going to}} strike the stern: [...] "Excuse me; just so; the sea's rising fast, isn't it?--Oh, dear, yes; of course they are; they're all heathen and cannibals. You couldn't imagine to {{yourself}} the horrible bloodthirsty rites that may this very minute be taking place upon that idyllic-looking island, under the soft waving branches of those whispering palm-trees. Why, I knew a man in the Marquesas myself--a hideous old native, as ugly as you can fancy him--who {{was supposed to be a}} god, an incarnate god, and was worshipped accordingly with profound devotion by all the other islanders. You can't picture to yourself how awful their worship was. I daren't even repeat it to you; it was too, too horrible. He lived in a hut by himself among the deepest forest, and human victims used to be brought--well, there, it's too loathsome! Why, see; there's a great light on the island now; a big bonfire or something; don't you make it out? You can tell it by the red glare in the sky overhead." [...] He paused a moment; then he added more slowly, [...] "I shouldn't be surprised if at this very moment, while we're standing here in such perfect security on the deck of a Christian English vessel, some unspeakable and unthinkable heathen orgy mayn't be going on over there beside that sacrificial fire; and if some poor trembling native girl isn't being led just now, with blows and curses and awful savage ceremonies, her hands bound behind her back--Oh, look out, Miss Ellis!" ...|$|R
