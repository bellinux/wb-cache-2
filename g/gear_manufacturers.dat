50|$|Ouray is {{the winter}} ice-{{climbing}} {{capital of the}} U.S. The world's first ice climbing park, expanding on previously-popular natural falls, consists of dozens of frozen waterfalls from 80 to 200 ft high farmed along {{more than a mile}} of the Uncompahgre Gorge. The water is supplied by a sprinkler system developed and maintained by a volunteer organization and supported by donations from local businesses, <b>gear</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and climbers. The Ouray Ice Park is free and attracts climbers from around the world. The annual Ice Festival is a weekend-long extravaganza of contests, exhibitions and instruction with many of the world's top ice climbers. Ice climbing has been a boon to the local economy as well, with hotels and restaurants that previously closed through the winter months now staying open to accommodate climbers.|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 48 Centrifugal {{compressor}} and turbine {{manufacturers are}} building machines that operate at increasingly higher speeds {{to reduce the}} size and cost of their equipment. Helical gears are commonly used to step down the speed of these machines to match nominal motor and generator speeds. The demand for higher compressor and turbine speeds has resulted in an increase in the maximum pitch line velocities of helical gears. <b>Gear</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have also increased the allowable tooth loading {{to reduce the size}} and cost of their equipment. The increase in pitch line velocities and tooth loadings has not been without problems. Several new and updated American <b>Gear</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> Association (AGMA) standards have been published to educate end users on the issues with high-speed helical gears and to provide consistent criteria for rating gears. One of the key issues is lubrication and cooling. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present some of the current methods for evaluating the lubrication and cooling requirements of high-speed helical gears to assist end users with selecting new gears and to provide a tool for solving gear problems...|$|E

In addition, the inclusion of the effect of operating error and load-distributing tooth flexibility provides the gear engineer with a more accurate means for helical-gear strength rating.

40|$|Surface {{stress on}} the surface contact of gear tooth {{calculated}} by the Buckingham equation constitutes the basis for The American <b>Gear</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> Association (AGMA) pitting resistance formula, {{which is based on}} a normal stress that does not cause failure since the yielding in contact problems is caused by shear stresses. An alternative expression based on the maximum-shear-stress is proposed in this paper. The new expression is obtained by using the maximum-shear-stress distribution and the Tresca failure criteria in order to know the maximum-shear-stress value and its location beneath the contact surface. Remarkable differences between the results using the proposed equation and those when the AGMA equation is applied are found...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{comprehensive}} methodology for calculating load sharing in multiple tooth contact is presented {{based on the}} experimental stress-optical method of caustics.

The load sharing factor (LSF) is calculated using well-established mathematical formulae from the photographs of the transmitted caustics and the obtained results are compared with the pertinent International Organisation for Standardisation and American <b>Gear</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> Association standards with which good agreement is verified. The proposed method is a reliable alternative for measuring load distribution in gear teeth compared with photoelasticity and other experimental techniques. © 2009 The Authors...|$|E
