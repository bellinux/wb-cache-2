The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E

'Last July a {{detachment}} of Gordon Highlanders was camped on the veldt {{for a week}} in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> which stands almost alone {{on the outskirts of}} the town.

60|$|On {{arriving}} at the green in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>house,</b> where we three had agreed to meet, I found that Jacob's outfit was even less than mine.

When that should be done it would be impossible for it to move any farther.|$|E
60|$|On the {{afternoon}} when my purchases were completed, I {{did not come}} home by the train. I drove home in my own carriage, drawn by my own horse! The ten miles' drive was over a smooth road, and the sorrel traveled splendidly. If I had been a line of kings a mile long, all in their chariots of state, with gold and silver, and outriders, and music, and banners waving in the wind, I {{could not have been}} prouder than when I drew up in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
60|$|A phœbe soon {{built in}} my shed, and a robin for {{protection}} in a pine which grew against the house. In June the partridge (Tetrao umbellus), {{which is so}} shy a bird, led her brood past my windows, from the woods in the rear to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> clucking and calling to them like a hen, and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of the woods. The young suddenly disperse on your approach, at a signal from the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so exactly resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his foot {{in the midst of}} a brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she flew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her trail her wings to attract his attention, without suspecting their neighborhood. The parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a dishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of creature it is. The young squat still and flat, often running their heads under a leaf, and mind only their mother's directions given from a distance, nor will your approach make them run again and betray themselves. You may even tread on them, or have your eyes on them for a minute, without discovering them. I have held them in my open hand at such a time, and still their only care, obedient to their mother and their instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling. So perfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them on the leaves again, and one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the rest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward. They are not callow like the young of most birds, but more perfectly developed and precocious even than chickens. The remarkably adult yet innocent expression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable. All intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the purity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye was not born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects. The woods do not yield another such a gem. The traveller does not often look into such a limpid well. The ignorant or reckless sportsman often shoots the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents to fall a prey to some prowling beast or bird, or gradually mingle with the decaying leaves which they so much resemble. It is said that when hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm, and so are lost, for they never hear the mother's call which gathers them again. These were my hens and chickens.|$|E

50|$|Samy Sorge (born 19 December 1977), {{commonly}} known as Samy Deluxe, Wickeda MC or Sam Semillia is a German rapper, and hip hop artist from Hamburg. When his Sudanese father left Germany when Samy Deluxe was just two years old, Samy grew up with his mother's family. His half-sister was born shortly after his father left. The family lived in Barmbek for many years, then moved to Eppendorf, a better-off part of Hamburg. His family {{was able to make}} this move after a recommendation from a family friend after his mother remarried. He attended the Wolfgang-Borchert-Schule and attained the Realschulabschluss, or certificate of general education similar to a high school diploma or British GCSE. He cites his upbringing in a middle-class neighbourhood as part of his inspiration. He says he felt out of place, “At (one) point I would stand out in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>house</b> and people who lived here before me would ask “can I help you?”. Additionally, he cites American rappers as his inspiration instead of relying on German history. Samy recalls taking up an interest in rap music in 1988.|$|R

5000|$|In Switzerland, in Bern, I {{lived on}} the Gerechtigkeitsgasse, that is, Justice Street.

In the spring red geraniums … And the still-medieval street: I lived in the old part of the city. What saved me from the monotony of Bern was living in the Middle Ages, it was waiting for the snow to pass and for the red geraniums to be reflected once again in the water, it was having a son born there, it was writing one of my least liked books, The Besieged City, which, however, people come to like when they read it a second time; my gratitude to that book is enormous: the effort of writing it kept me busy, saved me from the appalling silence of Bern, and when I finished the last chapter I went to the hospital to give birth to the boy.|$|E

40|$|Plum Blossom Warm Gentle Wind Shimmering Stillness is a {{composition}} for solo bass trombone and accompanying ensemble. It is in six movements and is approximately 12 minutes long. The piece {{is dedicated to}} my grandfathers Benjamin A. Levis, and Harbert S. Gregory, who have passed away in recent years. I initially began work on concepts for the composition while studying with Professor John Thow, and then with Professor Jorge Liderman, but put it away after their untimely passing. Movement four is dedicated to both of them. The composition was written for my good friend and unparalleled bass trombonist, Marc Bolin. The title reflects my interest in haiku, {{and the possibility of}} containing in a brief statement, a moment of total clarity and harmony. While reflecting on Professor Thow's passing, sitting on my front porch, watching the blooming plum tree in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> shake and stir ever so gently when the wind would pick up, I experienced one of these moments of deep quietude. Even as the title is not a haiku in its traditional form, it contains a moment for me where something brief and subtle can have a sudden impact and lasting resonance. Even though the composition is inspired by this moment, it is not an impressionistic, sonic image of the natural world. Rather, it is a metaphor for the complex relationships that make up our human experience, the impact those relationships have on us, and the lasting effects and reverberations they create. The work employs a myriad of extended techniques, engendering layers of timbral commonality. This allows the ensemble to fuse into blended "meta-instruments" and magnify the sonic landscape of the bass trombone. The composition is influenced by my interest in the sometimes antagonistic aims of post-spectral harmony and orchestration, self-similarity modeling of the new complexity school, and large-scale architecture in improvisation. The instrumentation for Plum Blossom Warm Gentle Wind Shimmering Stillness is bass trombone, four percussionists, piano, two violins, viola, violoncello, and contrabass...|$|E
