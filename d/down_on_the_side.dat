Iron Age hill forts near the city are at Leigh Woods and Clifton <b>Down,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Avon Gorge, and on Kings Weston Hill near Henbury. A Roman settlement, Abona, existed at what is now Sea Mills (connected to Bath by a Roman road); another was at the present-day Inns Court. Isolated Roman villas and small forts and settlements were also scattered throughout the area.|$|E

500|$|The thirteenth {{season premiere}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker gave the episode a positive review, showing approval of Kenny's misadventure, saying [...] "thus did South Park ultimately come <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> {{of religion and}} sexual freedom, with lots of big laughs in the bargain.... Trey and Matt are off to a great 13th-season start." [...] James Poniewozik of Time said [...] "The Ring" [...] was {{better than any of}} the twelfth season episodes. Poniewozik said the episode, [...] "demonstrated that the cartoon is best when it focuses on the four kids and when it is driven by a white-hot moral fury". Travis Fickett of IGN also particularly applauded the Disney satire, which he said, [...] "elevates this beyond shock humor and into sharp satire." [...] IGN gave the episode an 8.4 score out of 10.|$|E

500|$|The new {{constitution}} addressed {{many of the}} reformist concerns of the Patriots since 1785 (no hereditary offices; no sinecures; accountability of officials). It also came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of economic liberalism (as opposed to mercantilism) in the economic debate then raging in republican circles (and therefore promised {{to do away with}} guilds and internal impediments to trade). The old provincial-repartition system of public finance was {{to be replaced by a}} system of national taxation. There was to be a five-man Uitvoerend Bewind as a collective Executive, with eight national Agenten (government ministers) doing the actual Administration work (Foreign Affairs, Police and Interior, Justice, Finance, War, Navy, National Education, and National Economy). Most importantly, as the British historian Simon Schama states: [...] "ts central aim was to change the nature of the Dutch state and to bind its new institutions into the framework of an electoral democracy." [...] As such it had an importance that outlasted the Batavian Republic and set up an ideal to emulate for its successor states.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Freemasons {{and against}} the church, ordering Dom Vital to rescind the interdict, which he refused. [...] This refusal led to the bishops being tried before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Empire where in 1874 they were {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years of hard labor which was commuted to imprisonment without hard labor. Rio Branco explained in a letter written in August 1873 that he believed the government [...] "could not compromise in the affair" [...] since [...] "it involved principles essential to the social order and to national sovereignty". These actions aligned with his own views, but his convictions were bolstered by the Emperor's identical conclusions. PedroII regarded Rio Branco as his favorite politician and a second-in-command on whom he could rely. The Emperor played a decisive role by unequivocally backing the government's actions in moving against the bishops. The lack of independence shown by Rio Branco in relation to PedroII was strongly criticized by historian Roderick J. Barman, who believed that the Prime Minister only enforced policies that did not displease the Emperor or which had his full support. [...] The trial and imprisonment of the two bishops was very unpopular,.|$|E
500|$|An {{international}} {{design competition}} was {{launched by the}} Department of Home Affairs on 30 April 1911, closing on 31 January 1912. The competition was boycotted by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Institute of Civil Engineers, and their affiliated bodies throughout the British Empire, because the Minister for Home Affairs, King O'Malley insisted that the final decision was {{for him to make}} rather than an expert in city planning. A total of 137 valid entries were received. O'Malley appointed a three-member board to advise him, but they could not reach unanimity. On 24May 1911, O'Malley came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> {{of the majority of the}} board, the design by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin of Chicago, Illinois, United States being declared the winner. Second was Eliel Saarinen of Finland, and third was Alfred Agache of Brazil but resident in Paris, France. [...] O'Malley then appointed a six-member board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design. [...] On 25November 1912 the board advised that it could not support Griffin's plan in its entirety, and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising, incorporating the best features of the three place-getting designs as well as of a fourth design by H. Caswell, R.C.G. Coulter and W. Scott-Griffiths of Sydney, the rights to which it had purchased. It was this composite plan that was endorsed by Parliament and given formal approval by O'Malley on 10 January 1913. [...] In 1913 Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began. On 23 February King O'Malley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city.|$|E

[...] She subsequently acknowledged the mistakes made at the time and felt that a debt needed repaying. The inability or failure of the Clinton administration to do anything about the genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions. She said of the experience: [...] "I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would come <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required." ...|$|E

[...] Faced with workers striking {{in an effort to}} obtain better pay and working conditions, conservative farm owners resorted to violence, spying on attorneys sent to California to aid the workers, and propaganda asserting that the strike was communist-inspired. [...] Though Glassford was initially sympathetic to the farm owners, their tactics caused him to come <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the workers.|$|E

2500|$|Politically, {{the issue}} of Jurassic {{separatism}} is {{a major issue in}} Moutier. [...] In 1974 a plebiscite voted to remain part of Bern by a margin of only 70 votes. [...] This led to acts of vandalism on 16 March 1974 and on 7 September 1975 an armed standoff at the Hôtel de la Gare which was broken up by an elite team of Bernese police on the following day. [...] Two other plebiscites also came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of remaining in the Canton of Bern, including one in 1998 which passed with a thin majority of 41 votes. [...] In 2013 a third plebiscite ended with the majority of residents choosing to remain in Bern, though a majority of residents of Moutier wanted to join Jura. [...] On 18 June 2017 the municipality held a referendum, asking citizens 'Do you want the city of Moutier to belong to the Republic and Canton of Jura?' The result of the referendum was 51.7% of the citizenry voting in favour of Moutier joining the Canton of Jura.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue with}} the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of {{outwardly}} rotating (at the [...] "tops" [...] of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and p-factor force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot {{to deal with the}} situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load. This same design feature was present from its earliest days on both the Luftwaffe twin-engine Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, and from the fourth prototype onwards of the otherwise troubled Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} his Oman expedition, in early 1926, Lees was posted to Bahrain. While accepting {{that there were}} oil prospects in Cretaceous or older rocks, he gave it a distinctly low rating {{in comparison with the}} numerous Asmari Limestone prospects available in the region generally, most of them in Persia or Iraq. Lees' views at that time were greatly influenced by De Böckh, who considered Bahrain unlikely to yield oil in comparable quantity with structures in the Zagros foothills and had doubts whether any important amount would be found where the Asmari Limestone is missing (which it was in Bahrain). Lister James, who had been favourably impressed with Bahrain several years earlier, was still chief geologist for Anglo-Persian but De Böckh had been retained as the company's chief geological adviser for several years, and his opinion, supplemented by the report of Lees, prevailed with the management. At a lecture he delivered a few months before the discovery of oil in Bahrain, Lees summed up the evidence for and against finding oil in commercial quantities in Bahrain as an even chance. Lees came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the doubters, famously declaring that he would [...] "drink any commercial oil found in Bahrain".|$|E
