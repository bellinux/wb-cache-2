500|$|At {{the sight}} of hail and {{thunderstorm}} clouds, i.e. the ala that leads them, people did not <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> wait– they resorted to magic. In the Pomoravlje region, this magic was assisted by ala’s herbs, picked in levees and the places on a field where a plow turns around during plowing. These locations were considered unclean because ale visited them. In folk spells of eastern Serbia, a particular ala could be addressed by a female personal name: Smiljana, Kalina, Magdalena, Dobrica, Dragija, Zagorka, etc. An expression for addressing an ala– Maate paletinke– is of uncertain meaning. One of the spells that was used upon sighting hail clouds, and which explicitly mentioned an ala, was shouted {{in the direction of}} the clouds: ...|$|E
500|$|The Open Door took 18 {{months to}} write. The new songs {{were written by}} Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs. Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 Goncharov went to Marienbad for medical treatment. There he wrote Oblomov, almost in its entirety. [...] "It might seem strange, even {{impossible}} that {{in the course of}} one month the whole of the novel might be written... But it'd been growing in me for several years, so what I had to do then was <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> write everything down," [...] he later remembered. Goncharov's second novel Oblomov was published in 1859 in Otechestvennye Zapiski. It had evolved from the earlier [...] "Oblomov's Dream", which was later incorporated into the finished novel as Chapter 9. The novel caused much discussion in the Russian press, introduced another new term, oblomovshchina, to the literary lexicon and is regarded as a Russian classic.|$|E

2500|$|Rajneesh {{developed}} other active meditation techniques, {{such as the}} Kundalini [...] "shaking" [...] {{meditation and}} the Nadabrahma [...] "humming" [...] meditation, which are less animated, although they also include physical activity {{of one sort or}} another. His later [...] "meditative therapies" [...] require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent meditation. These processes of [...] "witnessing" [...] enable a [...] "jump into awareness". Rajneesh believed such cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> enter meditation. Once the methods had provided a glimpse of meditation people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.|$|E
60|$|But {{of course}} they wouldn't have a bar {{in a place like}} this. I'd like to go down and see, but I don't know that I'd care to ask, anyway. No, I guess I'll <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> wait. Some one will come for me, I guess, after a while.|$|E

We can tell each other the story of our lives." ...|$|E
50|$|Later, all of {{the women}} of the {{building}} have a get-together to welcome Lori while Karl spies on them from the air vents. He pushes a few buttons on a remote control device and a small door opens in the room and a rat comes out. The women scream and jump up on furniture, but Lori <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>and</b> laughs at it all.|$|R

No, you <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> have a good rest." ...|$|E

60|$|While Alvina sewed on the button, Madame {{spoke to}} her young men, principally to Max. They were to obey Max, she said, for he was their eldest brother. This {{afternoon}} they would practise well {{the scene of the}} White Prisoner. Very carefully they must practise, and they must find some one who would play the young squaw--for in this scene she had practically nothing to do, the young squaw, but <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> stand. Miss Houghton--but ah, Miss Houghton must play the piano, she could not take the part of the young squaw. Some other then.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you know}} what. But {{from this time}} forth I don't. It will be glorious not to let myself realize it. I shall <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> think up conundrums, and not hear, or see, or dream anything. Yes, I can do it, {{and it will be}} splendid practice. This is the way I shall look." [...] She took a pose in Cornelia's one chair, and put on an air of impenetrable mystery, which she relinquished a moment to explain, [...] "Of course this back is rather too stiff and straight; I shall be more crouching." [...] She pushed a ginger-snap between her lips, and chewed enigmatically upon it. [...] "See?" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{just the}} feeling of it,--everything under strict rule you know--no lights {{anywhere}} except just the electric lights,--smoking-room closed tight at eleven o'clock,--decks all washed down every night--officers up on the bridge all day {{looking out over the}} sea,--no, sir, I want no more of it. Poor old Loo Jones, I guess he's quite used up: he can't speak of it at all: <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>and</b> broods, in fact I doubt..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> still, <b>and</b> I 'll get {{you home}} in a jiffy;" [...] and before she could unpack herself, Tom trotted off with her at a fine pace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much!" [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "We {{are all on}} deck here, and all armed. You <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> still <b>and</b> suck {{your thumbs}} until the officers come," [...] he added, dryly.|$|R
60|$|So {{grateful}} Tommy {{gave her}} the picture, hoping that it would fill the void. But it did not. She {{put it on the}} mantelpiece so that she might <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> look at it, she said, and he grinned at it from every part of the room, but when he returned to her, he saw that she was neither looking at it nor thinking of it. She was looking straight before her, and sometimes her lips twitched, and then she drew them into her mouth to keep them still. It is a kind of dry weeping that sometimes comes to miserable ones when their minds stray into the happy past, and Tommy sat and watched her silently for a long time, never doubting that the cause of all her woe was that she could not write to Thrums.|$|E
6000|$|... 1 At {{least the}} above is the speech which I {{was going to}} make, but our [...] minister, General Schenck, presided, and after the blessing, got up [...] and made a great long inconceivably dull harangue, and wound up by [...] saying that inasmuch as speech-making {{did not seem to}} exhilarate the [...] guests much, all further oratory would be {{dispensed}} with during the [...] evening, and we could <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> talk privately to our [...] elbow-neighbors and have a good sociable time. It is known that in [...] consequence of that remark forty-four perfected speeches died in the [...] womb. The depression, the gloom, the solemnity that reigned over [...] the banquet from that time forth will be a lasting memory with many [...] that were there. By that one thoughtless remark General Schenck [...] lost forty-four of the best friends he had in England. More than [...] one said that night, [...] "And {{this is the sort of}} person that is sent to [...] represent us in a great sister empire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he does! He wouldn't {{have gone}} away and left us alone if he didn't. Stephen is very {{particular}} who he lets me 'sociate with. Why, even the rock people now--I had to promise I'd never let the Twin Sailors swear before he'd {{allow me to}} be friends with them. Sometimes I know by the look of the Oldest Twin that he's just dying to swear, but I never let him, because I promised Stephen. I'd do anything for Stephen. He's awful good to me. Stephen's bringing me up, you know, and he's bound to do it well. We're just perfectly happy here, only I wish I'd more books to read. We go fishing, and when we come home at night I help Stephen clean the fish and then we sit outside the door and he plays the violin for me. We sit there for hours sometimes. We never talk much--Stephen isn't much of a hand for talking--but we <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> think. There's not many men like Stephen, I can tell you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is no use,' exclaimed Thuggai, at last. 'The wood is too wet. We must <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> {{wait till}} the sun comes out again and dries it.' Then a very little fish indeed, not more than four inches long and the {{youngest}} of the tribe, bowed himself before Thuggai, saying, 'Ask my father, Guddhu the cod, to light the fire. He is skilled in magic more than most fishes.' So Thuggai asked him, and Guddhu stripped some pieces of bark off a tree, and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes. Then he knelt {{by the side of the}} fire and blew at it for a long while, till slowly the feeble red glow became a little stronger and the edges of the bark showed signs of curling up. When the rest of the tribe saw this they pressed close, keeping their backs towards the piercing wind, but Guddhu told them they must go to the other side, as he wanted the wind to fan his fire. By and by the spark grew into a flame, and a merry crackling was heard.|$|E
