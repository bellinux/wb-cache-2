40|$|A {{system for}} {{providing}} wireless, charging power and/or primary power <b>to</b> electronic/electrical <b>devices</b> is described whereby microwave energy is employed. Microwave energy is focused by a power transmitter comprising {{one or more}} adaptively-phased microwave array emitters onto a <b>device</b> <b>to</b> be charged. Rectennas within the <b>device</b> <b>to</b> be charged receive and rectify the microwave energy and use it for battery charging and/or for primary power. A locator signal generated by the <b>device</b> <b>to</b> be charged is analyzed by the system to determine {{the location of the}} <b>device</b> <b>to</b> be charged relative to the microwave array emitters, permitting thc microwave energy to be directly specifically towards the <b>device</b> <b>to</b> be charged. Backscatter detectors respond to backscatter energy reflected off of any obstacle between the <b>device</b> <b>to</b> be charged and the microwave array emitters. Power to any obstructed microwave array emitter is reduced until the obstruction is removed. Optionally, data can be modulated onto microwave energy beams produced by the array emitter and demodulated by the device, thereby providing means of data communication from the power transmitter <b>to</b> the <b>device.</b> Similarly, data can be modulated onto the locator signal and demodulated in the power transmitter, thereby providing means of data communication from the <b>device</b> <b>to</b> the power transmitter...|$|R
