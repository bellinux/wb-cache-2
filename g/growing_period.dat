5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the <b>growing</b> <b>period,</b> but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E

25|$|Early {{farming in}} Willow Bunch’s {{district}} saw high activity in grain production. In the early 1900s, oats {{were the most}} commonly grown (average of 21 yields), and wheat followed (eight yields). Wheat and oats remained popular during the 1920s, and barley emerged as another highly popular grain (producing more bushels than wheat during this period). The popularity and profitability of wheat fluctuated during the economic hardships of the 1930s, and began to stabilize during the 1940s. Although {{the early part of}} the decade (1942−1944) saw wheat yields reach tens of thousands of bushels harvested, the rate dropped by 12% in 1945 before marginally improving in 1946. Bushel yields increased and decreased throughout the 1940s before settling at 21,780 bushels (a 10-year high) in 1950. This decade marked a healthier <b>growing</b> <b>period</b> which (barring occasional bad years) produced 12,000-20,000 bushels every year. Towards the end of the 20th century, new grain types entered the market; durum and canola entered the market in the 1970s, while the 1980s saw the introduction of tame hay and a temporary disappearance of canola. Even through these crop changes, wheat varieties and oats produced consistently high yields.|$|E

Three levels of DL- methionine (50, 75 and 100 % of the level commonly used in commercial broiler diets) were added to the control (22 and 19. 4 % CP in the starting and <b>growing</b> <b>periods,</b> respectively) or a low protein diet (19. 1 and 16. 4 % CP in the starting and <b>growing</b> <b>periods,</b> respectively). For those broilers received the control diet, there was no significant effect of methionine level on body weight gain and FCR. For the broilers received the low protein diet, however, those fed the diet with the lowest methionine level had lower feed intake which brought about better FCR (P < 0. 05). Final body weight was not significantly affected by diet composition. Breast meat yield was improved by increasing methionine level (P< 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractLately {{grain legumes}} {{have come out}} of the shadows in {{research}} and extension because of their highly valued and multiple benefits for the farmer and the farming systems across the developing world. For semi-arid regions in particular, inadequate and highly variable rainfall and short <b>growing</b> <b>periods</b> limit yield potential and create a risky primary production environment. However, short-season crop varieties offer a promising option for farming with increased uncertainties. Against this background, the aim of this work was to collect field trial data for multiple seasons in Eastern Kenya to better calibrate the existing APSIM (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) legume models for short-season varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)., cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet) and to evaluate the performance of the adapted models in terms of biomass production and yield. Finally {{with the use of a}} simulation study, the impact of management options (e. g. sowing time, planting density) and future climate predictions on the overall production potential of the different short-season grain legumes was explored. Results indicate that decisions on optimal sowing times will become more important with shortened <b>growing</b> <b>periods</b> to take full advantage of in-season rainfall. Short-season cultivars of beans were advantageous in extreme short <b>growing</b> <b>periods</b> with external droughts due to their very short maturity time. Lablab seemed to cope best with high in season rainfall variability producing stable yields across a range of rainfall scenarios independent of future climate predictions. Cowpea instead was out yielding beans and lablab in wet years and had a very high biomass production. Consequently, using the full diversity of available short-season legumes can function as an essential part of a sustainable risk management strategy to design more resilient farming systems and increase food security in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. Finally, if well calibrated and tested, simulations models have proved to be an excellent tool for ex-ante assessment of agricultural management interventions in the view of future climate change...|$|R

About 200 to 300 acres of coffee bushes were planted at Magomero from 1895, but after poor crops in 1898 and 1899, the management looked for a more suitable crop. Following the collapse of coffee prices, the Shire Highlands estates next turned to cotton from 1903. Growing [...] Egyptian cotton in the Shire Highlands was at first unsuccessful: it was more suitable for the hotter Shire Valley. However, from 1906, W.J. Livingstone developed a hardier variety of Upland cotton called Nyasaland Upland, and by 1908 had planted 1,000 acres at Magomero, increased to 5,000 acres by 1914.

2500|$|Livingstone {{turned to}} cotton from 1903: growing [...] Egyptian cotton was {{unsuccessful}} {{as it was}} more suitable for hotter areas, but from 1906, he developed a hardier variety of Upland cotton called Nyasaland Upland, and in 1908 planted 1,000 acres at Magomero with it; this was increased to 5,000 acres by 1914. Cotton required intensive labour over a long <b>growing</b> <b>period,</b> and Livingstone ensured that 3,000 to 5,000 workers were available throughout its five or six month growing season by exploiting the obligations of the labour tenancy system called thangata. This word originally meant help, such as one neighbour might give another, but it came to mean the work that a tenant on a European-owned estate had to undertake in lieu of rent. Tenants were also required to undertake additional work {{on account of the}} Hut tax which the owner paid on behalf of tenants. Other men worked for wages: they were often unpaid, underpaid or given tobacco instead of cash, and violently coerced by the owners. Although William Jervis Livingstone pioneered the thangata system at Magomero from 1906, once Alexander Livingstone Bruce came to live in Nyasaland in 1908 and control of the estate operations, he instructed Livingstone, his manager, to exploit thangata rigorously to maximise the amount of cotton grown. The A L Bruce Estates increased the labour demand to four or five months a year, mainly in the rainy season, which was also the main growing season for both cotton and food crops, leaving tenants little time to grow their food. Single women tenants and widows were now also required to work.|$|E
