50|$|The {{next day}} Szpilman {{explored}} the hospital thoroughly.

When, again, he went searching for food and drink, Szpilman managed to find some crusts of bread and a fire bucket full of water. The stinking water was covered in an iridescent film, but Szpilman drank deeply, although he stopped after inadvertently swallowing a considerable amount of dead insects.|$|E
50|$|Irons entered {{postgraduate}} study in Vienna in 1909-1910.

50|$|Van Saren, a warlord in the {{neighboring}} camp of Mak Mun who had made a fortune selling rice that had been distributed by aid agencies, decided that Nong Chan represented a threat to his power, {{as the price of}} rice fell dramatically once the land bridge began operating.

Kong Sileah left the camp and moved with his soldiers into the interior of occupied Kampuchea, living in rustic conditions in the forest, a factor which may have contributed to his death from cerebral malaria on August 16, 1980. After this, Nong Chan came under the control of Chea Chhut, a warlord with fewer scruples than Kong Sileah.|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} a Burger King outlet in the foyer of the {{hospital}} since 1997. In November 2014 the Trust announced {{that they would not}} be renewing its lease due to expire in 2016 - because it no longer fits with the “healthcare environment” it is trying to create in its main reception area. Hampshire GP Dr Hilary Jones approved and said that in the grip of an obesity problem in the UK, hospitals should be setting a good example to patients. However some patient started a petition against this decision on the basis that <b>hospital</b> <b>food</b> was [...] "of a poor standard. Burger King seems to have a much higher quality of food that's cooked fresh and to order.” A hospital spokesman responded: [...] "The trust, as with all NHS hospitals, is regularly assessed by a variety of independent bodies on all aspects of care, including the quality of patient food. In the most recent of these inspections, the trust scored highly on food quality (92%) according to panel members from the national patient-led assessment team and fully compliant with all of the Care Quality Commission's essential standards, which incorporate quality of food and drink." [...] The fast food outlet will be replaced by a Marks & Spencer shop and cafe and a Subway franchise as part of a £2.5m redevelopment scheduled to begin in mid-2015.|$|E
5000|$|... "In this pale British {{imitation}} ERyou {{can almost}} smell {{the stench of}} <b>hospital</b> <b>food</b> and disinfectant. Like an NHS training film, the camera spins round, ER- style - and lo, frames a shot which cuts {{off one of the}} lead actor's noses. The medicine is way too graphic, showing full-screen open-heart surgery; the characters are too unsympathetic, with not a heartthrob alive or dead in sight; and the story lines are so drawn out and laborious that on the medical drama scale, Holby City is a flatliner." [...] —The Sunday Herald, contrasting Holby City with ER. The series received mixed reviews from critics. Graham Keal of the Birmingham Post wrote of the first episode: [...] "Heretical as it might seem, I liked Holby City more than Casualty, not least because the formula is so much more flexible and unpredictable." [...] Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail praised the series for breaking away from the [...] "dreary sameness" [...] of Casualty, and for presenting [...] "a less hopeless view of the NHS." [...] His only concern about the series was its continuation of patient storylines from Casualty, writing: [...] "if that happens too often, the new programme will soon lose its freshness and sparkle." [...] The Mirror Charlie Catchpole wrote that he was [...] "sick of the sensitive, hand-wringing, non-judgmental do-gooders who mope around the A&E department in Casualty", praising in comparison the [...] "pushy, ambitious, cynical and generally thoroughly unpleasant surgeons" [...] in Holby City.|$|E

50|$|While {{biocides}} {{can have}} severe effects {{on human health}} and/or the environment, their benefits should not be overlooked. To provide some examples, without the above-mentioned rodenticides, crops and food stocks might be seriously affected by rodent activity, or diseases like Leptospirosis might be spread more easily, since rodents can be a vector for diseases. It {{is difficult to imagine}} <b>hospitals,</b> <b>food</b> industry premises without using disinfectants or using untreated wood for telephone poles. Another example of benefit is the fuel saving of antifouling substances applied to ships to prevent the buildup of biofilm and subsequent fouling organisms on the hulls which increase the drag during navigation.|$|R
