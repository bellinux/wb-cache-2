[...] With capital stock of $200,000, the company soon began construction of a five story brewery located in Sharpsburg, PA. Fort Pitt Brewery opened for business in early 1908 with an annual capacity of 75,000 barrels. Fort Pitt Beer’s distribution network along with other brands, were established throughout Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland. Prohibition in 1920 caused the vast majority of breweries to close. Fort Pitt Brewing Company, however, remained successfully in business by selling a wide variety of non-alcoholic serial beverages in 27 states from Massachusetts to California.After the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 which led to the repeal of prohibition laws, Fort Pitt soon brought alcoholic beer back to Pittsburgh. Management initially found that the brewing industry had changed significantly since 1920 based upon many technological advances in the brewing process. [...] However, the economics of selling beer had also drastically changed {{especially in light of the}} fact that Fort Pitt was able to thrive on pre-prohibition saloon sales which were 60% of <b>draft</b> beer in <b>bars.</b> [...] As a result of the introduction of steel cans into the market, a growing portion of Fort Pitt sales had increased. [...] Fort Pitt played an increasingly larger role through point of sales signs in bars, supermarkets and liquor stores, outer billboards, newspapers, and eventually commercials on radio and television. In fact, the 1935 US Open Golf Championship held at Pittsburgh’s Oakmont Country Club, Fort Pitt printed the admission cards including its logo on each ticket.|$|R
