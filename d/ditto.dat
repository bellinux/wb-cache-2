Nikhat Kazmi rated the film 3.5 out of 5, describing it as [...] " [...] a sensitive parable on bonding and empowerment". Taran Adarsh rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praised the cinematography, screenplay, dialogue, costumes and styling, and called Fashion a [...] "hard-hitting film that enlightens you, moves you, motivates and deflates you, even shocks and surprises you and of course, entertains you". Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest. Like the director’s own film Page 3 it is mostly sensational and on several occasions compromises authenticity {{for the sake of}} exaggerated drama". He praised the performances of the lead cast, writing that [...] "Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best. The truth is, it’s one of those by-the-book characters that she understands only too well and performs just as easily. <b>Ditto</b> for Kangana Ranaut who plays the eccentric superdiva with such a practiced hand, it almost seems like an effortless delivery. It's...Godse who invests such sincerity into her role, that she makes the character a real flesh and blood person.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a [...] "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided [...] "a {{lot of fun}} moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Bart and Lisa’s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's [...] "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but {{soon it will be}} hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes. Homer comes over as a reasonable man who wants to live his last day in style, and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is [...] "rich with sentimentality and Homer's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up." [...] He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are [...] "funny", this episode [...] "features a true gem" [...] as Bart writes [...] "I will not cut corners" [...] once and then puts <b>ditto</b> marks below. Ed Potton of The Times wrote: [...] "The writers offer black humour by the bucketload, but the grim reality of Homer's fate is never in doubt; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting. A great example of [...] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said {{the first half of the}} episode has [...] "fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such, while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy." ...|$|E
