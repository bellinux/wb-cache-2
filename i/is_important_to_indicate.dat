5000|$|The {{indication}} of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps {{after a long}} period of rests), is called [...] "cueing". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful {{in the case of a}} pedal point with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by [...] "engaging" [...] the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible [...] "sniff" [...] from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.|$|E

[...] "Anglo-Saxons" [...] or [...] "Britons" [...] were no more homogeneous than nationalities are today, and they would have exhibited diverse characteristics: male/female, old/young, rich/poor, farmer/warrior—or even Gildas' patria (fellow citizens), cives (indigenous people) and hostes (enemies)—as well as a diversity associated with language.

In the Gulf of Mexico the seepage phenomena are common and have been responsible for the discoveries of important oil fields in recent decades, most of them assisted by remote sensing techniques. This project aims to evaluate methods for the detection and classification of oil slicks that were produced by marine seeps, through the utilization of multispectral images of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer sensor (ASTER). Several tests have been conducted as part of this research to achieve this purpose. Using the data related to the acquisition geometry of ASTER images was possible to predict the appearance of the oil. The test of three supervised classification algorithms demonstrated the possibility to detect oil slicks on the ocean surface. Moreover, a predictive model was made based on spectral features from laboratory and ASTER images to estimate the API gravity values from oil seeps in the ASTER images. The results obtained using remote sensing was similar to those recorded nearby the oil fields in this region of the Gulf of Mexico. Pages: 1509 - 151...|$|R

Observou-se que, dentre os 8 grupos de sinais e sintomas da CID- 10 para esquizofrenia, 7 grupos tiveram correlações com variáveis distintas do Rorschach. Tais dados sugerem que, embora exista uma relação entre as variáveis dos dois instrumentos, estas variáveis não se sobrepõem substancialmente.

The 2003 blackout occurred in N.E. North America is partly because of the lack of supportive applications when the system is close to instability [3].

To do so, domain knowledge is represented through a probabilistic ontology using crALC [...]. Among the concepts (N_C) and roles (N_R) in the ontology, there is a concept Ĉ that indicates which elements of the domain are nodes in G, and a role r̂ that indicates which pairs of elements are linked—hence Ĉ and r̂ describe the network itself, while other concepts and roles describe the remaining domain knowledge.

An incorrect diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency could therefore be made. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe {{the case of}} a 52 -year-old female with nephrotic syndrome that did not sufficiently respond to medication. Treatment management was complicated by symptomatic hypotension, which was thought to be caused by adrenal insufficiency. The cortisol levels in the blood were low and a clinical cause could not be identified. However, free cortisol in the saliva appeared normal and serum CBG levels were low; this therefore precluded adrenal insufficiency. After complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome, cortisol levels normalised.
