5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent <b>gapping.</b> Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E

40|$|The driver <b>gap</b> {{acceptance}} and rejection behavior during mandatory lane changes on a multilane freeway are analyzed in this paper. <b>Gaps</b> are accepted or rejected based on comparison {{with a minimum}} value generally defined as the critical <b>gaps.</b> Critical <b>gaps</b> are estimated based on the accepted and rejected <b>gaps</b> observed in the field. Driver behavior can be classified as consistent or inconsistent {{on the basis of}} <b>gap</b> rejection. For consistent driver behavior, it is assumed that the rejected <b>gaps</b> are shorter than the accepted <b>gaps.</b> This paper focuses on the estimation of critical <b>gaps</b> values and its distribution for consistent driver behavior. Critical <b>gap,</b> for consistent driver behavior is defined as the minimum value of <b>gap</b> above which the lane changer does not reject a <b>gap</b> to execute a lane change. Several <b>gaps</b> may be rejected prior to a <b>gap</b> being accepted, therefore, different types of rejected <b>gaps</b> can be utilized to estimate critical <b>gaps.</b> To systematically evaluate rejected <b>gaps</b> and propose the most suitable rejected <b>gaps</b> for use in estimating the critical <b>gaps,</b> rejected <b>gaps</b> were analyzed using the mean rejected, median rejected, and the largest rejected <b>gaps</b> less than the accepted <b>gaps</b> (LRLA).

2500|$|<b>Gap</b> penalty designates {{scores for}} {{insertion}} or deletion.

2500|$|In non-verb-final {{languages}}, {{apart from}} languages like Thai and Vietnamese with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to {{be restricted to}} positions {{high up in the}} accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that all roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. [...] "I saw the man who is my friend", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the accessibility hierarchy described below) [...] "...who I know", [...] "...who I gave a book to", [...] "...who I spoke with", [...] "...who I run slower than". Usually, languages with <b>gapping</b> disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [...] Classical Arabic, for example, only allows <b>gapping</b> in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point—e.g. in many Austronesian languages, such as Tagalog, all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving [...] "disallowed" [...] roles can be expressed by passivizing the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform [...] "The man who I gave a book to" [...] into [...] "The man who was given a book by me". Generally, languages such as this [...] "conspire" [...] to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from all positions — hence a sentence equivalent to [...] "The man who is run slower than by me" [...] is grammatical. Note also that <b>gapping</b> is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using <b>gapping</b> in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).|$|E
5000|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that there have been some findings suggesting the possibility of crosstalk between <b>GAPs.</b> A recent study showed that the p120Ras <b>GAP</b> could bind the DLC1 Rho <b>GAP</b> at its catalytic domain. The binding of the Ras <b>GAP</b> to the Rho <b>GAP</b> inhibits the activity of the Rho <b>GAP,</b> thereby activating the Rho G protein. [...] One <b>GAP</b> serves as a negative regulator of another <b>GAP.</b> The reasons for such cross-regulation across <b>GAPs</b> are yet unclear, but one possible hypothesis is that this cross-talk across <b>GAPs</b> attenuates the [...] "off" [...] signal of all the <b>GAPs.</b> Although the p120Ras <b>GAP</b> is active, therefore inhibiting that particular pathway, other cellular processes can still continue because it inhibits other <b>GAPs.</b> This may ensure that the whole system does not shut down from a single off signal. <b>GAP</b> activity is highly dynamic, interacting with many other components of signaling pathways.|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} used <b>gap</b> penalty {{function}} is the affine <b>gap</b> penalty. The affine <b>gap</b> penalty combines the components in both the constant and linear <b>gap</b> penalty, taking the form A+(B⋅L). This introduces new terms, A {{is known as the}} <b>gap</b> opening penalty, B the <b>gap</b> extension penalty and L the length of the <b>gap.</b> <b>Gap</b> opening refers to the cost required to open a <b>gap</b> of any length, and <b>gap</b> extension the cost to extend the length of an existing <b>gap</b> by 1. Often it is unclear as to what the values A and B should be as it differs according to purpose. In general, if the interest is to find closely related matches (e.g. removal of vector sequence during genome sequencing), a higher <b>gap</b> penalty should be used to reduce <b>gap</b> openings. On the other hand, <b>gap</b> penalty should be lowered when interested in finding a more distant match. The relationship between A and B also have an effect on <b>gap</b> size. If the size of the <b>gap</b> was important, a small A and large B (more costly to extend <b>gap)</b> is used and vice versa.|$|R

2500|$|Use of a {{relative}} pronoun. Prototypically, {{a relative}} pronoun {{agrees with the}} head noun in gender, number, definiteness, animacy, etc., but adopts {{the case that the}} shared noun assumes in the embedded, not matrix, clause. This is the case in a number of conservative European languages, such as Latin, German and Russian. Many languages also have similar linking words common termed [...] "relative pronouns" [...] that agree in some way with the head noun, but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause. In English, for example, the use of who vs. which agrees with the animacy of the head noun, but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast who vs. whom (which is often used incorrectly, if at all, in speech). Similarly, in Classical Arabic, there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number, gender, definiteness and case with the head noun (rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause). Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the <b>gapping</b> strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause, since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case. (Classical Arabic, where the case marking indicates something else, uses a resumptive pronoun.) Some linguists prefer to use the term relative pronoun only for the prototypical cases (but in this case it's unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases).|$|E
