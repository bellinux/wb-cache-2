25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E
500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, {{but it was always}} to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted to really make sure that we weren’t doing things, like, just to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to be doing something constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E

500|$|Turner {{was born}} in Simi Valley, California to parents John and Grace Turner. His father was the {{original}} drummer of the glam metal band Ratt. Chris Turner attended high school at the Chaminade College Preparatory School, {{where he was a}} three-year letterwinner and starting quarterback in football and pitcher in baseball. As a sophomore, he was on the junior varsity football team until midseason when the varsity quarterback suffered an injury against Valencia High School, a regional powerhouse. Turner described the incident as the last time that he was nervous during a game and said, [...] "It <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> ugly to be honest. Ever since then, I've always thought to myself, 'It can't get worse than that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} trips abroad, Elgar visited Paris in 1880 and Leipzig in 1882. He heard Saint-Saëns play the organ at the Madeleine and {{attended}} concerts by first-rate orchestras. In 1882 he wrote, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> well dosed with Schumann (my ideal!), Brahms, Rubinstein & Wagner, so had no cause to complain." [...] In Leipzig he visited a friend, Helen Weaver, {{who was a}} student at the Conservatoire. They became engaged in the summer of 1883, but for unknown reasons the engagement was broken off the next year. Elgar was greatly distressed, and some of his later cryptic dedications of romantic music may have alluded to Helen and his feelings for her. Throughout his life, Elgar was often inspired by close women friends; Helen Weaver was succeeded by Mary Lygon, Dora Penny, Julia Worthington, Alice Stuart Wortley and finally Vera Hockman, who enlivened his old age.|$|E
500|$|McCreary {{introduced}} a new Hydra theme for the season, explaining that [...] "Last season <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> musically complicated. I had a theme that associated itself with Centipede, The Clairvoyant, John Garrett and Raina. That theme ultimately functioned like a Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Victoria Hand that, while the audience briefly suspected her, also functioned as the Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra. It got so complicated ... The answer was obvious: I needed to write a new Hydra Theme, one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall." [...] For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter short film. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference." [...] A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons was released by Marvel Music digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.|$|E

[...] However, he put an end to his association with the 2006 Liberal Party leadership race, explaining {{that he did not want}} [...] "his life to become consumed by politics."

2500|$|Much of Lowry's {{early years}} were {{spent in the}} leafy Manchester suburb of Victoria Park, Rusholme, but in 1909, when he was 22, due to {{financial}} pressures, {{the family moved to}} 117 Station Road in the industrial town of Pendlebury. Here the landscape comprised textile mills and factory chimneys rather than trees. Lowry later recalled: [...] "At first I detested it, and then, after years I <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> interested in it, then obsessed by it... One day I missed a train from Pendlebury – [...] I had ignored for seven years– and as I left the station I saw the Acme Spinning Company's mill... The huge black framework of rows of yellow-lit windows standing up against the sad, damp charged afternoon sky. The mill was turning out... I watched this scene— which I'd looked at many times without seeing— with rapture..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Foster {{graduated}} from Nordonia High School {{in the suburbs}} of Cleveland, Ohio. At his father's encouragement, Foster moved in with his uncle in Sylmar, Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in music. Foster worked various jobs and at night, he attended parties in Hollywood to expand his social network. He said, [...] "I felt like an 18-year-old Hunter S. Thompson. I was just diving into this Hollywood Hills subculture and taking it all in. I wasn't shy about taking my guitar out at a party. I wanted {{to be the center of}} attention." [...] At one time, he roomed with actor Brad Renfro. Foster struggled with drug addiction during his initial years in Los Angeles, saying, [...] "It <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> dark. My friends thought I was going to die. I was blind to it. When I was 19 years old, it got to a point where I said, 'Enough is enough' ... I saw time was just passing me by. I wasn't being productive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, French actress Élodie Yung {{was cast}} as Jinx for the 2013 film [...] Jinx was {{featured}} in the first promotional pictures and trailer, shown sparring against Snake Eyes while clad in red and blindfolded, and fighting together with him against the Red Ninjas while wearing a yellow suit. Yung, who already owned a black belt in karate, prepared {{for about a month}} for the role, focusing on her cardio [...] "because of how demanding it all was", and training in the Chinese martial art wushu for dual sword fighting. The cliff battle scene required two months of green screen work to be done. Yung also said: [...] "I was wearing a yellow costume that <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> hot. It looks sexy, but I needed five people to get into that suit." [...] According to MTV, [...] "the totally silent mountainside battle between Snake Eyes, Jinx and a squad of Cobra ninjas mirrors the similarly silent comic book issue in the original Marvel series, which depicts Snake Eyes rescuing Scarlett from a Cobra castle in the Balkans." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Ravager ship the Eclector was handled by Weta Digital. Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for David Hasselhoff for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We tried morphing to a live action Hoff – {{but it did not}} hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version,..and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double,- we didn't {{want to go to the}} same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly to the body… so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we <b>got</b> <b>pretty</b> close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt." [...] Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the fractal art of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment. Gunn added that there are [...] "over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it." ...|$|E
