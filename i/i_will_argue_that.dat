50|$|In this essay, I {{present and}} discuss two films which are {{representative}} of popular cinema in that they foreground how otherwise invisible, occult forces impinge on the visible world. I will show how a quintessentially modern medium like film, which has been used ever since colonial times to educate and enlighten people through images, has been appropriated in order to express people’s concerns about the hidden presence of the occult in modern urban society. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the visualization of the dark, secret aspects lurking behind the surface of modern city life concerns an “enlightenment” in another sense than usually intended by modernist protagonists. In so doing, I find it useful to follow a distinction proposed by Michael Taussig during the conference on which this volume is based between revelation and exposure. While the notion of exposure {{is part of a}} hierarchical perspective affirming the superiority of scientific thinking which unmasks magic as false and based on mere superstition, the notion of revelation criticises magic from within, thereby leaving intact the idiom itself. I will show that, contrary to the elites’ expectations of the medium of film to promote superior forms of knowledge and behaviour leading beyond magic, watching popular movies does not make people go beyond magical imagination towards increased levels of rationality, but rather constitutes, or at least confirms, the domain of the occult at the very moment of its revelation. It brings light into the dark and, at the same time, contributes to establish the domain of occult forces as part and parcel of modern city life (cf. Geschiere 1997). I argue that, in so doing, it brings about a break with colonial cinema and realizes the magical potential of movies which is so often ascribed to this art form in the West.|$|E

40|$|Many {{who take}} a dismissive {{attitude}} towards metaphysics trace their view back to Carnap’s ‘Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology’ (1950 a).

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that,</b> {{international}} criminal law constitutes a valid legal system.

Specifically, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a ‘rule of recognition’ can be drawn from a variation of the legal norm pacta sunt servanda, and this serves to validate the system as a whole.

40|$|There are broadly {{speaking}} two varieties of views regarding {{the nature of}} coincident entities such as statues and the pieces of matter which constitute them. According to Monists, (some) coincident entities are identical while according to pluralists coincident entities are always distinct. The aim of this thesis is to defend the view that many cases of coincidence, including cases of temporary coincidence, are instances of identity. First, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> pluralism ought to be rejected because it faces serious philosophical challenges monism avoids. Next, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> monism can adequately resist the three most common Leibniz law arguments levied against the plausibility that (some) coincident objects are identical. Specifically <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the best monist response to the modal Leibniz law is to adopt a counterpart theoretic account of de re modality to justify the claim that modal contexts are referentially opaque. Next, I will show how monists can resist the linguistic version of LLA by either denying the truth (or falsity) {{of one of the}} relevant premises, or by denying the validity of the argument in question. Finally <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the best monist response to the temporal version of LLA is to adopt a stage theoretic account of persistence which can offer a unified account of what Michael Rea has called the “the problems of material constitution. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of agency and intentionality {{in the context of the}} free-energy principle. The free-energy principle is a system-theoretic framework for understanding living self-organizing systems and how they relate to their environments. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> first sketch the main philosophical positions in the literature: a rationalist Helmholtzian interpretation (Hohwy 2013; Clark 2013), a cybernetic interpretation (Seth 2015 b) and the enactive affordance-based interpretation (Bruineberg and Rietveld 2014; Bruineberg et al. 2016) and will then show how agency and intentionality are construed differently on these different philosophical interpretations. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> then <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a purely Helmholtzian is limited, in that it can account only account for agency in the context of perceptual inference. The cybernetic account cannot give a full account of action, since purposiveness is accounted for only to the extent that it pertains to the control of homeostatic essential variables. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> then <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the enactive affordance-based account attempts to provide broader account of purposive action without presupposing goals and intentions coming from outside of the theory. In the second part of the paper, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> discuss how each of these three interpretations conceives of the sense agency and intentionality in different ways...|$|R
