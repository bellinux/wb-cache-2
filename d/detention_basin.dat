25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} stop gates, are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set spillway crest heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known as crest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass or <b>detention</b> <b>basin</b> when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|E
2500|$|King County built a {{stormwater}} {{control system}} in Boeing Creek Park. A large <b>detention</b> <b>basin</b> stores water during storms, reducing the creek's flood risk. The <b>detention</b> <b>basin</b> is augmented by an underground storage pipe designed to temporarily store up to 500,000 gallons of wastewater during large storms. This storage pipe is located under the <b>detention</b> <b>basin</b> in Boeing Creek Park. The pipe is [...] {{in diameter and}} about [...] long. Completed in 2007 by King County Public Works, the pipe's purpose is to help keep wastewater within the sewer system and reduce overflows into Puget Sound. The pipe conveys wastewater to the Hidden Lake Pump Station. At {{the same time the}} Hidden Lake Pump Station, located on Hidden Lake, was replaced in order to increase capacity. The old pump station lacked capacity, resulting in about three overflows into Puget Sound per year. Another related wastewater projet is the [...] Boeing Creek Trunk Sewer Replacement. A major wastewater conveyance pipe, the Boeing Creek Trunk (BCT) was under capacity and had deteriorated with age. During heavy rain storms wastewater sometimes overflowed from manholes and into Puget Sound. These projects were all part of the Hidden Lake Pump Station replacement and sewer improvement project. Construction of this overall project began in 2006. The underground storage pipe in Boeing Creek Park was finished in 2007, Boeing Creek Trunk in 2008, and the Hidden Lake Pump Station in 2009. All of these wastewater systems are located very close to Boeing Creek, although the Boeing Creek Trunk extends north out of the creek's watershed. The City of Shoreline is planning additional stormwater management projects to reduce flooding and improve Boeing Creek's hydrology. Construction of the Pan Terra Pond and Pump Improvement Project began in 2009.|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{project is}} {{the second phase of}} a program to retrofit as many public dry <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> as possible. Through this project, the Village of Glenview seeks to improve water quality, enhance wildlife habitat, and increase biodiversity and public appreciation of naturalized <b>detention</b> <b>basins,</b> and ultimately the West Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River (West Fork). The project will utilize best management practices to increase stormwater residence time and introduce native plantings to areas that are currently vegetated with turf grass. The program was developed as a priority of the Village’s Natural Resources Plan, supported by consultant reports advising that current dry <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> exhibit short-circuiting and low plant diversity, resulting in less efficient pollutant reduction and stormwater management than could be achieved with wetland basins providing habitat for native plants and animals. Specifically, through retrofitting nearly two acres of dry <b>detention</b> <b>basins,</b> this phase of the project will improve the West Fork’s water quality by protecting it from polluted runoff, more effectively control runoff from small frequent storms, replenish groundwater, and provide habitat enhancement and opportunities for public education.

5000|$|A <b>detention</b> <b>basin</b> or {{retarding}} basin is an excavated area installed on, or adjacent to, tributaries of rivers, streams, lakes or bays {{to protect}} against flooding and, in some cases, downstream erosion by storing water for a limited period of time. These basins are also called [...] "dry ponds", [...] "holding ponds" [...] or [...] "dry detention basins" [...] if no permanent pool of water exists. Some detention ponds are also [...] "wet ponds" [...] {{in that they are}} designed to permanently retain some volume of water at all times.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that urban development alters infiltration capacity and enhances its spatial variability, but also constrains watercourses into narrow channels making them unable {{to contain the}} runoff that is generated by relatively small, but intense, rainfall events. Network of <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> are designed to reduce the flood peak by temporarily storing the excess storm water and then releasing the water volume at allowable rates over an extended period. This paper shows {{the use of a}} distributed hydrological model for the assessment of effectiveness of a network of detention facilities in a heavily urbanized river basin. The distributed hydrological model FEST was used to assess design hydrograph and, in parallel to design the seven <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> optimized for the specific purpose of maintaining the flow rate within the range of the maximum allowable discharge. This permitted to estimate the design hydrograph considering both the spatial variability of soil infiltration capacity and routing characteristics induced by each <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> along the main river. Results indicate that on-stream detention ponds can increase duration of the critical event and runoff volume of design flood with possible negative implications on downstream facilities...|$|R

50|$|<b>Detention</b> <b>basins</b> are {{storm water}} best {{management}} practices that provide general flood protection and can also control extreme floods such as a 1 in 100-year storm event.

50|$|Flood control {{programs}} {{as early as}} {{the first half of the}} twentieth century became quantitative in predicting peak flows of riverine systems. Progressively strategies have been developed to minimize peak flows and also to reduce channel velocities.

The two thousand <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> along the Danish main road network act as delaying basins for sudden large amounts of water and also collect substances which are injorious to the environment, before the water is led to lakes and streams. The Danish Road Directorate has examined the content of substances injorious to the environment in the sediment of 70 basins distributed in the whole country. Analysis of hydrocarbons, PAH, heavy metals and NaCl have been made. The analysis are {{used to determine the}} degree of pollution of the sediment in relation to the criteria set out by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency. The results show that at least 90 per cent of the <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> have sediment which is defined as slightly polluted and at least 61 has sediment which is polluted. These high values are due to the content of hydrocarbons. The second largest source of pollution is nickel and the concentrations show that 20 per cent of the basins have sediment which is polluted by nickel. The highest concentrations of substances injorious to the environment are around Copenhagen and Odense and on the stretch between Kolding and Randers. The content of PAH and heavy metals has been compared to analysis from 38 natural Danish lakes. The analyses shows that there is no marked difference between the measured levels of pollution in <b>detention</b> <b>basins</b> and natural lakes. Hydrocarbons have been compared to two natural lakes and here the difference is very considerable...|$|R
