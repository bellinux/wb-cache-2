5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to <b>encroach</b> on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K to authorise the modernisation works—to head off some of the encroachment.|$|E
5|$|As Toronto's suburbs {{began to}} <b>encroach</b> on the family's {{property}} in the late-1800s, Jesse's wife, Elizabeth, began subdividing the lot in 1893. A second storey in Second Empire style {{was added to the}} home in 1900, with a mansard roof, while maintaining the original veranda. The house was built to the east of the old frame home, which was demolished in 1913. Elizabeth continued to live in the home until her death in 1918.|$|E
40|$|Bush {{encroachment}} is {{the conversion}} of open savannas to tree-dominated shrub lands. Bush encroachment results in habitat degradation {{and the loss of}} resource productivity. In this study, small mammals were used to investigate the effects of bush encroachment on biodiversity. The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of bush encroachment on the species abundance, diversity and composition of small mammals. The study was conducted in selected bush <b>encroached</b> and non-bush <b>encroached</b> sites at the Neudamm Agricultural Farm in the Khomas Region, during the “Hot-dry ” season, “Hot-wet ” season (April 2010) and “Cold-dry ” season (July 2010). Various habitat factors, namely: woody density, woody cover and grass cover, all of which influence the diversity, distribution and abundance of small mammals were measured in the bush <b>encroached</b> and non-bush <b>encroached</b> sites. An area was considered to be bush <b>encroached</b> when the woody density of the <b>encroaching</b> species was> 1, 000 bushes per 1 ha. Non-bush <b>encroached</b> sites were areas with a woody density of < 1, 000 bushes per 1 ha. The results revealed a significant difference in the woody density (t 49 = 5. 77; n = 50, p < 0. 001), woody cover (H 7 = 15. 27, n = 8, p <...|$|R

5|$|Utah {{and western}} Colorado were {{deformed}} as {{the rate of}} subduction off the west coast increased in the Middle Jurassic Sevier Orogeny. At the same time, an inland sea began to <b>encroach</b> on the continent from the north. Broad tidal flats and streams carrying iron oxide-rich mud formed {{on the margins of}} the shallow sea to the west, creating the Sinawava member of the Temple Cap Formation. Flat-bedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones filled depressions left in the underlying eroded strata. Streams eroded the poorly cemented Navajo Sandstone, and water caused the sand to slump.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opposite}} {{each other}} across the River Thames, Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge to the west and Battersea Bridge to the east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population grew and London's built-up area began to <b>encroach</b> during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.|$|E
5|$|Before Spanish {{colonization}} in the 1770s, the San Juan Creek watershed was {{inhabited by}} the Acjachemen or Juañeno Native Americans. The Juañeno were named by Spanish missionaries who built Mission San Juan Capistrano {{on the banks}} of a stream they named San Juan Creek. The watershed was used mainly for agriculture and ranching until the 1950s when residential suburban development began on a large scale. Since then, the human population has continued to <b>encroach</b> on floodplains of local streams. Flooding in the 20th and 21st centuries has caused considerable property damage in the San Juan watershed.|$|E

5|$|Fragile Allegiance is an {{open-ended}} 4X real-time strategy (RTS) game from Gremlin Interactive, released in 1996 for MS-DOS and Windows 95. The game begins on May 25, 2496 as the player begins their employment with TetraCorp (a large interstellar megacorporation) who {{have set up}} a new asteroid mining franchise operation in the Fragmented Sectors. There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources. Beginning with one building and one million credits, the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation to sell as much ore as possible to the Federation. Diplomacy is crucial to {{the success or failure of}} this franchise operation as the players colonies begin to <b>encroach</b> on one another.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if the castle and town played any {{part in the}} English Civil War between 1642–45, {{although}} cannonballs from the period have been discovered within the castle. Local oral tradition states that the castle was slighted, or deliberately destroyed, during the war. Stones from the castle were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle, along with a yard and garden. A gallows operated at the castle until 1790. Buildings continued to <b>encroach</b> on the castle. By {{the end of the}} 19th century a school and a house, Castle Lodge, had been built in the castle grounds. Other buildings were built as lean-to's against the castle walls.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Somairle's {{descendants}} in the decades following his demise. Dubgall does not appear on record until 1175, when he is attested far from the Isles in Durham, by the Durham Cathedral's Liber Vitae. Nothing is certain of Dubgall's later activities, {{and it is possible}} that, by the 1180s, Ragnall had begun to <b>encroach</b> upon Dubgall's territories and his position as head of the meic Somairle. The fact that Dubgall is not accorded any title by the Liber Vitae could be evidence that Ragnall had displaced him upon Somairle's demise, or that the chronicle's account of Dubgall's connection with the kingship is merely the work of thirteenth-century bias favouring the powerful meic Dubgaill, Dubgaill's descendants.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Intensive land use {{has led to}} {{degradation}} and abandonment of Portuguese oak woodlands, and subsequent shrub encroachment may have altered the spatial heterogeneity of soil C and N pools. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of shrub invasion on soil C and N dynamics in an oak woodland in Southern Portugal. Methods Soil was sampled beneath and outside scattered Quercus suber L. canopies, considering non <b>encroached</b> areas and areas <b>encroached</b> by shrubs (Cistus ladanifer L. or Cistus salviifolius L.). Results The spatial heterogeneity of soil C and N contents was mainly associated with tree presence. Outside tree canopies, the labile C pools were larger (mainly beneath C. ladanifer) and C cycling was faster in <b>encroached</b> areas than in non <b>encroached</b> areas. Net and gross N mineralization and urease and protease activities were also higher in <b>encroached</b> than in non <b>encroached</b> areas; however, the metabolic quotient and the Cmicrobial/Corganic ratio were not significantly affected. Beneath the tree canopy, significant effects of encroachment included a small increase in soil labile C and the enzymatic activity beneath C. ladanifer. Conclusions The results indicate the potential capacity of shrub encroachment to accumulate soil organic C in the long term. The rate of soil C and N turnover promoted by shrub encroachment may depend on the Cistus species present...|$|R

5|$|Macedon {{began to}} <b>encroach</b> on {{territory}} claimed by several other Greek city states in 200 BC and these pleaded {{for help from}} their newfound ally Rome. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he must submit Macedonia to being essentially a Roman province. Philip, unsurprisingly, refused and, after initial internal reluctance for further hostilities, Rome declared war against Philip in the Second Macedonian War. In the Battle of the Aous Roman forces under Titus Quinctius Flamininus defeated the Macedonians, and in a second larger battle under the same opposing commanders in 197 BC, in the Battle of Cynoscephalae, Flamininus again beat the Macedonians decisively. Macedonia was forced to sign the Treaty of Tempea, in which it lost all claim to territory in Greece and Asia, and had to pay a war indemnity to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches <b>encroach</b> further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} in the secluded south-west corner of the Palace of Westminster, overlooking the King's garden in the Privy Palace, the most private part of Westminster. The tower was positioned {{so as not to}} <b>encroach</b> on the existing palace, but this meant it was built on top of land owned by the neighbouring Westminster Abbey. It took six years for the Abbey to convince the King to agree to compensate for them for this annexation. William Usshborne, one of Edward's officials, was blamed for this and, when he later choked to death while eating a fish from a pond in the palace, the monks argued that this was divine justice {{for his role in the}} affair.|$|E

5|$|Crompton's damp climate {{provided}} the ideal conditions for cotton spinning {{to be carried}} out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. When suitable land in nearby Oldham (then the largest and most productive mill town in the world) had become scarce in the 1860s, there was a mill building boom in Shaw and Crompton, giving rise to the area as major mill town. The local townscape became dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills, and its former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a single town around these factories. Shaw and Crompton railway station and a goods yard was opened in 1863, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Royton had begun to <b>encroach</b> upon the township's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district with Oldham, Lees and Chadderton—the Oldham parliamentary constituency—which was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Khwarezemids under Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu {{captured}} {{the town of}} Khilat from al-Ashraf, while the normally loyalist Rasulids began to <b>encroach</b> on Ayyubid territorial holdings in Arabia. In 1222 the Ayyubids appointed the Rasulid leader Ali Bin Rasul as governor of Mecca. Ayyubid rule in Yemen and the Hejaz was declining and the Ayyubid governor of Yemen, Mas'ud bin Kamil, {{was forced to leave}} for Egypt in 1223. He appointed Nur ad-Din Umar as his deputy governor while he was absent. In 1224 the local al-Yamani dynasty gained control of Hadramaut from the Ayyubids who had held it loosely due to the troubled situation of their administration in Yemen proper. Following Mas'ud bin Kamil's death in 1229, Nur ad-Din Umar declared himself the independent ruler of Yemen and discontinued the annual tribute payment to the Ayyubid sultanate in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Quarrington was a rural {{community}} {{during the early}} and middle Anglo-Saxon period while mills along the River Slea in the Middle Ages gave the village its alternative name of Millthorpe. The Bishop of Lincoln and Ramsey Abbey held manors in Quarrington after the Norman Conquest, but the Carre family of Sleaford were the principal land-owners between 1559 and 1683, when its estate passed by marriage to the Marquesses of Bristol. Although the growth of Victorian Sleaford saw the town <b>encroach</b> into the parish's boundaries, the old village remained a small cluster of farm buildings and cottages for much of its history. The sale {{of most of the}} surrounding farmland by successive Marquesses of Bristol in the late 20th century led to the rapid development of residential estates on Quarrington Hill and in New Quarrington which have engulfed the original settlement. Low crime rates, affordable housing, high standards of living and access to good schools have attracted home-buyers to the area, contributing to a sharp rise in the population.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the style}} of the Renaissance was {{generally}} regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland's Socialist national format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of Stalinism. Currently the soc-realist centre of Nowa Huta {{is considered to be a}} meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large Panel System apartment blocks, most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not <b>encroach</b> upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the later half of the 20th century in Kraków.|$|E
5|$|Structural damage {{ranged from}} the {{superficial}} to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the new and old portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to <b>encroach</b> on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a quarter mile (400 m).|$|E
5|$|The British and Egyptian governments {{would not}} again attempt major {{intervention}} until 1896, whereupon {{the government in}} Britain was impelled to act by several factors. The Egyptian economy had improved since British administrators commandeered the country's finances.

France, Britain's longtime competitor in the Scramble for Africa, was beginning to <b>encroach</b> upon the Nile river valley, alongside the Belgians. Finally, it was politically advantageous in Europe for Britain to distract the Khalifa from the Italians in Eritrea, who had been made vulnerable by a recent defeat at the hands of Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia.
