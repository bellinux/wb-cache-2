In this paper a modular OPC-Server is presented, that combines two features. First, an application software on office level has to be connected to only one server, even if it needs data connections to different <b>fieldbusses.</b> And second, fast and efficient communication between different <b>fieldbusses</b> is possible. Furthermore an OPC-Client is implemented, that is also a Web-Server with Java RMI functions (Remote Method Invocation). Combining the OPC-Server with the OPC-Client results in a system, that enables data access from a standard PC with a Web-Browser into several different bussystems on field level. 1 Introduction The communication interface between the office and field level in automation systems is an important element, that is needed to guarantee the necessary information flow for efficient working principles.

40|$|A service robot is a robot {{to perform}} tasks for humans, usually not stationary, but rather {{autonomous}} regarding motion and navigation. Usually, {{any kind of}} manipulation is performed {{while there is a}} differentiation between domestic and industrial service robots. Just as well as automation in general, service robots make use of <b>fieldbusses</b> in order to reduce cabling effort. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing trend towards Ethernet-based <b>fieldbusses</b> employing already existing network devices to connect a high number of participating components. But there are still a number of open issues. A desired, but not yet found technology would have to combine these aspects: - Easy and fast reconfiguration, - High reliability in research environment, - Integration of high variety of devices (e. g. robots, PLCs, PC-based control, advanced sensors, etc.), - Realtime capabilities, - Plug-and-play. All these items are necessary in order to provide and integrate the technological state-of-the-art with minimal effort. Thus, the actual problems when doing research in robotics can be addressed. In recent projects, there are several occasions addressing these aspects. The two most important ones are the communication of mobile machines with their control stations and the integration of several devices within one machine.

FOUNDATION <b>Fieldbus</b> was developed over a period of many years by the International Society of Automation, or ISA, as SP50. In 1996 the first H1 (31.25 kbit/s) specifications were released.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands of}} dynamics and accuracy in machine tools and {{the requirement of}} many additional features, like process or machine monitoring, effect not only the construction of tool machines but also the drive control. In the drive control of the present days, specialized digital signal processors and microcontrollers are used. Because they are made for standard drive control with high quantities and low prices, {{there is a lack}} of flexibility and openness towards new sensors or control algorithms. To include new technologies in an existing drive control severe changes in both software and hardware are required. This makes it difficult and expensive to adjust the drive control to the special needs of manufacturing processes and machines differing from the standard. In this thesis a new approach for drive control is shown which fulfills the requirements of present-day machines and future developments in that it is flexible and open so it can be easily adjusted to special processes and machines. This flexibility is achieved by a hardware based on programable logic. A library provides modules, containing all the functions for the drive control, process control, sensors analysis, machine monitoring, etc. The drive controller can be configured out of this library so that it provides exactly the functions needed by the process or machine. Besides the programable logic, the drive control provides slots where hardware interfaces towards sensors, actors, or <b>fieldbusses</b> can be added. This thesis introduces the architecture of an open drive control, covering the modularization of the drive functions, the infrastructure needed for execution of the modules, for communication in between the modules, and for monitoring them. The openness and flexibility of the system requires special development tools also shown here. As verification of this concept, an implementation of the open drive control architecture is shown controlling a linear direct drive, which demonstrates a basic library of drive function and a drive control configured with modules from this library...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fieldbus</b> Foundation was an {{organization}} dedicated to a single international, interoperable <b>fieldbus</b> standard. It was established in September 1994 by a merger of WorldFIP North America and the Interoperable Systems Project (ISP). <b>Fieldbus</b> Foundation was a not-for-profit trade consortium that consisted of more than 350 of the world's suppliers and end users of process control and manufacturing automation products. Working together those companies made contributions to the IEC/ISA/FDI and other <b>fieldbus</b> standards development.|$|E
50|$|In {{process control}} systems, {{the market is}} {{dominated}} by FOUNDATION <b>fieldbus</b> and PROFIBUS PA. Both technologies use the same physical layer (2-wire manchester-encoded current modulation at 31.25 kHz) but are not interchangeable. As a general guide, applications which are controlled and monitored by PLCs (programmable logic controllers) tend towards PROFIBUS, and applications which are controlled and monitored by a DCS (digital/distributed control system) tend towards FOUNDATION <b>Fieldbus.</b> PROFIBUS technology is made available through Profibus International with headquarters in Karlsruhe, Germany. FOUNDATION <b>Fieldbus</b> technology is owned and distributed by the <b>Fieldbus</b> Foundation of Austin, Texas.|$|E
50|$|The {{interface}} {{for conventional}} wired remote I/O and wired HART, dubbed RIO, was launched back in 2007. The HSE remote I/O (HSE RIO) specification allows end users to access high data requirement devices {{directly in the}} <b>fieldbus</b> host system via HSE high-speed <b>fieldbus.</b> The remote I/O specification allows all forms of conventional I/O to {{be brought into the}} native <b>fieldbus</b> environment easily. This solution makes discrete-in, discrete-out, analog-in, analog-out and FOUNDATION H1 available over a common Ethernet network. <b>Fieldbus</b> Foundation released the Remote I/O portion of the specification in April 2011.|$|E
50|$|There {{were many}} {{competing}} technologies for <b>fieldbus</b> {{and the original}} hope for one single unified communications mechanism has not been realized. This should not be unexpected since <b>fieldbus</b> technology needs to be implemented differently in different applications; automotive <b>fieldbus</b> is functionally different from process plant control. The final edition of IEC standard IEC 61158 allows 8 technologies. This are the some hierarchic layer of the automation protocols.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fieldbus</b> can be {{used for}} systems which must meet safety-relevant {{standards}} like IEC 61508 or EN 954-1. Depending on the actual protocol, <b>fieldbus</b> can provide measures like counters, CRCs, echo, timeout, unique sender and receiver IDs or cross check. Ethernet/IP and SERCOS III both use the CIP Safety protocol, Ethernet Powerlink uses openSAFETY, while FOUNDATION <b>Fieldbus</b> and Profibus (PROFIsafe) can address SIL 2 and SIL 3 process safety applications.|$|E
50|$|In late 1994, {{the path}} of <b>fieldbus</b> took a new, {{promising}} direction. Two parallel supplier consortiums-the InterOperable Systems Project (ISP) and WorldFIP North America-merged to form the <b>Fieldbus</b> Foundation. The new organization immediately brought critical mass to the effort to achieve an internationally acceptable <b>fieldbus</b> standard. The foundation organized development programs, conducted field trials, and established the industry's most rigorous program for testing and registration of <b>fieldbus</b> devices. Manufacturers, end users, academic institutions and other interested parties became members of the <b>Fieldbus</b> Foundation and developed open, non-proprietary specifications known as FOUNDATION <b>fieldbus.</b> This advanced digital communication solution was designed from the ground-up to support mission-critical control applications where the proper transfer and handling of data is essential. Foundation technology was created to replace incompatible networks and systems with an open, fully integrated architecture for information integration and distributed, real-time control. With Foundation technology, users gained the power to implement tightly integrated digital control based on unified system architecture and a high-speed backbone for plant operations. This, in turn, removed the previously experienced constraints on device and subsystem interoperability.|$|E

50|$|From a {{business}} standpoint, FOUNDATION <b>Fieldbus</b> technology delivers savings in total installation costs. H1 <b>Fieldbus</b> reduces instrument wiring, which means less termination and fewer screwdriver turns. The technology reduces hardware requirements and lowers Capital Expenditures (CAPEX). FOUNDATION <b>Fieldbus</b> primarily reduces Operating Expenses (OPEX) through improved plant efficiencies, better asset management, and reduced maintenance requirements.Specific benefits of FOUNDATION technology include: reduced wiring, multi-variables {{from a single}} multi-channel field instrument, simpler integration and easier maintenance. Using Half Duplex RS485 hardware connection a two wire communication is possible. The FOUNDATION <b>Fieldbus</b> H1 has support for Intrinsically Safe Wiring. Unlike other protocols, FOUNDATION H1 provides explicit synchronization of control and communication for precisely periodic (isochronous) communication and execution of control functions with minimized dead time and jitter. It synchronizes clocks in <b>fieldbus</b> devices for support of Function Block scheduling and alarm time-stamping {{at the point of}} detection.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} cabling {{required}} {{is much lower}} in <b>Fieldbus</b> than in 4-20 mA installations. This is because many devices share {{the same set of}} cables in a multi-dropped fashion rather than requiring a dedicated set of cables per device {{as in the case of}} 4-20 mA devices. Moreover, several parameters can be communicated per device in a <b>Fieldbus</b> network whereas only one parameter can be transmitted on a 4-20 mA connection. <b>Fieldbus</b> also provides a good foundation for the creation of a predictive and proactive maintenance strategy. The diagnostics available from <b>fieldbus</b> devices can be used to address issues with devices before they become critical problems.|$|E
50|$|Although 4-20 mA {{has been}} the main field {{signalling}} standard, modern DCS systems can also support <b>fieldbus</b> digital protocols, such as Foundation <b>Fieldbus,</b> profibus, HART, Modbus, PC Link etc., and other digital communication protocols such as modbus.|$|E
5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{requirements}} of <b>fieldbus</b> networks for process automation applications (flowmeters, pressure transmitters, and other measurement devices and control valves in industries such as hydrocarbon processing and power generation) are different from the requirements of <b>fieldbus</b> networks found in discrete manufacturing applications such as automotive manufacturing, where large numbers of discrete sensors are used including motion sensors, position sensors, and so on.

50|$|<b>Fieldbus</b> is an {{industrial}} network system for real-time distributed control. It {{is a way}} to connect instruments in a manufacturing plant. <b>Fieldbus</b> works on a network structure which typically allows daisy-chain, star, ring, branch, and tree network topologies. Previously, computers were connected using RS-232 (serial connections) by which only two devices could communicate. This would be the equivalent of the currently used 4-20 mA communication scheme which requires that each device have its own communication point at the controller level, while the <b>fieldbus</b> is the equivalent of the current LAN-type connections, which require only one communication point at the controller level and allow multiple (hundreds) of analog and digital points to be connected at the same time. This reduces both the length of the cable required and the number of cables required. Furthermore, since devices that communicate through <b>fieldbus</b> require a microprocessor, multiple points are typically provided by the same device. Some <b>fieldbus</b> devices now support control schemes such as PID control on the device side instead of forcing the controller to do the processing.|$|E

50|$|Different fieldbuses offer {{different}} sets of features and performance.
