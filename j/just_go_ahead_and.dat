5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlmann theorized {{as to the}} {{why this}} album ended the string of “six {{consecutive}} Gold-selling Top Ten albums (not counting reissues and compilations” or Christmas LPs) that Williams was enjoying upon its release, offering that it “may just be a question of marketing. The album, with its austere black cover, was released late in the holiday season after Williams's summer single 'In the Arms of Love,' belatedly topped the Easy Listening chart in October. The song was written by Henry Mancini, who had meant dollar signs for Williams with such previous movie themes as 'Moon River,' 'Days of Wine and Roses,' and 'Dear Heart.' But this hit, which only made it halfway up the pop charts, came from an unsuccessful film, What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?, and mid-December {{was no time to}} start selling a new, non-seasonal release.” As {{to the quality of the}} album itself, he wrote, “Much of it is even calmer than usual for him, and the focus on foreign material makes you wish he'd <b>just</b> <b>gone</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> recorded a samba album or one made up entirely of international songs, since those tunes mix oddly with the choices from the Great American Songbook and recent film themes. Williams had indicated his interest in overseas material on his last album, The Shadow of Your Smile, but this one went even further, though without the quality of songs to sustain the direction." ...|$|R
