Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was when I really started working out. I started running more. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was really {{going to find out}} how good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler signed quickly, {{and broke}} in as a shortstop in 2003. He batted [...]277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading {{the team in}} steals (11) and triples (6). He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches. He said: [...] "I was probably 170 pounds, and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much as I could. And I learned how to hit." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} chapter, Cartwright writes [...] "About {{five years ago}} <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> wanted to write this book. I knew that The Simpsons would end some day. [...] I decided that I wanted to write it while the show {{was still on the}} air." [...] In an {{interview}} with Scotland on Sunday, she added [...] "I wanted to tell my story and I needed to because I get so much fan mail. People are so interested in the whole process, how it all comes together. This book does that." [...] In a 1995 interview, five years before writing the book, Cartwright remarked that she wanted to write a book and that if she did, it would be titled [...] "My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{second of}} four daughters of a well-to-do dental surgeon and a housewife, Neila Balendra {{was born in}} 1938 in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). She began dancing {{at the age of}} five, and trained in the {{classical}} Indian dance traditions of Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali and Manipuri at the Shanti Kumar School of Dance and the Kalaya School of Dance in Colombo. In 1954, she won the gold medal at the All-Ceylon Dance Festival and was selected to perform for Elizabeth II when the Queen visited Sri Lanka in April 1954 during her tour of the Commonwealth after acceding to the throne. Neila has said: [...] "That was the day <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was going to devote my life to dance. My father wanted me to become a dental surgeon, but I refused".|$|E
500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking about this stuff. At the playbacks, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way." [...] Regarding the backlash about the sound, he stated, [...] "It's crazy, that kind of closed-mindedness." [...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos. It probably sounds heavier because it's Metallica, but really this was a 15-minutes-on-the-drum-sound type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 interview, Sevigny {{reflected}} on her career, {{and said she}} was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: [...] "When I was in my early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E

Before <b>I</b> <b>decide,</b> <b>I</b> {{want to be in}} possession of the facts--down to the smallest detail of what took place between you and Miss Silvester at the inn. There is only one way of getting at those facts. I am going to examine you as if I had you before me in the witness-box in court." ...|$|R
500|$|Following the match, referee Nicolae Rainea {{explained}} {{his decision to}} play the match despite heavy fog: [...] "When I went out there before kick-off <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> could see well enough and so I decided to play. I am afraid many spectators would not get a very clear view {{but there was no}} time I had any thoughts of abandoning the game." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was critical of the decision to play the match: [...] "You can't play football in conditions like that, it's ridiculous." [...] Paisley suggested the competition should be played in April when the weather was better: [...] "I think a match like this, between two leading team should be played in better weather, say in April. I know it's difficult, but it's farcical when good players like these have to slither about in fog and can't see each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Behan {{found he}} could not {{concentrate}} on his art in Germany as he was working too hard in the evenings in nightclubs and bars to earn money. Also, as he was doing [...] "too much drinking as well, so unless I {{wanted to start a}} new art style where it would've been very 'shakey' [...] to look at, basically <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> had to do something else". He resolved to go to London to study acting. After applying to three drama schools he was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). For about three years from 1990 or 1991, he lived with his friends from RADA, David Harewood and Danny Cerqueira, at 39 Ravenshaw Street in West Hampstead. Harewood recalls that his housemates were [...] "fantastic characters" [...] – [...] "It was a wonderful, experimental time. We'd spend long nights discussing art, life and politics; smoking weed, drinking lots of whisky, listening to music and throwing furniture on the fire." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{attended}} Savanna High School in Anaheim, describing {{himself as}} a [...] "band geek" [...] who played the trumpet. At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg {{took part in a}} [...] "dive program" [...] at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, California, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: [...] "The switch clicked and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist." [...] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: [...] "You should just draw fish." [...] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by [...] "making weird, little paintings". During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.) ...|$|E
500|$|After the loss, {{there were}} calls for Playford {{to be offered}} the post of Governor of South Australia or Governor-General of Australia, but nothing came of that. Playford {{continued}} to lead the LCL opposition for a further {{one and a half}} years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, Steele Hall, a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the Playmander still in place. Contrary to perceptions, Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor, and he did not publicly hint at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot; there was speculation that the former premier may have been one of those who abstained from the vote. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that [...] "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... I found I could no longer cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> couldn't take it any longer".|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

I used to post personal pictures and stuff because I saw it as both a personal blog and a blog about just things that I like.
