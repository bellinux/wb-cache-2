5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with <b>hard</b> <b>core</b> during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E
5|$|Nier {{originated}} when Yoko and Shiba {{teamed up}} to create a third Drakengard game. As the project continued, it became more detached from the main continuity and eventually developed into a spin-off. Despite what it became, Yoko has stated that he considers Nier to be the true Drakengard 3. After the release of Nier, Cavia closed down and was absorbed by AQ Interactive, then Yoko Taro left the company to pursue {{a wider range of}} projects. A stalled attempt to begin production of further games in the series at AQ Interactive was blamed by Shiba on a prevalent trend at the time for light-weight games for the general gaming community. Later, Yoko and Shiba came together again to create a proper second sequel to Drakengard, with the intention of creating a <b>hard</b> <b>core</b> RPG for the fanbase. Unlike the previous games in the series, Drakengard 3 was developed by Access Games, a developer whose noted games included Deadly Premonition, and brought in team members used to creating action games. During the run-up to Drakengard 3s release, both Yoko and Shiba expressed their willingness to continue the series on the PlayStation 4 if the latest game was enough of a success. Speaking in 2014 after the game's release, Yoko stated that the series was on hold due to lack of funds. A new Nier game was revealed to be in development at Square Enix and PlatinumGames.|$|E

40|$|Most {{current density}} {{functional}} theories rely upon {{the presence of}} <b>hard</b> <b>cores,</b> also between ions of like charge. These <b>hard</b> <b>cores</b> should in principle reflect exchange repulsion. However, by {{the way in which}} these theories are formulated, the <b>hard</b> <b>cores</b> effectively determine the range of ion-ion correlations. This is because the mutual repulsion between like-charged ions is truncated below the corresponding hard sphere diameter. In most relevant applications, at least those related to ion correlations and surface forces in colloidal dispersions, exchange repulsion between like-charged ions is unimportant. This can easily be demonstrated by simulations. Unfortunately, the <b>hard</b> <b>cores</b> can in practice serve as fitting parameters in calculations with traditional density functional theory. In this work, we present alternative density functional theories to describe aqueous salt solutions. In these approaches, an approximation of the relevant "Coulomb hole" that results from correlations between like-charged ions is calculated for the system under study. Hence, our theories are completely free from fitting parameters, and the results are appropriately insensitive to the exchange repulsion acting between ions of like charge. The theories are evaluated by comparing predictions with simulation data, with an emphasis on ion correlations and surface interactions...|$|R

25|$|As Roberts's army {{occupied}} Pretoria, the Boer {{fighters in}} the Orange Free State {{had been driven}} into a fertile area known as the Brandwater Basin in the north east of the Republic.

From the outgoing wave {{parts of the}} solutions, the expressions of the off-shell T matrices for triplet-state interactions are derived. It is shown that the present T matrices on the energy shell agree with the usual ones and the off-shell 'T matrices have the symmetry property, tf. (p, k; z) =tf, 1 +l (k,p; z). Â§ I. hbroduction The importance of {{the investigation of the}} off-shell T matrix consists {{in the fact that the}} elements of the T matrix are measurable quantities and if all of them will be known in the future from the experimental data, it will be useful to construct the interaction potential. It is only the on-shell elements that can be obtained from the analysis of the free two-body scattering data, but the off-shell elements must be obtained from the analysis of the P-P bremsstrahlung, nu-clear matter, three-body bound and scattering problems, etc. Unfortunately, the knowledge of the off-shell T matrix has been scarecely obtained from the experimental data up to the present day. Therefore it seems to be the second best that the off-shell T matrix can be obtained from the re-alistic potential which reproduces the free two-body scattering data. Once a realistic potential is assumed, the T matrix should be uniquely de-termined, because it is defined through the integral equation T=V+ V(E-H 0 +ie) - 1 T. Wong and ZambottPl solved the itpove integral equation for the Yukawa potential by use of the matrix inversion n'iethod.
