40|$|Black-tailed (Limosa limosa) and <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwits</b> (L. haemastica) are {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} superspecies. The Black-tailed Godwit is further split into three subspecies {{on the basis of}} morphological differences (L. l. limosa, L. l. islandica and L. l. melanuroides). We studied variation in partial mtDNA control region sequences among Black-tailed and <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwits</b> which showed 5 % divergence. Black-tailed and <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwits</b> were thus clearly differentiated and the separate species status for the two taxa is validated. All three subspecies described for the Black-tailed Godwit had unique haplotypes but the genetic distances were small (0. 3 â€“ 0. 6 %). Despite small genetic differences we could not detect any substantial gene flow between any of the subspecies as haplotypes were private to each subspecies. Thus, genetic variation within Black-tailed Godwits showed a clear geographic structure. We found a high proportion of rare private haplotypes in three fringe populations of the nominate subspecies of the Black-tailed Godwit (L. l. limosa) where godwits breed in low numbers, but no genetic variation at all in a sample from the Netherlands where godwits are abundant. This suggests that Dutch Godwits may have been affected by a founder effect. ...|$|R

5000|$|Various {{studies have}} {{surveyed}} bird populations at this site. The International Shorebird Survey in 1988 counted 155,000 shorebirds at Big Quill Lake. Surveys between 1989 and 1992 at Middle and Little Quill Lakes found one-day peaks of 101,900 birds. The most comprehensive study conducted, involving all three lakes, {{resulted in a}} count of 197,155 birds. The site is an important staging and breeding area for the endangered piping plover.

40|$|Populations of the Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica; Scolopacidae) {{embark on}} some of the longest migrations known among birds. The baueri race breeds in western Alaska and spends the nonbreeding season a {{hemisphere}} away in New Zealand and eastern Australia; the menzbieri race breeds in Siberia and migrates to western and northern Australia. Although the Siberian birds are known to follow the coast of Asia during both migrations, the southern pathway followed by the Alaska breeders has remained unknown. Two questions have particular ecological importance: (1) do Alaska godwits migrate directly across the Pacific, a distance of 11 000 km? and (2) are they capable of doing this in a single flight without stopping to rest or refuel? We explored six lines of evidence to answer these questions. The distribution of resightings of marked birds of the baueri and menzbieri races was significantly different between northward and southward flights with virtually no marked baueri resighted along the Asian mainland during southward migration. The timing of southward migration of the two races further indicates the absence of a coastal Asia route by baueri with peak passage of godwits in general occurring there a month prior to the departure of most birds from Alaska. The use of a direct route across the Pacific is also supported by significantly more records of godwits reported from within a direct migration corridor than elsewhere in Oceania, and during the September to November period than at other times of the year. The annual but rare occurrence of <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwits</b> (L. haemastica) in New Zealand and the absence of their records along the Asian mainland also support a direct flight and are best explained by <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwits</b> accompanying Bar-tailed Godwits from known communal staging areas in Alaska. Flight simulation models, extreme fat loads, and the apparent evolution of a wind-selected migration from Alaska further support a direct, nonstop flight. ...|$|R

50|$|KIBS is frequented from May through October by {{more than}} 90 bird species, {{including}} many migrating waterfowl. Compared to other Key Habitat Sites in Northern Canada, particularly high densities of Arctic tern, greater white-fronted goose, loon, northern pintail, and sandhill crane frequent the area. Tundra swan concentrate around the outer section of the MBS. A colony of approximately 3000 lesser snow geese have been identified at KIBS, as well as nationally significant numbers of <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>godwit</b> and whimbrel. The short-eared owl, a Species at Risk Act-listed bird, has been records at KIBS, as well as grizzly bear, polar bear and wolverine, which are listed species by Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife, and the highly endangered Eskimo curlew. The Lapland longspur appears to be avoiding the KIBS because of seismic lines and drilling pads brought on by natural gas exploration.|$|E
50|$|HNWR {{is located}} within the Central Flyway, a route {{traveled}} annually by numerous species of waterfowl and other migratory birds. The refuge enjoys {{a reputation as a}} premier bird watching destination in North Texas. Although a total of 316 bird species have been recorded on the refuge since it was established in 1946, recent surveys show 273 different bird species are regularly found at HNWR, of which 80 species nest and 193 are migratory. Painted buntings, cardinals, scissor-tailed flycatchers, blue grosbeaks, eastern meadowlarks, northern mockingbirds, blue jays, and red-bellied woodpeckers are common nesting birds. Neotropical migrants such as warblers, tyrant flycatchers, tanagers, orioles, sparrows, and others pass through them each spring and fall with many of these species remaining to nest. Game birds on the refuge include the mourning dove, northern bobwhite and wild turkey. Many declining species either occasionally or commonly occur on the refuge including the American golden plover, prothonotary warbler, painted bunting and <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>godwit.</b> The refuge attracts 15 species of raptors during the fall and spring migration period including the osprey, rough-legged buzzard and Swainson's hawk, hen harrier, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk. The refuge provides excellent wintering habitat for bald eagles, particularly along Lake Texoma. Nesting raptors include the red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, hen harrier, Mississippi kite, American kestrel, and the broad-winged hawk.|$|E
40|$|As {{is often}} the case, the spring season had {{something}} for everyone: potential range expansions, an incredible shorebird migration through the eastern Rainwater Basin, a scarcity of migrant warblers, and some genuinely rare birds. Timely spring rainfall transformed the Rainwater Basin, leaving large areas of sheetwater for migrant shorebirds and improving the attractiveness of wetlands, particularly renovated wetlands, to certain breeding species. Perhaps the most important bits of information we can record here are changes in breeding ranges or behavior. Of significance here is the second nesting record for Hooded Merganser, the increasing occurrence of Greater Prairie-Chickens at Rainwater Basin grasslands, the return of Mississippi Kites to Red Cloud, nesting Black-necked Stilts and American Avocets in the Rainwater Basin, discovery of Barn Owls in northeast Nebraska, expansion into the state of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers, possible breeding of Clark 2 Ì† 7 s Nutcrackers on the Pine Ridge, the continued feeding of grackle and robin chicks by the Sioux Co Curve-billed Thrasher (now {{considered to be a}} Husker), increasing evidence of Spotted Towhee introgression at Schramm State Park, and extra-limital nestings of Pine Siskin. The shorebird migration through the Rainwater Basin was one for the ages, with record numbers of <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwits,</b> Ruddy Turnstones, Dunlin, and Buff-breasted Sandpipers found. Numbers of other species were also high, and L Mcconaughy contributed with a record count of Whimbrels. On the other hand, migrant warblers were drastically lower in numbers, notably Nashville Warbler (8), Chestnut-sided Warbler (3), Magnolia Warbler (1), Black-throated Green Warbler (1), and Blackburnian Warbler (0). What this means will have to wait for a regional or national perspective. Rarities were in evidence also, with some real 2 Ì† 2 zooties 2 Ì† 2 : Black-bellied Whistling-Duck, Anhinga, Glossy Ibis, White-tailed Kite, Red Knot, Ruff, Little Gull, White-eyed Vireo (in Sioux Co, no less), and Connecticut Warbler...|$|R
40|$|Ruff and Godwits. On April 19, 1994, I {{discovered}} a red-phased Ruff (Philomachus pugnax) in alternate plumage at the Sacramento Wildlife Management Area in Phelps County. It was feeding with {{a flock of}} <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwits</b> (Limosa haemastica) and Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa) in a flooded marshy area. The Ruff was easily recognized and required little effort to identify. I observed and photographed it for about one hour in the early evening, using a Canon AE- 1 and my Kowa TSN- 4 with a 1200 mm photo attachment as a lens. I was unable to locate it the following morning. Several photographs {{have been sent to}} the Records Committee. Snowy Plover and Other Plovers. On May 2, 1994, I found a Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) at the Funk Marsh Waterfowl Production Area in Phelps County. It was on a mud flat with 16 semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) and a single Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), as well as a variety of sandpipers. The Snowy Plover was pale on the upperparts and white on the underparts. The bill was black and the legs appeared to be a darkslate color. The bird had a blackish breast band, which was limited {{to the side of the}} breast, and a dark area behind the eye. It possessed the typical Charadrius feature of a blackish area at the front of the crown. The only species that could possibly be confused with a Snowy Plover would be the Piping Plover. Breeding male and female Piping Plovers were eliminated from consideration because this bird had dark legs and bill, a dark area behind the eye, and was smaller in size than the Piping Plover. Non-breeding Piping Plovers have dark legs and bill but lack any darker plumage patterns. Photographs of the Snowy Plover will be sent to the Records Committee...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{altering}} conditions across the globe. These changes are happening asynchronously among regions, creating asymmetrical changes for species whose life cycles span hemispheres. This dissertation {{is an attempt to}} use the effects of global climate change on the annual cycle of the long-distance migratory bird, the <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit,</b> Limosa haemastica, as a lens for understanding the broader effects of global climate change on all migratory birds. Using geolocation tracking devices and intensive breeding season studies, I show how different populations within the same species are differentially affected by climate change and how this arises because of differences in the climate change regimes experienced by the two populations, but also underlying differences in the amount of flexibility that exists in their respective annual cycles. In response to different climate change regimes, the <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit</b> populations breeding at Beluga River, Alaska and Churchill, Manitoba are altering the timing of their arrival on their breeding grounds in different ways. Beluga River godwits, which are experiencing only warming climates throughout their annual cycle, have accelerated their arrival on their breeding grounds by nearly 9 days over the past four decades. Churchill godwits, which are experiencing both warming and cooling climates, have instead retarded their arrival by more than 10 days during that same time period. These different trends allow Beluga River godwits to remain properly timed with the period of peak insect abundance and maintain a robust breeding success rate, while Churchill godwits are instead suffering a phenological mismatch and frequent reproductive failure. Beluga River godwits are able to respond to such climatic changes because their annual cycle includes buffer events and flexibility in timing. As a result of this buffer, Beluga River godwits are able to absorb delays caused by extreme weather events that disrupt their northward migration, without suffering reductions in breeding success. Using these findings and an organismenvironment approach to the whole annual cycle, I suggest that those species and populations with larger amounts of flexibility in their annual cycles can withstand significant climatic change, but that those lacking flexibility are in danger of rapidly succumbing to climatic change...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} resting and peak metabolic rates (RMR and PMR, respectively) during {{development of}} chicks of seven species of shorebirds: least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla; adult mass 20 22 g), dunlin (Calidris alpina; 56 - 62 g), lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes; 88 - 92 g), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus; 85 - 112 g), {{lesser golden plover}} (Pluvialis dominicana; 150 - 156 g), <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>godwit</b> (Limosa haemastica; 205 - 274 g), and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus; 380 g). We tested two opposing hypotheses: the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, which posits that growth rate in chicks is inversely related to functional maturity of tissues, and the fast growth rate-high metabolism hypothesis, which suggests that rapid growth is possible only with a concomitant increase in either RMR or PMR. We have {{found no evidence that}} chicks of shorebirds with fast growth rates have lower RMRs or lower PMRs, as would be predicted by the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, but our data suggested that faster-growing chest muscles resulted in increased thermogenic capacity, consistent with the fast growth-high metabolism hypothesis. The development of homeothermy in smaller species is a consequence primarily of greater metabolic intensities of heat-generating tissues. The maximum temperature gradient between a chick's body and environment that can be maintained {{in the absence of a}} net radiative load increased rapidly with body mass during development and was highest in least sandpipers and lowest among godwits. Chicks of smaller species could maintain a greater temperature gradient at a particular body mass because of their higher mass-specific maximum metabolic rates...|$|E

On the other hand, numbers of staging Western Grebes were down significantly, apparently due to poor (dry) summer breeding conditions, but a flock of Brant and a Harlequin Duck added spice.

Snowies and Little Blue Herons appeared in good numbers, and the 10 th Glossy Ibis for 2006 (!) made an appearance. A fifth breeding location for Sandhill Crane was reported. Among shorebirds, record numbers of American Golden-Plovers were located, and the recent increase in fall sightings of White-romped Sandpipers continued. These two species, along with <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit,</b> are usually scarcer in fall than in spring. Also unprecedented historically was a fall flock of 28 migrant Mountain Plovers; previously, records after July were extremely unusual. Other lingering shorebirds included Semipalmated and Piping Plovers, Black-necked Stilt, Willet, and Long-billed Curlew. A count of 5500 Wilson 2 Ì† 7 s Phalaropes at Crescent Lake NWR was exciting...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a growing {{consensus}} that events during one part of an animalâ€™s annual cycle can detrimentally affect its future fitness. Notably, migratory species {{have been shown to}} commonly display such carry-over effects, facing severe time constraints and physiological stresses that can influence events across seasons. However, to date, no study has examined a full annual cycle to determine when these carry-over effects arise and how long they persist within and across years. Understanding when carry-over effects are created and how they persist is critical to identifying those periods and geographic locations that constrain the annual cycle of a population and determining how selection is acting upon individuals throughout the entire year. Using three consecutive years of migration tracks and four consecutive years of breeding success data, we tested whether carry-over effects in the form of timing deviations during one migratory segment of the annual cycle represent fitness costs that persist or accumulate across the annual cycle for a long-distance migratory bird, the <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>godwit,</b> Limosa haemastica. We found that individual godwits could migrate progressively later than population mean over the course of an entire migration period, especially southbound migration, but that these deviations did not accumulate across the entire year and were not consistently detected among individuals across years. Furthermore, neither the accumulation of lateness during previous portions of the annual cycle nor arrival date at the breeding grounds resulted in individuals suffering reductions in their breeding success or survival. Given their extreme life history, such a lac...|$|E
40|$|Larry Einemann kindly {{pointed out}} that in the Spring Report all his {{sightings}} from Pioneer 2 Ì† 7 s Park should have been attributed to Wilderness Park at Pioneer 2 Ì† 7 s Boulevard (in Lincoln). Larry noted that Pioneer 2 Ì† 7 s Park is a manicured Lincoln city park which is not good for birds except for {{in the vicinity of the}} embedded Chet Ager Nature Center. This was my (WRS) error; personally I have trouble even finding the Wilderness Park entrances, let alone naming them properly! Another correction! John Sullivan {{pointed out that}} the 2 Summer Tanagers at Indian Cave SP on 10 August, 1997, were not his sighting. In fact, after searching the raw data, I can 2 Ì† 7 t find this report; please delete it. A surprising number of rarities appeared this fall, notably some rare warblers for the Panhandle, including a 1 st Panhandle Pine Warbler and a 1 st fall state and Panhandle Prairie Warbler, as well as a 1 st fall Panhandle Mourning Warbler. A 1 st documented Panhandle Blue-headed Vireo and a first documented state fall <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit</b> were also found. Other outstanding sightings included a 2 nd state Long-tailed Jaeger, a 2 nd state fall Great Black-backed Gull, 6 th- 10 th (I) state Little Gulls, a 4 th fall (5 th state) Red-naped Sapsucker, an 8 th state fall Green-tailed Towhee, and a 5 th state documented Dark-eyed (Gray-headed) Junco. An observant reader will note that most of these rarities were discovered and documented by the indefatigable Steve Dinsmore, who has advanced our knowledge of Panhandle birds, especially migrants, tremendously in the last 3 years or so...|$|E
40|$|I wish {{to remind}} {{observers}} to report dates of breeding evidence, such as nests with eggs and adults feeding fledglings. There is surprisingly little known {{about these things}} for Nebraska 2 Ì† 7 s breeding birds, even the common ones. Please report these regardless of the season! This summer produced many interesting sightings; we 2 Ì† 7 ll lead off with significant breeding records: Snowy Plover provided a 2 nd state breeding record; Black-necked Stilt a first for Keith Co; Acadian Flycatcher first for Thurston Co; Summer Tanager first for Otoe Co; and Eurasian Collared-Dove 3 rd nesting locality, at Elmwood. Late spring migrants included a record late Tennessee Warbler and a 2 nd latest <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit</b> and Stilt Sandpiper. Early fall migrants were Pied-billed Grebe, Eared Grebe, 4 th July record for Bufflehead, record early Short-billed and Long-billed Dowitchers, and 2 nd earliest and 3 rd July Orange-crowned Warbler. Unusual summer records included firsts for Winter Wren and Pine Grosbeak, 6 th Pacific Loon, first adult Ring-billed Gulls, 4 th (10 th state) for Laughing Gull and 4 th for Pectoral Sandpiper. Record counts were provided by 500 (actual count!) Lesser Yellowlegs, 20 to 30 Willets, 34 Spotted Sandpipers, 5642 Baird 2 Ì† 7 s Sandpipers, 10, 000 Bank Swallows, and 21 Blue-gray Gnatcatchers in the Panhandle. Definitely out-of-place were a White-throated Swift seen at L McConaughy, the first summering Republican Valley Ruby-throated Hummingbird, a Red-bellied Woodpecker located at McGrew, a singing Swainson 2 Ì† 7 s Thrush spotted near Orleans, and a singing Blue-winged Warbler found along the Niobrara for apparently the 2 nd straight year. There were even some rarities: A potential first state record Dusky Flycatcher, a potential 2 nd Ash-throated Flycatcher, a 7 th state Neotropic Cormorant, and a 9 th Lesser Goldfinch...|$|E
40|$|There {{was much}} of {{interest}} this spring. Early and late dates, early breeding, {{even a few}} rarities, are scattered through the species accounts. A few highlights are mentioned here. Mark Brogie found 6 species of Gallinaceous birds in one hour in Knox Coâ€”quite a feat. Glossy Ibis reports continue to increase, and Mississippi Kites were found in new areas. Cranes made news: a leucistic Sandhill, another Common, and good numbers of Whoopings. Piping Plovers may be spreading out a bit, given {{the disappearance of the}} expanses of sand at L McConaughy, and amazing finds are being made by the team studying Mountain Plovers in Kimball County. Several shorebird species made a huge push 30 Apr: check out the accounts, beginning with American Avocet. The shorebird star had to be Bailey, the transmitter-wearing Long-billed Curlew, who made a rapid transit from wintering to summering grounds. Not far behind was XN, a banded <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit</b> seen on Chiloe Island, Chile, and next in Dakota Co, Nebraska. Black-billed Magpies have been hit hard in recent years and their progress is mixed, but Carolina Wrens took a beating last winter. A few survived, however, and we will watch their progress. A Bewick 2 Ì† 7 s Wren was a rarity in the southwest, but there was no doubt that the top rarity for the season was the Hermit Warbler photographed at Crescent L NWR; it was Nebraska 2 Ì† 7 s second. Additional rare Parulids found were Pine and Hooded Warblers. An amazing find, {{for the second year in}} a row, was singing Baird 2 Ì† 7 s Sparrows, seemingly acting territorially, in extreme northeast Sioux County. It will be interesting to see if they remain into summer...|$|E
40|$|First of all, I want {{to thank}} Joel Jorgensen for helping write these reports {{for the last few}} years. Joel has decided to spend his limited free time on Records Committee matters; he is {{currently}} Chairman. Over the last few years, Joel has made significant contributions to Nebraska ornithology, particularly through his! meticulous counts of shorebirds in the Rainwater Basin. This season proved interesting in terms of ranges of breeding birds, as discussed in the accounts. See, for example, Little Blue Heron, the dOWitchers. Black-billed Magpie, White-breasted Nuthatch, Sedge Wren, and the towhees. There seems to be an increasing number of 2 Ì† 2 displaced 2 Ì† 2 birds, either early or late 2 Ì† 7 migrants or birds just in the wrong places. Could this situation result from an increasingly unstable atmosphere? Very late in spring were <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit</b> and Wilson 2 Ì† 7 s Warbler, while very early in fall were Willet, Semipalmated Sandpiper. and Orange-crowned Warbler. Birds in the wrong places were numerous, but significant were a 2 Ì† 2 small race 2 Ì† 2 Canada Goose, ducks such as American Wigeon. Green-winged Teal, Bufflehead, and Common Goldeneye, Mississippi Kite away from Ogallala, adult Golden Eagle eastward, adult American Golden-Plover in July. westerly Least Terns, northerly Acadian Flycatcher, singing mid-June Blue-winged Warblers, Yellow-breasted Chats in Harlan Co, and Henslow 2 Ì† 7 s Sparrow in the RWB. Interesting breeding or possible breeding records involved Eurasian Collared Dove 2 Ì† 7 s 2 nd breeding location, Long-eared Owl, Pileated Woodpecker, Townsend 2 Ì† 7 s Solitaire, and MacGillivray 2 Ì† 7 s Warbler. 2 Ì† 2 Good birds 2 Ì† 2 were King Rail, Lewis 2 Ì† 7 s Woodpecker, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 Ì† 7 s Nutcracker, Hooded Warbler, and Cassin 2 Ì† 7 s Sparrow, and, best till last, the White Ibis, only the state 2 Ì† 7 s 3 rd report, but first with extant documentation. Finally, where were the Baird 2 Ì† 7 s Sandpipers? When was the last time only one was reported for the early fall? Presumably the adults went elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|This {{fall season}} was amazing, or as Stephen Dinsmore put it: 2 Ì† 72 Ì† 7 The birding was simply {{spectacular}} in western Nebraska this fall, 2 Ì† 2 There was something for everyone, whether rarity-chasers, taxonomists, listers, or whatever. There were {{no fewer than}} four new species for the state list (pending NOURC approval, of course!), a total of 315 species reported, and fascinating information on western subspecies in the Panhandle. Numbers of western migrants reached record levels, exemplified by fall totals of 53 Townsend 2 Ì† 7 s Warblers, 25 MacGillivray 2 Ì† 7 s Warblers, and 28 Western Tanagers. By contrast, eastern migrant warblers in the east were almost non-existent. At L McConaughy, the exposed flats at {{the west end of}} the reservoir attracted myriads of shorebirds and waterbirds, including record fall counts of Western Grebe (44, 000 !), Green-winged Teal, and a near-record count of Baird 2 Ì† 7 s Sandpipers. Several species also had new fall high counts, notably Cliff Swallow (30, 000 !) and Blue-winged Teal (14, 500 !). Stephen Dinsmore 2 Ì† 7 s diligent coverage of the Panhandle yielded no fewer than four first state records: Reddish Egret, Arctic Tern, Dusky Flycatcher (using mist-nettting, photography, and measurements!), and Black Rosy-Finch. The state total now stands at a healthy 445 species. There was also a host of significant distributional or seasonal reports, notably a first western White-eyed Vireo, first Panhandle documented Eastern Wood-Pewee, a first August-September Pacific Loon, a first August Red-breasted Merganser, a first fall record for Virginia 2 Ì† 7 s Warbler, and a second fall <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit</b> for the state. Not to mention all three jaegers! Sparrows were in mediocre numbers, with not much of interest in that group. Of concern are the few reports of Black-billed Cuckoo in recent years; only two were reported this fall. Despite the total of 315 species reported, no fewer than 17 species of regular, though generally rare, occurrence were not found. Most surprising among these were American Black Duck, American Woodcock, Broad-tailed Hummingbird, Veery, Wood Thrush, Northern Parula, Magnolia Warbler, Yellow-throated Warbler, Prothonotary Warbler, and Summer Tanager. Many of the missed species either depart early in fall or become inconspicuous. Were their breeding seasons unsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} where to nest has {{enormous}} fitness consequences for individuals and, when scaled up, can even affect population demography. Nest site selection in birds is, therefore, guided by {{a wide variety of}} proximate and ultimate factors, including protection from predators, access to favorable microclimates, proximity to food resources, and costs/benefits stemming from interactions with neighboring con- and hetero-specifics. Nevertheless, the features associated with, cues used to identify, and availability of favorable nest sites may be changing rapidly with accelerating human development and climate change, especially in the Arctic and sub-Arctic. I investigated how habitat characteristics, predation risk, and proximity to human disturbance (i. e., roads) influenced nest site selection for the <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit</b> (Limosa haemastica). First, I identified habitat characteristics most associated with nests of Hudsonian Godwits in two breeding populations - Beluga River, Alaska and Churchill, Manitoba. I was particularly interested in habitat attributes that are (or will be) strongly impacted by climate change and human development. Second, I assessed the spatial pattern of nests in Beluga River, Alaska to evaluate if there was evidence of aggregation and then determined the extent to which nest location and fate were associated with predation risk and habitat features. Hudsonian Godwits displayed strong preferences for certain habitat features when selecting nest sites, with individuals preferring nest sites with less bare ground and more graminoid and tall shrubby cover than random locations. Nest site preferences were relatively similar in the two study populations, though birds in Churchill also preferred to nest near shallow water. Given the demonstrated preferences of nesting godwits, our study suggests that habitat degradation due to grubbing by overabundant Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens) and changing climate will reduce the suitability and availability of habitats for breeding godwits. My study also provides evidence that, despite the importance of nesting habitat attributes, additional factors must be guiding nest site selection because nests of godwits were clustered within bogs. Because the spatial aggregation of nests was not explained by either underlying patchiness in habitat or by predation risk, I suggest that clustering may be related to social cues. Therefore, understanding behavioral processes can be as important as ecological requirements for habitat selection. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|E
40|$|New in this Seasonal Report, {{direct from}} the American Ornithologists 2 Ì† 7 Union (along with Wilson 2 Ì† 7 s Snipe, Rock Pigeon, etc.), is the {{modified}} checklist order, featuring geese, swans, and ducks at the beginning, followed by gallinaceous birds, then resuming the familiar order with loons. Perhaps {{the most important}} use for these reports, {{in addition to their}} incorporation into the Southern Great Plains Region summary in North American Birds, is the noting of significant avian events in Nebraska. Some are of obvious importance, but the meaning of others is obscure, perhaps only to be revealed as subsequent reports show a trend, or events noted in Nebraska are corroborated by the same events noted in the other Southern Great Plains states, in Kansas and Oklahoma, or even on a national level. Such events discussed in this report include a good showing of scoters, hints of a recovery of the Gray Partridge population, a sighting of 7 + migrating Mississippi Kites, a Clark 2 Ì† 7 s Nutcracker in Sowbelly Canyon, indications of declines in numbers of Black-billed Magpie, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee, westerly Carolina Wrens, rather low numbers of thrushes and warblers, westerly Rose-breasted Grosbeaks possibly breeding, good numbers of Purple Finches, no reports of Red Crossbills after 27 Sep, and few Pine Siskins. A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 Ì† 2 quirky, 2 Ì† 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an Orange Bishop (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney. Among significant early or late dates of occurrence were record late Caspian Terns, Panhandle Gray Catbird, and Bobolink (although the Boblink was unsubstantiated), second-latest Forster 2 Ì† 7 s Tern and Western Kingbird, and record early Northern (Red-Shafted) Flickers eastward. In-your-face numbers were the 321 Hooded Mergansers at L Yankton, 5 Yellow-crowned Night-Herons in the eastern Rainwater Basin, a fall record 247 Upland Sandpipers there also, an almost-record 283 Buff-breasted Sandpipers also in the eastern Rainwater Basin, 26, 000 Franklin 2 Ì† 7 s Gulls at L McConaughy, a record 14 Caspian Terns at Branched Oak L, 30 + Burrowing Owls at a Scotts Bluff County location, and a record 12 Brown Creepers at Arbor Day Farm. And for rarity buffs and state listers, there was limited joy this fall. Best were the 3 rd state record Yellow-billed Loon at L McConaughy and 5 th state record Tricolored Heron in the eastern Rainwater Basin. Significant also was a 3 rd state fall record <b>Hudsonian</b> <b>Godwit,</b> at L McConaughy. Important Panhandle records were a first record Summer Tanager (of the western subspecies cooperi), 2 nd record Ruby-throated Hummingbird (as well as a 2 nd record Archilochus hummingbird), 2 nd record Winter Wren, first fall record Baltimore Oriole, 2 nd fall record Mourning Warbler, and 3 rd fall record Rose-breasted Grosbeak, a male. Other important records were a Tufted Titmouse at Ponca SP, apparently the same bird that was there in May, and the 8 th fall record Rock Wren in the southeast...|$|E
