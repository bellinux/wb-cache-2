5|$|Elk are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} <b>infectious</b> diseases, some of which can be transmitted to livestock. Efforts to eliminate <b>infectious</b> diseases from elk populations, largely by vaccination, have had mixed success.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Racaniello and Baltimore used {{recombinant}} DNA {{technology to}} generate the first <b>infectious</b> clone of an animal RNA virus, poliovirus. DNA encoding the RNA genome of poliovirus was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and <b>infectious</b> poliovirus was produced. Creation of the <b>infectious</b> clone propelled understanding of poliovirus biology, {{and has become a}} standard technology used to study many other viruses.|$|E
5|$|OPV {{is usually}} {{provided}} in vials containing 10–20 doses of vaccine. A single dose of {{oral polio vaccine}} (usually two drops) contains 1,000,000 <b>infectious</b> units of Sabin 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 <b>infectious</b> units of the Sabin 2 strain, and 600,000 <b>infectious</b> units of Sabin 3. The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics—neomycin and streptomycin—but does not contain preservatives.|$|E
5|$|Rhinovirus-caused colds {{are most}} <b>infectious</b> {{during the first}} three days of symptoms; they are much less <b>infectious</b> afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A protein as a {{stand-alone}} <b>infectious</b> agent stands {{in contrast to}} all other known <b>infectious</b> agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, all of which contain nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both). For this reason, a minority of researchers still consider the prion/TSE hypothesis unproven.|$|E
5|$|<b>Infectious</b> {{bacteria}} such as Pseudomonas and Salmonella attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as Penicillium infect loggerhead {{sea turtle}} nests and cloacae.|$|E
5|$|Satoha et al. find {{evidence}} for an <b>infectious</b> cause of ulcers in rats.|$|E
5|$|When {{people with}} active {{pulmonary}} TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel <b>infectious</b> aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 µm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each {{one of these}} droplets may transmit the disease, since the <b>infectious</b> dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).|$|E
5|$|Yet Furia and Lasser {{describe}} the song's overall impact as an <b>infectious</b> delight.|$|E
5|$|A {{virus is}} a small <b>infectious</b> agent that {{replicates}} only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of health {{problems}} may affect cats, including <b>infectious</b> diseases, parasites, injuries, and chronic disease. Vaccinations are available {{for many of these}} diseases, and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1932, Kimball began {{suffering}} from boils and <b>infectious</b> sores, which plagued him until {{the advent of}} antibacterial medicines such as sulfonamides and penicillin during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Both {{envelope}}d and unenveloped virions are <b>infectious.</b> The {{viral envelope}} {{is made of}} modified Golgi membranes containing viral-specific polypeptides, including hemagglutinin. Infection with either variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as <b>infectious</b> diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an <b>infectious</b> disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Generally, Manasa is worshiped {{without an}} image. A {{branch of a}} tree, an earthen pot or an earthen snake image is worshiped as the goddess, though images of Manasa are worshipped too. She is worshiped for {{protection}} from and cure of snake bites and <b>infectious</b> diseases like smallpox and chicken pox.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS {{research}} {{includes all}} medical research {{that attempts to}} prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, as well as fundamental research {{about the nature of}} HIV as an <b>infectious</b> agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.|$|E
5|$|I've liked Tommy {{for a long}} time. He's clever, <b>infectious,</b> {{enthusiastic}} and a hard worker. He can play as a centre-forward, behind the centre-forward or out wide, so covers a lot of positions. He's {{going to be a}} great asset to us.|$|E
5|$|In generic sense, {{vaccination}} {{works by}} priming {{the immune system}} with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, via use of an <b>infectious</b> agent, is known as immunization. The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.|$|E
5|$|<b>Infectious</b> {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are <b>infectious</b> by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to <b>infectious</b> status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} {{drugs in}} use target {{different stages of}} the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on a proteolytic enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for it to become fully <b>infectious.</b> There is a large class of drugs called protease inhibitors that inactivate this enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} drugs target {{different stages}} of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the virus to become <b>infectious.</b> There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.|$|E
5|$|People with <b>infectious</b> {{pneumonia}} {{often have}} a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing. In the elderly, confusion {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E
5|$|Practically, several {{immunodiagnostic}} methods {{based on}} detection of complex antigen-antibody {{are used to}} diagnose <b>infectious</b> diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic immunoassay. Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox was an <b>infectious</b> disease {{caused by}} one of two virus variants, Variola major or Variola minor. The last {{naturally}} occurring case of smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed on 26 October 1977.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are <b>infectious</b> immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of <b>infectious</b> diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Infectious</b> Disease Society of America {{recommends}} against {{empirical treatment}} and considers antibiotics only appropriate when given after a positive test. Testing {{is not needed}} in children under three as both group A strep and rheumatic fever are rare, unless a child has a sibling with the disease.|$|E
5|$|The band {{released}} its fourth album, Friends, on 7 October 2016, after first being reported on in 2015. In December 2015 the band signed to <b>Infectious</b> Music.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} {{is the most}} {{frequent}} <b>infectious</b> disease in humans. The average adult gets two to four colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight. They occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have been with humanity throughout history.|$|E
5|$|The <b>infectious</b> isoform of PrP, {{known as}} PrPSc, {{is able to}} convert normal PrPC {{proteins}} into the <b>infectious</b> isoform by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes prion disease. Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has {{a higher proportion of}} β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process. The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the <b>infectious</b> PrPSc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in <b>infectious</b> material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the <b>infectious</b> form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|These {{tests are}} useful {{in a range of}} medical specialisms, {{including}} <b>infectious</b> disease, oncology, human leucocyte antigen typing (which investigates and predicts immune function), coagulation, and pharmacogenomicsthe genetic prediction of which drugs will work best. They overlap with clinical chemistry (medical tests on bodily fluids).|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} had <b>infectious</b> saliva used to kill its prey. This theory was first {{proposed}} by William Abler. Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly, <b>infectious</b> bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have. Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor's teeth, which are rounded. All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria, so the prospect of it {{being used as a}} method of predation is disputable.|$|E
5|$|Whether prions cause {{disease or}} are merely a symptom {{caused by a}} {{different}} agent is still debated by a minority of researchers. The following sections describe several hypotheses: Some pertain to {{the composition of the}} <b>infectious</b> agent (protein-only, protein with other components, virus, or other), while others pertain to its mechanism of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|With {{the decline}} of the whaling {{industry}} and the California Gold Rush, in the late 1840s, Hawaii's population dropped, and <b>infectious</b> disease epidemics contributed to the loss of local populations.|$|E
