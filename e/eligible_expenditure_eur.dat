40|$|The {{personal}} income tax systems in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere permit deductions or tax credits for out-of-pocket health care expenditures and private medical insurance premiums. Little {{is known about the}} effects of such tax measures on individual behaviour, in contrast to the extensive research on the tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance. In this paper, we exploit variation in the after-tax cost of health expenditures under the tax law to estimate the tax price elasticity of demand for prescription drugs, health insurance, and other <b>eligible</b> <b>expenditures.</b> We find evidence of moderate to large tax price elasticities, compared with traditional point-of-service price elasticity estimates - despite the apparent differences in the way tax subsidies are experienced by consumers. In contrast, we find no evidence the tax subsidy affects demand for health insurance on the intensive margin, which we show is consistent with the theory of optimal self-insurance. We discuss the implications of our results for recent proposals to reform public and private health insurance systems. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper derives {{analytical}} expressions for {{the revenue}} elasticity of the Spanish {{personal income tax}} system, as applied to tax units and in aggregate. This {{is complicated by the}} schedular nature of the system, and the role of central and regional governments, along with the existence of a range of tax credits and <b>eligible</b> <b>expenditures</b> and deductions. Empirical estimates are obtained using a cros -sectional dataset which enables a number of important ancillary elasticities (relating to allowances and tax credits, and different income sources) to be estimated. It was found that there is considerable variation among tax units in the revenue elasticity, with highly (positively) skewed distributions. The nature of the distributions varies among regions of Spain, and the aggregate elasticities for each region were found to display some variation associated with income distribution differences. The national aggregate is found to be around 1. 3. The paper also derives aggregate tax revenue as a function of characteristics of the distribution of taxable income in each region. This allows the sources of revenue differences among regions to be identified. ...|$|R
40|$|Student {{access to}} arts education, {{and the quality}} of such {{instruction}} in the nation’s public schools, continue to be of concern to policymakers, educators, and families. Specifically, research has focused on the questions: To what extent do students receive instruction in the arts? Under what conditions is the instruction provided? The passing of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was a significant move by the Senate, as they had not considered K- 12 public education legislation on the Senate floor since 2001. Under this federal law, the arts are included as part of a “well-rounded education” requiring that the arts have equal billing with reading, math, science, and other disciplines in K- 12 public education. This designation is an acknowledgement of the relevance of the arts in a complete education and means that the arts may be an <b>eligible</b> <b>expenditure</b> of funds for federal education programs (Davidson, B., Kahn, G., 2 ̆ 6 Fitzsimons, I., 2015, p. 2).

40|$|In several countries, {{personal}} income tax permits tax credits for out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure. Tax credits benefit taxpayers at all income levels by reducing their net tax liability and modify the price of out-of-pocket expenditure. To the extent that consumer demand is price elastic, they may influence the amount of <b>eligible</b> healthcare <b>expenditure</b> for which taxpayers may claim a credit. These effects influence, in turn, income distributions and taxpayers’ health status and therefore income-related inequality in health. Redistributive consequences of tax credits have been widely investigated. However, {{little is known about}} the ability of tax credits to alleviate health inequality. In this paper, we study the potential effects that tax credits for health expenses may have on income-related inequality in health status with reference to the Italian institutional setting. The analysis is performed using a tax-benefit microsimulation model that reproduces the {{personal income}} tax and incorporates taxpayers’ behavioral responses to changes in tax credit rate. Our results suggest that the current healthcare tax credit design tends to favor the richest part of the population...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to identify, from a health care perspective, the cost of {{treatment}} for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in specialized hospitals in Ukraine. MethodsCost analysis was performed by using retrospective data between 2006 and 2010 from patient-file databases of two specialized hospitals (145 patients). Uncertainty was assessed by using bootstrapping and multivariate sensitivity analyses. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze whether patients’ characteristics are related to health care costs. In addition, one-way analysis of variance (Welch test) and paired-sample t test were conducted to compare mean costs of treatment between the two hospitals and mean expenses for drugs and in-hospital stay. ResultsThe average annual cost for a patient’s drug treatment is 2047 EUR. The cost of hospitalization was significantly lower (t = 5. 026; significance two-tailed = 0. 000) and equal to 541 EUR per person, resulting in total <b>expenditures</b> of 2589 <b>EUR.</b> Mean total costs in the bootstrap analysis were equal to 2584 EUR (median 2576 EUR, 97. 5 th percentile 3223 EUR; 2. 5 th percentile 1987 EUR). The regression analysis did not reveal a relation between patients’ characteristics and health care costs, although hospital choice was an influential parameter (β = − 0. 260; significance = 0. 002). Significant difference in mean costs of two analyzed hospitals was also confirmed by one-way analysis of variance (Welch statistics 19. 222, P = 0. 000). ConclusionsDrug treatment comprises the largest portion of total costs, but differences between hospitals exist. Because many patients in Ukraine pay out of pocket for in-hospital drugs, these costs are a high economic burden for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia...|$|R
