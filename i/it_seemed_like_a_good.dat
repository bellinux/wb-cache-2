500|$|The Bold Bank Robbery was {{inspired}} by and created after {{the success of the}} 1903 western film The Great Train Robbery; other inspirations included American and European crime films. Lubin Manufacturing Company had been known to produce films similar to other popular ones; film historian Kemp R. Niver observed that [...] "if <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea, and other film producers were making money, 'Pop' Lubin simply appropriated the title and remade or duped the motion picture." [...] Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film on July 25, 1904. The finished product comprised 600 feet (182 m) of film.|$|E
2500|$|While it was {{generally}} thought that Henry Cow took their name from 20th-century American composer Henry Cowell, this has been repeatedly denied by band members. According to Hodgkinson, the name [...] "Henry Cow" [...] was [...] "in the air" [...] in 1968, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> name for the band. It had no connection to anything.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{had more}} {{material}} than the required 40-odd minutes for one album.

60|$|The {{room was}} chill {{and cold and}} gray. It had only two small windows. Its doors were low. Even Mrs. Field was forced to stoop in entering. This helped to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> den. There were roller-towels {{in the corner and}} wash-basins, and a {{grindstone}} which made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> barn. <b>It</b> was, in fact, more cheerless than a barn, and less wholesome.|$|R
2500|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of the Philippines during World War II, Aguinaldo cooperated with the Japanese, making speeches, issuing articles and radio addresses {{in support of the}} Japanese—including a radio appeal to Gen. Douglas MacArthur on Corregidor to surrender in order to [...] "spare the innocence of the Filipino youth." [...] He explained his action by saying, [...] "I was just remembering the fight I led. We were outnumbered, too, in constant retreat. I saw my own soldiers die without affecting future events. To me that seemed to be what was happening on Bataan, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing to stop." [...] After the combined American and Filipino troops retook the Philippines in 1945, Aguinaldo was arrested along with several others accused of collaboration with the Japanese, and jailed for some months in Bilibid prison. He was released by presidential amnesty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
