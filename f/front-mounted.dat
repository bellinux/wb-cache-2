5|$|As the Hood {{has managed}} to evade the authorities, Scott leaves him to IR's London agent, Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward (Sylvia Anderson). Chasing the enemy in their specially-modified Rolls-Royce, FAB 1, Penelope and her butler, Parker (Graham), blast him off the {{motorway}} using the car's <b>front-mounted</b> machine gun. Although the Hood survives the encounter, his photographs are destroyed.|$|E
25|$|At {{around the}} same time, Stephenson experimented with <b>front-mounted</b> cylinders. The {{unsuccessful}} 0-4-0 Invicta, built in 1829 immediately after Rocket, still had them at an angle. The successful 2-2-0 locomotive Planet (1830) had internal <b>front-mounted</b> cylinders set to the horizontal.|$|E

25|$|The Mark VII, {{launched}} in 1996, {{was the final}} version of the original two-door Mini. For this model twin point injection with <b>front-mounted</b> radiator was introduced, along with a full-width dashboard and driver's side airbag.|$|E
25|$|M-84AI – Armoured {{recovery}} vehicle created from the chassis of a M-84A. Completed {{with the help}} of Polish experts, resulting in a vehicle similar to the WZT-3. Standard equipment includes: A TD-50 crane, <b>front-mounted</b> stabilizing dozer blade, main and secondary winches.|$|E
50|$|Inexpensive leaf-shutter cameras also {{benefited from}} behind-the-lens {{metering}} as, Topcon introduced the Auto 100 with <b>front-mount</b> interchangeable lenses designed only for that camera, {{and one of}} the Zeiss Ikon Contaflex leaf shutter cameras. Kowa manufactured their SET-R, which had similar specifications.|$|R

25|$|When first built, the car used a Napier Lion {{engine of}} around 500bhp. It was of {{conventional}} form with a <b>front-mounted</b> vertical radiator {{and the driver}} behind the engine. The three banks of the W-12 engine were hidden behind bulges in the narrow bonnet, with exhaust stub pipes protruding.|$|E
25|$|These light utility {{vehicles}} were available with three engines: a Vortec 7.4-liter V8, a 5.7-liter V8, or Detroit Diesel 6.5 L V8. Each engine was {{coupled with a}} 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. All CUCV IIs have full-time all-wheel drive; a <b>front-mounted</b> winch was available as an option.|$|E
25|$|The MKR15 {{recovery}} variant {{is able to}} flat tow a 110,000 pound (49895kg) vehicle, is able to {{lift and}} tow a 96,000-pound (43545kg) vehicle, is equipped with rear-mounted winches with a 78,000 pound (35380kg) combined straight-pull rating, and a <b>front-mounted</b> self-recovery winch with a 20,000-pound (9072kg) straight-pull rating.|$|E
50|$|A big {{advantage}} of the air-to-liquid setup is the lower overall pipe and intercooler length, which offers faster response (lowers turbo lag) , giving peak boost faster than most <b>front-mount</b> intercooler setups. Some setups have reservoirs that can hold ice, producing intake temperatures lower than ambient air, giving a {{big advantage}} (but of course, ice would need constant replacement).|$|R
50|$|All Seras {{came with}} the 1.5 L (1496 cc) inline 4 5E-FHE {{unleaded}} petrol engine, the largest capacity version of Toyota's E series of engines included in other Toyota vehicles such as the Paseo and the Starlet. This was installed in a <b>front-mount,</b> front wheel drive transverse configuration with electronic fuel injection. All versions came with power assisted {{rack and pinion steering}} and either the Toyota A242L 4-speed automatic or the Toyota C155 5-speed manual transmission. The brakes were vented discs at the front and drums at the rear, unless fitted with the optional Anti-Lock Braking system which had vented discs all round.|$|R
5000|$|The {{label of}} the discs {{featured}} artwork depicting a Native American with a smoking pipe {{listening to a}} <b>front-mount</b> disc phonograph of undetermined manufacture; American Record Company advertising commonly marketed them as [...] "Indian Records". Several variations of the [...] "Indian" [...] label exist, differing only in minor details. Most ARCo records are single sided; with their double-sided records, apparently the combination of sides were randomly chosen. The company would press any two sides paired, if the buyer met the minimum-order qualification. These records are notable for being blue in color, rather than the usual black, pressed from a shellac compound called Empedite which reputedly delivered better sound quality than standard black shellac. The records {{appear to have been}} numbered using a sequence which began at 030000; the highest number known is 031435. The records exist in 7-inch, 10-inch and 10.75-inch sizes, with the latter size being derived from its connection with Odeon, which also used that size. The seven-inch discs used a different numbering sequence and seem to have only been produced for a short time. Some export pressings for Britain carried the [...] "American Odeon Record" [...] logo.|$|R
25|$|Utility {{bicycles}} {{have many}} standard features {{to enhance their}} usefulness and comfort. Chain guards and mudguards, or fenders, protect clothes and moving parts from oil and spray. Kick stands help with parking. <b>Front-mounted</b> wicker or steel baskets for carrying goods are often used. Rear luggage carriers {{can be used to}} carry items such as school satchels.|$|E
25|$|Based on the A6 platform, the RS6's {{internal}} combustion engines are <b>front-mounted</b> and longitudinally oriented, while the transmission is mounted immediately {{at the rear}} of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle. Like all S and RS models, the RS6 is only available with Audi's 'trademark' Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, {{managing}} director of the Lunéville plant, Adrien, Baron de Turckheim, bought the rights to a design by Amédée Bollée. This used a <b>front-mounted</b> horizontal twin engine with sliding clutches and belt drive. It had a folding top, three acetylene headlights, and, very unusual for the period, plate glass windshield. While the company started out using engines from Bollée, de Dietrich eventually produced the entire vehicle themselves.|$|E
25|$|The Panhard 24 is {{a compact}} two-door coupé {{automobile}} produced between 1964 and 1967 by French manufacturer Panhard. It was {{powered by a}} <b>front-mounted</b> air-cooled two-cylinder boxer motor: the basic design of this unconventional engine dated back to the 1940s. In 1965 a lengthened Panhard 24 was launched and promoted as a two-door four- or five-seat saloon. Plans for a four-door version which might have enabled the car more effectively to replace the commercially successful Panhard PL 17 saloon were never implemented, however.|$|E
25|$|The AEC Routemaster is a front-engined {{double-decker}} bus {{that was designed}} by London Transport and built by the Associated Equipment Company (AEC) and Park Royal Vehicles. The first prototype was completed in September 1954 {{and the last one}} was delivered in 1968. The layout of the vehicle was traditional for the time, with a half-cab, <b>front-mounted</b> engine and open rear platform, although the coach version was fitted with rear platform doors. Forward entrance vehicles with platform doors were also produced as was a unique front-entrance prototype with the engine mounted transversely at the rear.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Type 94 {{was based on the}} British Carden-Loyd Mark VIb tankettes. The hull of the Type 94 was of riveted and welded construction, with a <b>front-mounted</b> engine with the driver to the right. The engine was an {{air-cooled}} petrol motor that developed 35 hp at 2,500 rpm. Like many armored vehicles intended to operate in hot conditions, the engine was given asbestos insulation to protect the occupants from its heat. The commander stood in a small (unpowered) turret {{at the rear of the}} hull. A large door in the rear of the hull accessed the storage compartment.|$|E
25|$|After {{the removal}} of the {{sidewalks}} starting in 1943, bicyclists were able to use QBx1 buses of the Queens Surface Corporation, which could carry bicycles on the <b>front-mounted</b> bike racks. However, since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority absorbed the bus routes formerly operated by Queens Surface, the bike racks have been eliminated, though the MTA will reintroduce bike racks on Q50 Limited (the successor route to the QBx1) buses in spring 2018. For the time being, bicyclists are now forced to detour to the Triborough Bridge. Whether a new bikeway or walkway will be reconstructed on the bridge in the future is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|These were 30ft single deckers with twin-steering front axles. The Gnu had a <b>front-mounted</b> {{vertical}} engine and either front or central doors. The TEP1 sold three, two to Scottish operator Walter Alexander who built 41-seat front entrance bus and coach bodies, {{the first one}} a 1937 Earls' Court show exhibit. The other one went to City Coach Company of Brentwood Essex, who fitted a centre-door 43-seat Duple body. City had bought large numbers of three-axle Tigers and was the only customer for the TEC2 Gnu, designed for centre-entrance bodywork, and having much {{more in common with}} the Leyland Steer lorry.|$|E
25|$|Non-stop London to Edinburgh train runs had {{previously}} {{featured in the}} British Transport Films (BTF) production Elizabethan Express filmed {{in the summer of}} 1953, hauled by the LNER A4 Class No. 60017 Silver Fox, and the BBC's own film of the 1968 anniversary run. For the 2009 film Tornado was fitted with multiple miniature cameras around the locomotive and inside the cab, and using one <b>front-mounted</b> camera attached to the red buffer beam, raising the possibility of any footage gained being used to produce a modern-day version of the famous 1952 BTF film London to Brighton in Four Minutes, a four-minute long speeded up view of the railway route from London to Brighton as viewed {{from the front of the}} Brighton Belle.|$|E
25|$|An {{autogyro}} (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), {{also known}} as gyroplane, gyrocopter, or rotaplane, {{is a type of}} rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift, and an engine-powered propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the rotor disc to generate rotation. Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. De la Cierva's aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a <b>front-mounted</b> engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air.|$|E
25|$|The Labrador {{was fitted}} with a {{watertight}} hull for marine landings, a 5,000 kilogram cargo hook and an external rescue hoist mounted over the right front door. It featured a 1,110 kilometer flying range, emergency medical equipment and an 18-person passenger capacity. By the 1990s, heavy use and hostile weather conditions had taken their toll on the Labrador fleet, resulting in increasing maintenance costs {{and the need for}} prompt replacement. In 1981, a mid-life upgrade of the fleet was carried out by Boeing Canada in Arnprior, Ontario. Known as the SAR-CUP (Search and Rescue Capability Upgrade Program), the refit scheme included new instrumentation, a nose-mounted weather radar, a tail-mounted auxiliary power unit, a new high-speed rescue hoist mounted over the side door and <b>front-mounted</b> searchlights. A total of six CH-113s and five CH-113As were upgraded with the last delivered in 1984.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a {{relatively}} advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s many small Western cars (such as the Renault) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder four-stroke engine. The Trabant had a front, transversely-mounted engine and front-wheel drive {{in an era when}} many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or <b>front-mounted</b> engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car's two-stroke engine made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Some components, {{which are}} often {{optional}} accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. Mudguards, or fenders, protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas and chainguards protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and crankset teeth. Kick stands keep bicycles upright when parked, and bike locks deter theft. <b>Front-mounted</b> baskets, front or rear luggage carriers or racks, and panniers mounted above either or both wheels {{can be used to}} carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. Training wheels are sometimes used when learning to ride.|$|E
25|$|The flight school {{moved in}} November 1911 to a farm leased near Augusta, Georgia, hoping to {{continue}} flying {{there during the}} winter. Training was limited by rain and flooding, and they returned to Maryland in May 1912. Arnold began to develop a phobia about flying, intensified by Al Welsh's fatal crash at College Park on June 11. In August Arnold was at Marblehead, Massachusetts, with 1st Lt. Roy C. Kirtland conducting acceptance tests of the Burgess Model H, an enclosed-fuselage tandem-seat seaplane and the Army's first tractor (<b>front-mounted</b> propeller and engine). The pair received orders to fly the new aircraft to Bridgeport, Connecticut to participate in maneuvers but high winds forced them to land on Massachusetts Bay on August 12. Attempting to take off again, Arnold caught a wing tip in the water turning into the wind and crashed into the bay off Plymouth. Arnold suffered a lacerated chin during the mishap but the aircraft was salvaged and repaired. Another crash at College Park on September 18 killed 2nd Lt. Lewis Rockwell, an academy classmate of Arnold's.|$|E
25|$|M-55S - T-55 {{modernization}} {{developed by}} the STO RAVNE company and engineers of the Israeli company Elbit. Slovenia modernized 30 T-55 tanks in the inventory of its armed forces. The last T-55 was modernized to the M-55S standard in May 1999. The original 100mm tank gun {{was replaced by the}} 105mm one with a thermal sleeve. The armour protection of the tank was improved considerably by attaching Rafael ERA blocks to the hull and the turret. A digital ballistic computer was installed in order to improve the fire control system (FCS). The gunner has the Fotona SGS-55 two-axis stabilized day-and-night sight with an integral laser rangefinder. In addition to the integral optic sight the commander has the Fotona COMTOS-55 sight with an independent line-of-sight stabilization, which allows him to acquire targets and lay the gun independently if required. The driver has the Fotona CODRIS combined day/night observation periscope. The LIRD-1A laser illumination warning receiver was mated with <b>front-mounted</b> IS-6 smoke grenade launchers (of which there are six in two clusters, one per side of the turret) and can be automatically activated in an emergency. Modernization of the V-12 diesel engine resulted in an increase in power from 520hp to 600hp. The running gear has rubber side skirts and the tank was outfitted with new rubber and metal tracks. Improvements were also made to the communications aids.|$|E
500|$|Manufacturing a car {{powered by}} a competitor's engine was {{unacceptable}} to the new owner, but Chrysler's own 273 small-block V-8 was too large to fit under the Tiger's bonnet without major modifications. Compounding the problem, the company's small-block V8 engines had the distributor positioned at the rear, unlike the <b>front-mounted</b> distributor of the Ford V8. Chrysler's big-block V8 had a <b>front-mounted</b> distributor but was significantly larger. Shortly after the takeover Chrysler ordered that production of the Tiger was to end when Rootes' stock of Ford V8 engines was exhausted; Jensen assembled the last Tiger on 27 June 1967. Chrysler added its pentastar logo to the car's badging, and in its marketing literature de-emphasised the Ford connection, simply describing the Tiger as having [...] "an American V-8 power train".|$|E
500|$|The , water-cooled, , inline 4-cylinder Praga engine used a gasoline-alcohol mix. It had a {{top speed}} on the road of [...] and about [...] cross-country. One [...] fuel tank was located {{on each side of}} the engine. The {{transmission}} had four forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the <b>front-mounted</b> drive sprockets.|$|E
500|$|Planning for the Cycle Center {{was part}} of the larger [...] "Bike 2010 Plan", in which the city aimed to make itself more {{accommodating}} to bicycle commuters. This plan (now replaced by the [...] "Bike 2015 Plan") included provisions for <b>front-mounted</b> two-bike carriers on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on Chicago 'L' trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area's other mass transit providers, Metra and Pace, have developed increased bike accessibility. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. McDonald's controversially claimed that, since it is providing a healthier menu and fostering grade school physical education in an effort to help its customers improve their health, sponsoring bicycle and exercise activity in the park augments the company's other initiatives.|$|E
