However, little information is available on the behavior of epoxy‐repaired timber during a fire. To evaluate this behavior for repaired truss joints, an experimental and theoretical investigation was conducted.

At first, LVL panels were manufactured with nine layers of wood veneer glued with phenol-formaldehyde resin. After, they were reinforced with fiberglass impregnated with epoxy or isophthalic resin or with isophthalic resin. The treatments consisted on the aplication of one, two and four reinforced layers. The properties tested were density, moisture content, static bending in flatwise and edgewise position, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), <b>glue</b> <b>line</b> shear strength by compression loading. The epoxy and the isophthalic resin showed the same mechanical qualities among different treatments. MOE panel in flatwise position was influenced by one reinforcement layer and MOR was influenced by two reinforcement layers. In the edgewise position, MOE and MOR values remained stable among the treatments with two fiberglass reinforcement layers. The epoxy resin presented higher <b>glue</b> <b>line</b> resistance and higher percentage of wood failure. Isophthalic and phenolic resin presented similar values of <b>glue</b> <b>line</b> strength.

Thus, the bamboo stems were treated by immersion method with chemical product (solution of 1 % of active ingredients of copper chrome borate - CCB) and water by 15 days. Before treating the stems, the external and internal parts were removed to obtain the flat strips of bamboo with 4 mm of thickness, 45 cm of length and 5 cm of width. The "Cascophen RS" (resorcinol-formaldehyde) and "Cascorez-extra" (polyvinyl acetate) commercial adhesives were used to bond the flat strips.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{alkaline}} copper quaternary (ACQ) preservative treatment and of plywood <b>glue</b> <b>lines</b> on resistance-based moisture content (MC) measurements. Moisture meter readings using stainless steel screws as electrodes were acquired over a range of moisture conditions in Southern Yellow Pine (SYP) lumber and plywood. Calibration equations are presented for predicting gravimetric MC from meter readings taken in SYP lumber and SYP plywood with or without ACQ treatment. These corrections assume that the meter has been set for SYP. Correlation equations are also presented for directly relating resistance to gravimetric MC, which may be useful for automated data collection systems employed in monitoring moisture levels in buildings. The conductance of SYP lumber was raised by treatment with ACQ, particularly at higher moisture contents, but was unaffected by vacuum-pressure treatment with water. The conductance of untreated SYP plywood, measured with electrodes penetrating the <b>glue</b> <b>lines,</b> exceeded that of untreated SYP lumber. The conductance of SYP plywood was lowered by treatment with ACQ, by vacuum-pressure soaking with water, and by exposure to rain. We suggest that electrolytes in the plywood <b>glue</b> <b>lines</b> increase the conductance of untreated plywood relative to that of untreated lumber, and that the concentration of these electrolytes is lowered by the (aqueous) preservative treatment process, thereby lowering the conductance of these high-conductance pathways...|$|R

The 360 specimens were prepared for determining the shear strength of edge glued panels of Pinus taeda, and these were tested in a universal testing machine called EMIC.

The presence of unbonded areas in the <b>glue</b> <b>line</b> due to manufacturing faults or deterioration in bond in some of the originally fully bonded areas due to aging is a possibility in a FRP structure consisting of glue-laminated fibre composite sandwich beams.
