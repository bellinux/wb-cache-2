5|$|Georges, the {{youngest}} of eight children, was born on , 1887, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Jacques Vézina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara. Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi {{until the age of}} fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery. He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age. Vézina partook in these matches <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes,</b> and used skates {{for the first time at}} age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi. As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec, more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Rather the club, known as the Saguenéens ("People from the Saguenay", the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1887, Bogan {{was convicted}} of murder, and sentenced to death. However, Bogan still had several friends in cowboy circles, namely Tom Hall, whom famed Old West detective Charlie Siringo would later {{identify}} as having actually been Tom Nicholls, a murderer from the Texas Panhandle. Hall paid professional safecracker James Jones to commit a minor crime in Cheyenne, and to allow himself to be captured, thus being placed in jail with Bogan. Concealed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> Jones had saw blades, which he and Bogan used to saw through the bars and make an escape on October 4, 1887. Joined by fellow prisoners Charles H. LeRoy and Bill Steary, both horse thieves, they made their escape through a ventilator and onto the roof. Within hours a posse was organised {{in one of the}} largest manhunts in Wyoming history.|$|E

500|$|For the show's 100th episode, [...] "Mercy", which {{aired on}} October 22, 2017, {{executive}} producers Greg Nicotero and Scott M. Gimple {{wanted to create}} callbacks to this episode. Specifically, the episode included a near shot-for-shot remake of Rick searching for supplies among abandoned cars, though in this case, with Carl <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes.</b> For this, they recast Addy Miller, now a teenager, as a walker that threatens Rick and Carl. They also recast Joe Giles, who plays one of the walkers that followed Rick off the bus in Atlanta, as a walker in [...] "Mercy". Additional scenes from [...] "Mercy", apparently set in the future, were done to mirror the shots of Rick waking up from his coma in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Digital Domain, Scanline VFX and Trixter each {{worked on}} {{separate}} shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared {{some of their}} files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, Legacy Effects constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that [...] "Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put tracking markers on his trousers. He would also wear lifts <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, Canon C300s, and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character." [...] The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the aurora borealis as reference for {{the effect of the}} glowing Extremis characters.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{influential}} person as Hadlee developed and through {{his career was}} Dennis Lillee as the epitome of what fast bowling was all about. [...] "He was big, strong, fit, confident, aggressive, had marvelous skills, great technique, he intimidated the batsmen with sheer presence {{and of course he}} got you out!" [...] In tough times Hadlee put himself <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> and thought, [...] "what would Lillee do?". The sure answer was he would never give up. In his book Menace, Lillee believed that determination was the greatest contribution to his success. Of Hadlee he considers him super skillful, the first true professional he saw in tests with serial away swingers on off stump with the occasional inswinger or cutter, the odd bouncer and a very rare yorker.|$|E

2500|$|His undated poem, Mi último adiós {{believed}} to be written {{a few days before}} his execution, was hidden in an alcohol stove, which was later handed to his family with his few remaining possessions, including the final letters and his last bequests. During their visit, Rizal reminded his sisters in English, [...] "There is something inside it", referring to the alcohol stove given by the Pardo de Taveras which was to be returned after his execution, thereby emphasizing the importance of the poem. This instruction was followed by another, [...] "Look in my shoes", in which another item was secreted. Exhumation of his remains in August 1898, under American rule, revealed he had been uncoffined, his burial not on sanctified ground granted the 'confessed' faithful, and whatever was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> had disintegrated. And now he is buried in Rizal Monument in Manila.|$|E
2500|$|However, as Powell explained, Tricia's secret did {{not stay}} hidden for long. [...] "It's truly awful. It comes out because Mark is sorting out Frank's life {{insurance}} {{and the insurance}} company wants {{to see all of}} his medical notes. Tricia is nervous that Mark will find Frank had a paternity test, so she gets all his records and gives them to Mark in a sealed envelope. But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left to deal with the hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. I know that if I were <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes,</b> I certainly wouldn't tell her. It doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{only one}} supermax prison in the United States federal system, ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. [...] It houses several inmates who {{have a history of}} violent {{behavior}} in other prisons, with the goal of moving them from solitary confinement for 23 hours a day to a less restrictive prison within three years. [...] However, it is best known for housing several inmates who have been deemed either too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. [...] Residents include Timothy McVeigh, perpetrator of the Oklahoma City Bombing who was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute on June 11, 2001; Theodore Kaczynski, a domestic terrorist otherwise known as the Unabomber, who once attacked via mail bombs; Robert Hanssen, an American FBI agent turned Soviet spy; Terry Nichols, McVeigh's accomplice in the Oklahoma City Bombing; Richard Reid, known as the [...] "Shoe Bomber", who was jailed for life for attempting to detonate explosive materials <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> while on board an aircraft; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the underwear bomber; Richard Lee McNair, a persistent prison escapee; Charles Harrelson, a hitman who was convicted in 1979 of killing Federal Judge John H. Wood Jr.; and Vito Rizzuto, boss of the [...] "Sixth" [...] Mafia [...] "Family," [...] released on October 5, 2012. The maximum security facility in Colorado is the only federal Super Max in the United States. It is reserved for federal crimes. The Boston Marathon Bomber was housed there. Deprivation of social contact and the isolation of inmates has some unintended positive and negative effects. Inmates are safer being in isolation, and prisons create more jobs for their local communities. Super max prisons however are extremely expensive to run and can cost about three times the national average for a maximum security facility.|$|E
