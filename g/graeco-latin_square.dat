30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} and {{implement}} a speaker-dependent model interpolation method for HMM-based emotional speech synthesis. We use a novel MBMD measure to decide the interpolation model sets and weights. Comprehensive evaluation with subjective listening tests randomized by the Latin and <b>Graeco-Latin</b> <b>squares</b> to avoid systematic biases are carried out. The proposed model interpolation method has an intrinsic tradeoff between emotional expressiveness and similarity. Therefore, it is quite difficult to achieve both goals {{within the framework of}} interpolation. This {{can be seen as a}} drawback resulting from not using any emotional speech of the target speaker. Experiment results show that our method strikes a good balance between the emotional expressiveness, the naturalness, and the speaker identity. Additionally, our method does not require the emotional speech of new speakers, and can save enormous data collection and labeling costs. In the future, it will be interesting to compare the synthesized emotional speech with the non-synthetic emotional speech, with data collected from the target speaker, to further improve the performance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{content of}} Perec's novel was partly {{generated}} by 42 lists, each containing 10 elements (e.g. the [...] "Fabrics" [...] list contains ten different fabrics). Perec used <b>Graeco-Latin</b> <b>squares</b> or [...] "bi-squares" [...] to distribute these elements across the 99 {{chapters of the}} book. A bi-square {{is similar to a}} sudoku puzzle, though more complicated, as two lists of elements must be distributed across the grid. In the pictured example, these two lists are the first three letters of the Greek and Latin alphabets; each cell contains a Greek and a Latin character, and, as in a sudoku, each row and column of the grid also contains each character exactly once. Using the same principle, Perec created 21 bi-squares, each distributing two lists of 10 elements. This allowed Perec to distribute all 42 of his 10-element lists across the 99 chapters. Any given cell on the 10x10 map of the apartment block could be cross-referenced with the equivalent cell on each of the 21 bi-squares, for each chapter a unique list of 42 elements to mention could be produced.|$|R
50|$|The 36 Cube is a {{three-dimensional}} sudoku puzzle created by ThinkFun. The puzzle {{consists of a}} gray base that resembles a city skyline, plus 36 colored towers. The towers come in six different colors and six different heights. The goal of the puzzle is to place all the towers onto the base so as to form a level cube {{with each of the}} six colors appearing once, and only once, in each row and column. The 36 cube was invented by Dr. Derrick Niederman, a PhD. at MIT. He {{came up with the idea}} while writing a book on whole numbers, after unearthing an 18th-century mathematical hypothesis. This supposition, the 36 officer problem, requires placing six regiments of six differently ranked officers in a 6-x-6 square without having any rank or regiment in the same column. Such an arrangement would form a <b>Graeco-Latin</b> <b>square.</b> Euler conjectured there was no solution to this problem.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} reliably setting genetic algorithm parameters for consistent labelling problems. Genetic algorithm parameters are notoriously difficult to determine. This paper proposes a robust empirical framework, based on the analysis of factorial experiments. The use of a <b>graeco-latin</b> <b>square</b> permits an initial study {{of a wide range}} of parameter settings. This is followed by fully crossed factorial experiments with narrower ranges, which allow detailed analysis by logistic regression. The empirical models thus derived can be used first to determine optimal algorithm parameters, and second to shed light on interactions between the parameters and their relative importance. The initial models do not extrapolate well. However, an advantage of this approach is that the modelling process is under the control of the experimenter, and is hence very flexible. Refined models are produced, which are shown to be robust under extrapolation to up to triple the problem size...|$|E
40|$|Some experimentation, {{particularly}} on trees in orchards, requires the superimposition Of {{a new set}} of treatments on an existing experiment, {{on the assumption that the}} effects of the new treatments do not interact with those of the old. Different approaches to the randomization of such new treatments were considered by Preece, Bailey and Patterson, who investigated in detail the case when one Latin square is superimposed on another to produce a <b>Graeco-Latin</b> <b>square.</b> For non-orthogonal superimpositions the theory is in general much more complicated. However, this paper shows that fairly simple randomization results are obtainable for certain balanced superimpositions of one Youden square on another (i) when each Youden square is of size (t - 1) x t and (ii) when each Youden square is of size k x t, where t is a prime power of the form 4 s - 1 and k = 2 s - 1 or k = 2 s. In each case, t is the number of treatments in each Youden square. The valid randomization procedure obtained for the second case is unlike any previously known randomization procedure and is unlikely to be acceptable in practice; it is, however, an excellent indication of the difficulties that arise when randomization is attempted in unusual circumstances...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Considerable {{evidence}} suggests that food impacts both the gastro-intestinal (GI) function and the microbial ecology of the canine GI tract. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of high-carbohydrate (HC), high-protein (HP) and dry commercial (DC) diets on the canine colonic microbiota in Beagle dogs. Diets were allocated according to the <b>Graeco-Latin</b> <b>square</b> design. For this purpose, microbial DNA was isolated from faecal samples and separated by density gradient centrifugation, resulting in specific profiling based on the guanine-cytosine content (%G[*]+[*]C). In addition, 16 [*]S rRNA gene amplicons were obtained from the most abundant %G[*]+[*]C peaks and analysed by sequence analysis, producing a total of 720 non-redundant sequences (240 sequences per diet). Results The DC diet sample showed high abundance of representatives of the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, Coriobacteriales and Bacteroidales. Sequence diversity was highest for DC diet samples and included representatives of the orders Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales, which were not detected in samples from the HP and HC diets. These latter two diets also had reduced levels of representatives of the family Lachnospiraceae, specifically Clostridial cluster XIVa. The HC diet favoured representatives of the order Erysipelotrichales, more specifically the Clostridial cluster XVIII, while the HP diet favoured representatives of the order Fusobacteriales. Conclusions This study detected Coriobacteriales in dog faeces, possibly due to the non-selective nature of the %G[*]+[*]C profiling method used in combination with sequencing. Moreover, our work demonstrates that the effect of diet on faecal microbiota can be explained based on the metabolic properties of the detected microbial taxa. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{suggests}} that dietary composition influences gastrointestinal function and bacteria-derived metabolic {{products in the}} dog colon. We previously reported that dietary composition impacts upon the faecal microbiota of healthy dogs. This study aims at evaluating the dietary influences on bacteria-derived metabolic products associated with the changes in faecal microbiota that we had previously reported. We fed high-carbohydrate starch based (HCS), [crude protein: 194 g/kg, starch: 438 g/kg], high-protein greaves-meal (HPGM), [crude protein: 609 g/kg, starch: 54 g/kg] and dry commercial (DC), [crude protein: 264 g/kg, starch: 277 g/kg] diets, and studied their effects on the metabolism of the colonic microbiota and faecal calprotectin concentrations in five Beagle dogs, allocated according to the <b>Graeco-Latin</b> <b>square</b> design. Each dietary period lasted for three weeks and was crossed-over with washout periods. Food intake, body weight, and faecal consistency scores, dry matter, pH, ammonia, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and faecal canine calprotectin concentrations were determined. RESULTS: Faecal ammonia concentrations decreased with the HCS diet. All dogs fed the HPGM diet developed diarrhoea, which led to differences in faecal consistency scores between the diets. Faecal pH was higher with the HPGM diet. Moreover, decreases in propionic and acetic acids coupled with increases in branched-chain fatty acids and valeric acid caused changes in faecal total VFAs in dogs on the HPGM diet. Faecal canine calprotectin concentration was higher with the HPGM diet and correlated positively with valeric acid concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The HPGM diet led to diarrhoea in all dogs, and there were differences in faecal VFA profiles and faecal canine calprotectin concentration...|$|E
40|$|FOLLOWING {{the pattern}} set by Stanley (1957), this chapter omits {{almost all the}} {{references}} which have been covered by Harman (1958), Grant (1959), and Kogan (1960). Writings which have relevance to or are potentially useful for educational experimentation from either a long-range or a short-range point of view are, in general, noticed. In certain areas of experimental design and analysis, only a representative number of the many papers which actually appeared have been considered. Design and Analysis of Experiments Most of the work relative to the design and analysis of experimental results {{during the last three}} years has added to and extended standard designs and analyses. Randomized Blocks, Latin Squares, and Split-Plots The frequently employed randomized-block design was considered by Sampford and Taylor (1959) for the experimental condition where it is known only that a particular subject's response is greater or less than some value. Treatment effects and bias were estimated, and modified T-tests were derived for testing treatment differences. Mandel (1959) described a method valid for analysis of the Latin-square design under the presence of row-column interaction when the interaction can be represented by a simple multiplicative constant. Under certain experimental circumstances this technique might act to counter some of the behavioral scientists ' past objections to the use of Latin-square designs. The modified Latin square was analyzed by means of randomization theory by Rojas and White (1957). For this rarely used design they obtained the expected mean squares under randomization and found the F-ratio for treatments to be biased, but with a relatively small magnitude. The simple split-plot design was studied by Curnow (1957) as used both in a randomized block and in a <b>Graeco-Latin</b> <b>square.</b> For the special case of two split-plot units with possibly unequal error variances, he obtained a test of equality of, and confidence bands for estimating the ratio of, the two split-plot error variances.
