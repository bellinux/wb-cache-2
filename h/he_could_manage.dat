5|$|Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was {{appointed}} as his replacement, initially {{on a temporary}} basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day}} of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage.</b> At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E
5|$|The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season.

25|$|His {{domestic}} form {{suffered in}} 2004 as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> a first-class batting average of only 31.17 and just nine wickets all season. His one-day performances were even worse, {{as he passed}} fifty just once in 11 innings. In a 50 overs a side match played on 29 April Clarke hit 82 runs off only 28 balls. It included 9 Fours and 6 Sixes. It helped Surrey get to 494–5 against Gloucestershire.|$|E

25|$|McGrath {{played for}} Worcestershire in the 2000 English County Championship, proving both {{successful}} {{on the field}} and popular with the county's supporters. In 14 first-class games he took , including an outstanding innings return of 8–41 against Northamptonshire, as well as making his first ever first-class half-century (55 against Nottinghamshire). He also played a few games for Middlesex in 2004; although accurate, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> only nine wickets in four first-class appearances for the county.|$|E
25|$|Busher did {{not play}} any cricket in 1909, but August of the {{following}} year he appeared twice more for Worcestershire, against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham and against Somerset at Taunton. Worcestershire lost the former match by an innings but won the latter by 295 runs. Busher himself also experienced mixed fortunes in these games: against Gloucestershire <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> only one wicket, but after a wicketless first innings against Somerset he recorded 5-13 in the second; his last first-class wicket was that of wicket-keeper Arthur Newton.|$|E
25|$|After such a performance, Carr {{was chosen}} for two more matches that season, one of them against a Nottinghamshire team captained by his namesake Arthur Carr and the other against Lancashire. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> only 4, 28 and 2 in his three innings, however, and was no more {{successful}} (making 7, 4 and 2) in the couple of games he played in 1922. He was to play only one more first-class match, three years later against Somerset, but again he failed, making 0 and 4 in an innings defeat.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, {{the shoe}} company {{transferred}} Gacy to Springfield {{to work as}} a salesman. He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker within the department he managed. After a nine-month courtship, the couple married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Waterloo, Iowa, and Gacy and his wife moved to Waterloo so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).|$|E
25|$|In addition, Collins removed other Gould {{creations of}} the 1960s and 1970s (including Groovy Grove, who was gravely {{wounded in the}} line of duty and later died in the hospital; Lizz married him before his death). On a more {{philosophical}} level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the justice system than Gould; Tracy came to accept its limitations and requirements as a normal part of the process which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage.</b> Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the 2-Way Wrist Computer in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In December 1902, Bertholf {{reported}} for duty {{as an assistant}} inspector for the U.S. Life-Saving Service in Atlantic City. It was common practice for Revenue Cutter Service officers to perform this duty. This was helpful to him because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> {{to stay close to}} home, now that he was married. He was responsible as an assistant inspector to examine and drill the surfmen at the 42 life saving stations along the New Jersey shore each month. He also had to investigate any shipwrecks along the coast to see if the rescues had been conducted properly by the life saving stations. This tour of duty with the Life Saving Service would be of valuable experience later in his career when the USLSS merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E

25|$|Bieber {{was soon}} signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), {{a joint venture}} between Braun and Usher. Justin Timberlake was also {{reportedly}} in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher. Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group. Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in {{a joint venture between}} RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive Vice-President of Def Jam, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> Bieber's career at the label. Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher. Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Hick seemed set {{fair for}} another {{productive}} season in 1996, especially after making 215 for Worcestershire against the Indians in May, {{but it was}} not to be. His form completely deserted him as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> just 35 runs in four innings against India, and when he was dismissed cheaply twice in the first Test against Pakistan the selectors had had enough and he was dropped from both Test and ODI teams, not to be selected again {{for a year and a}} half. Back at Worcestershire, he scored unevenly: immediately after his being dropped by England he made 148 and 86 against Kent, but he then endured a run of ten innings in all cricket without making more than 30, before hitting 54 and 106 against Gloucestershire in the penultimate Championship game of the season.|$|E
25|$|A classic number 10, Maradona was {{renowned for}} his {{dribbling}} ability, vision, close ball control, passing and creativity, {{and is considered}} one of the most skillful players ever. He had a compact physique, and with his strong legs and low center of gravity he could withstand physical pressure well while running with the ball. Dutch legend Johan Cruyff saw similarities between Maradona and Lionel Messi with the ball seemingly attached to their body when dribbling. His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup. He was a strategist and a team player, as well as highly technical with the ball. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> himself effectively in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second 1986-goal against England), or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot. He showed leadership qualities on the field and captained Argentina in their World Cup campaigns of 1986, 1990 and 1994.|$|E
5000|$|In 1077 Hugh married Gersent, {{mistress}} of Geoffroy de Mayenne [...] She was {{a daughter of}} Robert Guiscard, but after discovering <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>manage</b> her either he repudiated her, was promptly excommunicated by Pope Urban and died childless.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} his {{low-profile}} in prior seasons, he gained {{a place on the}} Kenyan Olympic team by coming second at the 10,000 m trials at 2012 Prefontaine Classic. Unfortunately, at the Olympics themselves, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>manage</b> a twelfth-placed finish.|$|R
50|$|In March 2011, Johnson {{entered the}} final round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship with a two stroke lead over the rest of the field. However <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>manage</b> a final round one-under-par 71 to finish as runner-up behind Nick Watney.|$|R
25|$|The Church and ex-convent of Santa Rosa de Viterbo is {{attributed}} to Alarife Ignacio Maraiano de las Casas and financed by José Velasquez de Lorea, finished in 1752. The church has twin entrances, which was common with convent churches. The two arches are decorated with mocking faces put there by Casas {{to those who did}} not think <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> the building of the institution. The outside is flanked by scroll-shaped flying buttresses, which only serve as decoration and are unique to Querétaro. The tower has a unique shape and is topped with a pyramid-shaped crest. There is an inner doorway decorated in Churrigueresque style and an image of Saint Rose. Inside, the most outstanding feature is the pulpit inlaid with ivory, nacre, turtle shell and silver, and its altarpieces are gold covered in Querétaro Baroque style. The entrance to the sacristy contains paintings of José Velazquez de Lore and Sor Ana María de San Francisco y Neve. The convent complex was later amplified by Juan Caballero y Osio. The nuns began to dedicate themselves to primary education and by 1727 it became the Royal College of Santa Rosa. The convent was closed in 1861 due to the Reform Laws and was subsequently used as a hospital for about 100 years. Today the convent portion is home to the Centro de Estudios de Diseño y Artes Graficas Mexico-Italiano.|$|E
500|$|With the team's {{merger with}} Team RadioShack already announced, the {{traditional}} season-closing weekend in Italy at the Giro del Piemonte and the Giro di Lombardia effectively figured to comprise the team's final races under this guise. At the Giro del Piemonte, Bennati made {{each of the}} day's selections, first a 31-rider group that formed at the [...] to go mark and then a 14-rider break in the race's final kilometer. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> only seventh in the uphill final sprint, however.|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2015, Mark Meadows, {{a member}} of the Freedom Caucus from North Carolina, filed a motion to vacate the speakership, only the second time the motion had been filed. The next day, Boehner {{referred}} to the motion as [...] "no big deal." [...] However, following continued pressure from the Freedom Caucus, and to avoid the vacation of his speakership, Boehner announced on September 25 that he would resign the Speakership and retire from Congress effective October 30. Sources from his office indicated he chose to resign due to the increasing discord within the Republican caucus so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government and avoid a government shutdown.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 Vaņins {{signed a}} {{contract}} with FC Moscow. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>manage</b> to get into the first team, mostly being used in the reserves. As playing for the reserve team did not please the Latvian international, he decided to leave.|$|R
6000|$|The {{two boys}} lingered about the station admiring all this, and commenting {{in their own}} {{peculiar}} fashion on men and things, sometimes approvingly, often critically, and now and then disparagingly. They sometimes ventured to address a remark or two {{to any of the}} men who chanced to look at them with a sufficiently good-humoured expression, and even went the length of asking Bob Clazie if, in the event of the Thames going on fire, [...] "'e thought <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> to put it hout!" [...] to which Bob replied that <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> if [...] "cheek" [...] were a fire-extinguisher, and he only had a brigade of boys equal to the Bloater to help him.|$|R

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given {{time to get back}} into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, but this was a knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Stead went to London to be {{assistant}} {{editor of the}} Liberal Pall Mall Gazette (a forerunner of the London Evening Standard), where he set about revolutionizing a traditionally conservative newspaper [...] "written by gentlemen for gentlemen". When its editor, John Morley, was elected to Parliament, Stead took over the role (1883–1889). When Morley was made Secretary of State for Ireland, Gladstone asked the new cabinet minister if he were confident that he could deal with that most distressful country. Morley replied that, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> Stead, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> anything.|$|E
