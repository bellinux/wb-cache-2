Linguistically, in the US, American English usage of bona fides applies it as synonymous with credentials, professional background, and documents attesting a person's identity, which is not synonymous with bona fide occupational qualifications. More recently, other common law countries have begun to adopt good faith as a general principle. In the UK, the High Court in Yam Seng Pte Ltd v Int Trade Corp Ltd expressed this preference.

40|$|This paper reviews two {{legislative}} approaches {{intended to}} control housing {{conditions in the}} rented sector - the landlords' contractual obligations, and the powers of local authorities. The authors argue that the landlords' covenants are almost totally ineffective, and that it now rests on local authorities to protect {{the health and safety}} of tenants. Breaches of the <b>implied</b> <b>covenants</b> that houses should be fit and in repair will provide tenants with a legal action against their landlords. However, the tenant's standing is now so weak that these covenants fail to provide protection. The Housing Act 2004 introduced a regulatory framework based upon assessing the risks to the health and safety - the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) - giving local authorities tools to ensure that housing is as safe and health as possible. The history of the regulation of housing conditions also reveals important insights into the nature of private and public regulation. ...|$|R

The effects of recent defaults persist after controlling for bank capitalization, although compression in bank equity is also strongly associated with tighter contracts.

40|$|No {{one who is}} {{studying}} 1 housing law can do so successfully without understanding the legal system within which it operates. In this chapter, we look initially at how English law is made {{and how it is}} applied to the settlement of disputes. The former question involves some knowledge of case law, legislation and EU (European Union) law. The latter requires an understanding of the civil court system and the legal personnel of the law (solicitors, barristers and judges). We shall also look in outline at the law of contract and tort (the law of negligence, trespass, nuisance and occupiers’ liability) in order to provide a foundation for studies in housing law. Subsequently, the chapter provides the reader with an introductory text on the subject of property and housing law. It is not intended to be exhaustive and the reader is referred to the Recommended Reading {{at the end of the}} chapter. Specifically, this chapter examines: Legal studies: The development of English law. Sources of law. Civil court structure. Personnel of the law. Legal personality. Law of contract. Law of tort.

40|$|The first essay of my {{dissertation}} investigates how lender-specific shocks {{impact the}} strictness {{of the loan}} contract that a borrower receives. Exploiting between-bank variation in recent portfolio performance, I find evidence that banks write tighter contracts than their peers after suffering defaults to their own loan portfolios, even when defaulting borrowers are in different industries and geographic regions than the current borrower. The effects of recent defaults persist after controlling for bank capitalization, although negative bank equity shocks are also strongly associated with tighter contracts. The evidence is consistent with lenders learning about their own screening technology via defaults and adjusting contracts accordingly. Finally, contract tightening is most pronounced for borrowers who are dependent on a relatively small circle of lenders, with each incremental default <b>implying</b> <b>covenant</b> tightening equivalent {{to that of a}} ratings downgrade. The second essay examines the use of soft information in primary and secondary mortgage markets. Using a large sample of mortgage loan applications, I develop a proxy for soft information collection based on the probability that a mortgage applicant had a face-to-face meeting with a loan officer. I find that the use of soft information increases the probability of loan approval, and conditional on loan approval, reduces the interest rate charged. These loans, however, {{are less likely to be}} sold, consistent with the difficulty in credibly communicating soft information. This provides evidence of one mechanism through which securitization may affect screening. Meanwhile, preliminary evidence suggests that screening based on soft information may be valuable to lenders, with face-to-face meetings substantially reducing the growth in loan delinquencies during the recent period.

Additionally, the recommended Theory of Mandatory Core Duties would prohibit the LLC operating agreement from displacing those equitable remedies that may be necessary to prevent a controlling member from engaging in unfairly prejudicial conduct – the hallmarks of which typically include the deprivation of financial benefits and/or managerial rights without an offer of fair compensation for the interest.

In 1933, in the case of Kirke La Shelle Company v.

However, not all covenant violations are disclosed because firms are able to obtain covenant violation waivers and renegotiate debt contracts with their lenders before being required to disclose a violation in the financial statements. Exploiting the fact that over half of all private debt contracts contain a debt covenant based on some variation of accounting earnings, I construct a sample of firms with debt contracts that contain at least one earnings-based covenant. Combining earnings-based-covenant contract values with information publicly available, I construct a measure of <b>implied</b> debt <b>covenant</b> violation and find evidence that investors are able to price the likelihood of an earnings-based debt covenant violation on the earnings announcement date. Furthermore, I find {{no evidence of a}} negative stock price reaction to the disclosure of a debt covenant violation when there was a high likelihood of such a violation implied by previously-reported earnings.

40|$|This study quantifies {{costs that}} firms {{are willing to}} incur to avoid {{violation}} of private debt covenants. The results indicate that as firms approach covenant violation they engage in income-increasing earnings management, which increases their tax liability. By estimating the extent of income-increasing activities and the additional tax costs incurred, this study arrives at a lower-bound estimate {{of the cost of}} violating private debt covenants. The mean (median) firm with relatively tight debt covenants increases its current tax liability by an amount equivalent to increasing the cost of debt financing by between 12. 92 (10. 72) and 22. 72 (12. 81) basis points (where firms with relatively loose debt covenants serve as the baseline). The magnitude of this estimate indicates that the expected costs of covenant violation are meaningful.

Whereas Fugacious 1 was a basic primer on Arkansas oil and gas law, this article supplements the development of Arkansas oil and gas law {{over the last five}} years through an overview of the litigation concerning the Fayetteville Shale Play. Specifically, the article expands on those topics covered by Fugacious 1 needing revision or supplementation, while simply noting as such the sections where no revision or supplementation is necessary. The authors begin their supplementation by considering the ownership of natural gas found within coal formations and conclude that a coal owner may vent coal-bed methane away from its operations pursuant to safe mining practices while owing nothing to the gas owner for the gas lost as a result thereof. However, the coal owner may not capture and sell the coal-bed methane without the gas owner 2 ̆ 7 s permission. Next, the article discusses two recent Arkansas Court of Appeals cases considering reservation language in reservation deeds. The article then discusses the evolution of the Strohacker doctrine in Arkansas, concluding that the area where evidence of knowledge of oil and gas as mineral is relevant is not precisely limited to the county containing the lands. The authors then consider problems with severing minerals, and Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 Duhig doctrine, a bright line rule of property regarding mineral interests which applies to warranty deeds but not to quit-claim deeds. The authors examine a recent case where their opinion from Fugacious 1, that every purported tax forfeiture of a severed mineral interest for a tax year prior to 1986 was void for failure of the tax assessors in Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s various counties to properly subjoin mineral assessments to surface assessments of the same lands prior to 1985 legislation, which removed the subjoinder requirement, was proven correct. The authors discuss ingress and egress, and a recent Arkansas Supreme Court holding where the Court found that Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission 2 ̆ 7 s General Rule B- 42 requires express permission to conduct seismic testing despite the tester 2 ̆ 7 s ingress and egress right. Regarding oil and gas leases, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the revised Ark. Code Ann. § 15 - 73 - 701 and its implications to the oil and gas business. The authors finish their supplementation with a discussion of <b>implied</b> <b>covenants</b> in leases and the prudent operator standard codified in Ark. Code Ann. § 15 - 73 - 701, the Rule of Capture, and the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction to interpret contracts.

2500|$|The {{question}} has been raised whether the ancient view of this command prohibits images of Yahweh. Some scholars have proposed that the golden calf made by Aaron (while Moses was on the mountain receiving the Ten Commandments) was supposed to represent Yahweh, or perhaps a throne or steed on which the people were to envision Yahweh. According to Exodus 32:7-8, in a divine speech to Moses, Yahweh reveals the events {{going on at the}} base of Mt.

Others point out that the golden calf episode leads to the breaking of the tablets of the Decalogue, something that <b>implies</b> that the <b>covenant</b> had been violated.
