Our {{research}} {{was aimed at}} studying the radiographic and histological outcomes of using flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) combined with Ilizarov external fixation (IEF) versus Ilizarov external fixation alone on a canine model of an open tibial shaft fracture. Materials and Methods. Transverse diaphyseal tibial fractures were modelled in twenty dogs. Fractures in the dogs of group 1 (n= 10) were stabilized with the Ilizarov apparatus while it was combined with FIN in group 2 (n= 10). Results. On day 14, a bone tissue envelope started developing round the FIN wires. Histologically, we revealed only endosteal bone union in group 1 while in group 2 the radiographs revealed complete bone union on day 28. At the same time-point, the areas of cancellous and mature lamellar bone tissues were observed in the <b>intermediary</b> <b>area</b> in group 2. The periosteal layers were formed of the trabeculae net of lamellar structure and united the bone fragments. The frame was removed at 30 days after the fracture in group 2 and after 45 days in group 1 according to bone regeneration. Conclusion. The combination of the Ilizarov apparatus and FIN accelerates bone repair and augments stabilization of tibial shaft fractures {{as compared with the}} use of the Ilizarov fixation alone...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{shows the}} {{progression}} of my compositional work as I explored the concepts of time, media and space. It demonstrates how my methodological process has evolved {{from the idea of}} a ‘Nothing’ which becomes a ‘Something’; an exploration of the <b>intermediary</b> <b>area</b> delimited by the formulation of an initial idea, on the one hand, and a completed work on the other. The inspiration for this work emerged from observations of selected soundscapes recorded in woods, zoos, lakes and beaches. At the same time, I also began reviewing the literature of authors such as Pauline Oliveros, John Cage, Michael Nyman, David Toop, R. Murray Schafer and Bernie Krause. The notion of ‘silence’ and the basics of Zazen were also explored. A parallel element to this work involved identifying ways to disseminate these findings to the general public and to performers (choral groups, string quartets and solo performers), using both conventional music notation and graphic scores to enhance this process. Other aspects of my work included rethinking the concepts of rhythm and pitch, as well as the observation of one note evolving over time. Animation, the use of photography, video and pre-recorded audio all became an integral part of my compositional language. I planned regular encounters with nature, negotiated black and white, as well as observing how light affects particular soundscapes, and how manmade lights can transform a space. Camera manipulation, layering textures and the use of technology also played a significant part in formulating the final product...|$|E
40|$|The wider {{region of}} central Crete, is a {{particular}} neotectonic structure that is constituted by two separate post-alpine basins, that of Messara's {{to the south and}} Heraklion to the north, each one with different orientation of development (E-W and N-S respectively). After a quick study of this area by observing older geological maps, satellite images, and also the place of Crete along the Hellenic Arc, is that the Messara basin has a quite geometrical provision that might be related with surfacial extensional strain field, which trends perpendicular to the subduction zone. It could be a symmetrical structure trending E-W, with active marginal faults parallel to the basin, separating the uplifted basement rocks from the post-alpine formations, which cover unconformably the Alpine basement in the <b>intermediary</b> <b>area</b> of the basin. However, a second glance creates divergences from the ideal model of the symmetrical basin, as continuous marginal structures do not appear to exist in neither the northern nor the southern fringe. On the contrary, the northern margin of the basin seems to be a large fault zone which is interrupted abruptly and instead of a similar tectonic structure, the basin of Heraklion is developed trending N-S, perpendicular to that of Messara's. The margins of the latter are not evident, even if the appearance of Alpine rocks is quite frequent in the <b>intermediary</b> <b>area.</b> Additionally, in the south-western utmost of the Messara basin, post-alpine sediments are found outside the ideal area of this neotectonic basin and this creates scepticism as for the exact location of the southern margin. In the same region, it appears that the dominant structures trend NE-SW and have strong influence on the post-alpine tectonic regime which is different than the one that created the bigger structures of E-W. The same directions seem to coexist in all the extent of the basin which complicates the thoughts regarding to the estimation of time of the activity of the various fault zones. Finally, based on the topographical data, one could observe {{that there should be a}} single hydrologic basin in the region of Messara, trending E-W, beginning from the western slopes of Lasithi Mts and leading to the eastern coast of the Messara bay. The existence of this particular morphology is the one that differentiates the southern region of central Crete from the remainder southern coasts of island, where the rivers flow generally to the south. The contribution of Asteroussia Mts in this is very important as their linear growth of E-W, isolates the basin from the open sea of Liviko. After these points, important issues are opening and are called to be explained via the systematic study of the existing data, and also newly collected field data which are acquired and processed with the aid of relatively new technological methods. These methods concern in the statistical analysis of morphotectonic parameters, the tectonic analysis of field data with special techniques and the creation of databases in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. This geodatabase includes all kinds of data, aiming to their essential control and classification in the various time periods. The latter is very important as major changes of the strain field, along the Messara basin, seem to have happened during the post-alpine period. A brief summary of the publications found in the international literature is made in the 2 nd Chapter. Most of these publications are referring to the description of the Alpine units and secondly to the post-alpine formations of Neogene age. Also, the prevailing case scenarios of tectonic development of the wider region of central Crete are described based on papers published on this subject. The basic methodology of designing and using a GIS is analyzed in the 3 rd Chapter. This also concerns in the proposed structure and contents of a geodatabase that will be used as an interactive digital geological map. The way of using new technological tools is described here as well as how these can contribute in the more detailed, objective, and rapid importing of data collected by the fieldwork. In this chapter is also presented the way of using a GIS for the palaeo-geographic representation of central Crete and especially the Heraklion and Messara basins, based on the palaeo-environmental conditions during the time of deposition of the Neogene sediments. The background images of a GIS are usually satellite images of various resolutions so in the 4 th Chapter the main methodologies that were followed for the analysis and interpretation of remote sensing data are presented. The techniques that are used and described are distinguished in basic and advanced, depending on the degree of difficulty. Additionally the final products that were used for geological and tectonic observations are also presented. In the 5 th Chapter, the detailed and systematic methodology of studying the morphotectonic parameters is described as well as the precise calculation of several morphometric indices, with the use of the GIS as a tool for tectonic geomorphology. The structure and the design of the used databases are described, while the methodology that was followed is analyzed. Finally a discussion is made about the results, concerning the hydrologic basins that are included in the neotectonic basins of Messara and Heraklion. The analysis of the fieldwork data is described in the next chapters. In every chapter the data for each one of the key areas, which were mapped in high detail, are analyzed by using also high resolution remote sensing images and creating spatial databases in GIS environment. The Matala – Kaloi Limenes area is located at the south-western utmost of the basin and although its location is outside the "theoretical" margins of the postalpine graben, large areas are covered by Neogene sediments. Several fault zones have been studied and analyzed based on field measurements. The dynamic analysis led to the calculation of the local strain field which was required for every fault zone to operate and finally to the gradual changes of the regional strain field in order to be classified by the age of activation. The results were also combined with seismological data as evidence of the present strain field. The amount of deformation was quantified by using two different methodologies and the results showed more or less the same quantity of extension along the given trends. Finally a model of evolution, for the area, was extracted. The Ano Viannos area is located at the easternmost area of the Messara basin where large marginal fault zones are crossing each other, separating the Alpine basement rocks from the Neogene sediments. The tectonic analysis which was made by using the collected field data revealed the strain field that was dominant in several periods and the sequence of activation for each fault zone. The third area is located near Agia Varvara village on the watershed divide between Messara and Heraklion basins. The area is crossed by a very large and active fault zone that is representing the northern margin of Messara graben although it disappears towards east possibly because it is covered by post-alpine sediments. The main reason seems to be the activity of a number of faults with perpendicular strike (N-S) and trans-tensional sense of movement. Various tectonic analysis methods were applied on synsedimentary structures and the strain field during several time periods was calculated. The combination of the results at the above mentioned areas led to a model regarding to the evolution of Messara basin since Late Miocene. The present dominant strain field seems to be extensional after the phases of trans-pression and trans-tension respectively. During the later phase two left lateral strike slip fault zones were active by segmenting the northern margin of Messara basin into three main segments. These segments compose a low angle normal fault dipping to the south, creating a half-graben, whilst on the top of its hanging-wall the Neogene sediments are deposited. The strike slip movement is migrating from the east to the west starting from Tortonian and ending during Messinian, as a result of the transpression that started at the eastern part of the Hellenic trench during the Late Miocene. ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{critical}} edition of the correspondence between Queen Victoria of Sweden (1862 - 1930) and the Bishop and High Preacher to the Court, Gottfrid Billing (1841 - 1925), together with a commentary situating this surprisingly straightforward correspondence in its political and theological context. Since the queen lived both in {{the public and the}} private sphere, she had a ‘mixed’ relation to her spiritual advisor, who also was active both in the ecclesiastical and the political sphere. The letters between the Crown princess/Queen and the Bishop are very ‘mixed’ letters, with soulcare as only one part among others. Connecting to Kristina Persson’s description of the functions of letters, especially the ritual function is observed: the letter as a ‘receipt’ on the life and health of the correspondent, and a wish for further contact. This function is most clear when someone from the court writes to thank Billing, often in short, and because of the bad health of the queen. When he is being thanked, often together with the expressed hope for a renewed contact, from another person, the ritual function is especially accentuated. Generally, this means that a correspondence cannot be understood without consideration to letters from surrounding persons, in this case from the court and family of the queen. Also the mediating of norms is interesting. This function may be described as a variant of the social or identity function, and in this latter version it has a self-evident position in both spiritual and political letters. Here {{it turns out to be}} especially complex, since we may speak about a religious and a political creation of norms, simultaneously. The letters perforate the borders between the sharply contrasting constructions of male and female. Per definition letters open a sphere in between, a third, <b>intermediary</b> <b>area</b> between the two spheres of correspondents. A space is created where opposites move into each other, at least in the unphysical space of the correspondence. To Perssons’s different functions, we may add this perforating, gender exceeding function. The spiritual relation between the crown princess/queen and the bishop is constructed as comfort and advices in upcoming situations, seldom as answers to specifically spiritual questions. During the 1920 s, this spiritual relation was also reversed, so that the queen comforted and encouraged the old bishop. Both the prayers and the silent understanding remain without traces unreachable to the researcher, but hence their existence has to be observed much more. The intimacy in a spiritual relation, or in any other human relation, may not be measured in numbers of words, still less in what could be labeled verbal exhibitionism. The soul-care in the letters is being related to the publications of Billing, in a few cases answering the needs being expressed in the letters. A great part of Billing’s letters are missing, but this gap may partly be filled out by the queens’ letters to him, by his letters to his wife, or by the courtiers’ letters to him. The queens’ letters are distinguished for their very good treatment of the Swedish language, but still with a few, remaining germanisms. Sometimes she tries to make the Swedish language more consequent than it in fact is, in constructing new forms. In the letters we might speak about a formal and a material level of intimacy. The same letter may contains expressions at several material levels, depending on its material. This correspondence has been compared to other ones, such as the queen’s correspondence with her relative, Cardinal Hohenlohe, with Archbishop Söderblom, the Duchess d’Otrante, and with Dr. Sven Hedin. The queen’s strong commitment to service and preaching is being presented, especially how she in 1912 and the following years was strongly committed to the publication of a service ritual with short sermons for use on the ships of the Swedish navy, dedicated to the navy from Queen Victoria. Of its 31 sermons, Billing had written 16. An enlarged edition was published in 1917. Special observance has been paid to the correspondents’ positions from the perspectives of gender and relations. This correspondence is of great interest from a politico-historical point of view, and also theologically. The theological interest is to be observed, partly in several separate matters, and partly in both correspondents’ motivations in terms of Lutheran vocational teaching, the latter of which can be seen as motivating even the independent political actions of the Queen. The letters also reveal a relation of pastoral care that, at the end of the old Bishop’s life, is reversed, with the Queen providing spiritual solace to the Bishop. The edition includes a broad introduction and page-by-page comments in foot-notes...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} structure of monsoon thermal forcing by precipitating convection is diagnosed {{in terms of}} horizontal divergence. Airborne Doppler-radar divergence profiles from nine diverse mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are presented. The MCSs consisted of multicellular convective elements which in time gave rise to areas of stratiform precipitation. Each of the three basic building blocks of the MCSs - convective, intermediary, and stratiform precipitation areas - has a consistent, characteristic divergence profile. Convective areas have low-level convergence, with its peak at 2 - 4 km altitude, and divergence above 6 km. <b>Intermediary</b> <b>areas</b> have convergence aloft, peaked near 10 km, feeding into mean ascent high in the upper troposphere. Stratiform areas have mid-level convergence, indicating a mesoscale downdraught below the melting level, and a mesoscale updraught aloft. Rawinsonde composite divergence profiles agree with the Doppler data {{in at least one}} important respect: the lower-tropospheric convergence into the MCSs peaks 2 - 4 -km above the surface. Rawinsonde vorticity profiles show that monsoonal tropical cyclones spin-up at these elevated levels first, then later descend to the surface.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{doctoral}} thesis was to elucidate the mechanism of reaction leading {{to the formation of}} dicalcium silicate (C 2 S), its solid solutions and other phosphatic calcium silicate phases using the sol-gel method of synthesis. SiO 2 (Tosil A), CaO (calcium nitrate tetra-hydrate) and H 3 PO 4 (as a source of P 2 O 5) were used as starting materials. Series of samples with different content of P 2 O 5 were synthesized. The characterization of Tosil A and samples was based on the following methods: DTA/TGA and EGA, XRD and SEM and EDS analy-ses. It is known, that phosphorous oxide can enter the structure of C 2 S and possibly form solid solutions and different phosphatic calcium silicate phases in C 2 S–C 3 P system. Depending on the P 2 O 5 concentration in mixtures, three distinct phases are formed: larnite (2 CaO•SiO 2), Ca 14, 92 (PO 4) 2, 35 (SiO 4) 5, 65 and 5 CaO•SiO 2 •P 2 O 5, as detected by XRD.

The formation of two distinct islets of C 2 S and C 3 P is due the affinity of acid oxides (SiO 2, P 2 O 5) towards the basic one (CaO) during the sol-gel process.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1992 The 1987 Australian monsoon was {{observed}} with satellites, rawinsondes, radar and aircraft. These data are presented, with theory filling the gaps, in illustration of its dynamics. The {{engine of the}} monsoon is its embedded mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Ten MCSs were explored with airborne Doppler radar. They all exhibited multicellular convection, in lines or arcs {{along the edges of}} cold pools, aging and evolving into areas of stratiform precipitation. This temporal evolution can be divided into three stages: "convective," "intermediary," and "stratiform. " Doppler radar divergence profiles for each stage show remarkable consistency from one MCS to the next. Convective areas had low-level convergence, with its peak elevated off the surface, and divergence above ∼ 8 km altitude. <b>Intermediary</b> <b>areas</b> had very little divergence through the lower troposphere, but strong convergence near 10 km altitude, associated with upper-tropospheric ascent. Stratiform areas had midlevel convergence between divergent layers. These divergence profiles indicate thermal forcing of the monsoon by the convection, in a form more useful than heating profiles. The response of the atmosphere to thermal forcing is considered in chapter 2. Thermal disturbances travel through a stratified fluid at a speed proportional to their vertical depth. A heat source with complex vertical structure excites disturbances ("buoyancy bores"), of many depths, that separate themselves out with distance from the heat source. Hence the deeper components of a heat source can be found at greater distances from the heat source, at any given moment and also in the limit of long time in a rotating or dissipative fluid. Low-level dynamical processes initiate deep convection within the active cyclonic areas of the monsoon trough, despite the warm core aloft and the consequent (small) decrease in CAPE. In 1987, four tropical cyclones were generated in the monsoon by this runaway positive feedback loop. Two forcing terms appear in the vorticity equation, representing the two dynamical effects of MCSs. Vertical momentum transport causes small-scale vortex pairs in the upper troposphere, while net MCS divergence "stretches" vorticity at many scales. Divergence and vorticity profiles averaged over all north Australia show only the "gravest mode" vertical structure, while profiles in the smaller Gulf of Carpentaria, near the convective heat source, indicate finer vertical structure...|$|R

How SMEs perceive innovation <b>intermediaries</b> is an <b>area</b> of investigation that would provide important information on how innovation intermediaries’ assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This study focuses on the cleantech industry and explores SMEs’ expectations and perceptions of an established community-based intermediary (CBI) moving into their sector. A qualitative research methodology was adopted to collect data from 15 sample SMEs. In regards to SMEs, the findings show that cleantech companies face financing, partnerships, marketing, sales, regulatory and bureaucratic challenges. In regards to innovation intermediaries, the findings showcase how CBI, a regional intermediary, is not effective in supporting cleantech SMEs with their sector specific needs or challenges...|$|R

40|$|We used satellite-tracking {{data from}} {{repeated}} journeys between Europe and West Africa {{by the same}} osprey, Pandion haliaetus, individuals to test whether the timing of migration differs between spring and autumn and whether landmarks and stopover goal areas are important for navigation. The timing of migration varied more in autumn than in spring, owing to significant differences between individuals (related to sex) in autumn migration dates. Autumn journeys were significantly slower than spring journeys because they included more stopover days. The difference {{may be explained by}} environmental conditions restricting the timing of migration in spring, by differences in opportunities to deposit fuel prior to departure, and by differences in expected changes in foraging/fuelling conditions along the route. Flight paths from repeated journeys by the same individual were often 120 - 405 km apart (maximum east-west separation 1400 km). These distances exceed the expected normal range of vision, suggesting that the ospreys did not find their way by following familiar landmarks. Flight paths converged in some regions, indicating the existence of up to three <b>intermediary</b> goal <b>areas</b> along the route of individual birds. Between these goal regions route fidelity was low, and the ospreys could find the next goal region after extensive deviation, presumably by map-based navigation and possibly in combination with path integration.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the learning needs of managers in SMEs that seek to become progressively international. A particular focus of attention is the informal learning practices that occur within the economic and social networks utilised by managers in this sector. Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches to data collection, the paper investigates the challenges perceived by managers engaged (or seeking to engage) in international activity. The results suggest three main areas of challenge: first, the early â??pre-internationalisationâ? stage, when decisions about â??whetherâ?, â??whereâ? or â??howâ? to internationalise are taken; secondly, the development of longer-term planning processes and business systems to cope with the consequences of the initial internationalisation decision; thirdly, the challenge of regulatory issues and the need to secure payment and manage foreign <b>intermediaries.</b> Further <b>areas</b> of learning need, which depend on the significance of international business for the firm, are also indicated. Existing structures, cultures and approaches to management can be maintained for many SMEs that undertake some limited international activity. Where international business is a more important factor, however, managers need to develop cultural appreciation and empathy to underpin their expertise and consolidate their market position. Indeed, sustained international development may require a significant reorienting of the business, underpinned by management and organisational learning to develop an appropriate international â??mind-setâ? that supports the effective development of relationships with stakeholders in different countries...|$|R

The construction industry benefitted from capacity expansion programs in the production sector. The improvement in the labour market continued, inflation accelerated at a lower rate than in other countries. In April, the rate of inflation was 2. 4 percent, markedly below the rates in the U. S.

The world economy also kept its momentum in the spring: Economic activity was very brisk in continental Europe and Japan, but now there are signs of a gentle slowdown in the U.

5000|$|Khangai {{has become}} a {{generally}} used term by Mongolians to describe the entire lush forest-steppe area to the north {{as opposed to the}} southern desert, which is called Govi (Gobi). The <b>intermediary</b> steppe <b>area</b> is called Kheer or Tal. The word Khangai is composed of the verb [...] "khanga-" [...] which means [...] "provide, supply with necessities" [...] and the Mongolian nominalizing suffix [...] "-ai". The word Khan (King) is also a possible root, probably even related to the verb [...] "khanga-". Therefore, Khangai is usually interpreted as provident lord, munificent king, generous gracious lord or bountiful king. The ancient name denotes the sacredness of the mountain and the special place it holds in the hearts of those who depend on it. A similar Mongolian word for sacred mountains is Khairkhan which means loving king (for example Asralt Khairkhan, a particularly intimate name meaning caring loving king). Its forbidden to say the name of a Khairkhan when the mountain is in view. If the mountain is in view, it should simply be called Khairkhan, not its full name. This strict custom applies in all regions of Mongolia. Any mountain or hill that is pleasing to the sight or in any other way pleasant is praised with the words [...] "that is indeed a special Khairkhan" [...] or [...] "what a majestic Khairkhan!" [...] etc. Any area of the mountainous forest-steppe region understood alone or along with all that it contains (rivers, springs, plants, animals) may be praised with the words [...] "that is indeed a great Khangai" [...] or [...] "there is no denying that that is a unique Khangai!" [...] etc.|$|R

Based on the analysis of forty-two face-to-face interviews with female and male entrepreneurs, and <b>intermediaries</b> in the <b>area</b> of the valley and mountain range areas of the region of Tiquipaya, the characteristics of these entrepreneurs, the barriers and facilitators, and the role of social capital have been extracted. As main contributions, firstly, it has been proposed a comprehensive conceptual framework for the context. Secondly, it has been found that, contrary to what one might think being indigenous does not affect so much as the fact of being a woman, as a key element for developing successful entrepreneurial activities. The paper continues as follows. After a literature review on gender and entrepreneurship and indigenous entrepreneurship, an integrated research framework is proposed.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the current situation of mountain tourism and its sustainability in Turkey as a new and ascending tourism product. In addition, tourism policies of Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism in the mountain tourism area are scrutinized. Not only the tourism policies of the government are enough to promote a new alternative tourism type, but also the role and effects of tourism middlemen such as travel agencies, tour operators, and tour wholesalers cannot be denied in the promotion of a destination. Mountain tourism can be accepted and classified as one of these mentioned alternative and newly developed types of tourism in many destinations. Therefore, mountain tourism {{could be one of the}} best alternative tourism opportunities for many destinations if they have sufficient resources, namely naturally attractive mountains and related infra and/or superstructure. Turkey and Aegean region have many attractive resources in this sense. In this research, in addition to analyzing the current situation in Turkey; ways of developing mountain tourism in a sustainable way as well as possible roles and effects of travel <b>intermediaries</b> in this <b>area</b> are questioned.

40|$|Abstract. - Risk {{assessment}} of financial <b>intermediaries</b> is an <b>area</b> of renewed interest {{due to the}} financial crises of the 1980 ’s and 90 ’s. An accurate estimation of risk, and its use in corporate or global financial risk models, could be translated into a more efficient use of resources. One important ingredient to accomplish this goal is to find accurate predictors of individual risk in the credit portfolios of institutions. In this context we make a comparative analysis of different statistical and machine learning modeling methods of classification on a mortgage loan dataset with the motivation to understand their limitations and potential. We introduced a specific modeling methodology based {{on the study of}} error curves. Using state-of-the-art modeling techniques we built more than 9, 000 models as part of the study. The results show that CART decision-tree models provide the best estimation for default with an average 8. 31 % error rate for a training sample of 2, 000 records. As a result of the error curve analysis for this model we conclude that if more data were available, approximately 22, 000 records, a potential 7. 32 % error rate could be achieved. Neural Networks provided the second best results with an average error of 11. 00 %. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm had an average error rate of 14. 95 %. These results outperformed the standard Probit algorithm which attained an average error rate of 15. 13 %...|$|R
5000|$|China has {{experienced}} rampant child laundering in past decades, although {{now they are}} considered to be better off than most other sending countries. China reports about 10,000 kidnappings or abductions a year, although the true numbers {{are considered to be}} much higher. The official statistics are only based on those that are resolved, but {{it is very difficult to}} prove that a child has been kidnapped and then laundered. [...] Most of these children are from poor families in the rural areas, and are taken as a result of the profits to be made from Western families. The Hunan scandal brought many of these issues to light, as orphanages sent <b>intermediaries</b> into rural <b>areas</b> to acquire children that are then moved around Hunan and given fraudulent documents in order to cover up the situation. Some argue that the issue of child laundering in China stems from the one-child policy, which created what was once a surplus of children to be adopted. However, since the demand for Chinese children has increased, institutions resort to methods like kidnapping in order to meet the demand and make a profit. This has been criticized due to the fact that the system of international adoptions has created a system where poor families in China are abused in order to satiate the Western demand for children. Additionally, the ethnocentric justifications for these behaviors suggest that the child will have a better life without any connection to the biological family in the West, but some believe that the family should be preserved at all costs.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen {{considering}} some of {{the broader}} human rights implications of internet-related policies, despite their differences in character, context and content, a shift appears in how human rights are envisaged and debated, from the traditional focus on state obligations and state enforcement (hard law) to an increasing involvement and call upon private companies {{to play a role}} in the realization and protection of specific human rights (e. g. through charity actions, participation in soft law development, and through codes of conducts and other corporate social responsibility initiatives). Likewise, private actors increasingly refer to human rights when framing specific initiatives or interests, often with limited reflection on human rights as a set of international legal norms, with inherent zones of conflicts (e. g. protection of individuals against abuse of power, commitments to certain standards in society). This shift in the human rights discourse from state obligations to corporate initiatives seems to reflect the nature of the online environment with private actors in control of core infrastructure and services, yet it is extending and its implications for the protection of individuals is troublesome. This paper critically analyses examples of European policies regulating the role of internet <b>intermediaries,</b> including in <b>areas</b> such as content regulation, privacy and data protection, copyright, and telecommunication infrastructure. It formulates and explores the hypothesis that the observed shift is constructed and maintained mainly through procedural transformations of existing legislation and regulation, with still greater emphasis on co- and self-regulatory regimes. Moreover, it argues that the observed shift is closely related to the governance structure of the digital domain; with new zones of conflict and new areas of convergence between the state and private actors...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the relative importance of cultural and economic factors in mortality decline in the Netherlands in the periods 1875 / 1879 - 1895 / 1899 and 1895 / 1899 - 1920 / 1924. Mortality data by region, age, sex and cause of death as well as population data were derived from Statistics Netherlands for the years 1875 / 1879, 1885 / 1889, 1895 / 1899, 1910 / 1914, 1920 / 1924. Regional mortality declines were estimated on the basis of Poisson regression models. In a multivariate analysis the estimated declines were associated with economic (wealth tax) and cultural variables (% Roman Catholics and secularisation) corrected for confounders (soiltype, urbanisation). In the period from 1875 / 1879 - 1895 / 1899, %Roman Catholics was significantly associated with all-cause mortality decline and with mortality decline from diseases other than infectious diseases. Mortality declined less rapidly in areas with a high percentage of Roman Catholics. Secularisation was significantly associated with infectious-disease mortality decline. In areas with a high percentage population without a religious affiliation, mortality declined more rapidly. In the period from 1895 / 1899 to 1920 / 1924, wealth tax was significantly associated with all-cause and infectious-disease mortality decline. Mortality declined more rapidly in wealthy <b>areas.</b> <b>Intermediary</b> factors in the relationship between cultural factors and mortality decline were fertility decline, but more importantly, the number of medical doctors per 100, 000 inhabitants. No intermediary factors were found for the association between the economic variable and mortality decline. Cultural and economic factors both played an important role in mortality decline in The Netherlands, albeit in different periods of time. The analysis of intermediary factors suggests that the acceptance of new ideas on hygiene and disease processes was an important factor in the association between culture and mortality decline in the late 19 th century.
