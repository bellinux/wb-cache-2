5|$|In 1934, Woodfull led the Australians back to England for a {{tour that}} was to mend {{relations}} after assurances had been given that bodyline would not be repeated. The Australians won 2–1, and Woodfull remains the only first captain to regain the Ashes twice. Woodfull was criticised for adopting excessively cautious tactics after the advent of bodyline. Woodfull retired after the tour; his family claimed that the bodyline controversy had sapped his passion for cricket. The British king offered Woodfull a knighthood for his services to cricket, and in reference to his actions during the bodyline series, but Woodfull declined, stating that {{his work as a}} teacher was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> cricket. A mathematics teacher, Woodfull went on to become headmaster at his alma mater, Melbourne High School.|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

25|$|Jack Jouett has, for {{the most}} part, fallen through the cracks of history on a {{national}} level. Jouett has retained some recognition locally, including Jouett Elementary School in Louisa County, Virginia and Jack Jouett Middle School in Albemarle County named in his honor.

50|$|The {{route in}} earlier times was a <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> route <b>than</b> it is today. It was the main road from Nottingham to London. The turnpike went from Nottingham via Melton and Oakham to Kettering (to join today's A6), {{and then on to}} London, run by the Nottingham, Melton and Kettering Turnpike Trust from 1758. The turnpike trusts were {{abolished}} in 1880, the year that the railway line to Melton opened. The trains would run until 1968.|$|R
25|$|Kawabata {{left many}} of his stories {{apparently}} unfinished, sometimes to the annoyance of readers and reviewers, but this goes hand to hand with his aesthetics of art for art's sake, leaving outside any sentimentalism, or morality, that an ending would give to any book. This was done intentionally, as Kawabata felt that vignettes of incidents along the way were <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> conclusions. He equated his form of writing with the traditional poetry of Japan, the haiku.|$|E
25|$|Many Allied fighter gun cameras often {{revealed}} that aircraft {{which had been}} claimed destroyed as '109's were often Arado Ar 96 trainers with a cadet pilot at the controls. To counter this non-combat flights were only {{to be carried out}} at dawn and dusk. The Luftwaffe expanded aircraft warning systems and devised radio signals to warn flights of intruders. If attacked, poorly armed aircraft were to dive down to tree-top level, and if necessary, the pilot was to belly land and take cover, as pilots were <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|However, 2005 {{research}} on rockfish shows that large, elderly females are <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> younger fish in maintaining productive fisheries. The larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster, survive starvation better, and {{are much more}} likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish. Failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major US West Coast fisheries. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades. One way to prevent such collapses is to establish marine reserves, where fishing is not allowed and fish populations age naturally.|$|E

50|$|Đà Nẵng {{has been}} a port city for many centuries, long before the first arrival of European traders in the 16th century. One of the first Europeans to visit the city was Portuguese {{explorer}} Antonio De Faria, who anchored at Đà Nẵng Port in 1535.

25|$|Some {{opponents of}} ABC contend that since only few models—subjectively chosen and {{probably}} all wrong—can be realistically considered, ABC analyses provide only limited insight. However, {{there is an}} important distinction between identifying a plausible null hypothesis and assessing the relative fit of alternative hypotheses. Since useful null hypotheses, that potentially hold true, can extremely seldom be put forward in the context of complex models, predictive ability of statistical models as explanations of complex phenomena is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the test of a statistical null hypothesis in this context. It is also common to average over the investigated models, weighted based on their relative plausibility, to infer model features (e.g., parameter values) and to make predictions.|$|E
25|$|Three major {{elements}} of the writing style indicate that the book can be classified as a psychological novel. The first is the emphasis {{of the mind and}} inner thoughts rather than the plot line and movement of the story. The feelings behind all actions chosen are <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the actions themselves; the actions are mere secondary behaviors in response to the psychological decisions of the character. Another element is the stream of consciousness, or inner monologue style of writing. The majority of the storyline takes place {{in the mind of the}} lead character rather than externally through actions and interactions with other characters. In addition to inner monologues, memories of dialogues or even imagined dialogues with other important characters aid in plot movement. The final element is the use of a non-chronological timeline and excessive flashbacks. The effect allows the reader to follow the character thought by thought through memories, feelings, and contemplations, thus creating the illusion that the reader is inside the character's mind, rather than a third party observer, as in classical novels.|$|E
25|$|Magnússon {{returned}} to Þeyr, {{and the band}} toured Scandinavia. By this point, Guðni and Hilmar {{decided to leave the}} band’s management, and were replaced by Guðmundur Sigurfreyr Jónason. With the tour, the band gained more popularity and even managed to appear on radio and television in Denmark, they also went to a studio and recorded a few songs which were released on the 12-inch EP The Fourth Reich, in memory of Wilhelm Reich whose books had been banned by the Nazi regime. The image cover was alleged Nazi incitation because it depicted Wilhelm Reich wearing a Nazi-styled armband and the British label Shout was obligated to change the cover. However, it should be said, that the armband shown on the cover contained the symbol of the orgone physics, which represented duality and its origins in unity, referred by Reich as functionalism. On The Fourth Reich the use of percussions and rhythmical efforts were <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> in earlier works. In this respect, the song “Zen” was particularly important due to its marked rock style, but the album did not have the impact of earlier works because the music was less accessible. The Icelandic version of this EP was released by label Mjöt, which had been created by Magnús.|$|E
50|$|Kahone is {{the royal}} {{seat of the}} Serer Kingdom of Saloum which has ruled there since the 15th century after the Battle of Turubang (1335) and centuries {{previous}} to that.

25|$|Jerusalem was {{the center}} of {{education}} in the kingdom. There was a school in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where the basic skills of reading and writing Latin were taught; the relative wealth of the merchant class meant that their children could be educated there along with the children of nobles – it is likely that William of Tyre was a classmate of future king Baldwin III. Higher education had to be undertaken at one of the universities in Europe; the development of a university was impossible in the culture of crusader Jerusalem, where warfare was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> philosophy or theology. Nonetheless, the nobility and general Frankish population were noted for the high literacy: lawyers and clerks were in abundance, and the study of law, history, and other academic subjects was a beloved pastime of the royal family and the nobility. Jerusalem had an extensive library not only of ancient and medieval Latin works but of Arabic literature, much of which was apparently captured from Usamah ibn Munqidh and his entourage after a shipwreck in 1154. The Holy Sepulchre contained the kingdom's scriptorium and the city had a chancery where royal charters and other documents were produced. Aside from Latin, the standard written language of medieval Europe, the populace of crusader Jerusalem communicated in vernacular forms of French and Italian; Greek, Armenian, and even Arabic were used by Frankish settlers.|$|E
