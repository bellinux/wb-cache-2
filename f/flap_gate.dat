40|$|The {{doctoral}} disertation {{considers the}} analysis of the hydrodynamic conditions near the bottom-hinged flap gates on a side weir, which are used to regulate the amount of the lateral discharge over the side weir. The disertation is divided into two parts: the experimental and the numerical part. Within the experimental part, discharge and water surface measurements for 380 variants were carried out. A new equation for the discharge coefficient of a bottom-hinged <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> on a side weir was proposed, which covers the influence of the position and the width of the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> on the discharge coefficient. In addition, measurements of water levels near the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> and also measurements of the velocity fields were carried out with the computer-aided visualization method. From these measurements, it was possible to show that the contraction of the water jet varies with the gate opening angle. It was also found in which position a <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> has the most favorable hydrodynamic shape. Within the numerical work, a 3 D numerical model of two-phase flow, which uses the so-called VOF method for determining the interface was established. For this purpuse, the software code OpenFOAM was used. Within the numerical modeling three different turbulence models were analysed, these are the k-ε and k-ω SST turbulence model and the LES turbulence model with a Smagorinsky subgrid scale model. With the help of a calibrated 3 D numerical model, the influence of different geometric and operational parameters of the flap on the pressure distribution at the gate, caused by the flow of water over the side weir, was analysed. Furthermore, the resultants of the forces and torsion moments in the hinge of the gate were determined {{on the basis of the}} results of the numerical model. An update of the OpenFOAM software code was also applied. In this context, a new solver named interWaterFoam was established, which allows more stable and robust calculations with limiting the velocities in the phase of air...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{for assessing the}} impact of rising sea levels on areas upstream of tidal flap gates. These devices, designed to allow drainage of surrounding land during low water and flood defence during high water, are commonly used in areas where tidal high water {{is higher than the}} level of the land behind the sea wall. Studies were undertaken at Pagham Harbour, West Sussex, UK, where a number of tidal flap gates are used to control the flow of water from channels carrying drainage waters away from the nearby town of Chichester. On one of these channels, water level data were collected at 15 minute intervals at three sites near the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> and analysed in order to obtain values over each tidal cycle of maximum and minimum water levels downstream of the gate, and the time of closure of the gate. Water level was also monitored at two locations upstream of the gate. By obtaining estimates of mean fresh water discharge for each tidal cycle, and combining these with peak tidal water level, a functional relationship (in the form of a three dimensional plot) was obtained for the parameter Tc, the length of time in hours for which the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> is closed during each tidal cycle. These values of tc were also used in conjunction with mean tidal fresh water discharge to produce another three-dimensional plot showing the effect on peak tidal water level upstream of the <b>flap</b> <b>gate,</b> thus providing an illustration of the sensitivity of local flooding of varying tc under differing tidal conditions. Finally an estimate was made of the likely impact of a 300 mm rise in mean sea water level on tc for the same set of fresh water flow data, using a set of 'look-up' tables based on the three-dimensional plots obtained. These indicated that the frequency of local flooding was likely to increase significantly for fresh water flows greater than 0. 8 m 3 /s. Although the increase in local flooding illustrated here is not thought to be a cause for immediate concern, particularly in view of the recent construction of a further tidal <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> adjacent to the existing one, nevertheless the methodology employed is applicable to similar systems...|$|E

40|$|In {{practice}} discharges of untreated wastewater occur {{from many}} wastewater sewer systems, often via Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSO). The untreated wastewater from SSO {{can be transferred}} through the overflow systems into receiving waters, reducing their quality and bringing risks to human health and aquatic organisms. Increased awareness of {{the negative effects of}} SSOs has {{led to the development of}} various control measures as part of watershed protection programs around the world. However, the information the number of SSO events is often unknown due to poor or limited monitoring. A further problem is that backflows can occur through an overflow system, with receiving waters entering the wastewater network due to elevated levels of the receiving waters. This additional relatively clean water often increases the volumes of water that need to be transported to the treatment facility and dilutes wastewater pollutants, resulting in lower treatment efficiency and higher costs for chemicals, increasing electricity consumption for any intermediate booster pumps and within the treatment plant. This paper illustrates how the flap gates, commonly used for preventing these backflows, also can be used for the estimation of SSO discharge volumes. An experimental full-scale setup was designed where sewage flowed through a <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> between two chambers with a constant flow rate. The stabilised water heads in the two chambers and the flow rate were measured. Experiments were performed for both dry and submerged <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> conditions (the latter is relevant for the SSO event occurring during high water level in the receiving waters). In total, five flap gates with opening dimensions of 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mm were tested and flow rating curves were established with high precision (R 2 > 0. 99). Results of the opening pressure tests showed some deviations between the values specified by the manufacturer of the flap gates and the experimentally obtained opening pressure values. An approach to generalising the flow rating curves for other than tested diameters of the flap gates is suggested. The usage of flow rating curves for estimation of the volume is discussed. This study showed that the water head measurements before and after the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> can provide a reliable and inexpensive method for quantification of the SSO discharge volumes.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of mathematical models of solute mixing and sediment transport in estuaries rely heavily on the provision of good-quality field data. We present some observations of salinity, suspended sediment concentration and velocity {{at one of the}} tidal limits of a semi-enclosed tidal lagoon in Southern England (Pagham Harbour, West Sussex, UK) where the natural processes of tidal incursion and solute mixing have been heavily modified {{as a result of the}} construction of sea walls dating back to the 18 th Century. These observations, made immediately downstream of two parallel tidal <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> by conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiler, and also using bed-mounted sensor frames to measure velocity at 2 fixed depths, have yielded a set of results covering 11 tidal cycles over the period 2002 – 04. It is clear from the results obtained that over a typical tidal cycle, the greatest vertical salinity gradients occur in the 1 – 2 h immediately after the onset of the flood tide, and that subsequently, energetic mixing acts to rapidly break down this stratification. Under moderate-to-high fresh water flows (< 0. 5 m 3 /s), the break-down in vertical salinity gradient is more gradual, while under low fresh water flows (< 0. 2 m 3 /s), the vertical salinity gradient is generally less pronounced. Estimates of Richardson number during the early flood-tide period reveal values that vary rapidly between < 1 and about 20, with lower values occurring after around 1. 5 – 2 h after low water. Observations of suspended sediment concentration vary widely even for similar tidal and fresh water flow conditions, revealing the possible influence of wind speed, the storage effects of the water in the lagoon downstream of the observation site, and the complexity of the hydrodynamics downstream of tidal <b>flap</b> <b>gates.</b> The data also show that most of the sediment transport is landward, and occurs during flood tides, with estimated total tidal landward flood tide flux of fine sediment of the order of 50 – 120 kg under low fresh water flow conditions. These observations, which reinforce the results presented in Warner et al. (2004) and elsewhere, can help to provide information about the appropriate techniques for managing sediments and pollutants, including nutrients from sewage effluent waters, in estuaries where hydraulic <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> are used to control the entry of fresh water over the tidal cycle...|$|R
40|$|Floods {{forecasting}} {{and management}} of large regulated rivers require the ability to properly combine classical flow routing with the regulation dams that act as internal boundaries. Therefore a good knowledge of the stage-discharge relationships of these dams is mandatory. The Meuse River in Belgium is such a regulated river, for which the HYDROAXE software was developed jointly by the Belgian Min-istry of Public Works (SPW-SETHY) and the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Université catholique de Lou-vain (Belgium). Working for a constant improvement of this software, this paper presents an experimental study of flow over a typical dam of the River Meuse, i. e. a dam controlled by radial gates equipped with flap gates. Measurements of the upstream water level and of the discharge are presented for different positions of the <b>flap</b> <b>gate.</b> According to earlier works on gates featuring a variable inclination, mainly drum gates, {{it is observed that}} the stage-discharge relationship depends on the inclination of the flap. However, the theoretical discharge coefficient obtained by means of formulae of the literature always exceeds the measured discharge coefficient. This suggests that further work is required to obtain a stage-discharge relationship adapted to the particular case of radial gates equipped with flap gates...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{analysis}} of data collected at a macrotidal semi-enclosed lagoon (Pagham Harbour, UK) has revealed useful information about long-term patterns of siltation {{and some of the}} related mechanisms. Sediment surface-level measurements made over 2 years at different sites within Pagham Harbour have shown a steady siltation, in common with earlier measurements, which is moderated by seasonal effects due to erosion by locally generated waves. Furthermore, inspection of vertical profiles of salinity and turbidity over individual tidal cycles has revealed that the degree of sediment transport on the flood tide is related to the vertical salinity gradient. Thus, at the Ferry Pool site, which is characterised by episodic pumped discharges from a nearby sewage treatment plant, landward sediment transport is enhanced by the high degree of salinity stratification observed during the flood tide. The mobility of the sediment, and the greater distribution of softer, less-well consolidated sediment deposits, is greater here than at the other significant freshwater inflow at the Salthouse site, where the fresh water flow is instead moderated by a tidal <b>flap</b> <b>gate.</b> Preliminary analyses suggest that the higher the salinity stratification, the greater the landward sediment transport during the flood tide. Such analyses could help inform future policy on the methods of land drainage to macrotidal lagoons, and on the potential for managed realignment at such sites...|$|E
40|$|Water {{diversion}} {{mechanisms are}} commonly used in the irrigation systems and this concept is older than tank (reservoir) systems in Sri Lanka. At present, for water diversions in the wet zone anicuts are constructed by using lifting type gates. Anicuts are used to maintain required water level in the upstream by releasing only the excess water to downstream. In the lifting gate, water is allowed to flow from the bottom and this causes high erosion in the canal. The thrust force due to water pressure on the lifting gate {{makes it difficult to}} operate the system and then controlling the system is a complex task. This paper describes the construction and operation of newly introduced flap gates and issues related to lifting gate which are presently used for diversion process. In this analysis, conceptual design of a <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> with compressive arc type wall plate is proposed to minimize use of construction materials. In the proposed system, height of the anicut could be changed from the top and then the water level in the upstream is not varied much when compared with lifting gates for varying flows in the cannel.

Similar to the case of axially symmetric absorbers, the maximum power extracted is shown to be directly proportional to the incident wave characteristics: energy flux, angle of incidence and wavelength. Accordingly, the capture width ratio is directly proportional to the wavelength, thus giving a design estimate of the maximum efficiency of the system. We then compare the array and the single gate in terms of energy production.

40|$|Flooding {{has always}} been a major concern for coastal communities. However, many parts of New York City never had to worry about {{flooding}} until Hurricane Sandy hit in October 2012. The hurricane brought a record level storm surge, which destroyed homes, cut power to millions of people and caused a total of $ 19 billion in damage. The storm surge exposed the City's critical lack of infrastructure and gave the City a major reason to address this problem. Based on projected sea level rise, floods will become more frequent and will cause regular damage to New York City. There are various ways to protect against storm surge, ranging from local barriers in each community to citywide barriers. This study addresses the feasibility and design of a two-barrier system to protect most of the City. A design is proposed where the barriers are walls with a single gate to allow ships to navigate in and out. One barrier, located under the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, seals the City off from the Long Island Sound, which utilizes a vertical <b>flap</b> <b>gate.</b> The other barrier spans between Sandy Hook and Breezy Point utilizes a horizontally rotating arch gate. A life-cycle benefit analysis was performed to determine the time for a barrier of each height to start providing a return on investment considering upper and lower bounds on the initial construction cost. The quickest benefit occurred in just 36. 66 years for a wall height of 15 feet and in just 17. 32 years for a wall height of 15. 5 feet for the upper and lower bounds, respectively. The chosen height for the barriers was 20 feet which required a maximum of only 1. 83 additional years to provide a return on investment while protecting the City against 99. 5 % of all future storm surges. by Demetres Ingilis.

40|$|The Meuse in the Netherlands is {{since the}} 1920 s dammed by 7 weirs, which are located near Borgharen, Linne, Roermond, Belfeld, Sambeek, Grave and Lith. The weirs {{regulate}} the water {{levels in the}} canal sections (=stuwpanden) to provide sufficient depth for navigation. The management of the weirs is regulated by water level measurements at Maastricht St. Pieter (formerly Borgharen). The weirs dam the river for discharges lower than 1200 m 3 /s. For higher discharges the weirs are completely opened. Weir Linne is the oldest weir of the canalized Meuse and {{is part of the}} smallest canal section (=kanaalpand) of the Meuse. The weir consists just like the weirs of Roermond, Belfeld and Sambeek of two parts, a rough discharge regulating Poirée part and a accurate regulating Stoney part. Weir Linne maintains a water level of 20. 80 m +NAP in the upper canal section. The canal section forms a navigable interchange between the Juliana Kanaal, Lateraal Kanaal, Kanaal Wessem-Nederweert and canal section Roermond. The weirs in the Dutch part of the Meuse have been constructed for a period between 80 and 100 years. The weirs are approaching the end of their lifetime in the period between 2020 and 2030. In this situation is not spoken about design lifetime because in the period when the weirs were constructed the design lifetime was not defined. Based on maintenance reports and inspections it is concluded that the weirs are not able to fulfill their functions properly, they need to be replaced or upgraded. The main reasons for replacement or upgrading are technical and functional aging and changing legislations. According to Rijkswaterstaat the weir of Linne has ended its lifespan in the year 2030. Aging of materials and changes in the ARBO legislations are issues of the weir. This conclusions is the result of inspections and analyzes over several years. Besides aging of materials also aging in functionality contributes to the decrease of the weir quality. The functionality of the weirs has been changed in time due to changing conditions, in the RINK project called "new risks". These functional changes can have their causes in changes of design assumptions, maintenance, usability and controllability or law and regulations. The weir of Linne has to deal with the risks of changing discharges, ASR degradation, operability and the weir does not meet the ARBO regulations. This graduation report is focused on the problems of weir of Linne. The aim of this thesis research is to improve the situation of weir Linne for the future situation by replacing of upgrading the weir. The weir should meet the requirements based on discharge and navigational purposes in the future. This report is made up at four scale levels, the problem is approached from a high scale level to lower scale levels. The levels are made up according to the elementary design cycle. The first scale level concerns the canalized Meuse in the Netherlands. Because canal section Linne is relatively small It is investigated if it is possible to remove weir Linne instead of renewing or upgrading of the weir. The second scale level focuses on canal section Linne. In this section the effect of the Maasplassen with respect to the water level changes of the canal section is investigated for high and low discharges. Also the effect of the water level changes to the weir management is investigated to obtain a clear view about the reaction time of weir operations with regard to opening and closure of the weir. The third design level concerns the construction of weir Linne. It is considered if according to the RINK reports the current weir construction should be renewed or upgraded. The chapter proceeds with a rough analysis about the required width and retaining height of the weir to obtain if the discharge capacity of the current weir is sufficient for the future. It is decided to upgrade the Poirée part of the weir, the last part of this design level concerns the determination of a new gate type for the Poirée part of the weir. The lowest design level is focusing on the design of the new weir gate. The gate is designed in high strength concrete. The dimensions of the gate elements are determined and the gate is checked to the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The last section of the lowest design level concerns the way of placing and connecting the new gate to the current construction. The result of the first design level is that abolishing canal section Linne by combining the canal section with the upstream or downstream canal sections is not advisable. Weir and weir section Linne should be maintained in the future. This hold also for the other canal sections of the Meuse corridor except for canal section Lith. Because this canal section is the most downstream section in the Meuse canalization and far away from Linne, interventions to this canal section would have no effect on weir and canal section Linne. However the result holds for the current layout of the Meuse corridor. If a new layout should be proposed for the canalization of the Meuse it should be analyzed if weir Linne should be maintained or removed. The Maasplassen have a damping effect on the water level changes in canal section Linne. The damping effect is the effect of the relation between the changing discharge with respect to the water level changes in the canal section. Due to the Maasplassen the water level changes develop more slowly compared to a situation without the Maasplassen. This {{is the result of the}} storage capacity of the Maasplassen. The damping effect of the Maasplassen is most preferable and effective during low discharges. Navigational dept is maintained for a longer period because the water level decrease proceeds slowly due to the connected lakes. The discharge accuracy of the weir is not sufficient for the small discharges in the future, to maintain the navigable depth during low discharges the discharge accuracy should be increased. The damping has less effect on extreme high discharges compared to low discharges. Because the canal section is relatively small the water level rise will be relatively quick regardless of the damping effect of the Maasplassen. An increase of the storage capacity of the Maasplassen has a minor influence on this effect. However, the banks and retention areas are omitted in the analysis of the effects of the Maasplassen to the water level changes in canal section Linne. The results are not exact however, relative to each other the variants do represent a clear view about the effect of the Maasplassen to the water level changes. The opening procedure shorter than 8 hours is reliable after high discharges are measured at measure point Maastricht St. Pieter. Investigations on running times of flood waves on the Meuse have been done are not valid any more. Due to the Grensmaasproject running times for food waves will change. It is not advisable according to the RINK (=Risico Inventarisatie Natte Kunstwerken) report to replace the total weir of Linne at the moment. It is advised to monitor the condition of the weir until the period 2030 - 2035 and to take after this period a final decision. After this period a decision should be made to replace the or maintain the current weir for a longer period. In this report is concluded to maintain the current weir construction instead constructing a new weir. Due to over dimensioning the concrete super construction is a robust construction. The upgrade of the current weir will be done by the removal of the Poirée gates and constructing a new gate on the old Poirée part. The Poirée gate does not meet the requirements according to the ARBO legislations and the gate is not able to be remote controlled. The new type of weir that is chose to replace the old Poirée gates is the inflatable <b>flap</b> <b>gate.</b> The <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> is able to retain a the required water level, able to close the old Poirée part without large reconstruction of the weir. The gate fulfills (when properly designed) the ARBO legislations and is able to be remote controlled. The <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> is designed in concrete class C 90 / 105, this is a high strength concrete. High strength concrete is a durable construction material and requires less maintenance compared to steel constructions, especially in wet environments. The gate will be supported three air filled bladders, the bladders are placed next to each other. The concrete construction meets the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The checks of reinforcement, cracks and moment of failure are done for bending moments and shear resulting of loads perpendicular to the gate. Torsion due to for example failure of bladders is not taken into account. Checks to the concrete gate with regard to moments, cracks and failure due to torsion moments are also not taken into account. The gate will be placed as a prefabricated element. The element contains the gate, bladder, chain and supporting bottom plate. The plate is on upstream side placed at the rotation notches of the former Poirée gates and on the downstream side to the weir bottom. The gate could be further optimized, optimization could be done by for example reducing of the gate weight and curving the gate to increase the discharge capacity.

40|$|Separate {{sewerage}} {{systems are}} {{designed so that}} the wastewater and stormwater are carried separately. However, in practice, untreated wastewater discharges to receiving waters are not that rare, impairing {{the quality of the}} receiving waters and increasing the risks to public health and aquatic organisms. The two main causes for such discharges are wastewater that enters stormwater sewers as well as sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) from the separate wastewater sewers. The overall aim of this licentiate thesis is to review and improve the strategies used for detection of wastewater inputs to stormwater sewers and their location, and {{to address the issue of}} quantification of untreated wastewater discharges into the receiving waters by developing two methods: one for SSO discharges and one for the estimation of the wastewater amounts in stormwater sewers. A review of methods for detecting the entry of wastewater into stormwater sewers and the location of the entry points has been carried out by a critical literature review of the effectiveness of the current methods, their advantages, weaknesses and limitations in use. Additionally, an evaluation of the factors affecting the performance of a selected number of methods has been made from specially designed field studies, focusing on detectability of certain indicative pollution parameters and the effects of travel distance. The parameters selected based on those identified as being potentially the most useful in the literature review were E. coli, total coliform, Enterococci, conductivity, turbidity, TSS, and ammonium. The estimation of the volumes of untreated wastewater discharged into receiving waters was addressed by developing two methods: (1) volume estimation of SSO discharges based on already available infrastructure—backflow preventing flap gates—by performing full-scale studies to establish flow rating curves as a function of water head; and (2) estimation of wastewater ingress volumes into a stormwater system by using data from field studies as input to a Monte Carlo simulation to generate the probability distribution of possible fractions of wastewater in stormwater sewers. The reviewed indicator parameters and methods all demonstrated potential for detecting stormwater contamination by wastewater. However, there was no single method or strategy that would work under all conditions investigated. Human waste specific indicators—microbiological (adopted in microbial source tracking methods) and chemical markers (e. g., caffeine and carbamazepine) —as well as the Distributed Temperature Sensing method provided the best indication of wastewater pollution in the literature. However, these methods are currently beyond the capabilities of typical municipal expertise due to their costs and/or complexity and, therefore, combinations of methods that minimise the limitations of individual approaches have been identified in this thesis as the most effective provided these are tailored to specific cases. The travel distance from the point at which the wastewater entered the stormwater sewer is an important factor affecting the detectability of the investigated parameters, as the concentrations of the indicator parameters may change along the sewer length due to dilution, dispersion, physical, chemical, and microbiological processes. A Maximum Detection Distance (MDD) away from the origin of the input was determined which was in general shorter for the microbiological parameters than for the physicochemical parameters. Among the microorganisms analysed, Enterococci showed the shortest MDD of about 330 – 550 m, and E. coli — the longest of about 635 – 1245 m. Of the physicochemical parameters, the shortest MDD was for TSS (800 – 1130 m) and the longest for conductivity (1220 – 1560 m). MDD itself is not the main factor for selecting what parameters should be used, but rather how the sampling strategy for a particular parameter should be planned. The full-scale experiments on circular flap gates provided flow-rating curves for diameters of 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mm with high precision (R 2 > 0. 99). There are a large number of such gates installed in Sweden and the flow rating curves developed in this study could help practitioners to monitor SSO discharges with minimal onsite measurements (water head before and after the <b>flap</b> <b>gate)</b> in a reliable and inexpensive way. From the field study results, an equation was developed to estimate the volume of wastewater entering into the stormwater sewer. Monte Carlo simulation was selected as a means to increase the robustness of the outcome of the developed equation. The results of the simulation showed that the efficiency of the suggested method varied to a great extent depending on the selected combination of parameters: for example, for TSS and conductivity the percent error between the most probable and actual wastewater fractions in the sewer was less than 2 %, while TSS combined with microbiological parameters failed as a combination to estimate the wastewater fraction in sewer.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{presented}} {{on the development}} of a novel combined sewer overflow (GSO) and sewer volumetric flow monitoring system based principally upon the angular measurement of displaced engineering structures. The thesis plots the technological development from initial prototype, which established the frequency, duration and indicated discharge magnitude, through to the establishment of a robust series of instruments capable of producing both volumetric hydrographs and discharge water quality information using automatic sampling systems. The TEMS[sup]TM CSO monitor records the angular displacement of <b>flap</b> <b>gates,</b> commonly installed to protect the sewerage system from river ingress, {{as an integral part of}} the technology. The TEMS[sup]TM angular measurement system has operated maintenance free at one of London's largest sewage pumping stations for a period of 4 years. The instrument has recorded storm sewage discharges, dry weather crude sewage discharges caused by operational failures and pump malfunctions. Further research and development has enhanced system capabilities to include flow prediction, based upon the conservation of angular momentum, which has been shown accurate to ± 30...|$|R
40|$|The {{installation}} of one-way tidal restricting floodgates in regions containing acid sulphate soils {{has increased the}} problems associated with acid drainage in many areas of coastal Australia. In southeastern NSW, one-way <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> installed in deep flood mitigation drains maintain a low groundwater table and increase acid production and transport. Moreover, by restricting the intrusion of brackish water into the drainage system, the floodgates create a reservoir of acidic water. Recent studies suggest that by allowing a controlled amount of brackish water into the drains, via modified floodgates, buffering agents can neutralize the acidic water. A fifteen-month study was undertaken to examine the impact of modifying floodgates on water quality in flood mitigation drains that discharge into Broughton Creek, a major tributary of the Shoalhaven River, NSW. During the pre-modification period, drain water was predominately acidic (pH 3 ̆c 4. 5) with high concentrations of aluminium and iron (50 mg F 1). Brief periods of floodgate leakage permitted saline buffering and neutralised acidic drain water. After a ten-month monitoring period, twoway floodgates were installed that allowed for controlled tidal intrusion into the flood mitigation drain. Following floodgate modifications, average pH increased above 6. 0 and aluminium and iron concentrations decreased below 3 ̆c lmg T 1. Saline buffering was most effective during the prolonged dry periods with elevated salinity levels (3 ̆e 5000 /jS/cm). Two-way floodgates also decreased the difference between upstream and downstream water chemistry, thereby eliminating aluminium flocculation and the damaging effects ofFe 2 + iron oxidation...|$|R
40|$|The {{spillway}} of Sarpfossen {{hydropower plant}} {{has been studied}} numerically and experimentally. The physical model {{was built in the}} Vassdragslaboratoriet at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU. The model consists of the Sarpfossen dam and the river Glomma upstream of the dam. On the spillway crest are three gates installed - two <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> and a sector gate. In addtion is further upstream of the dam a bridge for cars and trains. Two of the bridge piers are fixed in the water and has an influence in the flow pattern. The model was run with a certain discharge and the velocities in the river were measured with a Flow Meter and VectrinoVelocimeter. Besides of the velocity measurements the water levels between bridge and dam were measured. These measurements were conducted to investigate the occuring wave phenomena, shock wave. The simulations were carried out by a commercial program, STAR-CCM+. The results from the simulation have been verified by the measurements from the model. Simulation were performed to replicate the flow phenomenas in the physical model and to find out how well STAR-CCM+ is suited to cope the complex flow structures. Three simulations were performed - two for the velocity distribution and one for the water level measurements with generated shock waves. The results of the simulations show quite good correlations. The velocity measurements show satisfying results. The shock wave could also be replicated quite well and the results are quite promising. Future studies are recommended to get more experience with simulating complex free-surface flows. Especially simulations of shock wave are not very frequent and well tested and should be included in further studies. </p...|$|R
