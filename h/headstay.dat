50|$|Lines (generally steel cables) {{that support}} masts are {{stationary}} and are collectively {{known as a}} vessel's standing rigging, and individually as shrouds or stays. The stay running forward from a mast to the bow is called the forestay or <b>headstay.</b> Stays running aft are backstays or after stays.|$|E
50|$|A swageless {{terminal}} can {{be removed}} and re-used, unlike a swaged terminal. This makes them very popular in the marine industry as they enable a quick repair {{to be made to}} a damaged cable while out at sea. Removing them from the wire end also allows anything which the cable has been threaded through (<b>headstay</b> furler) to be removed for servicing, re-threaded and the fitting re-attached.|$|E
50|$|Most Westsail 32s were rigged as cutters; i.e. with {{a single}} mast, mainsail, {{forestay}}sail and jib. The forestay terminates on the bow; a six-foot bowsprit supports the <b>headstay,</b> and the backstay terminates on a short boomkin, bringing the overall length with appendages of the typical boat to 40 ft. The shroud chainplates are bolted {{to the outside of}} the hull, making for a strong and reliable design, with clear side decks, at the expense of some sheeting angle for the jib.|$|E
50|$|Running backstays {{support the}} <b>headstay</b> in a fractionally rigged boat. A {{masthead}} rig {{has the advantage}} of not needing them. A running backstay runs from each lateral corner of the stern to the mast at the level where the forestay begins in the fractional rig. Together with other rigging, it supports the mast. Because they are attached low on mast, they can present a significant problem in an accidental gybe, as the boom hits the stay, with the possibility of breaking the boom, mast, or both.|$|E
50|$|The Nordic Folkboat, as {{initially}} designed, {{is constructed}} of {{wood in the}} clinker or lap-strake method of boat building. The boat {{was designed to be}} built with oak framing and fir planking, although different builders used many different species of wood. The boat has an open cockpit and a low coachroof covering a small cabin usually consisting of two bunks and minimal storage furniture. The boat is rigged as a simple fractional sloop, with minimal standing rigging, consisting only of two lower shrouds, two jumper shrouds, a <b>headstay,</b> and a backstay. Despite the simplicity of the rigging, the mast is highly tunable, enabling the Folkboat to sail well in light and heavy air well beyond initial expectations.|$|E
50|$|Early {{versions}} had {{a traditional}} two settee salon, while boats produced in 1968 and after feature {{a more modern}} galley starboard and settee to port. Both have a spacious V-berth over six feet long and were available with either a 30-HP Universal Atomic 4 gas inboard or an outboard well. The cockpit can comfortably accommodate 4-6 people, and the boat can sleep 4 adults below decks. Standard steering on the boat was with a tiller, but many owners have installed after-market wheel steering. Other typical upgrades would include a roller furling <b>headstay</b> to replace the original forestay, and upgraded instrumentation such as depth, speed, and wind gauges, which did not come standard on the original boats.

5000|$|Ketch or Sloop rig with {{aluminum}} spars {{and stainless steel}} standing and running rigging. Main (24m) mast has double aluminum in line spreaders and mizzen mast is with single spreaders. Standing rig with stainless steel wire rope with Norseman swageless terminals and consists of <b>headstay,</b> main backstay, the mizzen forward support is done using intermediate shrouds or a triatic stay, mizzen backstay, single upper shrouds and double lowers on main, single uppers and lowers on mizzen. Main, mizzen and spinnaker booms are aluminum. The original winches were manufactured by Lewmar and Barlow. Swan 65 has two spinnaker poles because gybeing large spinnakers by dipping the pole is considered too dangerous. With only one spinnaker pole operational ADC Accutrac performed gybes by lowering the spinnaker, repacking it and hoisting it up again on the other side. (Clare Francis 1978) ...|$|E
