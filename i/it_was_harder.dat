25|$|The {{application}} of wood tar to seagoing vessels was practiced through the 18th century and early 19th century, before the creosote was isolated as a compound. Wood-tar creosote {{was found not}} to be as effective in wood treatments, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> to impregnate the creosote into the wood cells, but still experiments were done, including by many governments, because {{it proved to be}} less expensive on the market.|$|E

Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 {{copies of a}} 60,000 {{character}} gazetteer of the local district was produced {{in less than a}} month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} aid the theatre, Fielding revised his The Author's Farce and The Intriguing Chambermaid. Fielding's The Miser was also put on 27 October 1733 with the King, the Queen, and many noble {{families}} in attendance. After this, Fielding produced The Universal Gallant: or, The Different Husbands, which didn't run until February 1735. 20th-century theatre scholar Charles Woods believed that Fielding joined with {{the management of the}} Theatre Royal because they were [...] "people whose legitimate investments were being jeopardized". Fielding later attacked Theophilus in a revised version of his The Author's Farce which ran on 15 January 1734. This caused a backlash upon him after the rebelling actors finally won in the dispute, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> for him to stage plays.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{felt that}} {{recording}} an album without her group mates was [...] "liberating and therapeutic", {{coming into the}} studio and freely expressing her ideas with her collaborators. The dependency she developed with Destiny's Child, however, meant <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> [...] "to be on [...] own creatively". As she wanted to grow as an artist Beyoncé contacted other artists {{with a view to}} forming a collaborative partnership. When the collective finished writing several songs, she printed copies of each and sent them to prospective guest artists. She talked to them by phone for possible collaboration, eventually gaining their approval. Besides Jay-Z, Beyoncé was able to work with Jamaican artist Sean Paul, American rapper Missy Elliott, among others. In contrast, some artists sent copies of songs to Beyoncé, which were eventually produced. Additionally, Beyoncé also worked with Timbaland and Missy Elliott on a track titled [...] "Wrapped Around Me" [...] for the album. Eventually, however, for reasons unknown, the song failed to appear on the album.|$|E
500|$|The Oi! {{movement}} {{was fueled by}} a sense that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, {{in the words of}} the Business guitarist Steve Kent, [...] "trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic... and losing touch". According to Bushell, [...] "Punk was meant to be of the voice of the dole queue, and in reality most of them were not. But Oi was the reality of the punk mythology. In the places where [...] came from, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> and more aggressive and it produced just as much quality music." [...] Lester Bangs described Oi! as [...] "politicized football chants for unemployed louts". One song in particular, the Exploited's [...] "Punks Not Dead", spoke to an international constituency. It was adopted as an anthem by the groups of disaffected Mexican urban youth known in the 1980s as bandas; one banda named itself PND, after the song's initials.|$|E
500|$|The first {{settlement}} in the Enugu area was the small Nike village of Ogui, which was present since {{the era of the}} Atlantic Slave Trade. Nike in the Igbo language means [...] "with strength or power." [...] It was through slave raiding that the Nike people acquired most of their lands, which were mostly unsettled. The Nike used slaves for a defence strategy, placing slave camps at the edge of their territories so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> for an enemy to access the free born. The Nike people were allied to the Aro people who formed the Aro Confederacy (1690—1901) which was an Igbo organisation that controlled slave trading in the Enugu area. Along with the Aro people who came to trade from Arochukwu in the south were the Hausa people who came to trade from the north. The Hausa traders provided horses to the Nike which were used for rituals by the Igbo. Both the Aro and Hausa migrated back and forth to what is now the city of Enugu and were considered foreigners to the area.|$|E

500|$|Ripken {{received}} the third base {{job for the}} Orioles in 1982 when the team traded DeCinces {{before the start of}} the season. He homered in his very first at bat of the first game of the Orioles' 1982 season against Dennis Leonard of Kansas City as part of three hits. However, he slumped to begin the season; his batting average was [...]118 through May 1. Ripken looked for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided by advice from Reggie Jackson: [...] "Just know what you know you can do, not what everybody else tells you to do." [...] After that, Ripken hit well for the rest of the season. On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998. On July 1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third baseman who could hit. Weaver said, [...] "You never know. Rip might be a great shortstop." [...] Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Aided by Ripken, the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers on the final day of the season.|$|E
500|$|Both musicians {{continued}} {{to work on their}} own projects during the composition of Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today. Byrne [...] of BigLove and completed his collaborations with Fatboy Slim on the album and musical HereLiesLove and the single [...] "ToeJam". Eno produced Coldplay's VivalaVida or DeathandAllHisFriends and U2's NoLineontheHorizon. Byrne and Eno discussed the former's collaboration with FatboySlim and ChrisMartin of Coldplay wrote lyrics to the instrumental track for [...] "OneFineDay", but acquiesced when he heard Byrne's version (the band would also adapt another one of Eno's instrumental compositions that Byrne did not finish into a track on VivalaVida). Once Byrne's version of [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was finished, the two began in earnest writing the rest of the tracks. Byrne initially had a long delay in writing material, but as the project progressed, he got to working several hours a day on the album and put his collaboration with FatboySlim on hold to finish the songs {{in the early part of}} 2008. Since the two did not work together face-to-face as they had in the past, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> for them to complete material quickly, and they had to rush to complete two of the tracks were finished at the end of the sessions. He later described the process as easy once details were sort out and summed up this method as [...] "purejoy" [...] and declared writing collaboratively to be easier than writing solo. He even credited the time between their last collaboration and the transatlantic distance as a strength, since it allowed the two to keep their own schedules. Eno agreed, as it gave him time to focus on a small piece of music without holding up Byrne's progress. Byrne later used a similar approach through 2010 and 2011 in collaborations with St.Vincent (Love This Giant) and WillOldham (the soundtrack to This Must Be the Place).|$|E

2500|$|Electrum {{was much}} better for coinage than gold, mostly because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> and more durable, but also because {{techniques}} for refining gold were not widespread at the time. [...] The discrepancy between gold content of electrum from modern Western Anatolia (70–90%) and ancient Lydian coinage (45–55%) suggests that the Lydians had already solved the refining technology for silver and were adding refined silver to the local native electrum some decades before introducing the pure silver coins cited below.|$|E

2500|$|With its cavalry, Oyo campaigned {{successfully}} in conquest and suppression over great distances. The Oyo army {{was able to}} attack defensive fortifications, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> to supply an army, and they withdrew when supplies ran out. The Oyo did not use guns in its major conquests. The military waited until the 19th century to adopt them. In 1764, a joint Akan(Akyem)-Dahomey-Oyo force defeated an Asante army. [...] The alliance victory defined borders between the neighboring states. [...] Oyo led a successful campaign into Mahi territory north of Dahomey in the late 18th century. The Yoruba also used the forces of their tributaries; for instance, they accomplished a 1784 naval blockade of Badagri with an Oyo-Dahomey-Lagos force.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} primate {{ancestors of}} modern humans most likely had light skin, like our closest modern relative – the chimpanzee. [...] About 7 {{million years ago}} human and chimpanzee lineages diverged, and between 4.5 and 2 million years ago early humans moved out of rainforests to the savannas of East Africa. They not only {{had to cope with}} more intense sunlight but had to develop a better cooling system. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>harder</b> to get food in the hot savannas and as mammalian brains are prone to overheating – 5 or 6°C rise in temperature can lead to heatstroke – so there was a need for the development of better heat regulation.

The meat ration in late 1916 was only 31% of peacetime, and it fell to 12% in late 1918. [...] The fish ration was 51% in 1916, and none at all by late 1917. The rations for cheese, butter, rice, cereals, eggs and lard were less than 20% of peacetime levels. [...] In 1917 the harvest was poor, and the potato supply ran short, and Germans substituted almost inedible turnips; the [...] "turnip winter" [...] of 1917-18 was remembered with bitter distaste for generations.|$|E
