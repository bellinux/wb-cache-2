2500|$|The [...] "calotype", or [...] "talbotype", was a [...] "developing out" [...] process, Talbot's {{improvement}} {{of his earlier}} photogenic drawing process {{by the use of}} a different silver salt (silver iodide instead of silver chloride) and a <b>developing</b> <b>agent</b> (gallic acid and silver nitrate) to bring out an invisibly slight [...] "latent" [...] image on the exposed paper. This reduced the required exposure time in the camera to only a minute or two for subjects in bright sunlight. The translucent calotype negative made it possible to produce as many positive prints as desired by simple contact printing, whereas the daguerreotype was an opaque direct positive that could only be reproduced by copying it with a camera. On the other hand, the calotype, despite waxing of the negative to make the image clearer, still was not pin-sharp like the metallic daguerreotype, because the paper fibres degraded the printed image. The simpler salted paper process was normally used when making prints from calotype negatives.|$|E

There are three distinct processes used here.

This cognitive approach permits us to <b>develop</b> <b>agents</b> that can provide assistance {{with a variety of}} tasks.

50|$|Photographic {{developer}} solutions {{may contain}} {{more than one}} <b>developing</b> <b>agents,</b> such as Metol and hydroquinone, or Phenidone and hydroquinone. This is because they work together to a synergistic effect, called superadditive development.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of photography, a wide range of <b>developing</b> <b>agents</b> were used, {{including}} chlorohydroquinone, ferrous oxalate,:131 hydroxylamine, ferrous lactate, ferrous citrate, Eikonogen, atchecin, antipyrin, acetanilid and Amidol (which unusually required mildly acidic conditions).|$|R
50|$|Glycin, or N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycine, is N-substituted p-aminophenol. It is a {{photographic}} <b>developing</b> <b>agent</b> used in classic black-and-white developer solutions. It is {{unrelated to the}} amino acid glycine. When fresh, it is typically characterized as thin plates of white or silvery powder, turning brown with age. It is sparingly soluble in water and most organic solvents; it is readily soluble in alkalies and acids.|$|E
50|$|Though {{a popular}} {{photographic}} <b>developing</b> <b>agent</b> in the 19th and early 20th centuries, pyrogallol largely {{fell out of}} favor around the 1920s, although it was still used by a few notable photographers including Edward Weston. In those days it {{had a reputation for}} erratic and unreliable behavior, due possibly to its propensity for oxidation. It experienced a revival starting in the 1980s due largely to the efforts of experimenters Gordon Hutchings and John Wimberley. Hutchings spent over a decade working on pyrogallol formulas, eventually producing one he named PMK (for its main ingredients, pyrogallol, Metol, and Kodalk name of Kodak). This formulation resolved the consistency issues, and Hutchings found that an interaction between the greenish stain given to film by pyro developers and the color sensitivity of modern variable-contrast photographic papers gave the effect of an extreme compensating developer. From 1969 to 1977, Wimberley experimented with the Pyrogallol <b>developing</b> <b>agent.</b> He published his formula for WD2D in 1977 in Petersons Photographic.|$|E
5000|$|Color {{developer}} bath: 6:00 @ 96-103 °F (35.6-39.4 °C). This step {{is carried}} out to completion. The developer contains CD-3 <b>developing</b> <b>agent,</b> and acts upon the chemically exposed silver halide that was not developed in the first developer to form a positive silver image. The metallic negative silver image formed in the first developer has no part in the reaction of this step. As the color development progresses, a metallic positive silver image is formed and the color <b>developing</b> <b>agent</b> is oxidized. Oxidized color developer molecules react with the color couplers and color dyes are formed {{in each of the}} three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different color couplers, which react with the same oxidized developer molecules but form different color dyes. Variation in color developer pH causes color shifts on the green-magenta axis with Kodak E100G & E100GX and Fujichrome films and on the yellow-blue axis with older Ektachrome films.|$|E

50|$|Agent 1 is the {{developer}} {{that reduces the}} silver halide crystals. Oxidation product of Agent 1 is reduced {{back to the original}} form by Agent 2. In other words, the ultimate source of the electrons used to develop image comes from Agent 2. For this reason, in modern convention, Agent 1 is usually called electron transferring agent or ETA. Agent 2 is usually called the main <b>developing</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{obvious from}} the above mechanism, <b>developing</b> <b>agent</b> with very stable semiquinone radical form (the first {{oxidized}} form of the ETA) tends to make more superadditive combination. Also {{obvious from the}} above mechanism is that Agent 1 has to have an intermediate reduction potential in the developer solution between the Fermi energy level of silver (the developing image silver) and the reduction potential of Agent 2 in the developer solution.|$|E
50|$|In a {{suitably}} formulated developer, electrons are injected to {{the silver}} halide crystals only through silver speck (latent image). Therefore, {{it is very}} important for the chemical reduction potential of the developer solution (not the standard reduction potential of the <b>developing</b> <b>agent)</b> to be somewhere higher than the Fermi energy level of small metallic silver clusters (that is, the latent image) but well below the conduction band of unexposed silver halide crystals.|$|E

5000|$|Glycin {{is related}} to 4-aminophenol and Metol. Compared to Metol, glycin has a {{carboxyl}} group attached to the methyl group of the Metol. This weakens the reduction potential of the compound, and the two developers have markedly different character. Glycin is slower-acting, but much longer-lasting in solution. Glycin is rarely used as a <b>developing</b> <b>agent</b> today, primarily because it is expensive and manufactured for specialty applications only. In its dry form, it also has limited shelf life compared to Metol and Phenidone.|$|E
50|$|Amidol is a colorless {{crystalline}} compound {{with the}} molecular structure C6H3(NH2)2OH. It is a dihydrogen chloride salt {{and is used}} as a photographic developer. It was introduced as a <b>developing</b> <b>agent</b> for photographic papers in 1892. It is unusual amongst developing agents as it works most effectively in slightly acid conditions rather than the strongly alkaline conditions required for most other developers. As amidol ages it changes color to a dark red-brown. Developing dishes and equipment used to prepare amidol solutions are also frequently stained brown, a stain that is very persistent.|$|E
