40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a comparative study of trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people <b>in</b> juvenile offender and law-abiding teens. The study involved 113 young offenders (from detention center for juvenile offenders, special closed schools, juvenile correctional facilities of Voronezh and Lipetsk regions) and 106 law-abiding teens, 13 to 18 years old. We identified the types of trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people <b>in</b> the two groups of adolescents. We analyzed the specifics of trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people <b>in</b> the group of offenders compared to law-abiding teenagers. Offenders reveal great variability <b>in</b> trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people. We describe a specific feature of confidence in offenders: their desire to establish shorter psychological distance from particular people, compared to law-abiding subjects. The factors causing the particular trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people are compared in juvenile offenders and in law-abiding teenagers.
