5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To make up for it, three lines of <b>earthworks,</b> ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The <b>earthworks,</b> usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E
5|$|The castle is {{protected}} as a Scheduled Monument under UK {{law and the}} remaining <b>earthworks</b> generally well preserved, but between 2010 and 2014 English Heritage expressed concerns about its condition {{and the impact of}} drainage, and the consequent drying out of the land, on the castle's <b>earthworks.</b> Only a handful of buildings survive in the castle's planned town of Skipsea Brough.|$|E

5|$|After {{civil war}} broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about {{improving}} the defences of the castle. He began to build a tall keep {{on top of the}} motte, reinforcing the surrounding <b>earthworks</b> with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside the castle, surrounded by its own <b>earthworks</b> and walls, and the Peddars Way was redirected to pass by the castle, town and priory, all important symbols of the de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired the castle through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three large stone gatehouses in the castle and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact.|$|E
5|$|Contract 2 (Donington) {{was awarded}} to R M Douglas Construction Ltd. The two-year {{contract}} was completed in only 18 months, due to the dry weather which allowed the <b>earthworks</b> to be completed ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|In England, motte-and-bailey <b>earthworks</b> {{were put}} to various uses over later years; in some cases, mottes were turned into garden {{features}} in the 18th century, or reused as military defences during the Second World War. Today, almost no mottes of motte-and-bailey castles remain in regular use in Europe, {{with one of the}} few exceptions being that at Windsor Castle, converted for the storage of royal documents. The landscape of northern Europe remains scattered with their <b>earthworks,</b> and many form popular tourist attractions as part of the European heritage industry.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{only the}} <b>earthworks</b> {{of the castle}} remain. The western bailey is managed by the parish council and the inner bailey by English Heritage, while the eastern bailey remains under cultivation. The site is {{protected}} under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Military <b>earthworks</b> perhaps {{culminated in}} the vast network of {{trenches}} built during World War I (1914−1918) that stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea {{by the end of}} 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{county is}} rich in archaeological remains such as forts, <b>earthworks</b> and {{standing}} stones. Historic sites that can be accessed include Aberystwyth Castle and Cardigan Castle, as well as Strata Florida Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The only {{remaining}} {{parts of the}} medieval castle left today is the 10 metre (33feet) high motte, which rests on the highest point in the city, and some fragments of the surrounding <b>earthworks.</b> It {{is open to the}} public daily with no admission fee, and offers views over the historic buildings of the city. Both the motte and <b>earthworks</b> are Scheduled Ancient Monuments. The site of the castle bailey and the 19th century prison is now occupied by the Cambridgeshire County Council's headquarters at Shire Hall, built in 1932.|$|E
5|$|As the Royalist {{situation}} deteriorated, the south-west {{became one}} of the few remaining Royalist strongholds. Lingen, with 200men and 90horses at Goodrich Castle, conducted raids on Parliamentary forces in the region, representing a continuing challenge. No action had been taken, however, to strengthen the castle's defences with more modern 17th-century <b>earthworks,</b> and the castle remained essentially in its medieval condition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} <b>earthworks,</b> 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally these have been thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts doubt on this, suggesting that they are instead the remains of hollow ways and sand pits.|$|E
5|$|Castle Hill, {{also called}} Mere Castle, was a medieval {{fortification}} built by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, in 1253 {{on a hill}} overlooking the village of Mere, Wiltshire, England. The castle was constructed in stone, with six towers, inner buildings and gates. It was abandoned in the 14th century and stripped of its stone and metalwork. Only <b>earthworks</b> remain in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War {{the house}} was garrisoned by Royalists. It was {{fortified}} by surrounding it with <b>earthworks.</b> The garrison surrendered (on agreed terms) to Parliamentarian forces {{under the command of}} Colonel Devereux, Governor of Malmesbury, within days of Oliver Cromwell's capture of the nearby town of Devizes in late September 1645.|$|E
5|$|Excluding ancient <b>earthworks,</b> {{there are}} fifty-six {{structures}} within the parish that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including two (the parish church and Waterston Manor) that {{are listed as}} Grade I, and three (Ilsington House, The Old Vicarage, and 8 The Square) that are Grade II*.|$|E
5|$|In Iron Age Britain around 700 BC, a {{settlement}} on the Head was established; also around this time, the headland {{was cut off}} from the mainland by the construction of two banks and ditches called the Double Dykes, similar to those found at Maiden Castle. The <b>earthworks</b> consisted of an inner bank three metres high, with a ditch three and a half metres deep. An outer ditch six metres wide and two metres in depth is now obscured due to wind-blown deposits of sand and a gradual silting process. These defences turned Hengistbury Head into a fortified settlement area which seems to have grown over succeeding centuries until it became an important port. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final site in a small chain of fortified <b>earthworks,</b> starting from Hambledon Hill, and also including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, {{people began}} {{treasure}} hunting at Buckton Castle, and in 1767 {{there were reports}} that one such venture had discovered a gold necklace and a silver vessel, though these artefacts have since been lost. This prompted the interest of local antiquarians and several visited in the 18th and 19th centuries, often drawing plans of Buckton Castle. In the 20th century it was suggested that the castle may have been an Iron Age hillfort, however a study of hillforts in Cheshire and Lancashire found that Buckton Castle was topographically different from these sites. Excavation in the 1990s demonstrated that the site was medieval, with no sign of earlier activity. It was also suggested that the castle was a ringwork – a type of fortification where <b>earthworks</b> formed {{an integral part of the}} defence. However, this was before archaeologists established that the first phase of the castle was a curtain wall and the <b>earthworks</b> seen today are the result of the collapse of the structure. Buckton is now considered to be an enclosure castle, with stone walls forming the key defence.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury's known history commences in the Early Middle Ages, {{having been}} founded c. 800 AD. It is {{believed}} that Anglo-Saxon Shrewsbury was most probably a settlement fortified {{through the use of}} <b>earthworks</b> comprising a ditch and rampart, which were then shored up with a wooden stockade. There is evidence to show that {{by the beginning of the}} 900s, Shrewsbury was home to a mint.|$|E
5|$|The Tameside Archaeology Survey {{began in}} 1990, {{carried out by}} the University of Manchester Archaeology Unit with more than £500,000 of funding from Tameside Council; £300,000 of this was {{directed}} towards the excavations at Buckton Castle. A topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record the castle <b>earthworks</b> and examine the possible outer bailey. As a result, the possible outer bailey was revealed to be a 20th-century feature and was probably related to nearby mining activity. On two occasions (1999 and 2002) illegal digging by unknown parties necessitated remedial work and test pitting. In 2007 full-scale excavations at Buckton Castle began with the aim of establishing the date and history of the site. Across three seasons 2007, 2008, and 2010 trenches were opened across the ditch, the northern entrance, the gap in the circuit of <b>earthworks</b> on the south side, the interior, and the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|The most {{definite}} {{example of}} a Roman site in the area is found above Blaenllechau in Ferndale. The settlement {{is one of a}} group of <b>earthworks</b> and indicates the presence of the Roman army during the 1st century AD. It was thought to be a military site or marching camp.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{the first}} {{prolonged}} conflict in Britain to involve the use of artillery and gunpowder. Sieges became a prominent {{part of the war}} with over 300 occurring during the period. Worcester was once again a strategically important region in the war, and walled towns and cities like Worcester that could be defended against passing armies were particularly significant from a military perspective. By the 1640s the design of military fortifications had progressed significantly on the continent, owing largely to the Thirty Years War; while older medieval stone walls still had military utility, they typically needed reinforcement with more modern <b>earthworks</b> to be truly effective. These new ideas were applied to city defences in England. In some cases a circuit of forts was built around a city; in other cases, an entirely new city wall comprising modern bastions would be built. At Worcester, the unimproved walls were considered to be indefensible {{at the start of the}} war in 1642, and the chosen solution was to directly reinforce the existing medieval wall with new <b>earthworks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Giant, the <b>earthworks</b> {{belong to}} Lord Digby, {{rather than the}} National Trust. Its purpose is unknown, though it {{is thought to be}} the site of maypole dancing. It has been {{considered}} to be Roman, or perhaps an Iron-Age burial mound containing the tomb of the person represented by the Giant.|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of <b>earthworks,</b> surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} slowly, to {{the extent}} that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more <b>earthworks</b> than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's disloyalty {{led to the}} Crown {{seizing the}} castle again and taking on the burden of {{repairing}} and maintaining it. The expenditure was recorded in still-surviving Treasury accounts which provide a valuable insight into {{the development of the}} castle during the later medieval period. In the 1180s the defences appear to have been a combination of stone walls (the old Roman structure) with Norman modifications, plus <b>earthworks</b> and timber palisades. They were maintained in part by some of the local manors, which were under a feudal obligation called heckage that required them to repair and keep up sections of the palisades.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are <b>earthworks,</b> {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first {{studied in the}} eighteenth century and the first serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparations}} {{for his next}} campaign, Germanicus sent Publius Vitellius and Gaius Antius to collect taxes in Gaul, and instructed Silius, Anteius, and Caecina to build a fleet. A fort on the Lippe called Castra Aliso was besieged, but the attackers dispersed on sight of Roman reinforcements. The Germans destroyed the nearby mound and altar dedicated to his father Drusus, but he had them both restored and celebrated funerary games with his legions {{in honor of his}} father. New barriers and <b>earthworks</b> were put in place, securing the area between Fort Aliso and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|In the East, {{under cover}} of ground fog the field army {{successfully}} withdrew from the Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared, and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops. The new position had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the <b>earthworks</b> and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil {{had not yet been}} constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the <b>earthworks</b> when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived {{in one corner of the}} keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{when the first}} fortification at Longtown was built. The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman, or Anglo-Saxon periods, but this remains uncertain. If Roman defences were constructed at the site, it was probably because of a Roman road that may have run nearby, and the defences may well have then been reused {{in the building of}} the current castle, parts of whose <b>earthworks</b> have square, angular corners, similar to those of Roman forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles.|$|E
5|$|Many astronomical {{alignments}} {{have been}} claimed for Stonehenge, {{a complex of}} megaliths and <b>earthworks</b> in the Salisbury Plain of England. The most famous {{of these is the}} midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} <b>earthworks</b> {{protecting}} the forts around Wola were being destroyed by Russian artillery. From 6:00, 108 pieces of Russian artillery {{were focused on}} forts 54, 55 and 57. Fort 54 held out and losses among the infantry were low, but the artillery of the isolated outposts was forced to hide behind the ramparts. Forts 59 and 61 could not support their neighbours as their crews fought their own artillery duel with horse artillery of Khilkov's Cavalry Division, which suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, {{in which the}} French were repulsed suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, to preserve their food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for <b>earthworks.</b> Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} to seal off the river with a chain or a boom {{stretching}} between the blockhouse and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished {{at a cost of}} £305. Further work was carried out on the defences, possibly including raising <b>earthworks</b> and establishing watch-houses. Fears of an invasion persisted for many years afterwards and in 1598 Charles Howard, the Lord High Admiral, expressed his concerns about the effectiveness of the Gravesend Blockhouse in protecting the Thames.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{set up a}} territory-based {{administrative}} system, establishing counties. Each county, {{headed by}} a royal official known as a count or ispán, was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress. Most fortresses were <b>earthworks</b> in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, Székesfehérvár and Veszprém were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around them, where markets were held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers.|$|E
5|$|The Bailey lies to {{the south}} of the walled Inner Court and was {{originally}} topped by a wooden palisade and <b>earthworks,</b> of which only the latter survive. The Bailey would have entered from an eastern gate and contained a range of buildings, probably including a Sergeant's Chamber, a Knights' Chamber, the Great Stable, barns and a granary. Modern visitors to the castle enter the complex through the Bailey from the south, which also contains the modern car park for the castle.|$|E
