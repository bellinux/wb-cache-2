5|$|ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", {{sometimes}} <b>hyphenated</b> ROT-13) is {{a simple}} letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.|$|E
5|$|The listed National Forest names {{represent}} the current management {{divisions of the}} National Forest System. Forests that are managed separately, such as Allegheny National Forest and Monongahela National Forest, are listed as separate forests. But forests that are managed together {{may or may not}} be listed separately. Forests managed together and with <b>hyphenated</b> names, such as Salmon-Challis National Forest, are considered to be a single National Forest. Forests that are managed together under titles such as Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, are considered to be separate forests. National Forests listed in this column in small text are constituent National Forests managed by, but not included in the name of, the named National Forest in normal text. If you are counting to reach 154 National Forests, count <b>hyphenated</b> names as two forests, with the exception of Manti-La Sal, which is the official name of one forest. Uinta-Wasatch-Cache is counted as three and George Washington and Jefferson is counted as two.|$|E

5|$|William Beach Thomas {{was born}} on 22 May 1868 in Godmanchester, in the county of Huntingdonshire, England. He was the second son of Daniel George Thomas and his wife, Rosa Beart. In 1872, his father was {{appointed}} rector of Hamerton and the countryside location of that parish inspired an affection in Beach Thomas which greatly influenced his later observational writings about natural history and rural subjects. Beach Thomas was not a <b>hyphenated</b> double-barrelled name; he used his second name {{as part of his}} surname.|$|E
5|$|Modern Britons are descended {{mainly from}} the varied ethnic groups that settled in the British Isles in and before the 11th century: Prehistoric, Brittonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Normans. The {{progressive}} political unification of the British Isles facilitated migration, cultural and linguistic exchange, and intermarriage between the peoples of England, Scotland and Wales during the late Middle Ages, early modern period and beyond. Since 1922 and earlier, there has been immigration to the United Kingdom by people from {{what is now the}} Republic of Ireland, the Commonwealth, mainland Europe and elsewhere; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens, with some assuming a British, dual or <b>hyphenated</b> identity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hyphenated</b> form {{in which}} two or more words are {{connected}} by a hyphen. Compounds that contain affixes, such as house-build(er) and single-mind(ed)(ness), as well as adjective-adjective compounds and verb-verb compounds, such as blue-green and freeze-dried, are often <b>hyphenated.</b> Compounds that contain articles, prepositions or conjunctions, such as rent-a-cop, mother-of-pearl and salt-and-pepper, are also often <b>hyphenated.</b>|$|E

25|$|This ss that replaces an ß {{has to be}} <b>hyphenated</b> as {{a single}} letter in the {{traditional}} orthography. For instance STRA-SSE (‘street’); compare Stra-ße. In the reform orthography, it is <b>hyphenated</b> like other double consonants: STRAS-SE.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{hyphenation}} based on pronunciation, foreign compounds may be <b>hyphenated</b> at their boundary, if the prefix or suffix is widely recognized, e.g. fotog-ráfia (by syllables) or foto-gráfia (by elements). The elements are also {{taken into consideration}} in compound names (e.g. Pálffy , <b>hyphenated</b> as Pál-ffy, rather than *Pálf-fy). Sometimes different ways of hyphenation reflect different words (e.g. me-gint ‘again,’ a single word <b>hyphenated</b> by syllables, cf. meg-int ‘admonish,’ a compound with a verbal prefix, <b>hyphenated</b> by elements). Hyphens {{are not to be}} repeated {{at the beginning of the}} next line, except in specialized textbooks, as a way of warning for the correct form.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the factors}} that helped the Doctor {{determine}} the home planet of the Slitheen was {{the fact that they had}} a <b>hyphenated</b> surname. Examples include the names Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen, and Jocrassa Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen. Additional <b>hyphenated</b> forms in Slitheen names suggest family sub-units within the broader Slitheen family.|$|E

25|$|Compound verbs in British English are <b>hyphenated</b> {{more often}} than in American English.|$|E
25|$|If an {{adjective}} {{is formed}} from a proper name, {{it is not}} capitalized. (In case of a <b>hyphenated</b> compound, no element is capitalized, e.g. Rippl-Rónai but rippl-rónais ‘typical of Rippl-Rónai’.) Suffixes are added directly, except if the name consists of several elements written separately: Széchenyi István and Széchenyi István-i. Compounds formed with personal names are always <b>hyphenated,</b> e.g. Ady-vers ‘a poem by Ady’.|$|E

50|$|A {{proposal}} {{which is}} totally consistent with regular grammar is to <b>hyphenate</b> li (he) and ŝi (she) to li-ŝi (or ŝi-li), similar {{to some other}} constructs in Esperanto, such as pli-malpli (more or less).|$|R
25|$|Points of the compass: northwest, northwestern, northwesterly, northwestwards. In British usage, the <b>hyphenated</b> {{and open}} {{versions}} are more common: north-western, north-westerly, north west, north-westwards.|$|E
25|$|Also nonbreaking hyphen, {{non-breaking hyphen}} and {{no-break}} hyphen. This character looks {{identical to the}} regular hyphen, but it is treated as a letter by word processors, namely that the <b>hyphenated</b> word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at {{what would be the}} end of a line of text; instead, the whole <b>hyphenated</b> word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The non-breaking space exists for similar reasons.|$|E

25|$|In France, until 1 January 2005, {{children}} were {{required by law}} to take the surname of their father. If the father was unknown, the child had the family name of the mother. Since 1 January 2005, article 311-21 of the French Civil code permits parents to give their children either the name of their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both - although no more than two names can be <b>hyphenated.</b> In cases of disagreement, both parents family names are <b>hyphenated</b> in alphabetic order with only the first of their names if they have a <b>hyphenated</b> name themselves. This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979. Similar measures were adopted by Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983), Spain (1999) and Austria (2013).|$|E
25|$|Frank Devenish Meares (25 April 1873 – 4 July 1952), also Frank Devenish-Meares (<b>hyphenated),</b> was an Australian sportsman {{who played}} both cricket and Australian rules {{football}} at high levels.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the bride}} and groom have to declare at the wedding which name they will use; and they have to declare which family name their {{children}} will get (which can be changed until the birth of the first child). Children can get either parent's surname, if it is on the marriage certificate, but all children must have the same surname. Since 2004 they can also get a <b>hyphenated</b> name, but only if both parents kept their birth names at least as one part of their new name. Children usually get their father's surname, but <b>hyphenated</b> names are becoming more common.|$|E
25|$|It is {{less common}} for women, {{especially}} in the U.S. and Canada, to combine their spouse's name with their own birth name. About 7% of American women <b>hyphenate</b> their name with their spouse's name upon marriage.|$|R
25|$|There was a {{tendency}} in the 18th century to use hyphens excessively, that is, to <b>hyphenate</b> all previously established solid compound verbs. American English, however, has diminished {{the use of}} hyphens, while British English is more conservative.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{the word}} very in a {{compound}} modifier {{is generally not}} accompanied by a hyphen. Where both (or all) of the words in a compound modifier are nouns, {{it is seen as}} not necessary to <b>hyphenate</b> them, as misunderstanding is unlikely.|$|R
