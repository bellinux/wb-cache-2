500|$|LaFace Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Bille Woodruff. The concept evolves around the ending of Braxton's relationship with her lover, played by model Tyson Beckford. As the video begins, Beckford is seen leaving their home, with Braxton giving him a goodbye kiss, then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the mailbox. After he leaves the garage, a fast car suddenly appears and causes an accident, leaving him lying on the street while Braxton cries over his body. She then walks around the house, remembering the good moments she had with him, such as swimming in the pool and playing Twister. During the bridge and final chorus, Braxton is seen singing the song during a live concert, an allusion to the film [...] "A Star is Born". As applause rises, the video fades to black. The music video premiered on September 10, 1996 on MTV.|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book. In public debate he has stated that if [...] "somebody borrowed the quote without <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that, that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.|$|E

Unbeknownst to David Letterman and the audience, Glover appeared in character as [...] "Rubin" [...] from the then-unreleased film Rubin and Ed, wearing platform {{shoes and a}} wig.

He believed that his wife's profession would have led her to rush to the nearby World Trade Center, if she was in the vicinity, and offer aid to victims. Her mother further testified to their online chat, in which she said she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> out Windows on the World and possibly do some shopping at the Trade Center's mall.
