40|$|Introduction: Dental {{trauma to}} primary teeth {{or to the}} jaws may cause {{disorders}} {{on the development of}} permanent successor teeth. The alterations may either occur at the time of accident or be caused by post-traumatic consequences. Objective: The aim {{of this paper is to}} present cases of alterations on permanent dentition following dental trauma to primary teeth. Case reports: Three cases are presented in this paper. The severity of the post-traumatic sequels shown by the permanent teeth kept a direct relationship with the extent of the impact and patientâs age at the accident. These sequels resulted in whitish or brownish opacities, enamel hypoplasia, root <b>dilacerations,</b> and total arrest of root development. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the protocols for patients who had experienced dental trauma must observe a systematic clinical and radiographic follow-up as well as alternatives of treatment for the primary and permanent teeth involved. Prognostics and treatments related to the sequels in permanent teeth may be obtained from a close analysis of clinical and radiographic aspects, avoiding more damages to the stomatognathic system.

40|$|Introduction: Maxillary canines have {{important}} roles in facial appearance, development of arch, and functional occlusion. Radiographs are important in evaluating the location and nature of these anomalies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate two types of 2 D and 3 D imaging technique in diagnosis and treatment of maxillary impacted canines. Methods: Thirty eight patients (50 impacted canines) were enrolled. An oral radiologist assessed all of patientsâ panoramic radiographs and then cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to determine the presence of adjacent teeth root resorption, root <b>dilacerations</b> before dental extraction, dental rotation, and buccolingual localization ofimpacted canine crown and root contact with sinus and nasal cavity. Then using the patientâs radiographs the treatment plan of each impacted canine was determined by an orthodontist. Results: Differences between panoramic radiography and CBCT in diagnosis of root resorption and dental rotation were significant. There was an agreement between panoramic radiographs and CBCT in localization of impacted teeth crown. Only the treatment plans of 20 % of impacted canines were different between panoramic radiographs and CBCT and treatment plan of 80 % of impacted teeth was similar. Conclusion: These results showed that 2 D and 3 D images of impacted maxillary canines can produce different diagnoses and treatment plans. ...|$|R
40|$|Preterm and low birthweight {{children}} comprise approximately 6 {{per cent}} of all live births.

The present paper reviews {{the results of this}} author 2 Ì 7 s own decade of research into the oral development of preterm children in the light of current understanding of the field. Studies have shown a high prevalence of generalized enamel hypoplasia in the primary dentition of around 40 - 70 per cent in preterm children which is likely to be associated with low bone mineral stores. The clinical significance of enamel defects is poor aesthetics, and predisposition of the lesions to dental caries. Other dental defects observed in preterm children are localized enamel hypoplasia, crown <b>dilacerations,</b> and palatal distortions which are usually associated with traumatic laryngoscopy and prolonged endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that the rate of dental development, and dental eruption may be affected by preterm birth.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Root <b>dilaceration</b> is {{a dental}} anomaly {{characterized}} by an abnormal curvature of the dental root, which can cause problems during eruption and complications in the orthodontic and endodontic treatment or extraction. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of root <b>dilaceration</b> in permanent incisors in an oral radiology clinic in the city of JoÃ£o Pessoa / PB, Brazil. METHODS: The sample consisted of 548 patients who allowed assessments of their dental radiographs, a total of 3, 948 examined teeth. Each tooth was examined according to the occurrence of root <b>dilaceration,</b> regarding type (mild, moderate or severe), root third that it was in and direction of the root. The angle formed by the root deviation in relation to the long tooth axis was obtained by means of a diagram printed on transparent acetate, placed over the radiograph.

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the frequency and characteristics of dental transpositions and to evaluate associated dental anomalies in a large sample of Turkish Anatolian population. Study design: A retrospective study was performed using panoramic radiographs of 6983 patients (4092 females and 2891 males) ranging in age from 12 to 27 subjected to Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Ataturk (Erzurum, Turkey) between 2005 and 2008. For each patient with tooth transposition we recorded the demographic variables (including age, sex), history of trauma, type, classification, and location of tooth transpositions, and associated dental anomalies. The Pearson chi-squared test was used to determine potential differences in the distribution of tooth transposition when stratified by gender. Results: Tooth transposition was detected in 19 subjects (0. 27 %), with a 2. 2 : 1 female male ratio (P= 0. 38). The most commonly observed transposition was maxillary canine-lateral incisor (60 %). The frequencies of complete and incomplete transpositions were equal (10 / 10) and it was more common in the left side than in the right side (11 / 9).

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Maxillary canines are esthetically and {{functionally}} important, but {{patients with}} impacted maxillary canines {{are perceived to}} be more difficult and time-consuming to treat than the average orthodontic patient. The aim {{of this study was to}} define orthodontic Treatment Difficulty Index (TDI) of impacted maxillary canine with CBCT according to experts' opinions. Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study, nine variables in CBCT of thirty six consecutive patients with 50 impacted maxillary canines were measured using Dolphin 3 D. The related 3 D and 2 D pictures and the measured data were uploaded on a website. Ten orthodontists were asked to judge the difficulty of bringing the impacted canine to occlusal plane from 1 to 10 (1 = easy, 10 = extremely difficult). Then, they were also asked to evaluate the effect of each variable on treatment from 1 to 5 (1 = very low, 5 = very high). Random effect linear regression was used in exploration stage and then simple linear regression was used for the application of the model. Results: The patients mean age was 19. 08 Â± 5. 8 years. Mean clinical experience of examiners was 22. 7 Â± 12. 02 years. Three variables were deleted at exploration stage and two other in model application stage.

The recorded platelet numbers were closer to the lower physiological limit, indicating a mild thrombocytopenia, with values ranging from 26. 6 to 30. 43 Ã 104 /mm 3. The phagocytic index revealed significant differences (P< 0. 001) between the mean values obtained before vaccination (day 0) and the 3 post-vaccination measurements, confirming the increase in phagocytic capacity after immunisation. Additionally, the serum lysozyme average value equalled 9. 14 mg/mL post-vaccination. The analysis of variance revealed significant statistical differences (P< 0. 05) between the average values obtained before vaccination (0) and the post-vaccination values, measured on day 14 and 30, respectively. The morphology of the samples collected from the main organs involved in immune protection, spleen and gastric and portal lymph nodes highlighted changes corresponding to the post-vaccination immunological response. The white pulp of the spleen appeared as a diffuse lymphoid tissue, presenting with primary and secondary lymphoid follicles.
