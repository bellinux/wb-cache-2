5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock</b> known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

40|$|Plutonic {{rocks in}} the Lunckeryggen-Brattnipene region, Sor Rondane Mountains are divided into the older (late Proterozoic) and younger (early Paleozoic) <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks.</b> The older <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> are {{composed}} of tonalite, quartz diorite, granodiorite and small sheet-like granite, granodiorite and trondhjemite. They have a gneissose structure and show a concordant relation to the surrounding metamorphic rocks. On {{the basis of their}} field occurrences, it seems that they have intruded before or during the period of the regional mylonitization. The younger <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> are composed of syenite, quartz syenite and granite. They occur as stocks or dikes intruding discordantly into the surrounding <b>rocks.</b> The older <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> give low values of magnetic susceptibility in general, while most of the younger <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> give high magnetic values in Lunckeryggen and the neighborhood. Magnetic values on the discordant granites of the younger stage decrease northward in the Lunckeryggen-Brattnipene region. Moreover, the magnetic values of the younger <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> in the western Sor Rondane Mountains show a possibility that the lateral variation extends farther west from the Lunckeryggen-Brattnipene region. The younger <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> are composed of alkaline rocks in contrast with the older <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> dominated by tonalite and granodiorite with low K_ 2 O content in the Sor Rondane Mountains. Syenitic {{rocks in the}} Sor Rondane Mountains are characterized by high K_ 2 O and low Na_ 2 O contents. Such extremely high K_ 2 O/Na_ 2 O ratios correspond to that of the syenitic rocks in the Yamato and Belgica Mountains and it is considered that the high K_ 2 O/Na_ 2 O ratio may be a general characteristic of the early Paleozoic plutonism in the eastern Queen Maud Land. The transition of the plutonism from calc-alkaline to alkaline affinity corresponds to the tendency of the Pan-African magmatism...|$|R

2500|$|An {{intrusion}} of light-coloured diorite {{lies at the}} northern end of the Tetapaga Syncline, along the Milne-Sherman Road. Its colouration is from weathering of plagioclase, which comprises more than 50% of the <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock.</b> Several east-trending high-strain zones related to the Link Lake Deformation Zone, less than [...] wide, are found in the intrusion, indicating that it formed at least before the last increment of strain along the Link Lake Deformation Zone. The dioritic intrusion might be the remains of a magma chamber that was the product of calc-alkaline feldspar-phyric felsic volcanism, the erupted products of which are mostly located in the Sherman Mine area.|$|E
2500|$|Around Blaenau Ffestiniog, {{there are}} five veins of slate, {{separated}} from one another by bands of poor quality slate which is of no use or by other <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock.</b> They are called the North, Back, Narrow, Old and New veins, with the North Vein being nearest to the surface. The veins dip down towards the north at an angle of between 20 and 29 degress. Apart from small-scale trials [...] on other veins, {{nearly all of the}} slate extracted at Rhosydd was from the Old Vein, which is about [...] thick at this point. Where the rock outcrops, opencast working was possible, and the West Twll is evidence of this approach, but it soon became uneconomical to remove the rock above the slate, and the quarry became a mine. Floors were formed at vertical intervals of about , first in the opencase section, and then underground. Once below ground, an incline was cut just below the hard rock above the vein. From this, horizontal galleries or floors were cut, which formed the starting points for chambers. Each chamber was begun by miners, who cut a roofing shaft, which they then widened and made a trench on one side, to allow the rockmen to free blocks of slate. The chambers varied in width, as did the pillars left between them to support the roof, but on average, chambers were [...] wide, and pillars were [...] wide. Careful alignment was necessary, to ensure that the pillars on one floor were above the pillars on the floor below, so that a continuous wall of slate supported the rocks above.|$|E
60|$|The altered clay-slate formation, already described, is seen {{in several}} parts of the valley as far down as Las Vacas, {{underlying}} the porphyritic conglomerate. At the Casa de Pujios [L], there is a hummock of (andesitic?) granite; and the stratification of the surrounding mountains here changes from W. by S. to S.W. Again, near the R. Vacas there is a larger formation of (andesitic?) granite [M], which sends a meshwork of veins into the superincumbent clay-slate, and which locally throws off the strata, on one side to N.W. {{and on the other}} to S.E. but not at a high angle: at the junction, the clay-slate is altered into fine-grained greenstone. This granitic axis is intersected by a green dike, which I mention, because I do not remember having elsewhere seen dikes in this lowest and latest <b>intrusive</b> <b>rock.</b> From the R. Vacas to the plain of Uspallata, the valley runs N.E., so that I have had to contract my section; it runs exclusively through porphyritic rocks. As far as the Pass of Jaula, the claystone conglomerate formation, in most parts highly porphyritic, and crossed by numerous dikes of greenstone porphyry, attains a great thickness: there is also much intrusive porphyry. From the Jaula to the plain, the stratification has been in most places obliterated, except near the tops of some of the mountains; and the metamorphic action has been extremely great. In this space, the number and bulk of the intrusive masses of differently coloured porphyries, injected one into another and intersected by dikes, is truly extraordinary. I saw one mountain of whitish porphyry, from which two huge dikes, thinning out, branched DOWNWARDS into an adjoining blackish porphyry. Another hill of white porphyry, which had burst through dark- coloured strata, was itself injected by a purple, brecciated, and recemented porphyry, both being crossed by a green dike, and both having been upheaved and injected by a granitic dome. One brick-red porphyry, which above the Jaula forms an isolated mass {{in the midst of the}} porphyritic conglomerate formation, and lower down the valley a magnificent group of peaked mountains, differs remarkably from all the other porphyries. It consists of a red feldspathic base, including some rather large crystals of red feldspar, numerous large angular grains of quartz, and little bits of a soft green mineral answering in most of its characters to soapstone. The crystals of red feldspar resemble in external appearance those of orthite, though, from being partially decomposed, I was unable to measure them; and they certainly are quite unlike the variety, so abundantly met with in almost all the other rocks of this line of section, and which, wherever I tried it, cleaved like albite. This brick-red porphyry appears to have burst through all the other porphyries, and numerous red dikes traversing the neighbouring mountains have proceeded from it: in some few places, however, it was intersected by white dikes. From this posteriority of intrusive origin,--from the close general resemblance between this red porphyry and the red granite of the Portillo line, the only difference being that the feldspar here is less perfectly granular, and that soapstone replaces the mica, which is there imperfect and passes into chlorite,--and from the Portillo line a little southward of this point appearing to blend (according to Dr. Gillies) into the western ranges,--I am strongly urged to believe (as formerly remarked) that the grand mountain-masses composed of this brick-red porphyry belong to the same axis of injection with the granite of the Portillo line; if so, the injection of this porphyry probably took place, as long subsequently to the several axes of elevation in the gypseous formation near the Cumbre, as the injection of the Portillo granite has been shown to have been subsequent to the elevation of the gypseous strata composing the Peuquenes range; and this interval, we have seen, must have been a very long one.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Hamit pluton {{is one of}} the {{alkaline}} intrusions in the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC). The pluton {{consists of}} nepheline syenite, pseudoleucite syenite, alkali-feldspar syenite and quartz syenite. The nepheline syenite and pseudoleucite syenite are cut by foid-bearing microsyenitic dykes, whereas the alkali-feldspar syenite and quartz syenite are cut by aplitic and silicic dykes. The predominantly peralkaline Hamit <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> possess field, petrographic and geochemical characteristics comparable to A-type granites. All <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> of this pluton show enrichment in LILE and LREE relative to HFSE. The Th/Yb versus Ta/Yb plot suggests that the <b>intrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> formed from an enriched mantle source region carrying a subduction component inherited from pre-collision subduction events. Either thermal perturbation of the metasomatised lithosphere by delamination of the thermal boundary layer (TBL) or removal of a subducted plate (slab breakoff) are the likely mechanisms for initiation of the post-collisional magmatism of this complex...|$|R
