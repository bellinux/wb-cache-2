40|$|Abstract—Modern {{application}} specific system-on-chip plat-forms allow customization of caches. Such flexibility {{enables the}} designers {{to identify the}} suitable cache configurations through design space exploration of caches. Trace-driven simulation is widely used to obtain the cache hits and misses for design space exploration. However, simulation is normally slow. Meanwhile, as the embedded system moves toward cache hierarchies with multi-level caches, such expanded design space leads to extremely long simulation time. In this paper, we propose a rapid design space <b>exploration</b> <b>technique</b> for two-level unified caches. Given the application trace, our technique determines the cache hits and misses for multiple cache configurations in a single pass. Our <b>exploration</b> <b>technique</b> adopts a novel LRU linked list data structure, lookup tables, and search algorithms to effectively improve the exploration time. Experimental results indicate that our analysis is 7 – 239 X times faster compared to the fastest known design space <b>exploration</b> <b>technique,</b> in estimating cache hits and misses for popular embedded benchmarks.

INTRODUCTION Sedimentary basins in Northwest Europe {{have significant}} potential for low to medium enthalpy, deep geothermal energy resources. These resources are generally assessed using standard seismic <b>exploration</b> <b>techniques</b> to resolve geological structures. However, the electrical resistivity parameter, which can be directly impacted by the presence of a geothermal reservoir is rarely investigated in such context. Therefore, the development of alternative and complementary <b>exploration</b> <b>techniques</b> such as Electromagnetic (EM) techniques may have an important role in reducing the cost and uncertainty associated with geothermal resource assessment...|$|R

Efficient exploration is of fundamental importance for autonomous agents that learn to act. Previous approaches to exploration in reinforcement learning usually address exploration in the case when the environment is fully observable. In contrast, we study the case when the environment is only partially observable. We consider different <b>exploration</b> <b>techniques</b> applied to the learning algorithm “Utile Suffix Memory”, and, in addition, discuss an adaptive fringe depth.
