Normally, these air conditioners are selected for worst-case conditions, and work on an on/off control. This paper describes the work carried out to analyse the performance of an air conditioner (AC) with variable refrigerant flow (VRF) for a masters degree dissertation [1]. The performance of a standard on/off air conditioner was first measured. The implementation of VRF in a control cabinet was carried out successfully by installing a variable-speed compressor within a standard AC unit. Experiments performed showed that the energy savings are 14 % at full load and between 8 and 32 % at part load. For most conditions, the <b>enclosure</b> <b>temperature</b> could be controlled to a stable value with a flat <b>enclosure</b> <b>temperature</b> profile. Maintaining a stable <b>enclosure</b> <b>temperature</b> reduces electronic component failure. A computer model was created using Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, {{which could be used}} within Microsoft EXCEL. For a given set of ambient temperatures and enclosure loads, the model estimates the power consumption of a standard AC and a VRF AC and calculates the potential savings. When applied to various scenarios, savings of 18 - 25 % were achieved. The system efficiency can be improved further by other changes to the AC design. A mathematical software model of the AC was built using Visual Basic Express 2005, to evaluate these potential improvements. It was shown that the COP could be improved by increasing the air-flows and by controlling evaporator superheat. By using an electronic expansion valve, the degree of superheat could be accurately controlled.

For turbomachinery applications, this guard is an oil-tight enclosure and {{the purpose is to}} trap any oil escaping the machinery seals. When couplings rotate at high speeds in oil-tight enclosures, they shear the air, and this shearing results in a significant heat generation. The <b>temperature</b> of the <b>enclosure,</b> as well as the coupling, depends on the amount of air shearing and on the ability of the enclosure to dissipate the heat. Another problem with couplings operating in oil-tight enclosures is that negative pressures are created occasionally in the vicinity of machinery seals, causing oil to be sucked in the enclosure, which is particularly detrimental for gear reducers. Numerous tests were conducted at Koppers' Power Transmission facilities with various types and sizes of couplings, operating at various speeds, within enclosures of many configurations. Measurements were taken of the coupling and the <b>enclosure</b> <b>temperatures,</b> pressures in the enclosures, and the cooling effect of air flow and oil spray.

Numerical temperature predictions for natural convection in air of a heated cubic component inside a perspex enclosure are compared with experimental measurements.

Only the upstream component is heated and the intercomponent distances are varied. The Reynolds number based on the component height equals 190.

40|$|With the {{evolution}} of 3 G wireless communications, the once benign thermal management requirements of portable handset design are quickly gaining potential for becoming long-term performance and safety roadblocks. The need for EMI shielding of plastic-housed handsets, particularly wireless devices, {{has long been known}} and met through a variety of methods. The most common approach to shielding at the plastic enclosure level is to apply a conductive coating on the housing’s interior surface. Methods for applying this conductive layer include; sprayed conductive paint, vacuum deposited metallization and electroless plating. However, none of these existing techniques address the designer’s thermal management challenges. A new method developed for applying a metallic conformal coating to plastic enclosures combines traditional EMI shielding performance with a heat-spreading material layer that provides an effective thermal management solution. Thermal performance data has been gathered for a typical power semiconductor component mounted to a plastic housing in a closed environment.

Cortical neurons (extracted from 18 -day old rat embryos) are dissociated and plated onto a grid of 59 electrodes {{on the center of}} an MEA culture dish. Once plated, the neurons reform synaptic connections with one another to become a single functional network, displaying highly correlated activity among constituent neurons. MEAs can be used as two-way interface between the outside world and LNNs. In-vitro LNNs serve as excellent models for long-term experiments studying the development of network circuitry. This specific investigation focused on designing novel technologies aimed at studying a specific form of neural network plasticity: synaptic scaling in homeostatic plasticity.

40|$|Flow {{and heat}} {{transfer}} of NH{sub 3 } and He were studied in a rotating disk system with applications to {{chemical vapor deposition}} reactors. Flow field and disk heat flux were obtained over a range of operating conditions. Comparisons of disk convective heat transfer were made to infinite rotating disk results to appraise uniformity of transport to the disk. Important operating variables include disk spin rate, disk and <b>enclosure</b> <b>temperatures,</b> flow rate, composition, pressure, and gas mixture temperature at the reactor inlet. These variables were studied over ranges of the spin Reynolds number, Re{omega}; disk mixed convection parameter, MCP{sub w}; and wall mixed convection parameter, MCP{sub w}. Results obtained for NH{sub 3 } show that increasing Re{omega} from 314. 5 to 3145 increases the uniformity of rotating disk heat flux and results in thinner thermal boundary layers at the disk surface. At Re{omega}= 314. 5, increasing MCP{sub d} to 15 leads to significant departure from the infinite disk result with nonuniform disk heat fluxes and recirculating flow patterns; flow becomes increasingly complex at larger values of MCP{sub d}. At Re{omega} of 3145, results are closer to the infinite disk for MCP{sub d} up to 15. For large negative (hot walls) and positive (cold walls) values of MCP{sub w}, flow recirculates and there is significant deviation from the infinite disk result; nonuniformities occur at both values of Re{omega}.

40|$|International audienceThis {{literature}} review summarizes the environmental controls governing biogenic sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions and presents {{a compendium of}} numerous SQT-emitting plant species {{as well as the}} quantities and ratios of SQT species they have been observed to emit. The results of many enclosure-based studies indicate that temporal SQT emission variations appear to be dominated mainly by ambient temperatures although other factors contribute (e. g. seasonal variations). This implies that SQT emissions have increased significance at certain times of the year, especially in late spring to mid-summer. The strong temperature dependency of SQT emissions also creates the distinct possibility of increasing SQT emissions in a warmer climate. Disturbances to vegetation (from herbivores and possibly violent weather events) are clearly also important in controlling short-term SQT emissions bursts, though the relative contribution of disturbance-induced emissions is not known. Based on the biogenic SQT emission studies reviewed here, SQT emission rates among numerous species have been observed to cover a wide range of values, and exhibit substantial variability between individuals and across species, as well as at different environmental and phenological states. These emission rates span several orders of magnitude (10 s? 1000 s of ng g DW ? 1 h ? 1). Many of the higher rates were reported by early SQT studies, which may have included artificially-elevated SQT emission rates due to higher-than-ambient <b>enclosure</b> <b>temperatures</b> and disturbances to enclosed vegetation prior to and during sample collection. When predicting landscape-level SQT fluxes, modelers must consider the numerous sources of variability driving observed SQT emissions. Characterizations of landscape and global SQT fluxes are highly uncertain given differences and uncertainties in experimental protocols and measurements, the high variability in observed emission rates from different species, the selection of species that have been studied so far, and ambiguities regarding controls over emissions. This underscores the need for standardized experimental protocols, better characterization of disturbance-induced emissions, screening of dominant plant species, and the collection of multiple replicates from several individuals within a given species or genus as well as a better understanding of seasonal dependencies of SQT emissions in order to improve the representation of SQT emission rates...|$|R

Sky wells also serve as vents for rising hot air, which draws cool air from the lower stories {{of the house and}} allows for exchange of cool air with the outside.|$|R
40|$|The {{shrinkage}} of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) for {{flexible display}} applications is investigated using a Thermal Mechanical Analyzer (TMA). The effect of temperature on {{the resistance of}} the ITO coated PET was measured using a custom built 4 -wire resistance probe in a <b>temperature</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Thermal shrinkage of the substrate effects {{the resistance of the}} ITO and is temperature and substrate dependent. The shrinkage is also anisotropic with the greatest shrinkage in the machine direction. Shrinkage of up to 4 % was obtained for samples maintained at 180 ° C. This shrinkage can greatly influence the reliability of the ITO layer and must be considered during fabrication of flexible displays. 1...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{convection}} loops (NCL) {{can occur}} when extracting energy from thermal storage with immersed heat exchangers. To assist in heat exchanger design and annual performance simulations of such systems, this paper proposes modeling an NCL with a comparatively simple ''ersatz'' thermosiphon loop (ETL). In an actual thermosiphon loop, fluid in channels or pipes flows {{in a closed}} loop, driven by a net buoyancy head which {{is equal to the}} total pressure drop. In the proposed approach, ersatz flow channels corresponding to the actual NCL flow are first defined, based upon experiment, numerical solution, or other information. The heat transfer and friction coefficients in the simplified ETL model must then be adjusted to fit these known data. The test case analyzed here is a horizontal shallow <b>enclosure</b> with <b>temperature</b> boundary conditions at both ends. A numerical solution is used to calibrate the ETL, and an analytical solution is used to extrapolate to other conditions for testing the ETL mo del predictions. It is shown that over two orders of magnitude variation in heat transfer, the calibrated ETL model predicts the heat transfer to 8 % RMSD...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} Navier-Stokes {{and energy}} equations are numerically solved for natural convection of {{air in a}} horizontal enclosure. The bottom wall is conductive containing a heat source and the other walls are either insulated or isothermal. Flow patterns in the <b>enclosure</b> and the <b>temperature</b> distributions on the bottom wall are presented graphically. The local temperature and Nusselt number profiles at several conductive wall thicknesses are also plotted. Further, {{the effects of the}} thermal conductivity ratios of the wall-to-air and heat source-to-air on the effective heat transfer area are clarified. A correlation between Nusselt number and the modified Rayleigh number is obtained to predict the possible temperature rise of the heat source when the ratio of effective heat transfer to the total surface area is below 0. 2...|$|R
40|$|The National Transonic Facility, NTF, {{is a high}} Reynolds Number {{facility}} where the increase in Reynolds Number is obtained by operating at high pressures and low temperatures. Liquid nitrogen is allowed to vaporize, making gaseous nitrogen the test medium with temperatures extending down to approximately 100 degrees Kelvin. These factors have created unique, new challenges to those developing sensors and instrumentation. Pressure vessels, thermal <b>enclosures</b> or elaborate <b>temperature</b> compensations schemes, are needed for environmental protection and special materials are needed for sensors and model fabrication. The {{need for a new}} measurement, model deformation, was also created. An extensive program to develop the unique sensors and instrumentation was initiated. The data acquisition system and systems to measure aerodynamic forces and pressures, model attitude, and model deformation, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} are to compare soil respiration rate and its temperature sensitivity at different land use types and discuss soil respiration response to soil temperature (Ts) and soil water content at different soil depths. Methods Periodic measurements of soil respiration rates (Rs) were made during August–October 2009 with a LI- 8100 portable automated soil CO 2 flux system in three agro-pastoral ecotone land use types: cropland, abandoned cultivated land and grazing <b>enclosure.</b> Soil <b>temperature</b> and soil water content at 0 – 5, 5 – 10 and 10 – 15 cm depths were measured simultaneous {{adjacent to the}} soil collar. Important findings Rs is significantly different among the three land use types and greatest in cropland. Rs exhibited a unimodal curve during 6 : 00 – 18 : 00, with a maximum during 12 : 00 – 15 : 00. Rs decreased with Ts, so Rs was significantly higher in August than in September and October. With the Van’t Hoff model, we concluded thereis a positive, exponential relationship between measured Ts and Rs. In addition, temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q 10), which {{is derived from the}} Van’t Hoff model, was largest in cropland. In contrast, Rs was negatively related to soil water content in different soil depths at the sites...|$|R
