40|$|Responses of leaf water {{relations}} and photosynthesis to summer drought and autumn rewetting were studied in two evergreen Mediterranean oak species, Quercus ilex spp. rotundifolia and Quercus suber. <b>The</b> <b>predawn</b> leaf water potential (ΨlPD), stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic rate (A) at ambient conditions were measured seasonally over a 3 -year period. We also measured the photosynthetic response to light and to intercellular CO 2 (A/PPFD and A/ Ci response curves) under water stress (summer) and after recovery due to autumn rainfall. Photosynthetic parameters, Vcmax, Jmax and triose phosphate utilization (TPU) rate, were estimated using the Farquhar model.

40|$|Proceedings - IX International Terroir Congress, 2012 Aiming to {{evaluate}} {{the potential of the}} portuguese Dão winegrowing region for the production of Touriga Nacional (TN) red grapes, climatic, ecophysiological and viticultural data from two different climatic years (2004, wet year and 2005, dry year) are presented and discussed. The data was collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control non-irrigated plants of an irrigation experiment installed at the Dão Research Station, Nelas, Portugal. The vineyard is established in a typical granitic soil and trained on a vertical shoot positioning. According to the Géoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification System, the Dão region is classified as temperate/temperate warm for the heliothermal index, with cool nights (night cold index) and moderately dry (dryness index). <b>In</b> 2004 <b>the</b> <b>predawn</b> leaf water potential presented always values higher than - 0. 2 MPa from flowering to harvest but in 2005 moderate to severe water stress was observed during the ripening period (- 0. 4 MPa at veraison to - 0. 6 MPa at harvest).

In a container study, 1. 2 -m-high shelters were placed over whips following transplanting, then diurnal microclimate, water relations, and water use were measured. Shelter air temperature and vapor pressure were substantially higher, and solar radiation was 70 % lower, than ambient conditions. Sheltered trees responded with nearly three-times higher stomatrd conductance than nonsheltered trees.

Grass cover conduced to a less dense canopy, especially in 2005, by a reduction of the leaf layer number (LLN), higher penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at cluster zone and in 2005, provoked a drastic increase on the proportion of sunburned leaves and scalded clusters.

Vorse is mentioned again in the squadron history on 12 January, when VF-80 flew a record 144 sorties and sunk an estimated 51,000 tons worth of escorts, oilers and merchant vessels. According to the record he flew three times that day and gave [...] "Jap shipping a very unfriendly time." [...] In short order, however, the shoe would be on the other foot.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the use of thermography for locating spoilage areas (chimneys) within storage piles and to subsequently use the information for the scheduling of their processing. Thermal-infrared quantitative scanner data were acquired initially on January 16, 1975, over the storage piles at Moorhead, Minnesota, both during <b>the</b> day and <b>predawn.</b> Photographic data were acquired during the day mission to evaluate the effect of uneven snow cover on the thermal emittance, and <b>the</b> <b>predawn</b> thermography was used to locate potential chimneys. The piles were examined the day prior for indications of spoilage areas, and the ground crew indicated that no spoilage areas were located using their existing methods. Nine spoilage areas were interpreted from the thermography. The piles were rechecked by ground methods three days following the flights. Six of the nine areas delineated by thermography were actual spoilage areas...|$|R

40|$|Among several {{different}} types of radio emissions discovered at Uranus during the Voyager 2 encounter in January 1986 is a very sporadic, bursty signal which consists of very narrow bands lying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency range from about 3 to 10 kHz. The bursty emission was virtually undetectable from the dayside portion of the Voyager 2 trajectory, but was observed out to beyond 300 R(U) during the outbound trajectory through <b>the</b> <b>predawn</b> sector. While <b>the</b> narrowband tones making up this emission are reminiscent of escaping continuum radiation observed near earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, the Uranian signals show large amplitude variations on time scales of 1 s, suggesting a very different type of generation mechanism...|$|R
