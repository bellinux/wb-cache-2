40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that LK, a system of propositional sequent calculus, without a cut rule (written <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> form) does not p-simulate LK with a full cut rule (written <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> form) [1, 6]. It is also known that LK with a full cut rule in tree-form p-simulates LK in DAG form. In this paper, we show that LK (<b>in</b> <b>tree</b> form) with a cut rule, where the {{complexity}} of cut formulas is bounded by (k + 1) has an exponential speed-up over the one bounded by k. We also show that LK (<b>in</b> <b>tree</b> form) with a bounded complexity cut rule does not polynomially simulate cut-free LK in DAG form...|$|R
5|$|Herons and egrets are {{medium to}} large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. They all fly with their necks retracted. The sharp bill is used to catch fish, {{amphibians}} and other animals. Many species nest in colonies, often <b>in</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E
5|$|House sparrows {{sleep with}} the bill tucked {{underneath}} the scapular feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally <b>in</b> <b>trees</b> or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs {{before and after the}} birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} emerald ash borer {{has not yet}} been detected, surveys are used to monitor for new infestations. Visual surveys are used to find ash trees {{displaying}} emerald ash borer damage, and traps with colors attractive to emerald ash borer, such as purple or green, are hung <b>in</b> <b>trees</b> as part of a monitoring program. These traps can also have volatile pheromones applied to them that attract primarily males.|$|E

3000|$|... “Sanbu-sugi” {{cultivar}} of Cryptomeria japonica {{has been}} one of the most economically important trees used for lumber <b>in</b> Japan. The <b>tree</b> heights where annual rings disconnected were 4 and 6  m <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> 1 and 2  m <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> 2, and tree ages were 15 and 24  years old <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> 1 and 37  years old <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> 2, respectively (Fig.  3). Imazeki [4] reported on the prevention of the disease by early artificial pruning. In the Japanese Agricultural Standard for round logs [30], the standard length for log production of C. japonica is 1.9 – 4.3  m. Our results show that at heights of 2, 4 and 6  m, damage concerned the first, second, and third 2  m-round logs, respectively. These logs which had to be discriminated against were supposed to be the most economically valuable compared with the upper parts of the trees.|$|R

5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. It only perches <b>in</b> <b>trees</b> in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|M. alcathoe {{lives in}} small groups. In Greece, a {{maternity}} colony, containing three females and two juveniles, {{has been found}} in a plane tree. Additional roosts were found high in oak trees in Baden-Württemberg and Saxony-Anhalt. Twenty-seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one <b>in</b> <b>trees</b> (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree roosts were in oaks (Quercus robur); others were in limes (Tilia cordata), birches (Betula pendula), and various other species. Its strong preference for roosting sites <b>in</b> <b>trees</b> is unusual among European bats. Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy, and are often in old trees. In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups. M.alcathoe swarms from late July to mid-September in southern Poland.|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, <b>in</b> <b>trees,</b> underground or on two legs. The {{largest group of}} mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation.|$|E

5|$|Mindomys hammondi {{is known}} only from Ecuador, where {{it occurs in}} montane forest; a record from the Amazon basin {{lowlands}} is dubious. Reportedly, it lives {{on the ground and}} is associated with water; other suggest it lives <b>in</b> <b>trees.</b> A large, long-tailed, and long-whiskered rat, its fur is buff above and abruptly lighter below. The front part of the skull (rostrum) is heavily built.|$|E
5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night <b>in</b> <b>trees</b> or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Most nests are <b>in</b> <b>trees,</b> both {{deciduous}} and coniferous. Sometimes, {{they can}} be found in shrubs, vines, or on artificial constructs like buildings, or hanging flower pots. When there is no suitable elevated object, mourning doves will nest on the ground.|$|E

40|$|The {{first set}} of {{quantitative}} data of diffuse erythemal UV and UV-A radiation <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> shade at a sub-tropical Southern Hemisphere latitude is presented. Over the summer, approximately 60 % of the erythemal UV radiation <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> shade {{is due to the}} diffuse component. Similarly, approximately 56 % of the UV-A radiation <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> shade is due to the diffuse component. <b>In</b> <b>tree</b> shade these diffuse UV percentages are relatively constant from the morning to noon to afternoon periods. In comparison, in full sun, there is a decrease in the percentage of diffuse UV from morning to noon to afternoon. The exposures to diffuse UV on a horizontal plane <b>in</b> <b>tree</b> shade between 9 : 00 EST and 15 : 00 EST are of the order of 4 MED (minimum erythemal dose) and 14 J cm - 2 for erythemal UV and UV-A, respectively. The high diffuse UV component in the shade may result in high UV exposures not only to unprotected parts of the body on a horizontal plane, but also in equally high UV irradiances to parts of the body, including the eyes and face, that are not UV protected...|$|R

5|$|Outside its {{breeding}} season, the russet sparrow is gregarious {{and forms}} flocks to find food, though it infrequently associates with other birds.
