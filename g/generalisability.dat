50|$|While widely {{discussed}} {{in the context of}} machine learning, the bias-variance dilemma has been examined in the context of human cognition, most notably by Gerd Gigerenzer and co-workers in the context of learned heuristics.

This reflects the fact that a zero-bias approach has poor <b>generalisability</b> to new situations, and also unreasonably presumes precise knowledge of the true state of the world.

50|$|The <b>generalisability</b> of Nsamenang’s ‘West African’ theory {{across the}} many {{different}} societies in sub-Saharan Africa is debatable. For instance, there are mother-infant interactions among the Gusii of rural Kenya in the 1950s and 1970s that stands {{in marked contrast to}} Nsamenang’s description of social priming through cuddling and teasing. Gusii mothers, ‘are not expected to talk to or gaze at their infants or play with them’, and they explain how this (strange to Western eyes) emotional detachment is compatible with healthy emotional development in later life. Part of their explanation is that the infants receive playful stimulation and emotional support from their elder siblings and other child caregivers. The contrast between these ethnographic accounts serves as a warning that wide variations occur across different ethnocultural groups within the African region, and that further detailed research on socialization practices is needed.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Objective and {{reproducible}} {{evaluation of}} data quality {{is of paramount importance}} for studies of 'real-world' observational data. Here, we summarise a standardised data quality, density and <b>generalisability</b> process implemented by MSBase, a global multiple sclerosis (MS) cohort study. METHODS: Error rate, data density score and <b>generalisability</b> score were developed using all 35, 869 patients enrolled in MSBase as of November 2015. The data density score was calculated across six domains (follow-up, demography, visits, MS relapses, paraclinical data and therapy) and emphasised data completeness. The error rate evaluated syntactic accuracy and consistency of data. The <b>generalisability</b> score evaluated believability of the demographic and treatment information. Correlations among the three scores and the number of patients per centre were evaluated. RESULTS: Errors were identified at the median rate of 3 per 100 patient-years. The <b>generalisability</b> score indicated the samples' representativeness of the known MS epidemiology. Moderate correlation between the density and <b>generalisability</b> scores (ρ[*]=[*] 0. 58) and a weak correlation between the error rate and the other two scores (ρ[*]=[*]- 0. 32 to - 0. 33) were observed. The <b>generalisability</b> score was strongly correlated with centre size (ρ[*]=[*] 0. 79).

40|$|The thesis {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} centre selection on the <b>generalisability</b> across locations of trial-based economic evaluations. A novel methodology to assess and enhance the <b>generalisability</b> of trial findings was demonstrated using the comparison between wound-edge protection devices (WEPDs) and standard care to reduce surgical site infection (SSI) after open abdominal surgery as a case study. A systematic review and a preliminary economic model suggested that WEPDs may be effective and cost-effective in reducing SSI compared to standard care, although the methodological quality of available studies was poor. ROSSINI was a high quality multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) which demonstrated that WEPDs {{are unlikely to be}} effective or cost-effective, so their routine use cannot be recommended. The impact of centre selection on trial results was then investigated using ROSSINI as a case study. Mixed methods research demonstrated that most RCTs do not enrol centres so as to ensure a representative sample at jurisdiction level. The <b>Generalisability</b> index (Gix) was introduced as the basis of a novel methodology to assess <b>generalisability,</b> which was demonstrated using simulation methods and ROSSINI data.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{rationale}} for centre selection in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is often unclear but may {{have important implications}} for the <b>generalisability</b> of trial results. The aims of this study were to evaluate the factors which currently influence centre selection in RCTs and consider how <b>generalisability</b> considerations inform current and optimal practice. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Mixed methods approach consisting of a systematic review and meta-summary of centre selection criteria reported in RCT protocols funded by the UK National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) initiated between January 2005 -January 2012; and an online survey on the topic of current and optimal centre selection, distributed to professionals in the 48 UK Clinical Trials Units and 10 NIHR Research Design Services. The survey design was informed by the systematic review and by two focus groups conducted with trialists at the Birmingham Centre for Clinical Trials. 129 trial protocols were included in the systematic review, with a total target sample size in excess of 317, 000 participants. The meta-summary identified 53 unique centre selection criteria. 78 protocols (60 %) provided at least one criterion for centre selection, but only 31 (24 %) protocols explicitly acknowledged <b>generalisability.</b> This is consistent with the survey findings (n = 70), where {{less than a third of}} participants reported <b>generalisability</b> as a key driver of centre selection in current practice. This contrasts with trialists' views on optimal practice, where <b>generalisability</b> in terms of clinical practice, population characteristics and economic results were prime considerations for 60 % (n = 42), 57 % (n = 40) and 46 % (n = 32) of respondents, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Centres are rarely enrolled in RCTs with an explicit view to external validity, although trialists acknowledge that incorporating <b>generalisability</b> in centre selection should ideally be more prominent. There is a need to operationalize 'generalisability' and incorporate it at the design stage of RCTs so that results are readily transferable to 'real world' practice...|$|E

Nine characteristics were derived by an external criterion panel on which the quality of advice in a random sample of consultations (50) was assessed using rating scales. Following the application of <b>generalisability</b> theory, operational conditions for the assessment were selected to obtain a <b>generalisability</b> coefficient of around 0. 8. Nearly half the consultations achieved satisfactory scores on at least three-quarters of the criteria on which they were assessed.

40|$|To {{anticipate}} the likely market demand better {{and identify the}} best customers to target with potential new products early in their development, concept tests need to provide adequate data quality for the objectives of measurement. <b>Generalisability</b> theory provides a framework where a <b>generalisability</b> study can be conducted to identify each possible aspect of a measurement as a factor {{that may be a}} potential source of variability. When a limited budget is available, optimising measurement designs involves a trade-off between the accuracy of the data (i. e. <b>generalisability</b> coefficients) and cost considerations. Building on previous and ongoing research, this study presents a multivariate optimisation procedure to achieve the most cost-efficient measurement design under the pre-specified <b>generalisability</b> coefficient constraint. We used the available online concept testing data to illustrate how to optimise the measurement cost by sampling along the facets that contribute to the total error variance in different iso-generalisability designs. The findings may help to facilitate decision making for the sampling of respondents, concepts, items, and occasions in the design of concept test.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate how generalisable the public service motivation (PSM) observed in Western society is to China and {{to examine the effects of}} public service motivation on job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach – Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis techniques are applied to survey data of 191 public servants in China to investigate the <b>generalisability</b> of Western PSM. Using hierarchical regression analysis, the paper examines the effects of the dimensions of PSM on job satisfaction. Findings – The results show that the public service motivation observed in the West exists in China, but the <b>generalisability</b> of the construct is limited. Three of the four dimensions of public service motivation (attraction to public policy making, commitment to the public interest, and self-sacrifice) exist in China, but the fourth dimension (compassion) is unconfirmed. Originality/value – The paper is the first to examine the <b>generalisability</b> and instrumentality of PSM as observed in Western society to China. The results indicate that the public service motivation observed in the West also exists in China, but that the <b>generalisability</b> is limited. Public service motivation emerges from the results as a positively significant predictor of job satisfaction in the public sector of China.

40|$|In practice, product {{managers}} {{have to assume}} consumer evaluations of concepts generalise from the time (and research environment) of concept testing to the time (and market environment) of market introduction. However, {{little is known about}} the temporal stability or <b>generalisability</b> of the results of concept testing over occasions. Rarely have concept-testing studies incorporated testing of the same concepts on the same respondents on more than one occasion. This research investigates the importance of occasions as a source of error variance in estimates of the <b>generalisability</b> of concept test scores for both minor and major innovations within the context of <b>Generalisability</b> theory. The study collected concept evaluations of ten innovations from members of an online panel on three occasions, approximately a month apart. The results show that the three-way interaction among subjects, concepts and occasions is a substantial contributor to variation in concept testing of both major and minor innovations, with the contribution for major innovations even more substantial than for minor innovations. Moreover, failure to recognize occasions as an explicit source of variance in the <b>generalisability</b> analyses will lead managers to overestimate the <b>generalisability</b> of their decision studies. However, the impact of neglecting occasions varies by purpose of measurement and associated object of measurement. This research provides insight about how well concept testing can generalise over occasions. Concept test evaluations provided on an initial exposure are more favourable than will be received on any later occasions, and apparent differences in consumer evaluations of a particular concept in an initial test do not provide a generalisable basis for identifying which consumers will respond most favourably to it on a later occasion.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Generalisability</b> of {{longitudinal}} studies {{is threatened by}} issues such as choice of sampling frame, representativeness of the initial sample, and attrition. To determine representativeness, cohorts are often compared with the population of interest at baseline on demographic and health characteristics. This study illustrates the use of relative survival {{as a tool for}} assessing <b>generalisability</b> of results from a cohort of older people among whom death is a potential threat to <b>generalisability.</b> Methods The authors used data from the 1921 - 26 cohort (n = 12, 416, aged 70 - 75 in 1996) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). Vital status was determined by linkage to the National Death Index, and expected deaths were derived using Australian life tables. Relative survival was estimated using observed survival in the cohort divided by expected survival among women of the same age and State or Territory. Results Overall, the ALSWH women showed relative survival 9. 5 % above the general population. Within States and Territories, the relative survival advantage varied from 6 % to 23 %. The interval-specific relative survival remained relatively constant over the 12 years (1996 - 2008) under review, indicating that the survival advantage of the cohort has not diminished over time. Conclusion This study demonstrates that relative survival can be a useful measure of <b>generalisability</b> in a longitudinal study of the health of the general population, particularly when participants are older. </p...|$|E
