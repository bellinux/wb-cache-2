25|$|Inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by John Duff and Frank Clement, Barnato {{agreed to}} finance Bentley's business.

A subsequent agreed wind-up of the original Bentley company was agreed, with all existing creditors paid off for Â£75,000, but with existing shares devalued from Â£1.00 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares, meaning that he controlled the company, and became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: Â£35,000 as a debenture in July 1927; Â£40,000 in 1928; Â£25,000 in 1929.|$|E

[...] KKR raised more than three times what it had expected at the outset as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds that sought exposure to private equity but that could not make long term commitments to private equity funds.

[...] Posner and DWG are {{perhaps best known for}} the hostile takeover of Sharon Steel Corporation in 1969, one of the earliest such takeovers in the United States. [...] Posner's investments were typically motivated by attractive valuations, balance sheets and cash flow characteristics. [...] Because of its high debt load, Posner's DWG would generate attractive but highly volatile returns and would ultimately land the company in financial difficulty.
