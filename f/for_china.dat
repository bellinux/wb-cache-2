Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, exposing a microSD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that {{it was able to}} include an SD card slot in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take up as much internal space as that of the international models.|$|E
5|$|The Song dynasty (960–1279 AD) was a {{culturally}} rich and sophisticated age <b>for</b> <b>China.</b> There was blossoming of and advancements {{in the visual}} arts, music, literature, and philosophy. Officials of the ruling bureaucracy, who underwent a strict and extensive examination process, reached new heights of education in Chinese society, while general Chinese culture was enhanced by widespread printing, growing literacy, and various arts.|$|E
5|$|CTLS-4TAC – Designed {{for export}} under Lend-Lease, {{a total of}} 420 were produced, {{originally}} intended <b>for</b> <b>China.</b> Six hundred 4TACs and 4TAYs were sent to China after Pearl Harbor. The remaining 240 were dispersed for emergency situations, like in Alaska. The armor was doubled and the armament consisted of three 7.62mm (.30 cal) machine guns, {{one of which was}} mounted in a 240° traverse, hand-cranked turret. Under OCM 18526, the CTLS-4TAC was labeled Light Tank T16. All vehicles were scrapped in 1943.|$|E

In June 2016, it was reported that nearly 60 countries supported China's position. In July 2016, it was reported that more than 70 countries expressed their support <b>for</b> <b>China's</b> position. China stressed that 7 or 8 countries cannot represent international society.|$|R
5|$|Christopher Tärnström, {{the first}} apostle and a 43-year-old pastor {{with a wife}} and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed <b>for</b> <b>China.</b> Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a {{tropical}} fever on Côn Sơn Island the same year. Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling.|$|E

5|$|Massaro was a {{contestant}} on CBS's , {{which was}} the fifteenth season of the show, in 2007. Massaro approached the WWE {{with the idea of}} doing the show, and after going through the casting process, she found out she made the show ten days before she had to leave <b>for</b> <b>China</b> to film. Prior to the experience, Massaro had never been camping before, so to train for the show she had to get used to being outside. She was assigned to the Zhan Hu tribe in the first episode and quickly began quarreling with fellow contestant Dave Cruser. In the second episode, Massaro was voted off after six days with a 6–1 vote.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, at the UN, {{although}} the UN members and US were initially divided {{on how to}} respond to Chinese intervention in Korea, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire soon rallied the UN members towards US. Immediately afterward, a UN resolution that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1. In the opinion of historian Bevin Alexander, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes, and this later made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>China</b> to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan. The Korean War, which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel, would drag on for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Wang Zhizhi {{refused to}} return to China {{to play for the}} {{national}} team and was subsequently banned from playing <b>for</b> <b>China,</b> the CBA stipulated that Yao would have {{to return to}} play for the national team. They also said they would not let him go to the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall. After assurances from Team Yao that the Rockets would draft Yao with their number one pick, the CBA gave permission {{on the morning of the}} draft for Yao to play in the U.S. When the Rockets selected Yao with the first pick of the draft, he became the first international player ever to be selected first overall without having previously played U.S. college basketball.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{brought to}} the club his {{political}} awareness of Chinese matters. In 1928, following a public outrage over a massacre at Jinan (known as the Jinan Incident) in Shandong {{in which more than}} 5,000Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese, the club set up the Shandong Relief Fund. Its purpose was to raise funds <b>for</b> <b>China,</b> to create awareness amongst the Chinese about the Japanese invasion of China, and to encourage the Chinese to boycott Japanese goods and services. The Chinese community contributed a total of S$1.34 million within a year of its inception.|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee {{status in}} 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 {{was the first}} games {{in which they were}} {{eligible}} to participate. The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time. The Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007. Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations. China and the United States had the largest teams, with 639 athletes <b>for</b> <b>China</b> and 596 for the United States.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree of responsibility for the massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory <b>for</b> <b>China.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} India and Burma have {{proposed}} building, with China's cooperation, {{a link to}} the Eurasian Land Bridge that would start in India or Burma and connect to the Chinese rail system in Yunnan. The route would allow freight from India and Burma to travel overland to Europe. The link would also give rail access <b>for</b> <b>China</b> to the Indian Ocean. One proposed starting point for the route is Kyaukpyu. The governments of Thailand and Malaysia are also studying the feasibility of establishing rail links with China.|$|E

5|$|While U.S. support <b>for</b> <b>China</b> was {{a reason}} for the war, the U.S. Army did not deploy major ground forces there, {{although}} U.S. air and service units played a vital role. After being driven out of Burma in 1942, a provisional regiment of the U.S. Army (Merrill's Marauders) participated in the reconquest of Northern Burma in 1944, and two regiments took part in the Central Burma Campaign the following year before moving on into China. In response to U.S. Army Air Forces operations from China, the Japanese drove the Americans and Chinese from eastern China. Only in the last weeks of the war did the tide turn in favor of the Allies in China.|$|E
5|$|Working with Skywatch, the Autobots begin {{helping them}} deal with Transformer-related crises around Earth, finding {{themselves}} {{caught between the}} Combaticons, allied with North Korea, and the Predacons, working <b>for</b> <b>China.</b> Disenchanted Skywatch operative Sandra broadcasts footage of his battle to the world, exposing Skywatch's secret alliance with the Autobots; when Bumblebee tries to hold {{a press conference in}} response, he is grievously injured by a human agent of anti-Transformer movement Earth's Children, wielding Cybertronian weaponry surreptitiously supplied by the Decepticons. This heralds the return of the rebuilt Megatron, who launches a devastating attack on Skywatch and the Autobots but is eventually defeated by Optimus Prime and surrenders to his custody.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaty of Paris, the British {{government}} sought stronger {{ties with}} China. William Amherst, the diplomat chosen {{to inform the}} emperor of the peace in Europe and to offer Britain's friendship, specifically requested Maxwell and Alceste to accompany him. Maxwell, without a ship since HMS Daedalus was wrecked three years before, commissioned Alceste {{at the beginning of}} 1816. The journey out was uneventful; Alceste left Spithead <b>for</b> <b>China</b> on 9 February with Amherst aboard, and after stopping at Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope, Anyer, and Batavia, sailed through the Bangka Strait into the South China Sea. After calling to pay respects at Canton, Alceste transited the Straits of Formosa and hove-to in the Bohai Sea on 28 July. There she met the 10-gun brig-sloop, Lyra, despatched earlier to herald the arrival of Britain's ambassador.|$|E

5|$|Completed {{in early}} 1883 and 1884, respectively, Dingyuan and Zhenyuan {{were to be}} sailed to China by a German crew, but delays—primarily from France {{following}} {{the outbreak of the}} Sino-French War in 1884—kept the ships in Germany. A German crew took Dingyuan out for a firing test at sea, causing glass to shatter around the ship, along with damage to a funnel. After the war ended in April 1885, the two ironclads were permitted to depart <b>for</b> <b>China,</b> along with Jiyuan. The three ships arrived in China in October and they were formally commissioned into the Beiyang Fleet. Dingyuan was the flagship of the new formation, and {{by the time of the}} First Sino-Japanese War, she was under the command of Commodore Liu Pu-chan, while Admiral Ding Ruchang was also stationed on board. Zhenyuan was under the command of Captain Lin T'ai-tseng. With the war breaking out in 1894, both ships of the Dingyuan class first saw combat at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September.|$|E
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined <b>for</b> <b>China.</b> Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{to rebound}} from their disappointing 2010 result, the Opals {{qualified}} for the 2012 Olympic Games in London by beating New Zealand three games to nil in the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship. They finished the Olympic preliminary series with a 4 – 1 record, losing to France in game 2, but after Belinda Snell sank a well beyond the half-court line 3 point shot with less than 1 second on the clock to send the game into overtime. Against Russia, Liz Cambage {{became the first woman}} in Olympic history to successfully slam dunk a basketball. In the quarterfinal against China, Lauren Jackson became the Olympic Games record holder for points scored, overtaking Brazilian legend Janeth Arcain's tally of 535 points. The Opals accounted <b>for</b> <b>China</b> 75–60 to set up a semifinal game with their long-time s USA. Despite holding a half-time lead, the Opals again fell short losing 86–73. The Opals would however, win their 5th consecutive Olympic medal with an 83–74 win over Russia to claim the bronze.|$|E
