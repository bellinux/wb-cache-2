5|$|Alerted by a witness, MalcolmX and a {{small group}} of Muslims went to the police station and <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> see Johnson. Police {{initially}} denied that any Muslims were being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred, they allowed MalcolmX to speak with Johnson. Afterward, MalcolmX insisted on arranging for an ambulance to take Johnson to Harlem Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE Flight 139 {{occurred}} on 21 June 1985, when a Boeing 737-200 from Braathens SAFE {{en route from}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Fornebu was hijacked by a drunk student who <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> talk {{to the prime minister}} and minister of justice. The plane landed at Fornebu, and the hijacker eventually surrendered his gun in exchange for more beer. No-one was injured in the incident.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the referendum, aboriginal peoples in Quebec strongly affirmed their own right to self-determination. First Nations chiefs said that forcing their peoples to join an independent Quebec without their consent would violate international law, violating their rights to self-determination. Aboriginal groups also <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> be full participants in any new constitutional negotiations resulting from the referendum.|$|E
2500|$|Demand {{and supply}} {{have also been}} {{generalized}} to explain macroeconomic variables in a market economy, including the quantity of total output and the general price level. [...] The aggregate demand-aggregate supply model {{may be the most}} direct application of supply and <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and <b>demand.</b> Compared <b>to</b> microeconomic uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such macroeconomic counterparts as aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate money supply and money <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> interest rates, and to relate labor supply and labor <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> wage rates.|$|R

5|$|In the {{following}} season, the Lakers won 26 {{of their first}} 39 games, but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40. They were eliminated {{in the first round}} by Phoenix again. Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> be traded in the offseason. Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG Harald Gille, with 121 {{passengers}} {{en route}} from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and {{a press conference to}} make a political statement. His demands were not met, and he surrendered while the plane was parked in Oslo. This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{official}} record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.|$|E
5|$|Bryan urged {{a system}} of bank guarantees, so that depositors could be repaid if banks failed, but Taft opposed this, {{offering}} a postal savings system instead. The issue of prohibition of alcohol entered the campaign when in mid-September, Carrie Nation called on Taft and <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> know his views. Taft and Roosevelt had agreed the party platform would take no position on the matter, and Nation left indignant, to allege that Taft was irreligious and against temperance. Taft, at Roosevelt's advice, ignored the issue.|$|E
5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E

5|$|In all, 15 hijackings {{similar to}} Cooper's—all unsuccessful—were {{attempted}} in 1972. With {{the advent of}} universal luggage searches in 1973 (see Airport security), the general incidence of hijackings dropped precipitously. There were no further notable Cooper imitators until July 11, 1980, when Glenn K. Tripp seized Northwest flight 608 at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, demanding $600,000 ($100,000 by an independent account), two parachutes, and the assassination of his boss. After a 10-hour standoff, he was apprehended, but on January 21, 1983—while still on probation—he hijacked the same Northwest flight, this time en route, and <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> be flown to Afghanistan. When the plane landed in Portland, he {{was shot and killed}} by FBI agents.|$|E
5|$|Mina fell in {{love with}} actor Corrado Pani in 1962. Their {{relationship}} shocked Italian audiences as he was already married although separated from his wife. Their son, , was born on 18 April 1963. Due to Mina's refusal to hide the relationship, the singer was banned from performing on public Italian television or radio channels. As her record sales were unaffected and audiences <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> see Mina on the air, RAI was forced to end the ban and let Mina return to television on 10 January 1964. Within a year, her affair with Corrado ended.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones {{came down from the}} spar deck only to find the gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{results were}} favorable, and a {{full-scale}} mockup was formally reviewed in March 1949. The prototype {{was completed by}} August 1949, but an incident involving the rival swept-wing Tupolev Tu-82 that broke an engine mount during a low-altitude flight led to delays as additional tests were <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> determine {{the strength of the}} wings before the first flight was made. By the following year, the Il-30 program had lost momentum as the Ilyushin OKB was ordered to concentrate its resources on facilitating the service introduction of the Il-28. It was formally terminated by government order on 20 August 1950, and the prototype was eventually scrapped {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s. Aviation historian Bill Gunston quotes a maiden flight date of 9 September 1949, but Vaclav Nemecek says 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, {{even though he had}} not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.|$|E
5|$|The team {{started the}} 1977–78 {{season with a}} 50–10 mark, and some {{predicted}} a dynasty in Portland. However, Bill Walton suffered a foot injury that ended his season and would plague him over {{the remainder of his}} career, and the team struggled to an 8–14 finish, going 58–24 overall. In the playoffs, Portland lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1978 conference semifinals. That summer, Walton <b>demanded</b> <b>to</b> be traded to a team of his choice (Clippers, Knicks, Warriors, or 76ers) because he was unhappy with his medical treatment in Portland. Walton was never traded, and he held out the entire 1978–79 season and left the team as a free agent thereafter. The team was further dismantled as Lucas left in 1980.|$|E
