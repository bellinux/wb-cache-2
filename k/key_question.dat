5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>question</b> {{surrounding}} the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a <b>key</b> <b>question</b> is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the <b>key</b> <b>question</b> of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E

5|$|Wallace, {{following}} {{on earlier}} work by de Candolle, Humboldt and Darwin, made major contributions to zoogeography. Because of {{his interest in}} the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in South America and then in the Malay archipelago. While in the archipelago he identified the Wallace line, which runs through the Spice Islands dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a New Guinea/Australian zone. His <b>key</b> <b>question,</b> as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote The Geographical Distribution of Animals, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, Island Life, in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by Philip Sclater for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of municipal autonomy is a <b>key</b> <b>question</b> of public administration and governance.

25|$|Human {{missions}} to Mars will include several transitions between different gravitational environments. These changes will eventually affect the reflex eye movements.

Determination of the dual-adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is vitally important {{so that it can}} be determined to what extent the Sensory-motor coupling skills acquired in one-g environment will transfer to others.|$|E

25|$|In 1903, the 25-year pontificate of {{the liberal}} diplomat Leo XIII came to an end. For 57 years. the papacy had been held by just two men, Leo and his predecessor, Pius IX. While Pius had been a {{conservative}} reactionary, Leo had {{been seen as a}} liberal, certainly by the standards of his predecessor. As cardinals gathered, the <b>key</b> <b>question</b> was whether a pope would be chosen who would continue Leo's policies or return to the style of papacy of Pius IX.|$|E
25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The <b>key</b> <b>question</b> in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E
25|$|Ethologists and sociobiologists have {{characteristically}} analysed animal {{communication in}} terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising {{the question of whether}} the animals concerned understand the meaning of the signals they emit and receive. That is a <b>key</b> <b>question</b> in animal cognition. There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by vervet monkeys. Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators (leopards, eagles, and snakes), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately—but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call. Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.|$|E

500|$|Since then a <b>key</b> <b>question</b> {{has been}} whether Linnaeus's {{original}} type was a South African plant (now Amaryllis) or a South American plant (now Hippeastrum). If the latter, the correct {{name for the}} genus Hippeastrum would then be Amaryllis and a new name {{would need to be}} found for the South African genus. In 1938 JCT Uphof claimed, with some evidence, that the plant was in fact the South American Hippeastrum equestre (Linn. fil.) Herb. (syn. Amaryllis equestris (Linn. fil.) ex Aiton, accepted name H. puniceum) a plant which Carl Linnaeus' son, Linnaeus the Younger (Linn. fil.) had described c. 1781-3 (unpublished) but soon after appearing in the Hortus Kewensis of 1789. [...] This paper sparked a debate over the next half century, that delayed the official transfer of species from Amaryllis to Hippeastrum. This debate involved botanists {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic and the final outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that Amaryllis L. should be a nomen conservandum (conserved name, i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African Amaryllis belladonna from the Clifford Herbarium. Thus Amaryllis L. is the correct name for the South African genus, not the South American genus (Hippeastrum).|$|E
