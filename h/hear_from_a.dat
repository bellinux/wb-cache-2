500|$|Chris Carter {{wrote the}} teleplay for the episode, which he {{described}} as [...] "the result of an year-long learning experience". Carter tried to firmly establish the mythology of the series, [...] "where we explored the different avenues of government conspiracy, and turning it into more than just flying saucers", and having what the writer called a [...] "defining moment" [...] for Scully, where the agent would <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> fellow scientist that she was dealing with truly extraterrestrial material. The scene where poisonous fumes were emitted by Dr. Secare {{was inspired by the}} case of Gloria Ramirez, which occurred in California in February 1994; Carter remembered this when writing the script, and it became an established aspect of the mythology in subsequent seasons.|$|E
500|$|When {{the pair}} {{decided to make}} [...] "This Was a Real Nice Clambake" [...] into an {{ensemble}} number, Hammerstein realized {{he had no idea}} what a clambake was like, and researched the matter. [...] Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, [...] "First came codfish chowder". [...] However, further research convinced him the proper term was [...] "codhead chowder", a term unfamiliar to many playgoers. [...] He decided to keep it as [...] "codfish". [...] When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line [...] "We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good". [...] He was grieved to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> friend that lobsters are always slit down the front. [...] The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back. [...] Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back. [...] One error not caught involved the song [...] "June Is Bustin' Out All Over", in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring—they actually do so in the winter. [...] Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
