40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the geometric structural parameters of a glass textile reinforcement, which is embedded into an epoxy polymer matrix, by micro-computed tomography (CT). Therefore, four different glass fabrics were investigated. The CT images of the composites feature a good contrast between glass reinforcement and polymer matrix. The resolution is high enough for the determination of the geometric structural parameters: wavelength of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> amplitude of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> width of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn,</b> height of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> and the gap between two adjacent warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> The micro-computed tomography shows a high potential for an efficient measurement of the three dimensional geometric structural properties of laminated woven textile fabrics...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} prevent fiber {{distortion}} in textile materials employed in a modified weaving process. In a first embodiment, a tacifier {{in powder form}} {{is applied to the}} yarn and melted while on the fabric. Cool air is then supplied after the tacifier has melted to expedite the solidification of the tacifier. In a second embodiment, a solution form of a tacifier is used by dissolving the tacifier into a solvent that has a high evaporation rate. The solution is then sprayed onto the fabric or <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> as each <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted into a shed of the fabric. A third embodiment applies the tacifier in a liquid form that has not been dissolved in a solvent. That is, the tacifier is melted and is sprayed as a liquid onto the fabric or <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> as it is being extracted from a <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> spool prior to the <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> being inserted into the shed of the fabric. A fourth embodiment employs adhesive yarns contained {{as an integral part of}} the warp or <b>fill</b> <b>yarn.</b> Additional tacifier material is not required because a matrix is used as the tacifier. The matrix is then locally melted using heating elements on clamping bars or take-up rollers, is cooled, if necessary, and solidified...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for integral <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> insertion and beatup are disclosed. A modified rapier contains a channel for holding <b>fill</b> <b>yarn.</b> The channel {{is covered with}} a flexible and inflatable boot, and an inflating apparatus for this boot is also attached. <b>Fill</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted into the channel, and the rapier is extended into a shed formed by warp yarn. Next, the rapier is pushed into the fell of the fabric, and the flexible and inflatable cover inflated, which both pushes the yarn into the fell of the fabric and performs beatup. The rapier is withdrawn and the shed closed to complete one step of the weaving process...|$|R
50|$|Picking. As the {{harnesses}} {{raise the}} heddles or healds, which raise the warp yarns, the shed is created. The <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted through the shed {{by a small}} carrier device called a shuttle. The shuttle is normally pointed at each end to allow passage through the shed. In a traditional shuttle loom, the <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> is wound onto a quill, {{which in turn is}} mounted in the shuttle. The <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> emerges {{through a hole in the}} shuttle as it moves across the loom. A single crossing of the shuttle from one side of the loom to the other is known as a pick. As the shuttle moves back and forth across the shed, it weaves an edge, or selvage, on each side of the fabric to prevent the fabric from raveling.|$|E
50|$|A {{rapier loom}} is a {{shuttleless}} weaving loom {{in which the}} <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> is carried through the shed of warp yarns {{to the other side}} of the loom by finger-like carriers called rapiers.|$|E
50|$|In a twill weave, each weft or <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> floats {{across the}} warp yarns in a {{progression}} of interlacings {{to the right}} or left, forming a pattern of distinct diagonal lines. This diagonal pattern {{is also known as}} a wale. A float is the portion of a yarn that crosses over two or more perpendicular yarns.|$|E
40|$|Fabrics used in curved composite-material {{structures}} {{prevented from}} skewing during composite layup by weaving them in modified {{process in which}} warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns</b> bonded together at their points of contact. (Bonding concept may prove similarly beneficial for braided and knitted fabrics.) In modified weaving process, adhesives prevent excessive shifting of warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns</b> with respect to each other...|$|R

5000|$|Battening. As {{the shuttle}} {{moves across the}} loom laying down the fill yarn, it also passes through {{openings}} in another frame called a reed (which resembles a comb). With each picking operation, the reed presses or battens each <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> against {{the portion of the}} fabric that has already been formed. The point where the fabric is formed is called the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.|$|E
50|$|Battening. Between the heddles and the takeup roll, {{the warp}} threads pass through another frame called the reed (which resembles a comb). The {{portion of the}} fabric {{that has already been}} formed but not yet rolled up on the takeup roll is called the fell. After the shuttle moves across the loom laying down the fill yarn, the weaver uses the reed to press (or batten) each <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> against the fell. Conventional shuttle looms can operate at speeds of about 150 to 160 picks per minute.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1920s, the American market {{has used the}} term {{broadcloth}} to describe a plain-woven, usually mercerised fabric woven with a rib and a slightly heavier <b>filling</b> <b>yarn,</b> used for shirt-making, made from cotton or a polyester-and-cotton blend [...] This fabric {{was introduced in the}} early 1920s as an import from the United Kingdom, where it was called poplin, but it was arbitrarily renamed broadcloth as it was thought that the British name had connotations of heaviness. Another version of this fabric, woven in rayon or polyester-and-rayon, is called fuji.|$|E
5000|$|Poplins {{are used}} for dress purposes, and for rich {{upholstery}} work which are formed by using coarse <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> in a plain weave.|$|R
5000|$|... 4-harness {{satin weave}} (4HS), also called {{crowfoot}} satin, {{in which the}} <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> passes over three warp yarns and under one warp yarn. It is more pliable than a plain weave.|$|R
5000|$|... 8-harness {{satin weave}} (8HS), {{in which the}} <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> passes over seven warp yarns and then under one warp yarn, is the most pliable satin weave and forms most easily around {{compound}} curves.|$|R
50|$|In weaving, the weft (sometimes woof) is {{the thread}} or yarn which is drawn through, {{inserted}} over-and-under, the lengthwise warp yarns that {{are held in}} tension on a frame or loom to create cloth. Warp is the lengthwise or longitudinal thread in a roll, while weft is the transverse thread. A single thread of the weft, crossing the warp, is called a pick. Terms do vary (for instance, in North America, the weft is {{sometimes referred to as}} the fill or the <b>filling</b> <b>yarn).</b> Each individual warp thread in a fabric is called a warp end or end.|$|E
5000|$|Twill weave {{is often}} {{designated}} as a fraction, such as , in which the numerator indicates the number of harnesses that are raised (and thus threads crossed: in this example, two), and the denominator indicates the number of harnesses that are lowered when a <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> is inserted (in this example, one). The fraction [...] is read as [...] "two up, one down" [...] (the fraction for plain weave is [...]). The minimum number of harnesses needed to produce a twill can be determined by totaling the numbers in the fraction; for the example described, the number of harnesses is three. Twill weave can be identified by its diagonal lines.|$|E
50|$|Shedding. Shedding is {{the raising}} of part of the warp yarn to form a shed (the {{vertical}} space between the raised and unraised warp yarns), through which the <b>filling</b> <b>yarn,</b> carried by the shuttle, can be inserted. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or heald frame, {{also known as a}} harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are dobbies and a Jacquard Head.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method for forming woven fabrics {{through the use}} of an adjustable reed. The adjustable reed has multiple groups of reed wires that guide the warp yarns. The groups of reed wires move on reed rails parallel to the warp direction. In addition, rail expanders permit the space between the reed wires to be modified and telescoping rods attached to the rail sliders can be turned to permit the reed wires to be skewed to alter the <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> angle. These adjustments to the reed permit simultaneous variation of <b>fill</b> <b>yarn</b> angles and fabric widths and allow these variations to be made during fabrication, without the need to halt production...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for fabricating straight or curved planar or three-dimensional (C channel, for example) fabric for fabrication into composite structures is presented. In the first embodiment, the <b>fill</b> <b>yarns</b> are inserted between layers of warp yarns, and a canted or curved reed, {{depending on the}} desired orientation of the <b>fill</b> <b>yarns,</b> is used to compact or 'beat-up' the <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> In the second embodiment, the warp yarns of the fabric are curved using a conical {{or a combination of}} conical and cylindrical rollers to effect differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining a constant radius of curvature of the warp yarns. In a third embodiment, a clamping bar fabric take-up device is used to effect the differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining straight warp yarns, curved warp yarns with a constant radius of curvature, curved warp yarns with a non-contant radius of curvature, or some combinations of straight and curved warp yarns. In a fourth embodiment, for forming the flanges of the curved C channel, the warp yarns are alternately inserted through adjacent dent wires of the reed to permit vertical weaving of the flanges...|$|R
40|$|Fibre {{reorientation}} {{occurs when}} forming a reinforced structure {{such as a}} fabric onto a doubly curved surface. This leads {{to a change in}} the angle between warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> The composite properties change inhomogeneously, corresponding to the varying angle between warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns.</b> Many composite properties are determined by the angle between the warp and <b>fill</b> <b>yarns,</b> such as the mechanical properties, the coefficients of thermal expansion, the local fibre volume fractions, the local thickness and the permeability. The extent of the fibre reorientation is affected by the product shape and the forming process. The forming process may cause tensile stresses in the fabric yarns, causing subsequent product distortions. Also, wrinkling risks are present due to the incapability of the fabric to deform beyond a maximum shear deformation. The local change in composite properties {{must be taken into account}} to predict the properties of a product. Drape modelling can predict the process induced fibre orientations and stresses, which can speed up the product development process compared with trial-and-error development. The constitutive model for these bi-axially reinforced composite materials is the primary element of these process simulations...|$|R
40|$|A tapered tubular {{polyester}} sleeve as set forth. It {{has a large}} end 12 and a {{small end}} 14 with a length to be determined. The ratio of taper is also determined by scale factors. All the warp yarns extend to the large end 12. A requisite number of warp yarns 16 extend {{the full length of}} the sleeve. Other warp yarns exemplified at 18, 22, 26, 28, 30 and 32 extend from the large end but are terminated {{along the length of the}} sleeve. It is then woven with a <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> 40 which extends in a full circle along the full length of the sleeve to thereby define the tapered sleeve. The sleeve after fabrication is then placed on a mandrel 42, heated in an oven 44 and is thereafter placed on the arm or other limb of a space suit exemplified at 50...|$|E
40|$|Comfort {{performance}} of woven structures made {{of various types}} of ring spun yarns like carded, combed, and compact spun yarns {{has been reported in}} the present study. Carded, combed, and compact spun yarns are entirely different in structure in terms of fibre migration inside the yarn body, level of free space inside the yarn, number of hairs, and length of hairs on yarn surfaces. In this study, 197 [*]dtex and 144 [*]dtex (30 s[*]Ne and 40 s[*]Ne) ring spun combed yarns are used as a warp. The same cotton mixing was used to manufacture 30 s[*]Ne and 40 s[*]Ne carded, combed, and compact yarns. Both 30 s and 40 s[*]Ne linear density yarns were prepared by all three carded, combed, and compact yarn manufacturing routes. The structure of fibre strand in <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> has a great impact on comfort related properties, that is, thermal conductivity,, air permeability, wicking, and moisture vapour permeability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an investigation on the design options available for positioning the inlaid yarn in fillet warp knit structures. The geometry and structural parameters using our previously published methodology are also presented. It is shown, for example, that if inlaying guide bar does the shifting behind the needles at two needle pitch (variants 1. 11 - 1. 13, Table. 1) the <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> wraps the junctures from G 1 ground yarns according to repeat. This position of in-laying yarn provides good stability in the fabric structure, which improves {{with the amount of}} wrapping. Thus, the different positions of the inlaid yarn within the structures offer other possibilities that could be explored when designing fillet warp knit auxetic structures. The array of data for the various design options provide analytical tool for making comparisons about the physical, structural and mechanical properties of the warp knit fillet structures. It is observed that the position of in-laying yarn has some effect on stretch characteristics of warp knit structure...|$|E

40|$|Pilling {{has been}} one of the major {{consumer}} problems of man-made staple yarn products. This study evaluated the pilling performance of 65 / 35 % Dacron/cotton fabrics woven from open-end (OE) yarns by the Random Tumble Pilling Tester Method (ASTM Test Method D 3512 - 82) and the Elastomeric Pad Method (ASTM Test Method D 3514 - 81) at five specified test intervals. The effect of twist level of warp and <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> on pilling propensity, flex abrasion, tensile strength, and breaking elongation was also investigated. Pilling produced by the Random Tumble Pilling (RTP) procedure was mainly fiber fuzz and loosely anchored pills; that produced by the Elastomeric Pad Method (EPM) was large scale pills and fiber entanglement which did not wear off readily. ANOVA test revealed that the twist level of warp yarns had a significant influence on thepilling characteristics as evidenced in both pilling tests. Twist level of <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> influenced EPMpilling ratings only intermittently. The effect of twist level of warp yarns was highly significant for the warp direction on flex abrasion, tensile strength, and breaking elongation. On the other hand the twist level of <b>filling</b> <b>yarns</b> influencedfilling tensile and breaking elongation. The major findings of the study indicate that pilling performance was significantly influenced by pilling tes...|$|R
40|$|Tearing {{resistance}} {{is an important}} parameter for evalu-ating the reliability of textile structures, {{especially in the case}} of protective materials. In order to better under-stand the individual contribution of the different mecha-nisms involved in the tearing process, a study of the relation between the fabric and yarn properties charac-terizing these mechanisms and the tearing energy has been carried out. For that purpose, polyester fabrics with two types of weave patterns and various values of <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> density and linear density were character-ized in terms of tongue tear energy, yarn and fabric modulus, breaking force and elongation at break, yarn slippage, and yarn jamming. Data for all tested fabrics relied on a unique master curve when the tearing energy was expressed as a function of the transverse yarn slippage force. This demonstrates the strong con-tribution of transverse yarn slippage to the tearing pro-cess, a mechanism which has generally been over-looked in previous works on tearing. Relationships between the tearing energy and the other properties characteristics of the mechanisms involved in tearing of woven textiles were also observed. These results build the path toward the development of models for the tearing energy of textile structures. POLYM. COMPOS. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} enhance the {{capability}} of multiple weave color reproduction for Jacquard textiles. Today, the subtractive color mixing of CMYK color system is being widely used for rendering weave patterns and assorting <b>filling</b> <b>yarn</b> colors. However, as Jacquard color creation involves optical color mixing, the direct application of pigment mixing is limited to corresponding to an artwork that involves red, green, blue and saturated solid black. Since Jacquard colors are realized by opaque and non-blended material of yarns, it requires a different approach of light and pigment mixing to simulate colors of an original image in woven forms. Therefore, in this study, the optimization of weave color reproduction was approached to properly embrace the proposed color gamut of the CMYK model in digital Jacquard textiles. Based on the ink densities of the CMYK color scope, segmentation was applied in reflection of optical thread color mixing to attain optimal weave patterns. A pair of primary color layers was merged by defining {{a set of rules}} to classify individual primary and secondary color patterns to designate colored threads in associated regions, and weave structures were designed and aligned to generate varied levels of color shades in weaving form.
