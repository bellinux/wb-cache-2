40|$|Background: Insulin assays are {{affected}} by varying degrees of interference from anti-insulin antibodies (IAs) and by cross-reactivity with recombinant insulin analogues. We evaluated {{the usefulness of the}} <b>E</b> <b>170</b> insulin assay by assessing IA effects and cross-reactivity with 2 analogues. Methods: Sera were obtained from 59 type 2 diabetes patients receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and 18 healthy controls. Insulin levels were determined using an <b>E</b> <b>170</b> analyzer. To investigate the effects of IAs, we performed IA radioimmunoassays, and analyzed the differences between directly measured insulin (direct insulin) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) -treated insulins (free, IA-unbound; total, IA-bound and unbound insulin). We performed in-vitro cross-reactivity tests with insulin aspart and insulin glulisine. Results: In IA-positive patients, <b>E</b> <b>170</b> free insulin levels measured using the <b>E</b> <b>170</b> analyzer were significantly lower than the direct insulin levels. The mean value of the direct/free insulin ratio and IA-bound insulin, which were calculated as the difference between total and free insulin, increased significantly as endogenous IA levels increased. The <b>E</b> <b>170</b> insulin assay showed low cross-reactivities with both analogues (< 0. 7 %). Conclusions: IAs interfered with <b>E</b> <b>170</b> insulin assay, and the extent of interference correlated with the IA levels, which may be attributable to the increase in IA-bound insulin, and not to an error in the assay. The <b>E</b> <b>170</b> insulin assay may measure only endogenous insulin since cross-reactivity is low.

40|$|Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase is a {{flavoprotein}} {{containing a}} covalent flavin that catalyzes the oxidation of 4 -(methoxymethyl) phenol to 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde. The reaction proceeds through {{the formation of}} a p-quinone methide intermediate, after which, water addition takes place. Asp- 170, located near the N 5 -atom of the flavin, has been proposed to act as an active site base. To test this hypothesis, we have addressed the properties of D <b>170</b> <b>E,</b> D <b>170</b> S, D 170 A, and D 170 N variants. Spectral and fluorescence analysis, together with the crystal structure of D 170 S, suggests that the Asp- 170 replacements do not induce major structural changes. However, in D 170 A and D 170 N, 50 and 100 %, respectively, of the flavin is non-covalently bound. Kinetic characterization of the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase variants revealed that Asp- 170 is required for catalysis. D <b>170</b> <b>E</b> is 50 -fold less active, and the other Asp- 170 variants are about 10 ^ 3 -fold less active than wild type enzyme. Impaired catalysis of the Asp- 170 variants is caused by slow flavin reduction. Furthermore, the mutant proteins have lost the capability of forming a stable complex between reduced enzyme and the p-quinone methide intermediate. The redox midpoint potentials in D <b>170</b> <b>E</b> (16 mV) and D 170 S (– 91 mV) are considerably decreased compared with wild type vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (155 mV). This supports the idea that Asp- 170 interacts with the protonated N 5 -atom of the reduced cofactor, thus increasing the FAD redox potential. Taken together, we conclude that Asp- 170 is involved in the process of autocatalytic flavinylation and is crucial for efficient redox catalysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Keratin {{intermediate}} filaments {{are important}} cytoskeletal structural proteins involved in maintaining cell shape and function. Mutations in the epidermal keratin genes, keratin 5 or keratin 14 {{lead to the}} disruption of keratin filament assembly, resulting in an autosomal dominant inherited blistering skin disease, epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). We investigated a large EBS kindred who exhibited a markedly heterogeneous clinical presentation and detected two distinct keratin 5 mutations in the proband, the most severely affected. One missense mutation (<b>E</b> <b>170</b> K) in the highly conserved helix initiation peptide sequence of the 1 A rod domain was found in all the affected family members. In contrast, the other missense mutation (E 418 K) was found only in the proband. The E 418 K mutation was located in the stutter region, an interruption in the heptad repeat regularity, whose function as yet remains unclear. We hypothesized that this mutated stutter allele was clinically silent when combined with the wild type allele but aggravates the clinical severity of EBS caused by the <b>E</b> <b>170</b> K mutation on the other allele. To confirm this in vitro, we transfected mutant keratin 5 cDNA into cultured cells. Although only 12. 7 % of the cells transfected with the <b>E</b> <b>170</b> K mutation alone showed disrupted keratin filament aggregations, significantly more cells (30. 0 %) cotransfected with both <b>E</b> <b>170</b> K and E 418 K mutations demonstrated keratin aggregation (p < 0. 05).

A number of serum samples (264, 263, 224, and 202 for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe, respectively) were studied. For samples giving discrepant results for HBeAg between methods, real-time PCR assays were performed. The concordance rates among the three methods were high for HBsAg (100 %) and HBeAg (94. 6), but low for anti-HBs (91. 6 %) and anti-HBe (82. 2 %).

40|$|IntroductionThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{analytical}} performances of the newly developed Access 2 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) total immunoassay on two analysers, DxI 800 and Access 2 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), and compare these two and a recalibrated Modular <b>E</b> <b>170</b> 25 (OH) D assay (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) with reference liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with special emphasis on clinical diagnosis. Materials and methodsBeckman immunoassays were assessed for imprecision, accuracy, limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantitation (LoQ), linearity, interference, and carryover. One hundred and nineteen samples were run on DxI 800, Access 2, and <b>E</b> <b>170,</b> and agreement with the LC-MS/MS method was evaluated. ResultsDxI 800 and Access 2 assays showed good performances in terms of LoB, LoD, LoQ, linearity, and interference. All immunoassays showed negative biases ranging from - 8. 6 % (DxI 800) to - 19. 2 % (Access 2). DxI 800 and Access 2 systems had proportional biases, and the <b>E</b> <b>170</b> system had a constant bias with the largest random error. Concordance correlation coefficient values ranged from 0. 941 (CI: 0. 917 – 0. 958) for DxI 800 to 0. 854 (CI: 0. 811 – 0. 889) for Access 2.

40|$|Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) is the {{prototype}} of a newly recognized family of structurally related oxidoreductases sharing a conserved FAD-binding domain. The active site of VAO is formed by a cavity where the enzyme is able to catalyze many reactions with phenolic substrates. Among these reactions is the stereospecific hydroxylation of 4 -ethylphenol-forming (R) - 1 -(4 ′-hydroxyphenyl) ethanol. During this conversion, Asp- 170 is probably critical for the hydration of the initially formed p-quinone methide intermediate. By site-directed mutagenesis, the putative active site base has been relocated to the opposite face of the active site cavity. In this way, a change in stereospecificity has been achieved. Like native VAO, the single mutants T 457 <b>E,</b> D <b>170</b> A, and D 170 S preferentially converted 4 -ethylphenol to the (R) -enantiomer of 1 -(4 ′-hydroxyphenyl) ethanol.

40|$|PublishedBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Autochthonous {{hepatitis}} E virus (HEV) {{infection is}} a porcine zoonosis and increasingly recognized in developed countries. In {{most cases the}} route of infection is uncertain. A previous study showed that HEV was associated geographically with pig farms and coastal areas. AIM: The aim of the present research was to study the geographical, environmental and social factors in autochthonous HEV infection. METHODS: Cases of HEV genotype 3 infection and controls were identified from 2047 consecutive patients attending a rapid-access hepatology clinic. For each case/control the following were recorded: distance from home to nearest pig farm, distance from home to coast, rainfall levels during the 8 weeks before presentation, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: A total of 36 acute hepatitis <b>E</b> cases, <b>170</b> age/sex-matched controls and 53 hepatitis controls were identified. The geographical spread of hepatitis E cases was not even when compared with both control groups. Cases {{were more likely to}} live within 2000 [*]m of the coast (odds ratio= 2. 32, 95...|$|R
40|$|The e†ect of nib {{roasting}} {{time and}} temperature on volatile component proÐles was studied using response surface methodology (RSM) which consisted two independent variables : time (5 È 65 min) and temperature (110 <b>È</b> <b>170</b> ¡C). A steam distillation extraction (SDE) method was used to extract and gas chromatographÈmass spectrometry equipped with an ICIS data system was used to identify the volatile compounds. Tetramethylpyrazine, trimethylpyrazine, phenethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 3 -methylbutyl acetate, phenylacetaldehyde, benzaldehyde and 2 -phenylethanol were present in all treatments. Pyrazine formation increased as roasting {{time and temperature}} were increased. The number of pyrazines increased from 4 to 11 and 25, respectively, when roasting, time was increased from 5 to 35 and 65 min at 140 ¡C. The unit area of esters increased (up to 1700 È 1800) when the roasting time was increased from 15 to 65 min (at 110 È 120 ¡C). However, the unit area of carbonyls linearly decreased with an increasing roasting temperature at shorter time (5 È 25 min). The unit area of phenols was enormously reduced at the highest roasting temperature (160 <b>È</b> <b>170</b> ¡C) with longest roasting time (45 È 65 min) while that of alcohol slightly decreased as roasting time and temperature were increase...|$|E

40|$|Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) {{have spread}} worldwide, leaving very few {{treatment}} options available. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) {{is the main}} carbapenemase mediating CRE resistance and is of increasing concern. NDM-positive Enterobacteriaceae of human origin are frequently identified; however, the emergence of NDM, and particularly novel variants, in bacteria of food animal origin has never been reported. Here, we characterize a novel NDM variant (assigned NDM- 17) identified in a β-lactam-resistant sequence type 48 (ST 48) Escherichia coli strain that was isolated from a chicken in China. Compared to NDM- 1, NDM- 17 had three amino acid substitutions (V 88 L, M 154 L, and <b>E</b> <b>170</b> K) that confer significantly enhanced carbapenemase activity. Compared to NDM- 5, NDM- 17 had only one amino acid substitution (<b>E</b> <b>170</b> K) and slightly increased isolate resistance to carbapenem, as indicated by increased MIC values. The gene encoding NDM- 17 (blaNDM- 17) was located on an IncX 3 plasmid, which was readily transferrable to recipient E. coli strain J 53 by conjugation, suggesting {{the possibility of the}} rapid dissemination of blaNDM- 17. Enzyme kinetics showed that NDM- 17 could hydrolyze all β-lactams tested, except for aztreonam, and had a significantly higher affinity for all β-lactams tested than did NDM- 5. The emergence of this novel NDM variant could pose a threat to public health because of its transferability and enhanced carbapenemase activity...|$|E

However, no gaseous sulfur-bearing species have ever been detected in the Martian atmosphere. We search for SO 2 signatures in the thermal spectrum of Mars at 7. 4 μm using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Data were obtained on Oct. 12, 2009 (Ls = 353 °), in the 1350 - 1360 cm- 1 range, with a spatial resolution of 1 arcsec (after convolution over three pixels along the N-S axis and two steps along the E-W axis) and a resolving power of 80 [*] 000. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we co-added the Martian spectrum around the positions of nine selected SO 2 transitions with a high S/N and no telluric contamination. From a mean spectrum, averaged over 35 pixels {{in the region of}} maximum continuum, we infer a 2 σ upper limit of 0. 3 ppb to the SO 2 mixing ratio, assuming that our instrumental errors are combined according to Gaussian statistics. Our upper limit is three times lower than the upper limit derived by Krasnopolsky (2005, Icarus, 178, 487), who used the same technique on previous TEXES data. In addition, we derive an upper limit of 2 ppb at each spatial pixel of the region observed by TEXES, which covers the longitude ranges 50 E- <b>170</b> <b>E</b> for latitudes above 30 N, 100 E- <b>170</b> <b>E</b> for latitudes between 0 and 30 N, and 110 E- <b>170</b> <b>E</b> for latitudes between 15 S and 0. The non-detection of localized SO 2 sources in the observed area is consistent with a homogeneous distribution being expected around equinox for non-condensible species with a lifetime longer than the global mixing time. In view of the typically large SO 2 /CH 4 ratio observed in terrestrial volcanoes, and assuming a comparable volcanic composition for Mars and the Earth, our result reaffirms that a volcanic origin is unlikely for any methane in the Martian atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|Neonatal {{administration}} of estradiol- 1 7,B (E 2 - 1 7 f) increases the nuclear DNA {{content in the}} mouse reproductive tract. Similar responses have been demonstrated for synthetic estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol. One of the questions raised regarding environmental estrogens such as organochlorines is whether they are potent enough to result in abnormal changes such as those demonstrated by both natural and synthetic estrogens. To test this hypothesis, female BALB/c mice were treated neonatally (days 1 - 5) with either E 2 - 1 7 p or estradiol- 1 7 a (E 2 - 1 7 a), an inactive stereoisomer in adult reproductive tissues. We also proposed whether neonatal {{administration of}} (E 2 - 17 a) was tumorigenic and whether the effects were age dependent. To answer these questions, one set each of 10 -day-old treated and control mice received short-term secondary administration of <b>E</b> 2 - <b>170,</b> <b>E</b> 2 - 17 a, or cholesterol. Cervicovaginal tracts from intact BALB/c mice were examined histologically and by flow cytometry at 70 days of age and by histology alone at 18 to 22 months of age. The results include several important findings: a) like E 2 - 1 7 p, neonatal E 2 - 1 7 a treatment induced persistent vaginal cornification, hypospadias, vaginal concretions, and hyperproliferation in nearly 100 % of the animals regardless of the secondary treatment for most groups; b) neonatal E 2 - 177 a treatment increased the nuclear DNA content of cervicovagina...|$|R
