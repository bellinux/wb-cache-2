In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight {{on trying to}} {{convey a sense of}} the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E
5|$|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. In this work <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's next {{published}} work was the 1967 novel, The Vendor of Sweets. It was inspired {{in part by}} his American visits and consists of extreme characterizations of both the Indian and American stereotypes, drawing on the many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received {{the first of his}} honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, A Horse and Two Goats, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan remembered a promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. The Ramayana was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing The Ramayana, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was researching and writing the epic, he also published another book, The Painter of Signs (1977). The Painter of Signs is a bit longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan's other works, as <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist's character is very similar to his earlier creations. The Mahabharata was published in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The investigation, Außenseiter, which {{appeared}} in 1975, was {{considered by many to}} be his main work.

Darrell starts to believe his own PR and eventually becomes more interested in his music video career than the band. Manipulation by music industry insiders sees both Martin and Carol tempted by solo deals; eventually the group splits.|$|E

25|$|Subaru's {{character}} has received positive critical response by publication from manga and anime {{ever since his}} introduction in Tokyo Babylon.

Mike Dungan from Mania Entertainment noted that Subaru's relationship with Seishiro carried nods to Clamp's doujinshi fan-base. While reviewing the Tokyo Babylon OVAs, Chris Beveridge from the same site found Subaru's portrayal interesting and recommended it to X fans to explore the character more. On the other hand, Stig Hogset from THEM Anime Reviews criticized Subaru for being unfitting for his job due to his quiet personality.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect that}} this concept had on church music was threefold: first, it bred a highly {{conservative}} attitude to musical composition; secondly, it stabilized the melodic tradition of certain hymns; and thirdly, it continued, for a time, {{the anonymity of}} the composer. For if a chant is of heavenly origin, then the acknowledgment received by man in transmitting it to posterity ought to be minimal. This is especially true when <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> with hymns that were {{known to have been}} first sung by angelic choirs—such as the Amen, Alleluia, Trisagion, Sanctus and Doxology. Consequently, until Palaeologan times, it was inconceivable for a composer to place his name beside a notated text in the manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|As a {{supplement}} to this treatise he wrote a second, which he called the Kitab al-Af'al Dhawat al-Mathalain (The Book of Verbs Containing Double Letters), and in which he points out the principles governing the verbs whose second and third radicals are alike. He furnishes a list of these verbs, together with their various forms occurring in the Bible. Besides the two treatises on verbs Hayyuj wrote Kitab al-Tanqit (The Book of Punctuation). This work, probably written before his two chief treatises, {{is an attempt to}} set forth the features underlying the Masoretic use of the vowels and of the word-tone. In this work <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> chiefly with nouns, and its purpose is more of a practical than of a theoretical character.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{scientist}} Theophrastus {{compiled a}} book on weather forecasting, called the Book of Signs. The work of Theophrastus remained a dominant influence {{in the study of}} weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years. In 25 AD, Pomponius Mela, a geographer for the Roman Empire, formalized the climatic zone system. According to Toufic Fahd, around the 9th century, Al-Dinawari wrote the Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants), in which <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the Muslim Agricultural Revolution. He describes the meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the anwa (heavenly bodies of rain), and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of the New 52 Superman, Luthor decides to assume Superman's symbol in a new suit of battle-armour (apparently powered by a Mother Box) to protect Metropolis, but he is confronted by the pre-Flashpoint Superman, who refuses to believe that Luthor's {{intentions}} are as noble as he claims. This results in a brief conflict between the two, Luthor claiming that Superman's 'unprovoked' attack proves that he is an impostor while Superman counters that Luthor's brutal response proves him right, but the fight is cut short when Doomsday apparently emerges. Despite Superman's uncertainty about Luthor and Luthor's own beliefs about Superman, Superman convinces Luthor to help him by focusing on evacuating civilians while <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> with Doomsday due to his greater experience. After the crisis is over, Superman talks with Luthor and agrees to let him continue acting as a hero using his logo when Superman concedes that he has no clear evidence that this Luthor has any criminal activity. Luthor is later attacked by an alien warrior who attacks people who, according to visions of the future he receives, will go on to commit various acts of death and violence, but Superman appeals to them to let Luthor free by arguing that the future is always changing and he will do his best to ensure that the dark future they foresaw for Luthor will never come to pass.|$|E
25|$|Howard Robinson is {{a philosopher}} who has {{concentrated}} his research within {{the philosophy of}} mind. Taking what has been through {{the latter part of}} the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly Matter and Sense and Perception) are characterized by the thoroughness with which <b>he</b> <b>deals</b> with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency to take for granted that the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the physicalist to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.|$|E
25|$|Trouble {{arrives in}} the form of Cluny the Scourge in the Summer of the Lain Rose. Cluny is an evil, infamous rat, owning an extra-long tail with a {{poisoned}} barb on the end, and commander of a horde of vermin. He has only one eye, having lost the other in a battle with a pike, which he killed. The foebeasts arrive {{at the beginning of the}} book and make their headquarters at the Church of St. Ninian, to the south of Redwall, with the intention of taking the Abbey for themselves. Matthias in the meanwhile begins having visions of the Abbey founder Martin the warrior who guides him, The Abbey inhabitants, who refuse to back down, make ready to defend themselves if necessary; most of the inhabitants of the surrounding area are now within Redwall. None of them are particularly martial, but Redwall folk, and indeed much of the Mossflower population, are generally slow to anger but fierce fighters when roused; they are able to make an effective defence. Matthias, fearing that Cluny will still overrun them, begins a quest to find the legendary sword of Martin the Warrior, which is supposedly hidden somewhere within the Abbey. He is helped particularly by Methuselah, an ancient and grizzled mouse, who is the abbey recorder. Matthias is a brave-hearted young mouse, if small in stature, and as the story continues, his natural leadership abilities begin to emerge, Cluny, in the meanwhile, has been attempting to gain entrance to the Abbey. <b>He</b> <b>deals</b> with traitors Sela the vixen and her son Chickenhound, Sela is killed while Chickenhound seeks refuge at Redwall, but he ends up accidentally killing Methuselah after being caught stealing, he is driven out of the abbey but ends up being attacked and maimed by the adder Asmodeus who appears as a local legend and terror throughout the novel and picks off wandering creatures, Chickenhound escapes and heals himself (and would later debut as the main villain of the third book).|$|E
