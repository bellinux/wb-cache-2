5|$|<b>I</b> <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> real companionship, for {{apart from}} that life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|Hańska and Balzac met {{several times}} {{over the next five}} days, and her husband became enchanted with Balzac as well, {{inviting}} him to meals with the family. During a trip to Lake Biel, Hański went to arrange lunch, leaving his wife and Balzac alone. In the shade of a large oak tree, they kissed and exchanged vows of patience and fidelity. She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit {{before the end of the}} year. Before he left Nauchâtel, she sent a passionate letter to his hotel: [...] "Villain! Did you not see in my eyes all that <b>I</b> <b>longed</b> <b>for?</b> But have no fear, I felt all the desire that a woman in love seeks to provoke".|$|E
2500|$|After filming {{ended on}} the series Mercy Peak, Bartolomei {{decided he would}} stay in New Zealand rather than {{returning}} to Australia and was offered {{the role of a}} new character – Craig Valentine on Shortland Street, who was set to undergo a steamy romance with the upcoming character Sarah Potts. Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, [...] "It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often that you have the security that a job like Shortland Street provides. But after {{four and a half years}} <b>I</b> <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> a degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given what I do for a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you." [...] The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be [...] "unforgivable" [...] but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, [...] "It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different," [...] and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, [...] "That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned." ...|$|E

2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution <b>I</b> <b>longed</b> <b>for</b> some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E
