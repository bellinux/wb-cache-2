Today, this ecosystem is facing a new threat from a proliferating native species, the bramble (Rubus ulmifolius Schott), which preferentially colonizes areas that were formerly cultivated and/or exposed to water infiltration. To identify a strategy for effective control of this colonization, in situ experiments testing disturbance regimes (shrub clearing and/or mixed grazing by sheep and goats) combined with the control of access to water resources (with or without <b>drainage</b> <b>trenches)</b> were undertaken between 2010 and 2013. Only clearing and grazing combined over 3 years led to significant changes in vegetation height and bramble cover as well as modifications in the floristic composition, diversity, similarity, and richness of the plant community. Neither a clearing operation carried out in 2010 alone, nor grazing alone, reduced bramble cover, and neither treatment increased the species richness of the plant community. Similarly, digging <b>drainage</b> <b>trenches</b> had no significant impact either on the plant community or on bramble cover. Our study suggests that only annual mechanical clearing coupled with sheep and goats grazing can significantly reduce bramble cover.

40|$|Nonpoint source {{pollution}} (NPS) {{continues to}} be the leading cause of water quality degradation in the United States. On-site wastewater systems (OWS) contribute to NPS; however, due to the range of system designs and complexity of the subsurface, OWS contributions to groundwater pollution are not well understood. As the population of coastal North Carolina continues to increase, better methods to locate and characterize wastewater impacted groundwater are needed. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of non-intrusive geophysical methods to provide high resolution information on various contaminants in different geologic settings. The goals of this study were to evaluate the utility of ground penetrating radar (GPR) and capacitively coupled resistivity (CCR) for detecting OWS components, delineating associated wastewater plumes, and monitoring temporal variations in groundwater quality. Cross-sectional and three dimensional (3 D) geophysical surveys were conducted periodically over a one year period (February 2011 - January 2012) at two schools utilizing OWS in the lower Neuse River Basin (NRB) in the North Carolina Coastal Plain (NCCP). Cores were collected at both study sites; as well as monthly groundwater depth, temperature, and specific conductivity measurements to better constrain the geophysical interpretations. Additionally, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and Cl concentrations were monitored bi-monthly to assess nutrient transport at the sites. The 3 D GPR surveys effectively located the wastewater <b>drainage</b> <b>trenches</b> at both sites, in close agreement with locations described in as-built OWS blueprints. Regression analysis of resistivity versus groundwater specific conductivity revealed an inverse relationship, suggesting resistivity [less than or equal to] 250 ohm. m was indicative of wastewater impacted groundwater at both sites. The 3 D resistivity models identified regions of low resistivity beneath the drainfields relative to background values. Regression analysis of GPR signal absolute peak amplitude (APA) versus groundwater specific conductivity revealed a decrease in APA indicative of radar signal attenuation at locations where groundwater specific conductivity was elevated. The 3 D GPR models identified regions of attenuated radar signal beneath the drainfields relative to background locations. Comparisons of groundwater specific conductivity, GPR, and CCR lateral wastewater plume estimates indicated similar dimensions at both sites. The sensitivity of resistivity measurements tended to decline with increased water-table depth; although, differences in resistivity associated with seasonal water-table depth changes were noticeable. Overall, {{results of this study suggest}} that GPR and CCR surveys combined with sediment, hydrologic, and water quality data may provide reliable information on the location of OWS components and extent of associated wastewater plumes. The GPR surveys successfully located the wastewater <b>drainage</b> <b>trenches</b> and helped image the uppermost surface of the wastewater plumes. The CCR surveys delineated the lateral wastewater plume dimensions and revealed temporal changes in groundwater quality associated with differences in groundwater recharge. M. S...|$|R

In 1848, the mayor of Verton refused the building of a station in the town because of alleged pollution, and it was decided instead to build it at Rang-du-Fliers. The railway station rapidly took on an importance, especially when a sugar mill was built in 1858 and the commune enjoyed ever-growing prosperity, employing up to 800 people in the years before 1914 during the beet campaigns. Since 1867, the village of Rang-du-Fliers had everything to make a commune: a church (1864), a priest, a cemetery, a station, a school and a factory that encouraged more and more workers to settle there.The idea of separating from Verton had its way, helped by the lack of interest shown by the Verton council.

40|$|This section {{describes}} the {{key components of}} the floodplain and terrace groundwater remediation systems and summarizes their performance for the 2009 - 2010 reporting period. 3. 1 Floodplain Remediation System The floodplain remediation system consists {{of the three major}} components shown in Figure 1 - 1 : two extraction wells (wells 1089 and 1104); two <b>drainage</b> <b>trenches</b> (horizontal wells), Trench 1 and Trench 2; and a sump (collection drain) used to collect discharges from seeps 0425 and. 0426 on the escarpment. The objective of the floodplain groundwater extraction system is to reduce the mass of COCs in alluvial groundwater near the San Juan River and to lessen exposure and potential risks to aquatic life. All groundwater collected from the floodplain extraction wells and trenches is piped south to the terrace and discharged into the evaporation pond. 3. 1. 1 Extraction Well Performance The floodplain extraction well system consists of wells 1089 and 1104 (Figure 1 - 1). These wells were constructed using slotted culverts placed in trenches excavated to bedrock. Corresponding pumping rates and cumulative volumes of groundwater extracted are plotted in Figures 3 - 1 and 3 - 2.

40|$|Since 1996, the E. coli {{levels in}} Dickinson Bayou have been {{considerably}} {{higher than the}} Texas state maximum of 126 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 mL for recreational waters. One hypothesis is that failing onsite sewage facilities (OSSFs) in the nearby residential areas are causing an increase of Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations in Dickinson Bayou. There {{are two types of}} OSSFs in the watershed; anaerobic and aerobic systems. The anaerobic systems discharge partially treated effluent below the soil surface from gravel <b>drainage</b> <b>trenches</b> while the aerobic systems disperse treated effluent on the soil surface using spray nozzles. This project was designed to determine if either of the two systems was contributing to the elevated E. coli concentrations in Dickinson Bayou. Two water quality monitoring stations were installed in the Dickinson Bayou watershed to estimate E. coli concentrations in surface runoff. One of the monitoring stations was placed in a neighborhood that uses OSSFs and the second station was placed in a neighborhood connected to a municipal sewage plant. Each monitoring station was equipped with a flow meter and an automatic water sampler. Runoff/rainfall relationships were established for each monitoring station. Water quality samples were obtained for sixteen rainfall events at the site with OSSFs and twelve events at the site with no OSSFs. Nearly all sampling events had at least one sample with an E. coli concentration greater than the state boundary. However, the concentrations from both sites were very similar to one another. A bacterial source tracking method was employed to conclude that a portion of the E. coli from both sites were of human origin. Further studies should focus on bacterial source tracking to determine the exact extent of human-based bacterial contamination in the Dickinson Bayou watershed...|$|R

40|$|Ecology, syntaxonomy and {{population}} size of Gymnocarpium dryopteris have been studied, {{especially during the}} period 1979 – 1991 by collecting data on 419 colonies in the Kuinderbos (a planted woodland in the Noordoostpolder, a polder reclaimed from the former Zuiderzee in 1942) and 74 colonies elsewhere in the Netherlands. In this paper the Kuinderbos population is compared with other Dutch populations (pleistocene area) {{in order to provide}} more insights in the ecology of the species and circumstances facilitating high density. Populations in Germany were studied as reference. In the period 1979 – 1991 the species was recorded in the Netherlands with at least 670 colonies, of which 89 % are in the Kuinderbos. Gymnocarpium dryopteris prefers shadowed ditches and <b>drainage</b> <b>trenches,</b> but can grow at various other habitats as well. Especially at the western and southern part of the Netherlands, the species grows on canal walls. Sites with Gymnocarpium dryopteris belong to different communities. In the Kuinderbos stands of Picea sitchensis are preferred, while elsewhere in the Netherlands the species prefers the Quercion roboris-petreae (Fago-Quercetum) or Pseudotsuga mensiezii-stands. Gymnocarpium dryopteris is accompanied by 14 fern species, at the Kuinderbos by 12 fern species, with Athyrium filix-femina as characteristic species, often indicating potential sites. Rhizomes are shallow creeping, at average 2. 6 cm below the surface (0. 5 – 8 cm). It grows in the ecto-organic layer or just below this layer. At trench sides it often grows in the mineral layer. Most colonies are within the influence of the watertable. The Dutch colonies are small and colonies with more than 1000 fronds are rare. This probably indicates that most colonies are less than 20 years old. Colonies with more than 100 fronds are often fertile, with less than 20 % of the fronds bearing sori. At the wall habitat small-sized individuals may be fertile as well. The high density in the Kuinderbos can be attributed to an optimal water supply from a peat subsoil, the composition of the ecto-organic layer consisting of Picea needles and an optimal light climate. The high density in Picea sitchensis within the Kuinderbos is unprecedented in Europe and makes these stands resemble the natural habitat of Picea sitchensis at the west coast of N. America...|$|R

40|$|Many buried systems {{modify the}} urban soil characteristics, and {{especially}} the subsoil water flow. Since the urban groundwater flow can be influenced by these modifications, there is a relation between the base flow observed in sewer systems due to drainage infiltration, and the piezometric levels fluctuations. The hydrological behaviour of urban catchments is affected by these phenomenon and one has to take it into account in urban hydrological models. This study presents the finding using a numerical groundwater model to represent groundwater <b>drainage</b> by <b>trenches</b> and buried pipes. This modelling is first implemented at a local scale first, and then at a catchment scale, which corresponds to a small urban area located at Nantes (Pin Sec, 31 ha). The sensitivity analysis, which is done at a local scale for a unit element of 100 m x 100 m reveals that the best representation consists in a consideration of a sewer pipe similar to a field drainage system. Furthermore, the model is highly sensitive to soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity. Both the local and catchment scales reveal the piezonetric head drawdown near the trench...|$|R
