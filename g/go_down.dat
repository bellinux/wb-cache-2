5|$|Promoted {{to younger}} writers by Anderson himself, Winesburg, Ohio {{has served as}} a {{representative}} early example of the modern short story cycle in American letters. Comparisons between Winesburg, Ohio and Jean Toomer's Cane (1923), Ernest Hemingway's In Our Time (1925), William Faulkner's <b>Go</b> <b>Down,</b> Moses (1942), and several of John Steinbeck's works, among others, demonstrate the pervasiveness of the formal innovations made in Anderson's book.|$|E

5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed.

Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E

5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E

Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to swim in the sea.

5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals {{at the time}} to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E
