500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN thought the episode [...] "wasn't {{as strong as}} the pilot" [...] and rated it at 7.4 ("Decent"). Goldman wrote that Electro's redesigned costume retained [...] "some nice visual nods to the Electro many of us grew up with." [...] Liz Allan's characterization, though, he found confusing, with the character's accent and background unclear, and the scene where Peter fought Electro while conducting a phonecall with Aunt May [...] "just a bit too much": [...] "Come on, Aunt May isn't <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> hearing ?" [...] Nonetheless, Goldman praised the episode's humorous scenes and the introduction of Dr. Conner's limb regeneration experiments.|$|E

50|$|You Are <b>Freaking</b> Me <b>Out</b> is {{the fifth}} album from the American band, Samiam. Released in 1997 on Burning Heart Records and (the now defunct) Ignition Records.|$|R
500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} Yorke, are more {{abstract}} compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends. Critic Alex Ross said the lyrics [...] "seemed {{a mixture of}} overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary" [...] with [...] "images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, yuppies <b>freaking</b> <b>out,</b> sympathetic aliens gliding overhead." [...] Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: [...] "On this album, the outside world became all there was... I'm just taking Polaroids of things around me moving too fast." [...] He told Q: [...] "It was like there's a secret camera {{in a room and}} it's watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me. It's neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Beck {{had been}} {{impressed}} with the Chess studio's history and sound, he {{had been unable to}} complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction. [...] "I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through. So we did two or three takes of my guitars and blended them all together. But the solo on [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] was pretty honest up until that feedback note that comes in over it", he recalled. [...] During the recording, [...] "there was mass hysteria in the studio when I did that solo. [...] They weren't expecting it and it was just some weird mist coming from the East out of an amp. [...] Giorgio was <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> and dancing about like some tribal witch doctor". [...] Beck played the solo on one string(G), using a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar he had purchased before the tour. Relf also benefitted from multi-tracking—two vocal tracks were recorded, allowing him to harmonise the vocal line.|$|E
500|$|... "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{the last}} track that Clarkson {{recorded}} for Breakaway; it was recorded in Sweden. At first, Clarkson was not fully convinced {{at the prospect of}} recording the song saying, [...] "It didn't have any lyrics and the melody really wasn't finalized ... the track was done on a computer, there was no band on it. My record label was <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> about it and I was, like, why?" [...] Clarkson also explained that when she first heard [...] "Since U Been Gone", she felt that it sounded a little bit pop for her direction and she decided to tweak the song musically by incorporating drums and guitars. Clarkson told MTV that the song is about a relationship turned sour although it was going well at the very beginning. The song was officially released to mainstream radio stations in the United States on November 16, 2004 as the lead single of Breakaway.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} shot in two days in Gallatin and Hendersonville, Tennessee. On {{the first day of}} filming, Swift used a body double in order for both Swift, as the protagonist and antagonist, to appear in one shot. In a scene where she {{appeared}} dancing, White replaced Swift's routine with a one having no rhythm; she recalled, [...] "It was some of the most fun I'd had in a long time, just <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> and doing the dumbest moves." [...] On the second day, they first filmed a prom scene and, lastly, the football game, both being filmed at Pope John Paul II High School. The school supplied many students as extras, including football players, band members, cheerleaders and students. The final prom scene used the school's decorations for its real prom the next night. When filming for a touchdown, Till was unable to catch the ball, furthering the length of the shoot. [...] "You put a lot of good solid effort in it and it looks good", Swift stated about filming.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan <b>freaking</b> <b>out.</b> [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E

Singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger told Rap-Up that he, along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Brian Alexander Morgan, was working on Usher's next album. Bellinger compared the album's music to Usher's Confessions (2004), {{saying that it is}} [...] "more R, more urban" [...] than Usher's Looking 4 Myself. The latter declared that his next album would show that he is [...] "still Usher". [...] "Good Kisser", a dance-heavy throwback R track, was released as the first single allowing Usher to achieve his 13th no.1 on the Airplay chart, tying Drake for most leaders in the list's history. Produced by Pop & Oak, it was performed at The Voice. Since then, two other singles have been released from the album: [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] featuring Nicki Minaj and [...] "I Don't Mind" [...] featuring Juicy J. The latter allowed Usher to lead the Rhythmic charts with the most number ones (13).|$|E

5000|$|Early season {{injuries}} to Reggie Bush and Pierre Thomas left Ivory as the Saints' starting running back.

[...] The performance earned him awards as both Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week and FedEx Ground Player of the Week. Another strong performance in Week 11, with 23 rushes for 99 yards in a 34-19 win over against Seattle, led Seahawks coach Pete Carroll to call Ivory [...] "a <b>freaking</b> stud <b>out</b> there."

500|$|Rooney Mara {{plays the}} role of Nancy Holbrook; Mara is also {{contracted}} for a sequel. Bayer describes Nancy as [...] "the loneliest girl in the world". Mara stated that her Nancy is different than the role of Nancy Thompson, performed by Heather Langenkamp, and described her character as [...] "socially awkward and timid and really doesn't know how to connect with people". Kyle Gallner was cast as Quentin, who forms a connection with Nancy. Gallner described his character as [...] "a mess, more jittery and more 'out there' than Nancy is". Gallner pointed out that his character is like this because of the amount of pharmaceuticals he ingests to stay awake. Producer Brad Fuller commented that Gallner brought a sense of [...] "humanity and relatability" [...] to the role with his compassion and intellect. Other cast members include Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz. Cassidy performed the role of Kris. According to Cassidy, Kris becomes an emotional wreck throughout the film. Cassidy described her character's ordeal: [...] "She is literally dragged through hell, having to crawl through dark, claustrophobic tunnels. She's always crying and <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> as her nightmares of Freddy bleed into her everyday life. Kris suspects there's something that connects her with the others; she even confronts her mother about it, but no one's talking." ...|$|E
500|$|Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{believed}} the episode was [...] "well-schooled" [...] in the horror genre, [...] "with plenty of <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> and jumping at shadows.

[...] Mellor was also appreciative of McGuigan's [...] "stylish hand" [...] as director, particularly highlighting the [...] "mind palace" [...] sequence, as well as Tovey's performance as Henry Knight and for [...] "once again" [...] seeing Watson's role for being [...] "more than just sigh exasperatedly at his flatmate and apologise to others on Sherlock's behalf." [...] In summary, the reviewer stated [...] "I can only echo Sherlock's own closing words to Henry: [...] "This case, thank you, it's been brilliant"." [...] Chris Tilly of IGN rated the episode a [...] "good" [...] 7 out of 10, but stated that although the it was [...] "full of mystery and intrigue," [...] the central story [...] "wasn't strong enough to fill the 90-minute run-time, running out of steam at the mid-way point and padded out with irrelevant and at times exasperating efforts to throw the audience off the scent." [...] Tilly praised Cumberbatch's performance as a mentally broke down Holmes, and Freeman for being [...] "let off the leash this week, with Watson investigating solo on a couple of occasions," [...] and also thought Tovey was a [...] "fine addition to the ensemble." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{songs from}} the album are {{inspired}} by Cuomo's past personal experiences. [...] "My Name is Jonas", deals with Cuomo's brother Leaves who had been seriously injured {{in a car accident}} while a student at Oberlin College and was having problem with his insurance. Jason Cropper earned co-writing credit for coming up with the intro to the song. Both [...] "No One Else" [...] and [...] "The World Has Turned and Left Me Here" [...] are lyrically connected, with Cuomo describing the narrator of [...] "No One Else" [...] as [...] "the jealous-obsessive asshole in me <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> on my girlfriend" [...] and claiming that [...] "'The World has Turned and Left Me Here' is the same asshole wondering why she's gone." [...] The second single from the Blue Album was [...] "Buddy Holly", whose music video was also directed by Spike Jonze. It portrayed the band performing at the original Arnold's Drive-In diner from the popular 1970s television show, Happy Days. The video combined contemporary footage of the band with clips from the show. Happy Days cast member Al Molinaro made a cameo appearance in the video. The video was met with great popularity and heavy rotation on MTV. The music video was also featured as an extra in the Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade CD, along with Edie Brickell's [...] "Good Times" [...] music video and the movie trailer for Rob Roy. The video won four awards at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, including prizes for Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Video.|$|E

It was just drunken talk, throwing darts, having fun. There’d be other people there, sometimes {{four or five of}} us. Just me and Eddie and our wives and mutual friends like Mudhoney manager Bob Whittaker. The Pearl Jam song ‘Lukin’ is about how my kitchen’s a sanctuary for him. Also, I was giving him shit about all their songs being too long. That inspired him to make ‘Lukin’ a one-minute song. I’ve always flipped him shit.

It later revealed onscreen that Summer may in fact not be his daughter; the paternity results read only by Nick years ago were inconclusive. Logan called it [...] "messy development", stating that his character may be [...] "trashed forever". According to Morrow, after Cassie's death, Nick withheld the fact that the results were corrupted because [...] "he just couldn't bear the thought of losing Summer, too", but called it [...] "out of character". [...] "But now he's <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> because there's a good likelihood that Summer and Kyle are brother and sister," [...] he stated. Nick later secretly does another test using hair from Summer's hairbrush, which comes back conclusive. Later that May, Morrow stated during an interview with TV Buzz that Nick would be devastated by the paternity test outcome; confirming that Summer is in fact Jack's daughter. He stated that Nick is [...] "terrified" [...] of the potential repercussions and the reactions, from Jack, Sharon, Noah, and most importantly Summer. However, months later it was revealed that the paternity test results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, [...] "I'm very curious as to how they're going to play it out with Summer.

[...] In responses to this controversy, Pastes Luke Larson said, [...] "when 'Video Games' first hit the web, people weren’t <b>freaking</b> <b>out</b> about Lana Del Rey or fake lips or Lizzy Grant.

Early in the series he was carried around the computer generated world by Jobs thereby fusing friendship with Jobs that is persistent throughout the series. Long before the Mayflower, Billy dreamt of events that would unfold over five centuries later. While in hibernation, Billy did not sleep, and was awake for the five-hundred-year journey. The ordeal twisted his mind, giving him telekinesis, the power to levitate, and many other strange abilities. In the fourth book, he moves Wylson Lefkowitz-Blake's dead body like an oversized marionette, <b>freaking</b> Mo'Steel <b>out</b> big-time. These abilities make Billy a match for Mother, {{to the point where they}} assimilate to become one. Billy dies in the re-greening ritual: it is possible he may have survived, but 2Face's attack and the subsequent energy Billy spends to drain her life force may have contributed to his death. He is dubbed [...] "Billy Weird" [...] by many of his enemies (which amounts to anyone seeking control of the ship).|$|R
