After touching at San Diego on the 27th, she arrived on 28 October at San Pedro, where Rear Admiral H.O. Stickney designated her the flagship of Pacific Fleet Training. For {{the next few}} months, Connecticut cruised along the West Coast, taking part in exercises and commemorations. Under {{the terms of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, which set tonnage limits for its signatory nations, the Navy designated Connecticut for scrapping. <b>Getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> for her final voyage on 11 December, she made a five-day journey to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923. On 1 November, the ex-Connecticut was sold for scrap to Walter W. Johnson of San Francisco for the sum of $42,750.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, Warner Bros. and {{producer}} Lauren Shuler Donner hired writer-director Hype Williams {{to take the}} helm of the project. In October 2001, the studio hired screenwriters Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring for $1.2 million split between them to write a script for the film. Eventually, without production <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> the director and the writers left the project. In June 2004, Vince Vaughn spearheaded a revival of the project by presenting a take for the film that would develop the characters more strongly. Vaughn was cast as Racer X and was also attached to the project as an executive producer. With production never becoming active, Vaughn was eventually detached from the project.|$|E

25|$|The {{limited number}} of copies {{available}} at first were targeted at a select fashionable readership. The late Autumn literary season was just <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> as the first reviews appeared, and by early January the book {{was the subject of}} conversations at elite literary gatherings. At venues such as Buckingham Palace and Lady Byron's parties, cosmic evolution became a topic of discussion {{for the first time in}} many years. Reforming medical journals including The Lancet for 23 November 1844 carried favourable reviews, while criticising specific points. In January the Unitarian quarterly Prospective gave powerful support, but the influential prestige quarterlies which could determine the long term success of books were still looking for reviewers.|$|E
25|$|By 11 December the Japanese {{invasion}} {{was developing}} with commercial ships evacuating Manila Bay. By 14 December {{most of the}} U.S. Asiatic Fleet had withdrawn and all heavy bombers of the USAAC had withdrawn to Mindanao and on the 17th to Darwin. On 13 December Don Esteban departed Manila after loading bombs from USS Canopus destined for the Del Monte airfield on Mindanao. The ship returned to Manila, already under air attack, on 21 December after a stop at Iloilo to deliver small arms and ammunition. On the 22nd the ship had to evade air attack by <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> into open waters. After successful evasion the ship was assigned to begin transporting supplies to Corregidor.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 July, Captain Ross and Colonel Fremantle made an {{inspection}} {{of the town of}} Gettysburg itself, intending to get to the cupola of the seminary, which had been used by General John Buford as a vantage point two days earlier. The commencement of the Union bombardment stopped the two observers, and so they returned to Longstreet's headquarters early in the afternoon. Fremantle alone found the General sitting on a small fence. Thinking that the battle was just <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> Fremantle commented to Longstreet that he 'wouldn't have missed this for anything'. Longstreet wryly pointed out to his guest that the attack had already happened, and had been repulsed. Longstreet asked if Fremantle had anything to drink, at which the Englishman made a gift to the general of his silver hip flask.|$|E

[...] GCC's lobbying was key to the defeat in the United States Senate of Clinton's 1993 BTU tax proposal. In 1994, after United States Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary said the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change needed to be strengthened, and that voluntary carbon dioxide reductions may not be enough, GCC said it was: [...] "disturbed by the implication that the President's voluntary climate action plan, which is just <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> will be inadequate and that more stringent measures may be needed domestically." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for Operation Tungsten, {{an attack on}} the , Furious and Victorious exchanged Barracuda squadrons, 827 for 831 Squadron, so that the squadrons that trained together could fly together. Furious also embarked 880 Squadron with eight Seafire L.IIC fighters to reinforce the six Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron. On the morning of 3 April 21 Barracudas of 827 and 830 Squadrons made the first attack just as the Tirpitz was <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> for sea trials. The Germans were caught entirely by surprise and the Tirpitzs smokescreen was only just beginning to form. The British aircraft enjoyed a clear view of their target and hit the German battleship six times. An hour later the second wave of 19 Barracudas from 829 and 831 Squadrons arrived and scored eight more hits. Only one Barracuda was shot down from each wave and another crashed on take-off. 801 and 880 Squadrons were retained for fleet air defence during the operation. Tirpitzs superstructure and upper hull was moderately damaged by the bombs, but her machinery was intact because the Barracuda pilots pressed home their attack below the [...] altitude necessary to give their [...] armour-piercing bombs enough velocity to penetrate Tirpitzs main armoured deck. Nonetheless Tirpitz was under repair for three months.|$|E

2500|$|In <b>getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> Governor Moore was fouled by and {{ran into}} the Confederate tug Belle Algerine, sinking her. [...] Attacking the Union fleet, she found USS Varuna ahead {{of the rest of the}} fleet. A long chase ensued, both ships firing on each other as Governor Moore pursued the Federal vessel. Despite losing a large part of her crew during the chase, she was {{eventually}} able to ram Varuna. The cottonclad ram Stonewall Jackson, of the River Defense Fleet also managed to ram. Varuna was able to reach shallow water near the bank before she sank, the only vessel lost from the attacking fleet. Captain Beverley Kennon of Governor Moore would have continued the fight, but his steersman had had enough and drove the ship ashore. Kennon, apparently realizing that his steersman was correct and that the ship was unable to do any more, ordered her abandoned and set afire.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{monitors}} led the way; {{first was}} , under Captain John Rodgers. <b>Getting</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> Weehawken's anchor fouled the grappling hooks on the torpedo raft, delaying the start by about an hour.

Third was , led by Commander John L. Worden; Worden was famed as the captain of [...] when she engaged CSS Virginia at the Battle of Hampton Roads. Next came , under Commander Daniel Ammen.
