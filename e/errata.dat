40|$|The paper {{represents}} an <b>erratum</b> {{for the article}} [4]. The goal of this <b>erratum</b> is to present some corrections {{for each of the}} chapter from the original article and few comments which will reduce some confusions. The intent of writing this <b>erratum</b> comes from a regrettable error of the authors, the references have not been attached with the right paragraphs and figures. In this case, we have decided to publish an <b>erratum</b> in which we correct this mistakes.

5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two <b>errata</b> sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{reason for}} the use of one-pass assemblers was speed of assembly â often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading the program source on tape or rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of <b>errata</b> makes the linking process (or the program load if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.|$|E
