40|$|Rationale and Objectives: Teaching is an {{important}} skill. Academic physicians teach on a daily basis, and nearly all physicians occasionally teach colleagues and patients. There are generally few opportunities for medical students to learn teaching skills. We developed a novel "near-peer" teaching program in which fourth-year students cotaught first-year students. Materials and Methods: Eighteen fourth-year students enrolled in our institution's primary senior radiology elective learned the basics of ultrasound {{through a series of}} lectures and hands-on scanning sessions. Each fourth-year student, paired with a radiology resident or attending, then cotaught a first-year anatomy small group session. After instruction, voluntary surveys were administered to assess the perceived value of the "near-peer" teaching experience. Results: Seventeen of 18 (94 %) and 104 of 120 (87 %) administered surveys were returned by fourth- and first-year students, respectively. Sixteen (94 %) and 99 (95 %) of the fourth- and first-year students reported they "enjoyed" or "really enjoyed" the near-peer teaching experience. Fourteen (82 %) of the <b>fourth</b> <b>years</b> perceived improvement in their teaching skills and an increase in their knowledge. Only 8 (47 %) of the <b>fourth</b> <b>years</b> thought they were "helpful" or "very helpful," though 92 (88 %) of the first years identified their fourth-year co-instructors as "helpful" or "very helpful. ". Conclusions: We piloted a novel "near-peer" program. Both senior and freshman students enjoyed the experience, and <b>fourth</b> <b>years</b> thought the session was educational for them as well. Although most <b>fourth</b> <b>years</b> did not judge themselves as helpful, first-year students overwhelmingly considered them a useful addition to the session. © 2013 AUR...|$|R
