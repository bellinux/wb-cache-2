40|$|Penicaud 11 couplingThe {{objective}} of this work is to present the methodology used to bring insight into interactions between heat and mass transfer phenomena (within the <b>heating</b> <b>product</b> and between the product and its environment) {{and the extent of}} Maillard reaction (influenced by the variations of local values of product moisture content, temperature and reactants concentration) during baking of a sponge-cake type bakery product. Therefore, a heat and mass transfer model coupled with a stoechio-kinetic model has been developed. This model aimed at mechanistically inter-relate the level of operating conditions and the initial composition of the bakery products (in terms of reducing sugars and amino-acid contents) with {{the nature and extent of}} Maillard reactions occurring during baking. The developed heat and mass transfer model takes into account internal moisture evaporation and vapour migration within the open porosity of the product during heating as well as apparent liquid moisture migration described by Fick's law. Internal heat transfer phenomena were described using Fourier's law and apparent thermal heat conductivity. External heat and mass transfer phenomena taken into account were convective drying, convective and radiative heat transfer for both <b>heating</b> <b>product</b> and baking tray. Concerning the stoechio-kinetic model developed in the present work, attention was paid to the nature of simplifying assumptions made to deal with phenomena of concern. This point is particularly important considering the complex reaction scheme of Maillard reaction which was necessarily reduced to a simplified observable scheme taking into account bibliographical references about the subject and available experimental data about reactivity acquired during the study. The level of physical realism of heat and mass transfer model previously discussed has hence been adapted to the level of complexity of the stoechio-kinetic model...|$|E

Rainfall, latent heating and radar reflectivity structures between El Nino (DJF 1997 - 98) and La Nina (DJF 1998 - 99) will be examined and compared. The seasonal variation of heating over various geographic locations (i. e., oceanic vs continental, Indian ocean vs west Pacific, Africa vs S. America) will also be analyzed. In addition, the relationship between rainfall, latent heating (maximum heating level), radar reflectivity and SST is examined and will be presented in the meeting. The impact of random error and bias in straitform percentage estimates from PR on latent heating profiles is studied and will also be presented in the meeting. The Goddard Cumulus Ensemble Model is being used to simulate various mesoscale convective systems that developed in different geographic locations. Specifically, the model estimated rainfall, radar reflectivity and latent heating profiles will be compared to observational data collected from TRMM field campaigns over the South China Sea in 1998 (SCSMXX), Brazil in 1999 (TRMM- LBA), and the central Pacific in 1999 (KWAJEX).

40|$|A bedding {{system should}} help {{maintain}} thermal conditions near the skin in comfortable ranges [1], {{regardless of the}} conditions prevailing in the surrounding environment. However, when {{the temperature of the}} environment surrounding the user decreases, it becomes increasingly unpractical to rely only on the passive insulation of fabrics to offer the body the thermal protection it needs to reach thermal neutrality. In these scenarios, electrically heated bedding systems may be interesting alternatives as they help maintaining temperature levels in comfortable ranges, while allowing to avoid some of the drawbacks of typical insulation products (e. g. increased thickness or weight, decreased breathability and passive operation, i. e. absence of adaption to user¿s thermal needs). However, in the interest of ensuring a high level of energy-efficiency in such a <b>heating</b> <b>product,</b> it is crucial to address its technical specification with approaches enabling a proper performance optimization, considering all relevant aspects of the problem (properties of the fabric layers and structures, characteristics of the heating system, geometrical features, energy requirements and operation conditions). With the goal of conducting pre-prototype optimization of a heating system to be embedded in a bedding product, the heat transport across its structures was studied numerically using a FEM-based approach [2] in order to analyse potential performance bottle necks, the effect of the main fabric characteristics and the possible characteristics of the heating system. The analyses were conducted for different exposure conditions, allowing the prediction of the temperature profiles across its structures, as a function of fabrics insulation, position and distribution of the heating elements and imposed heating powers. This enabled the acceleration of product specification activities (e. g. definition of fabric properties, features of the embedded heating system and overall design of the system) and the substantial {{reduction in the number of}} prototypes needed for the final performance optimization and fine-tuning. The approached described here can be used to potentiate and accelerate the optimization of different product families with smart/active functionalities (e. g. protective clothing, home textiles products, automotive seats, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Smoking is {{a leading}} cause of {{numerous}} human disorders including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The development of modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the risks of tobacco smoking by reducing exposure to cigarette smoke toxicants. This study is designed to investigate whether biomarkers of such exposure are reduced when smokers switch from smoking commercial cigarettes to using either a novel or a commercially-available tobacco <b>heating</b> <b>product</b> (THP). Design and Methods This study will assess biomarkers of exposure in current smokers who either remain smoking, switch to THP use, or quit all tobacco use completely, for 5  days. The study is an in-clinic (confinement) two-centre, randomised controlled clinical study with a forced-switching design. Subjects of either gender will be aged 23 – 55  years (minimum legal smoking age plus 3  years), of Japanese origin and with a verified smoking status (assessed by exhaled breath carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine levels). Subjects will have a usual brand cigarette within the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) tar band of 6 - 8  mg and will be judged to be healthy by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG), clinical biochemistry and lung function tests. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} assess changes within groups in selected biomarkers of exposure (BoE) and of biological effect (BoBE) after a forced switch from a commercial control cigarette to either a menthol or a non-menthol THP. Secondary objectives are to assess between-group differences, to determine nicotine pharmacokinetics for cigarettes and THPs, to assess subject’s satisfaction with the study products, and to monitor additional endpoints related to safety and product use. Discussion Data from this study will advance our scientific understanding of the changes in exposure to cigarette smoke toxicants in smokers who switch to using a THP.

40|$|The {{optimisation}} of {{the performance}} of products with smart/active functionalities (e. g. in protective clothing, home textiles products, automotive seats, etc.) is still a challenge for manufacturers and developers. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimise the thermal performance of a <b>heating</b> <b>product</b> by a numerical approach, by analysing several opposing requirements and defining solutions for the identified limitations, before the construction of the first prototype. A transfer model was developed to investigate the transport of heat from the skin to the environment, across a heating blanket with an embedded smart heating system. Several parameters of the textile material and of the heating system were studied, in order to optimise the thermal performance of the heating blanket. Focus was put on the effects of thickness and thermal conductivity of each layer, and on parameters associated with the heating elements, e. g. position of the heating wires relative to the skin, distance between heating wires, applied heating power, and temperature range for operation of the heating system. Furthermore, several configurations of the blanket (and corresponding heating powers) were analysed in order to minimise the heat loss from the body to the environment, and the temperature distribution along the skin. The results show that, to ensure an optimal compromise between the thermal performance of the product and the temperature oscillation along its surface, the distancebetween the wires should be small (and not bigger than 50 mm), and each layer of the heating blanket should have a specific thermal resistance, based on the expected external conditions during use and the requirements of the heating system (i. e. requirements regarding energy consumption/efficiency and capacity to effectively regulate body exchanges with surrounding environment). The heating system should operate in an ON/OFF mode based on the body heating needs and within a temperature range specified based on the blanket total thermal resistance, external temperature during use, and observed temperature on the blanket outer surface (safety and energy efficiency aspects). The approach described in this work enabled the definition of the textile properties, the features of the embedded heating system, and the overall design of the system thus reducing substantially the number of prototypes needed for the final performance optimisation and fine-tuning...|$|E
