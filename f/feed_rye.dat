40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of dietary essential oil components, i. e., thymol, cinnamaldehyde and a commercial blend of essential oil components (CRINA ® Poultry) on growth performance, fat digestibility, intestinal viscosity and plasma cholesterol in female broiler chickens fed on a diet rich in rye. There were 5 dietary treatments: a diet containing corn, a diet with rye, the rye diet with 100 ppm thymol, the rye diet with 100 ppm cinnamaldehyde and the rye diet with 100 ppm CRINA ® Poultry. Each treatment consisted of 3 cages with 5 birds per cage. Birds fed on the supplement-free diet containing rye instead of corn showed a significantly depressed daily weight gain between 1 - 14 days of age. The rye-induced suppression of weight gain between 1 - 14 days of age was partially overcome by the inclusion in the diet of cinnamaldehyde, but the effect failed to reach statistical significance. Birds fed on the diets with rye generally ate less than those fed on the corn diet. Cinnamaldehyde tended to increase voluntary feed intake. The water:feed ratio was increased by the <b>feeding</b> of <b>rye,</b> but the supplements had no effect. The viscosity of jejunal and ileal digesta were significantly elevated when the diet contained rye instead of corn, but there was no counteracting effect of the essential oil components. Fecal fat digestibility was significantly lowered in birds fed on the rye diet, but the supplements did not reverse this effect. Thus, it is concluded that cinnamaldehyde may counteract the antinutritional effect of rye, but without a simultaneous effect on intestinal viscosity or fat digestibility. <b>Feeding</b> <b>rye</b> instead of corn did not modulate plasma cholesterol. Cinnamaldehyde produced a significant increase in plasma cholesterol concentration...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} growing chicks to {{study the effects of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>rye</b> and wheat diets supplemented with different calcium levels, two types and two levels of fat, and increasing levels of vitamin D 3 and to study the interrelationships of these dietary ingredients on chick performance. In Experiment 1, feed conversion efficiency was reduced to a much greater extent (10 % vs. 1 %) when tallow replaced soybean oil in a rye-based diet containing only. 6 % calcium compared to a wheat-based diet. When the dietary calcium was increased to 1. 1 % the replacement of tallow by soybean oil resulted in only a small reduction in feed efficiency for chicks fed either the rye- (3 %) or wheat- (1 %) based diets. The retention of fat, particularly tallow, was depressed in rye as com-pared to wheat-fed birds. Fat retention was also influenced by calcium levels. Increasing the dietary calcium from. 6 to 1. 1 % improved tallow (16 %) and depressed (7 %) soybean oil retention in rye-based diets, whereas in wheat-based diets the retention for both fats was slightly decreased. Experiment 2 showed that the efficiency of utilization of rye diets containing 7. 5 % tallow was improved by 10 % when the level of dietary calcium was increased from. 6 to 1. 1 % while the corresponding improvement in similarly formulated wheat diets was only 1 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} growing chicks to study the effects on performance and fat absorption of <b>feeding</b> <b>rye</b> and wheat diets supplemented with fats of different chain length and degree of saturation. In Experiment 1 it was shown {{that there was a}} much greater decrease in feed intake and fat absorption when tallow replaced safflower oil in the diets of chicks fed rye as compared to those fed wheat-based diets. Experiment 2 established the effects on chick performance of supplementing diets based on either rye or wheat with variably saturated fats. Substituting the most saturated triglyceride (<- 18 : 0) with the most unsaturated triglyceride (Cl 8 : 2) in the rye diets improved the respective feed intake, weight gain, and feed conversion efficiency by 11, 75, and 40 %, whereas the corresponding changes for the wheat-fed birds were- 9, 9, and 16 %, respectively. Experiment 3 investigated the effects on chick performance of supplementing rye-based or wheat-based diets with fats of varying chain lengths. Substituting fats containing long chain fatty acids (*- 48) for those containing shorter chain fatty acids (Cl 2) resulted in respective improvements in weight gain and feed conversion efficiency of 27 and 30 % in rye-fed birds and corresponding improvements of only 1 and 9 % in the wheat-fed birds. A similar trend also occurred for fat absorption. The results of Experiment 4 demonstrated that older birds (35 versus 6 days of age) fed wheat-based diets absorbed only 1 % more fat than younger birds, whereas when rye diets were fed, older birds absorbed 55 % more fat than the younger birds. Overall it may be concluded that fat absorption in chicks is affected by chain length and degree of saturation of the fat and the age of the birds and that these factors affect rye-fed birds to a much greater degree than those birds fed wheat-based diets.

40|$|In Denmark a {{nephropathy}} in pigs {{characterized by}} tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis {{has been identified}} frequently during the last 5 decades {{in the course of}} meat inspection in slaughterhouses. The disease was first described by Larsen, who recognized the connexion between <b>feeding</b> mouldy <b>rye</b> to pigs and the development of the nephropathy. In this study kidneys were examined from 19 pigs coming from a farm with an outbreak of nephropathy. The barley fed to the pigs was contaminated with the mycotoxin ochratoxin A. Histological examination revealed different degrees of change ranging from slight regressive changes in the tubular epithelium and periglomerular and interstitial fibrosis to tubular atrophy, thickened basement membranes, glomerular sclerosis, and marked fibrosis. These differences were considered to be due to differences in the length of time of exposure to the mouldy barley and differences in the amount of mycotoxin consumed by the individual pig. However, {{it will be necessary to}} carry out experiments using crystalline ochratoxin A in order to prove such a relationship. Mycotoxins have also been suggested as etiological factors in Balkan nephropathy in man, which in the initial stages is characterized by tubular lesions similar to those seen in mycotoxic nephropathy in pigs...|$|R
40|$|Ergot {{alkaloids}} are mycotoxins {{which can}} be found in food based on cereal-crops, due to a con-tamination of plants by fungi of the genus Claviceps.

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} growing chicks to study the effect of autoclave treatment, water extraction, water soaking, and antibiotic supplementation on the nutritional value of rye grain. Experiment 1 showed that the antinutritional factor(s) in rye grain was not destroyed by autoclaving. This treatment for 10 or 30 min, respectively, depressed feed utilization by 9 and 14 % in the rye fed chicks and by only 2 and 4 % in the wheat fed birds because of reduced digestibility of all nutrients. The detrimental effect of rye grain was partly overcome by increased feed intake. Experiment 2 demonstrated that rye grain contains a water-soluble, sticky, and hydroscopic factor forming highly viscous aqueous solutions. The addition of this factor to a wheat-based diet depressed chick performance to that obtained from <b>feeding</b> extracted <b>rye</b> because of the factor's interference with palatability of the feed and the digestion and absorption of all nutrients including fat {{and most of the}} individual amino acids. Extraction of rye twice improved chick performance and the digestibility of all nutrients, but all of these criteria were still inferior compared to those of wheat-fed chicks. The residual antinutritional activity of extracted rye was attributed to the partially insoluble nature of this factor. Chick performance was also improved by penicillin supplementation of diets containing rye, extracted rye, or water extract. In Ex...|$|R

Experiment one was conducted as a 3 × 4 × 3 × 3 factorial arrangement with three <b>feed</b> ingredients (<b>rye,</b> wheat and barley), four T (20, 38, 55 and 80 °C), three pH levels (3. 0, 5. 5 and 8. 0) and three incubation times (30, 60 and 120 min), with two replicates per treatment. Stability was calculated as {{the ratio of the}} residual phytase activity of a treated sample to the non-treated (reference sample) times 100. Phytase activity of the reference samples of rye, wheat and barley was 3. 14, 1. 77 and 0. 66 FTU/g, respectively. Overall, rye showed the highest and barley the lowest stability (0. 58 vs. 0. 47, P 0. 90). Wheat and rye phytases were stable at pH 3. 0 and 5. 5 (20 and 38 °C). In experiment two, the effect of shorter period of time (10 and 30 min) was assessed on the stability of cereal phytases. Barley phytase showed the highest residual phytase activity among cereals at 65 °C. In experiment three, stability of intrinsic phytase of these feed ingredients was determined after incubation in different concentrations of pepsin (0, 5 and 10 mg/mL) at pH 2. 0. Intrinsic phytases of wheat and rye were resistant to pepsin, but barley phytase was susceptible to pepsin and its stability decreased to 0. 57 after pre-incubation for 60 min in 5 mg pepsin/mL. This knowledge regarding the effect of T, incubation time and pH on stability of cereal intrinsic phytases may contribute to optimize available P contents of diets, thereby reducing phosphorus excretion of monogastrics...|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between the}} green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the entomopathogenic fungus Lecanicillium muscarium (Ascomycota: Cordycipitaceae), {{and a common}} {{parasitoid}} Aphidius colemani (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), were tested with Brussels sprout (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera L. cv. Bedford Winter Harvest) as host plant, under laboratory and controlled field conditions. The effects of temperature, relative humidity and developmental stages of M. persicae on the efficacy of this fungus were measured under laboratory conditions. The most effective method of co-applying these two biological control agents to enhance their additive interactions against M. persicae was also assayed, in particular to determine if fungal infection of the aphid host {{had an effect on}} the number of aphids mummified by the parasitoid, and on emergence rate and parasitoid sex ratio. Although this fungus can be grown at a broad range of temperatures (15 – 30 °C), the optimum temperature for control of M. persicae ranged between 20 °C and 30 °C. Lecanicillium muscarium had high efficacy as a microbial control agent against M. persicae between 55 % and 90 % RH. Furthermore, the fungus was most virulent against adults and older developmental stages, compared to young developmental stages of M. persicae. Results also showed that although fungal infection has no negative effect on the rate of nymph production per day, total fecundity of infected aphids declined overall as the length of the reproductive period of the aphids was reduced. In no-choice and choice experiments under laboratory conditions, mummification, adult emergence from mummified aphids and female sex ratio in emerging adults, were unaffected when the fungus was applied 6 or 7 days after the parasitoid was added, compared with treatment by A. colemani alone. However, all parameters were significantly lower when L. muscarium was applied first, compared with treatment by A. colemani alone. Co-application of A. colemani or exposure to naturally occurring parasitoids and L. muscarium can interact positively, leading to increase the control level to be higher than equivalent level produced by one agent alone but less than additive effects in a field cage experiments. Laboratory experiments showed that aphids <b>feeding</b> on <b>rye</b> were the most susceptible to infection by L. muscarium. The highest percentage of aphids mummified and emergent parasitoid females were found in aphids feeding on green pepper. Further research is required in large scale open field conditions to study the combined effects of the fungus and either naturally occurring or introduced parasitoids on aphid population growth. The implications of these results for the use of L. muscarium and A. colemani in combination as a biological control programme are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{antibiotics}} at low, subtherapeutic {{levels have}} been shown to improve growth performance in farm animals. However, there is a trend to look for alternatives to dietary antibiotics, due to occurrence of antibiotic-resistance bacteria. The present thesis explored the essential oils as the possible alternative to dietary antibiotics. An essential oil is a mixture of fragrant, volatile compounds derived from the aromatic plant. Dietary feed additives based on essential oil components are marketed to enhance growth performance and health. It is claimed that under practical conditions dietary essential oil components improve digestion and stimulate feed intake, and consequently raise growth performance. However, the effect of essential oils on animal performance has not been proved in a controlled study. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of essential oils as the possible alternatives to antibiotics in poultry nutrition. Female broiler chickens were used as an animal model to study the effect of essential oils on growth performance, activities of digestive enzymes, macronutrient digestion and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, experiments were carried out to test whether dietary essential oil components could either counteract anti-nutrient effect of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) or rye. Finally, the possible synergistic effects of individual essential oil components were tested in relation to growth performance when chickens were fed on a diet containing CMC. The literature review describes the general biological activities of essential oils. Dietary essential oils can have several useful biological properties, e. g., acting as antimicrobial substance and antioxidants, and being hypocholesterolemic, affecting flavor, and stimulating the digestion process. Their metabolic pathways have been well elucidated, and based on that observation, it was suggested that their side effects are unlikely. Due to a limited number of controlled studies on the effect of essential oil components on growth performance in broiler chickens, an experiment was conducted to describe the effect of thymol, cinnamaldehyde and a commercial preparation of essential oil components (CRINA Poultry) on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities and macronutrient digestibilities. Corn-soybean meal based diet was used to prepare the experimental diets and chicks were housed in wire-bottomed cages. It was shown that no effect of essential oil components on any of parameters monitored in female broiler chickens was observed, but it can not be excluded that positive effects would have been observed under less hygienic environmental conditions or when using a less digestible diet. However, in this study dietary cinnamaldehyde significantly lowered water intake without affecting growth performance. Consequently, dry matter contents of excreta were higher in birds fed diet containing cinnamaldehyde. The observed cinnamaldehyde-induced reduction of spontaneous water intake could be commercially interesting. In subsequent studies, we further screened dietary carvacrol, and -ionone as potential feed additives in female broiler chickens. Furthermore, we tested the alleged hypocholesterolemic effect of dietary essential oil components when the chickens were fed either cholesterol-free or cholesterol-rich diets. It was found that dietary carvacrol lowered feed intake and weight gain, but also lowered the feed:gain ratio. The carvacrol effect on feed:gain ratio could relate to increased efficiency of feed utilization and/or altered carcass composition. Unfortunately, carcass composition of the chickens was not analyzed. Carvacrol lowered plasma triglyceride concentrations, but did not affect plasma cholesterol. Dietary -ionone failed to affect growth performance and the plasma lipid profile, irrespective of whether the diet was cholesterol free or rich in cholesterol. The question then addressed was whether dietary essential oils (thymol, cinnamaldehyde, CRINA Poultry) could antagonize the negative effect of CMC on growth performance in broilers. Intestinal viscosity was increased by CMC inclusion, but was not lowered by dietary essential oils. However, addition of cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry to the CMC diet tended to counteract the negative effect on growth performance. Fat digestibility was reduced by CMC, but cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry partially relieved the CMC-induced inhibition of fat digestion. This study indicates that cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry, but not thymol, may antagonize the negative effect of CMC on growth performance which may relate to improving fat digestibility. In following study, we observed whether dietary essential oil components, i. e., thymol, cinnamaldehyde and CRINA Poultry could have effects on growth performance, fat digestibility, and intestinal viscosity in female broiler chickens fed on <b>rye.</b> <b>Feeding</b> <b>rye</b> to chicken lowered weight gain, elevated intestinal viscosity and reduced fat digestibility. Addition of dietary cinnamaldehyde to rye diet partially counteracted rye-suppressed weight gain in female broiler chickens. However, intestinal viscosity and fat digestion were not modified by dietary cinnamaldehyde. The partial counteraction of dietary cinnamaldehyde on rye-induced growth depression seemed to be mediated by concomitant increase in feed intake, however underlying mechanisms remain unknown. It would expect that a mixture of essential oil components could act synergistically on growth performance. Carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde were selected based on earlier studies. In addition, CMC was included to enhance treatment contrasts. Individual components when supplemented to the CMC diet had no apparent effects on growth performance. On the other hand, a mixture of carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde added to CMC diet significantly impaired growth performance of the chickens. This latter study suggests that a certain combination of two or more essential oil components can impair growth performance of chickens when birds are fed a diet with the soluble fiber, CMC. It is generally concluded that dietary essential oil components have potential to improve performance of broiler chickens. However, the consistently alleged hypocholesterolemic effects of dietary essential oil components were not observed. Based on the present work, future studies with dietary essential oil components should focus on identifying synergistic effects of different essential oil components and their application to animal production...|$|R
40|$|I denne oppgaven var hensikten å sammenligne virkning av fôring med timotei-, raigras eller maissurfôr på fettsyresammensetning i kumelk. Siden tidligere forsøk, blant annet på Jæren, med bruk av raigras har gitt gode resultater med tanke på humanernæringen var vi i dette forsøket interessert i se hvor store de eventuelle forskjellene var i forhold til de to andre grovfôrsortene. Timotei har tradisjonelt vært den dominerende fôrveksten dyrket til melkeproduksjon, mens raigras egner seg godt til dyrking i deler av landet. Det er i dag en svært liten produksjon av mais her i landet, men kan bli mer interessant som følge av de spådde klimaendringene. Fôrets umetta fettsyrer blir i betydelig grad omdannet i drøvtyggerens vom gjennom {{hydrolyse}} og hydrogenering til metta fettsyrer. I juret skjer det også en betydelig omdanning av de opptatte fettsyrene ved hjelp av enzymet D 9 - desaturase som desaturerer en andel av de metta fettsyrene, særlig stearinsyre til oljesyre og vaksensyre til CLA. I tillegg blir også korte og mellomlange fettsyrer syntetisert i juret gjennom de novo syntesen fra eddiksyre og smørsyre produsert i vomma. Fôrets fettsyresammensetning kan på tross av fermenteringen i vomma likevel til en viss grad påvirke melkens fettsyresammensetning. For eksempel vil det ved en større andel umetta fettsyrer i fôrrasjonen være større sjanse for at deler av disse slipper unna hydrogeneringen i vomma og dermed kan tas opp av juret som umetta. Det er nettopp dette som tidligere har karakterisert raigras, høyere fettinnhold og en større andel av umetta fettsyrer. Det ble gjennomført to like forsøk ved institutt for husdyrvitenskap ved universitetet for miljø og biovitenskap i perioden fra mai til ut oktober 2009, et ved høyt fôrnivå tidlig i laktasjonen og direkte deretter et tilsvarende forsøk ved et lavere fôrnivå. På den måten fikk vi målinger av melkens fettsyresammensetning gjennom store deler av kyrnes laktasjon. Det ble benyttet 6 vomfistulerte NRF kyr som rullerte mellom de ulike fôrrasjonene av timotei-, raigras- og maissurfôr. Melkeprøver og fôr ble analysert for kjemisk innhold og fettsyresammensetning og danner grunnlaget for dataene i denne oppgaven. Det var generelt små forskjeller i totalt innhold av metta og umetta fettsyrer i melken mellom forsøksleddene, mens timotei- og maissurfôr ga nominelt noe mer transfettsyrer sammenlignet med raigrassurfôr. Det var imidlertid noen forskjeller mellom grovfôrene når det gjaldt de enkelte fettsyrene i melkefettet, hvor maissurfôret i størst grad skilte seg ut fra surfôr av timotei- eller raigras. Maissurfôret hadde signifikant høyere innhold av C 18 : 2 og transsyrene C 18 : 1 t 9 og C 18 : 1 t 10 på bekostning av C 18 : 3, C 18 : 0 og C 20 : 0 ved begge fôrnivåer sammenlignet med timotei- og raigrassurfôr. På det høye fôrnivået var det ingen signifikante forskjeller i melkens fettsyresammensetning ved fôring med timotei- eller raigrassurfôr. Derimot var det noen signifikante forskjeller på det lave fôrnivået ved at fôring med timoteisurfôret hovedsakelig ga signifikant høyere innhold av C 18 : 0, C 18 : 2 og C 18 : 1 t 11 i melkefettet. I tillegg også tendens til høyere innhold av CLA i forhold til fôring med raigrassurfôr. Det kan være flere årsaker til at resultatene var såpass like. Blant annet at grovfôrene, særlig timotei- og raigrassurfôret, inneholdt om lag like andeler av metta og umetta fettsyrer. En annen viktig faktor her er nok at kraftfôret har hatt en innvirkning ved at dette hadde et høyt innhold av metta fettsyrer, særlig C 16 : 0. The {{purpose of}} these experiments were to compare silage rations of timothy, rye grass or maize, and their influence on the fatty acid composition in the milk of dairy cows. Earlier studies using rye grass in milk production, for example at Jæren in Norway, have shown good results on the composition of fatty acids in milk in regards to human nutrition. Therefore, in these experiments {{we were interested in}} the range of possible differences between the three roughages. In Norway, timothy is traditionally grown as a general forage crop for dairy production and rye grass more rare, being used in just a few parts of the country. As of today there is very little production of maize, but maize can be of greater interest in light of possibly predicted climate changes. In ruminants, the unsaturated fatty acid content in the feed is in large extent hydrolysed and hydrogenated to saturated fatty acids in the rumen. The fatty acid component in the udder is desaturated with the enzyme D 9 - desaturase, resulting in a desaturation to unsaturated acids, primarily stearic acid to oleic acid and vaccenic acid to conjurated lineoleic acid (CLA). Additionally, short and medium chained fatty acids will be synthesized de novo from acetic and butyric acid produced in the rumen. Despite the large extent of fermentation in the rumen and transformation in the udder, the fatty acid composition of the feeds will to a certain extent influence the resultant composition in the milk. For example, with a larger proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the feed ration there is a greater chance that parts of it will escape the rumens hydrogenation and more unsaturated fatty acid is then available for the udder. In earlier studies rye grass have shown similar effects because of its higher contents of total fat, and a greater part of unsaturated fatty acids compared with other roughages. The Department of Animal Science at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences completed two experiments involving six rumenfistulated cows in the period ranging from May to the end of October of 2009. The first experiment focused on providing a high quantity of fodder early in the cows lactation. Later in the same lactation the cows were provided with a lower quantity of feed. This proved to give us information about the composition of fatty acids in the milk during the entire lactation period. The samples from the milk and the feeds were analysed for their chemical contents, components and composition, and the result establish the basis for this paper. In general, the content of saturated and unsaturated fat in the milk was to a great extent similar among the three roughages. Silage of timothy or maize however gave a nominally higher content of trans fatty acids than <b>feed</b> with <b>rye</b> grass silage. However, there were some differences between the individual fatty acids in the milk based on the type of fodder the cows received. Silage from maize gave the greatest differences compared to the other two silages with significantly higher contents of C 18 : 2, C 18 : 1 t 9 and C 18 : 1 t 10 at the expense of C 18 : 3, C 18 : 0 and C 20 : 0. At the high feeding level {{there were no significant differences}} between the milk composition when feeding with timothy- or rye grassilage. On the other hand, in the low feeding level range there were some differences with higher content of C 18 : 0, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 1 t 11 in the milk when feeding with timothy silage compared to silage of rye grass. There was also statistical tendencies to higher content of CLA when feeding with timothy silage. There are several possible factors that can explain why the different forages provided such a similar composition of fat in the cows milk. An example would be how similar the proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are in timothy and rye grass. Another important factor is the possible influence from the concentrates used in these experiments with their high proportion of saturated fatty acids, mainly C 16 : 0...|$|R
