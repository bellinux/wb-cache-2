25|$|The {{peptides}} may be desalted {{to remove}} <b>ionizable</b> <b>contaminants</b> {{and subjected to}} MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Direct measurement of the masses of the peptides may provide sufficient information to identify the protein (see Peptide mass fingerprinting) but further fragmentation of the peptides inside the mass spectrometer {{is often used to}} gain information about the peptidesâ€™ sequences. Alternatively, peptides may be desalted and separated by reversed phase HPLC and introduced into a mass spectrometer via an ESI source. LC-ESI-MS may provide more information than MALDI-MS for protein identification but uses more instrument time.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of parylene, most organic coatings are readily penetrated by water molecules. A coating preserves the performance of precision electronics primarily by preventing <b>ionizable</b> <b>contaminants</b> such as salts from reaching circuit nodes, and combining there with water to form a microscopically thin electrolyte film. For this reason, coating is far more effective if all surface contamination is removed first, using a highly repeatable industrial process such as vapor degreasing or semi-aqueous washing in a special machine. Extreme cleanliness also greatly improves adhesion. Pinholes would defeat {{the purpose of the}} coating, because a continuous contaminant film would be able to make contact with the circuit nodes and form undesired conductive paths between them.|$|E
40|$|The {{superior}} adsorption {{capacity of}} carbon nanotubes {{has been well}} recognized {{and there is a}} wealth of information in the literature concerning the adsorption of unionized organic pollutants on carbon nanotubes. Recently, the adsorption of emerging environmental pollutants, most of which are ionizable, has attracted increasing attention due to the heightened concerns about the accumulation of these emerging contaminants in the environment. These recent studies suggest that the adsorption of emerging <b>ionizable</b> <b>contaminants</b> on carbon nanotubes exhibit different characteristics than unionized ones. For example, a new charge-assisted intermolecular force has been proposed for ionizable compounds because some adsorption phenomenon cannot be easily explained by the conventional force theory. The adsorption of ionizable compounds also displayed much stronger dependence on solution pH and ionic strength than unionized compounds. This article aims to present a brief review on the current understanding of the adsorption of emerging <b>ionizable</b> <b>contaminants</b> to carbon nanotubes and discuss further research needs required to advance the mechanistic understanding of the interactions between <b>ionizable</b> <b>contaminants</b> and carbon nanotubes...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{transport}} mechanisms connected to solid-liquid interactions is fundamental in {{the determination of the}} extension of the pollution of a site and in the evaluation of the best remediation process to be applied. The sorption of hydrophobic <b>ionizable</b> organic <b>contaminants</b> from the groundwaters is supervised not only by the physico-chemical properties of soil and pollutants, but also by the groundwaters pH, which deeply influences their solubility in the aqueous media, and consequently their transport mechanisms in the aquifer. In this work an experimental {{study of the}} sorption of phenol and 2 -nitrophenol on two soils, different in particlesize distribution, CEC and organic carbon content, was realized. The sorption potential of the soils was evaluated by means of a physical, mineralogical and chemical characterization. The experimental data coming from some batch tests, performed at pH values equal to 4, 7 and 10 were fitted by means of linear, Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms models. The soil-contaminants interaction mechanisms that influence the isotherms shapes were then analyzed and discussed, and a comparison between the theoretical and experimental values of the partitioning coefficient KD was performed...|$|R
40|$|Binary and ternary model {{particles}} containing montmorillonite, ferrihydrite, and {{humic acid}} (HA) {{were used to}} determine the changes in the sorption behavior of the herbicide 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) upon the interassociation of these three major soil constituents. On single sorbents, 2, 4 -D sorption was high with S-type isotherms on ferrihydrite, moderate with L-type isotherms on HA, and zero on montmorillonite. In binary sorbents, ferrihydrite and humic acid coatings on montmorillonite provided sorption sites for 2, 4 -D, although the exclusion of the anionic form from highly charged clay surfaces partially obscured the role of Fe and HA as sorbents of 2, 4 D. Sorption of 2, 4 -D on ferrihydrite-HA binary particles was not very different from that on pure ferrihydrite because most of the ferrihydrite surface area was from micropores being not accessible to large humic macromolecules and hence remained available for herbicide sorption. In ternary sorbents HA coatings reduced the sorption of 2, 4 -D by the montmorillonite-ferrihydrite binary complex, indicating that HA blocked many of the sorption sites provided by the Fe coatings. This work shows that the amount and nature of the surface that remains available after the interassociation of single soil constituents is a critical parameter in determining the sorptive behavior of the resultant aggregate for <b>ionizable</b> <b>contaminants</b> such as 2, 4 D. Thus, the use of calculated sorption parameters such as K(oc), K(ow), K(minera), or K(Fe), for modeling contaminant behavior. In aquatic or soil environments may result in serious deviation from the reality. | Binary and ternary model particles containing montmorillonite, ferrihydrite, and humic acid (HA) {{were used to determine}} the changes in the sorption behavior of the herbicide 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dicholorophenoxyacetic acid) upon the interassociation of these three major soil constituents.
