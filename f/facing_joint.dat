40|$|Formation {{of joint}} ventures between {{construction}} companies {{is one of}} the recent efforts in combating contractors problems in Tanzania and addresses one of the key challenges facing the construction industry today in the country especially when large and complex projects are involved. The main objective of the research is to examine the formation of joint ventures in Tanzania, specifically to: study joint ventures formation procedures; identify criteria in selection of joint venture partner; and identify risks associated with and challenges <b>facing</b> <b>joint</b> venture undertakings in Tanzania. The study adopted a descriptive research design and purposive sampling. Multiple sources of evidence was used to collect information mainly literature review, questionnaires and interviews. Key findings reveal that legal and statutory requirements in the formation of joint ventures include registration by Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA), Contractors Registration Board (CRB) and under Registration of Documents Act (RDA). All JV respondents were registered by BRELA and CRB which are mandatory but only 7 were registered by RDA. Most important factors considered during formation of JVs are: contract agreement, financial stability and commitment while key risks associated with JVs are cultural and social differences, delays in approvals and financial risks. In addition, main challenges <b>facing</b> <b>joint</b> ventures are: identification of possible risks and joint venture agreement interpretation. The study concludes that formation of JVs have been addressing some of emerging challenges facing local construction organizations despite the risks and challenges that exist. The study recommends that firms entering joint ventures should explore the benefits of registering with RDA and ensure risks associated with their JV are properly assessed. The study also recommends introduction of an incentive scheme through Tanzania Investment Centre to grant tax relief for foreign contractors going into joint venture with local construction firms...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} creative {{ways in which}} Israeli and Palestinian activists engage {{with each other and}} the powers seeking to separate them in their nonviolent struggles for a just and lasting peace. Using the geopolitical theory of territoriality, the article briefly examines a number of administrative, physical, and psychological barriers <b>facing</b> <b>joint</b> activism and the strategies activists use to counteract them. Drawing on nonviolent theory and practice, the article analyzes how activists exert power through the creative use of symbols and practices that undermine the legitimacy of occupation policies. Based on fieldwork con-ducted in 2004 – 05 and July 2006, the article explores the implications of this activism on conceptions of identity, and strategies for restarting a moribund peace process. The relative ‘success ’ of sustained joint action in Bil’in can provide scholars and policymakers with innovative approaches for addressing some of the outstanding issues needing to be addressed by official negotiators. Although government bodies are more constrained than activists, the imaginative means of engaging with the system – and the reframing of issues through the redeployment of ‘commonplaces ’ – can perhaps provide inspiration, if not leverage, for thinking outside of the box.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{opportunities}} for, {{and the challenges}} <b>facing,</b> <b>joint</b> working {{in the provision of}} community mental health care. At a strategic level the organization of contemporary mental health services is marked by fragmentation, competing priorities, arbitrary divisions of responsibility, inconsistent policy, unpooled resources and unshared boundaries. At the level of localities and teams, these barriers to effective and efficient joint working reverberate within multi-disciplinary and multi-agency community mental health teams (CMHTs). To meet this challenge, CMHT operational policies need to include multiagency agreement on: professional roles and responsibilities; target client groups; eligibility criteria for access to services; client pathways to and from care; unified systems of case management; documentation and use of information technology; and management and accountability arrangements. At the level of practitioners, community mental health care is provided by professional groups who may have limited mutual understanding of differing values, education, roles and responsibilities. The prospect of overcoming these barriers in multidisciplinary CMHTs is afforded by increased opportunities for interprofessional ‘seepage’ and a sharing of complementary perspectives, and for joint education and training. This review suggests that policy-driven solutions to the challenges facing integrated community mental health care may be needed and concludes with an overview of the prospects for change contained in the previous UK government’s Green Paper, ‘Developing Partnerships in Mental Health’...|$|E
40|$|We present high {{signal-to-noise}} galaxy-galaxy lensing {{measurements of}} the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey constant mass (CMASS) sample using 250 deg(2) of weak-lensing data from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey. We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogues trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and twodimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 2040 per cent larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust {{to a variety of}} systematic effects. Lowering the value of S- 8 = sigma(8) root Omega(m) / 0. 3 compared to Planck Collaboration XIII reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement (r < 10 h(- 1) Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos and modifications to general relativity on Delta Sigma and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effect of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge <b>facing</b> <b>joint</b> lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions. COPYRIGHT 2017 The Authors...|$|E

40|$|Part I: Surgical Tool Design. The primary {{objective}} of this thesis was {{the development of a}} surgical tool to implant a specialized micro-scale sensor into the anterior chamber of a mouse eye. The sensor measures intra-ocular pressure continuously under normal living conditions, creating a measurement system that is needed in the field of Glaucoma research. The sensor has a complex geometry comprised of both compliant and non-compliant materials, and requires careful handling. ^ Previously, the surgical procedure required three separate tools; a knife, a syringe and needle, and forceps. That procedure suffered from issues of ease of use, efficiency, safety and reliability. The objective was to design, fabricate, and test a single unified tool that could perform all necessary surgical functions. The motivation for unifying the toolset into a single device was primarily to improve surgical efficiency and ease of use. ^ The development of the surgical tool faced a number of different challenges. These issues pertained to creating a sharp cutting instrument within unusual geometrical constraints, loading the sensor into a narrow tube, delivering both fluid and an object through the same tube, optimizing dimensions against competing constraints, and satisfying the ergonomic needs of the surgeon. ^ Two generations of prototypes were fabricated and tested. The second generation prototype was comprised of three telescoping tubes, each with a specific function. All three surgical steps were successfully carried out on a cadaver pig eye, with minor complications in the handling of the tool. Due to inherent design constraints in the implant and available materials, the size of the tool is likely more appropriate for the anatomy of a larger animal. ^ Part II: The Effects of Leg Morphology on Running Performance. The secondary {{objective of this}} thesis was to explore how differences in joint morphology impact the dynamics and energetics of running. An analysis was completed on the effects of kinematic knee orientation on legged locomotion, specifically simple running patterns. ^ The analysis compared the dynamics of a forward facing knee found in humans, a rear facing ankle found in birds, and a linear knee found in pogo sticks and simple robots. ^ The equations of motion for the models reveal that joint orientation has a direct effect on the dynamics of the system. The early simulation results show that leg morphology directly effects deflection and force patterns, which in turn effects the trajectory of the system. In forward <b>facing</b> <b>joints,</b> hip torque increases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of higher compliance in the leg. In rear <b>facing</b> <b>joints,</b> hip torque decreases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of lower compliance in the leg. The results suggest that a forward <b>facing</b> knee <b>joint</b> found in humans is more energy efficient than a rear <b>facing</b> ankle <b>joint</b> found in birds. ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDermatomyositis (DM) is a multisystem {{inflammatory}} disorder primarily {{affecting the}} skin and muscles. Its pathophysiology is still very poorly understood, but humoral and cellular immune dysregulation is apparent. Diagnosis of DM is based on five criteria: proximal limb muscle weakness, serum muscle enzyme elevation, histopathologic muscle abnormalities on muscle biopsy, electromyographic abnormalities, and clinical inflammatory dermatological manifestations (heliotrope rash, poikiloderma, and inflammatory lesions on the hands and <b>facing</b> <b>joints).</b> DM is frequently associated with certain cancers, and may appear before, concurrent with, or after diagnosis of cancer. DM {{has been reported to}} be associated with approximately one per 1000 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Treatment is based on long-course nonselective immunosuppression, particularly corticosteroids, by general route, even when malignancy is present, but new-targeted therapies may modify the treatment strategy in the near future. Despite iatrogenic immunosuppression, the prognosis of nasopharyngeal cancer is not worse in patients with paraneoplastic DM. We report one case as an illustration of this paraneoplastic course (evolving in parallel with the cancer), and to make an update on the state of knowledge on paraneoplastic DM in such cancers...|$|R

In this work, we explore using identification signals to supervise one CNN and the combination of semi-verification and identification to train the other one. In order to estimate semi-verification loss at a low computation cost, a circle, which is composed of all faces, is used for selecting face pairs from pairwise samples. In the process of face normalization, we propose using different landmarks of faces {{to solve the problems}} caused by poses. In addition, the final face representation is formed by the concatenating feature of each deep CNN after principal component analysis (PCA) reduction. Furthermore, each feature is a combination of multi-scale representations through making use of auxiliary classifiers.

Liquidity risk matters in an imperfect capital market where interim losses on a futures position {{have to be}} financed at a borrowing rate that {{is higher than the}} risk-free rate.

This paper analyzes the optimal risk management and production decisions of a risk-averse firm that <b>faces</b> <b>joint</b> price and liquidity risk and can trade derivatives in unbiased markets. Its main contribution is to provide a rationale for the use of futures and options on futures in imperfect capital markets for risk management purposes. The analytical results show that there is a hedging role for option on futures: If liquidity risk materializes, the firm sells options on futures in order to partly cover this liquidity need. The additional exposure to price risk created by the options position is partly offset by an adjustment of the futures position. Otherwise, no options are traded and the optimal futures position is a full hedge. Numerical results show that the existence of liquidity risk reduces the optimal futures hedge ratio and that options are not normally used before a liquidity need actually arises.
