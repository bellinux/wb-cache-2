On physical examination, a goose-egg sized tumor was palpable in the left flank region. Drip infusion pyelography and computerized tomographic scan showed left retroperitoneal tumor which deviated the left <b>kidney</b> upwards. Percutaneous <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of the tumor revealed no malignancy. Total resection of the tumor was performed subsequently. A yellowish solid tumor was macroscopically encapsulated by fibrous tissue, weighed 230 g and 6 x 7 x 10 cm. Histopathological diagnosis was malignant schwannoma. After operation, the hematuria stopped without any treatment and deviation of the left kidney was improved. Soft tissue tumor should be treated by adjuvant chemotherapy with irradiation because of its high frequency of recurrence and metastasis.

40|$|Two {{patients}} with arteriovenous fistulas {{of the native}} <b>kidney</b> occurring after <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> were evaluated using duplex and color Doppler ultrasonography. The first patient had a fistula with associated pseudoaneurysm: color Doppler showed the lesion as a small rounded area with whirling flow; spectral analysis allowed recognition of both the afferent artery with low impedance flow and the draining vein with pulsatile, arterialized flow. The second patient had a normal color Doppler study; however, spectral analysis demonstrated signals with low vascular impedance from an intra-parenchymal artery at the lower pole, and a jet of turbulent flow. Following disappearance of clinical findings, such Doppler abnormalities were no longer detectable. When a iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula is considered on clinical grounds, both color and Doppler spectral analysis of waveforms from intra-parenchymal vessels should be performed. Possibly, further advances in color Doppler technology will {{permit the use of}} this examination as the first imaging procedure in these clinical situations...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{probability}} of anaplastic transformation in a differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is < 2 %. Admixture of DTC and undifferentiated carcinoma can occasionally {{be found in}} thyroidectomy specimens, or the undifferentiated tumor may develop in metastatic foci months or years after removal of the primary tumor. Case Anaplastic transformation of a metastatic DTC was diagnosed at autopsy in a 71 -yearold female. At {{the time of her}} total thyroidectomy for follicular carcinoma, she already had several lung nodules, which diminished in size upon 131 I treatment. Five years later the patient developed a new, pleura-based lung mass. The mass extended along the paraspinal soft tissue and involved the <b>kidney.</b> Fine <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>biopsy</b> of the paraspinal mass resulted in a diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Two months later the patient died. Histologic evaluation of the lung nodules and pleura-based mass revealed areas of follicular carcinoma intermixed with a various patterns of undifferentiated carcinoma. The paraspinal and kidney mass consisted entirely of anaplastic tumor, including areas of squamoid differentiation. Conclusion: In patients with a history of DTC who develop a rapidly growing mass elsewhere, a possibility of metastatic DTC with anaplastic transformation must be considere...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transrectal ultrasound-guided repeat <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (TUGRNB) {{is widely}} used for {{diagnosis}} of prostate cancer (PCa). However, significance of TUGRNB in Chinese population was rarely reported. A retrospective {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the significance of TUGRNB applied in prediction of PCa in Chinese population. Materials and Methods: A total of 960 from January 2009 to December 2012 were included. Repeat <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> rate and PCa positive detection rate were evaluated. Relationship between prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and PCa positive rates was analyzed. Results: PCa positive detection rate after initial <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was 28. 4 %, which was lower than the rate of repeat <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (40 %). The rate for immediate transurethral resection (TUR), surgery after initial <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> was 27. 1 %, however with a low PCa positive detection rate (0. 66 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite known {{benefits}} to <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> for suspicious breast lesions, {{variability in the}} use of this technique has been documented in practice. We sought to study the use of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and open surgical biopsy in women with breast cancer, predictors of <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use, and the effect of biopsy choice on overall number of surgical procedures needed to treat breast cancer. METHODS: We analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare data for 45, 542 women diagnosed between 1991 and 1999 with ductal carcinoma in situ and stage I-II breast cancer. By using diagnosis and procedure codes from 3 months before to 6 months after the SEER diagnosis, we classified the initial <b>biopsy</b> as <b>needle</b> or surgical. By using multivariate logistic regression, we identified patient and tumor characteristics associ-ated with <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use, and estimated the association between initial biopsy type and likelihood for multiple breast surgeries. RESULTS: <b>Needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was the initial procedure for 11, 073 (24. 3 %) women. In multivariate analyses, <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use varied significantly by race, year of diagnosis, and tumor size. Af-ter controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> use was associated with a reduced like-lihood of multiple breast surgeries (odds ratio, 0. 35; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 34 - 0. 37).

40|$|Stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> is {{increasingly}} replacing needle-localized breast biopsy for {{the diagnosis of}} nonpalpable breast disease. In this prospective study, {{the impact of the}} introduction of this technique on diagnosis and surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer was assessed in two hospitals in The Netherlands. A total of 84 patients with nonpalpable breast cancer, diagnosed by means of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (<b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group) were compared with 80 patients diagnosed with nonpalpable breast cancer before the introduction of large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> These patients were diagnosed by means of needle-localized open breast biopsy (control group). Clinical outcome measures evaluated included: duration of diagnostic and therapeutic intervals and number of surgical procedures required for complete surgical treatment. Subgroup analysis was performed for the category of microcalcifications without tissue distortion. For the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group, the median interval between initial referral to the surgeon and the availability of histological diagnosis was 9 days and the interval between initial referral and complete surgical treatment was 31 days. These intervals were significantly longer for the control group (19 days and 44 days respectively); 75 % of patients in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group were treated in a single step surgical procedure compared to 16 % of the patients in the control group (67 vs 25 % respectively for the subgroup). The mean number of surgical procedures required to complete surgical treatment was 1. 31 for <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group vs 1. 91 for the open biopsy group (1. 46 vs 1. 84 for the subgroup). Introduction of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> leads to a reduction of the time to diagnosis and the time to complete surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer. It also reduces the number of surgical procedures required for complete surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer.

40|$|Background: One of {{the alleged}} {{advantages}} of stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> of non-palpable breast lesions is that it entails less inconvenience for the patient. In this prospective study, {{the quality of life}} of patients undergoing large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> was compared with that of patients undergoing open breast biopsy prior to learning the definitive diagnosis. Methods: Thirty patients with non-palpable breast lesions underwent stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> as initial diagnostic procedure (<b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group). Quality of life as perceived by these patients was compared with that of 27 patients who underwent open breast biopsy as initial diagnostic procedure (control group), Both groups completed quality of life questionnaires (EuroQol and SF- 36) 1 day before and 4 days after the diagnostic intervention. Results: One day before the diagnostic procedure, the overall estimate for quality of life (measured with the EuroQol) was slightly higher in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group than in the control group (73 versus 69 resp.). Four days after the diagnostic procedure, the quality of life score remained approximately unchanged in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group, but was reduced in the control group (71 versus 61 resp.). Results of the SF- 36 questionnaire demonstrated that patients in the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> group had higher quality of life scores on physical functioning, physical performance, pain and social performance after the diagnostic intervention. Conclusion: Stereotactic large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> seems to affect quality of life to a lesser extent than open breast biopsy. This difference is mainly attributable to a reduction of physical discomfort and pain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: Gleason scores, as {{determined}} by 18 -gauge core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> (NB), were compared with both Gleason scores and the pathological staging of corresponding radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. The goal was to evaluate the clinical implication and the prognostic impact of these discrepancies. Methods: Records of 234 consecutive patients undergoing a radical retro pubic prostatectomy between 2001 and 2012 were reviewed. In total, all our patients were enrolled, al 1 {{of whom had been}} diagnosed with adenocarcinoma by transrectal <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> using an 18 -gauge automated spring-loaded biopsy gun. Results: Grading errors were greatest with wel 1 -differentiated tumors. The accuracy was 18 (23 %) for Gleason scores of 2 - 4 on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Of the 108 evaluable patients with Gleason scores of 5 - 7 on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy,</b> 84 (78 %) were graded correctly. All of the Gleason scores of 8 - 10 on <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> were graded correctly. 54 of 162 patients (33 %), with a biopsy Gleason score of < 7 had their cancer upgraded to above 7. Tumors in 18 patients (60 %) with both a Gleason score < 7 on the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and a Gleason score of 7 for the prostatectomy specimen were confined to the prostate. Conclusion: The potential for grading errors is greatest with well-differentiated tumors and in patients with a Gleason score of < 7 on the <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Predictions using Gleason scores are sufficiently accurate to warrant its use with all <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies,</b> recognizing that the potential for grading errors is greatest with well-differentiated tumors...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{accuracy}} of an image guided percutaneous core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> (PCNB), using ultrasound or computed tomography, to PCNB without image guidance in the diagnosis of palpable soft tissue tumours.

40|$|For the {{evaluation}} of non-palpable lesions of the breast, image-guided large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsies</b> are increasingly replacing needle-localized open breast biopsies. In this study, the diagnostic accuracy of this minimally invasive technique was evaluated by reviewing the available literature. Five cohort studies were included in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity rate, histological agreement between <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> and subsequent surgery or long-term mammographic follow-up and clinical consequences for different disease prevalences were assessed. The sensitivity rate of large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> for the diagnosis of breast cancer was high (97 %). The reclassified agreement rate between core biopsy and subsequent surgical biopsy or long-term mammographic follow-up was also high (94 %). In case of 20 % breast cancer prevalence among women referred after screening (as in the US), {{the risk of breast}} cancer despite benign large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> result is less than 1 %. In European countries, however, prevalence of breast cancer among referred women is 60 – 70 %. This would result in a risk of breast cancer despite benign large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> result of 4 – 6 %. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the image guided large-core <b>needle</b> <b>biopsy</b> is a promising alternative for the <b>needle</b> localized breast <b>biopsy.</b> However, additional research is needed to explore the limiting factors of the technique.
