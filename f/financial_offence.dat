In this paper by defining two indices for money laundering, the effects of money laundering shocks on macroeconomic variables (economic growth, income inequity, and government expenditure) have been evaluated by the Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) Method during 1984 - 2009. Results of the VECM method show an increase in money laundering indices (the rate of crime and number of black markets) can decrease economic growth, raise income inequity and government expenditure in the Iranian economy...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{financial}} crisis, various supra-national initiatives have targeted banking and corporate secrecy, the conventional underpinnings of the illicit Global Wealth Chains through which money from tax evasion, corruption and other <b>financial</b> <b>offences</b> are passed across borders. This paper analyses the varying {{impact of these}} initiatives on the diverse types of Wealth Chains running through two stereotypical havens, Liechtenstein and the Seychelles, and one G 20 /OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) member rarely associated with illicit financial flows, Australia. Recent campaigns have {{had a significant impact}} on illicit Global Wealth Chains connected to micro-state tax havens, while leaving those to Australia unaffected. Even with reference to the micro-state havens, however, outside regulatory shifts have in some cases changed the flow or form of Wealth Chains by unintentionally creating new opportunities for offshore finance. Evidence is drawn from interviews and fieldwork in all three countries, secretly recorded footage of intermediaries explaining the workings of illicit Wealth Chains, and corporate and property records collected by a private investigator engaged by the author.

40|$|The Government of Indonesia (GOI) {{has been}} proposing a draft act on {{financial}} service regulatory authority, called Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK hereafter). In {{the aftermath of}} 1998 Asian crisis, {{the establishment of the}} institution was mandated through Bank Indonesia Act (Indonesia’s central bank bill) in 1999, which was later updated in 2004. According to the draft act, the OJK has been designed using an integrated approach, which is similar to the arrangement of FSA in the UK. This paper aims to examine the feasibility of establishing OJK. The existing financial supervision suffers from several problems: a) the quality of supervisions tend to be heterogeneous among the financial supervision bodies, b) there is a gap in supervision, whereby thousand of non-banking financial institutions have not been supervised properly, and c) <b>financial</b> <b>offences</b> have been flourishing in inter market transactions. We found that the establishment of OJK, however, would not minimize, let alone, resolve the problems above. The draft act has not proposed a mechanism on how to address these very issues. We estimated the minimum irreducible costs of establishing and operating OJK and found that the costs are paramount. According to the draft act, the costs would burden all financial institutions and obviously this creates complexity in financing OJK. Finally, two alternative approaches have been proposed in order to improve the feasibility and the effectiveness of the OJK by considering the structure of financial sector supervision in Indonesia. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There is an {{increasing}} probability that the psychiatrist will, willingly or not, {{come into contact with}} mentally ill offenders {{in the course of their}} practice. There are increasing rates of violence, substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders that are of legal importance. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the rates of different mental disorders in 100 court reports and to investigate the characteristics of mentally ill offenders. Methods All cases referred from different departments of the legal system to the forensic committee for assessment of legal accountability over 13 -months duration were included. A specially designed form was prepared for data collection. Cases were classified into five groups: murder, robbery, <b>financial</b> <b>offences,</b> violent and simple offences and a group for other offences. Data were subjected to statistical analysis and comparisons between different groups of subjects were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results Men constituted 93 % of cases. In all, 73 % of offenders were younger than 40 years old. Schizophrenia cases made up 13 % of the total, substance related cases constituted 56 % and amphetamine cases alone made up 21 %; 10 % of cases were antisocial personality disorders, and 51 % of cases were classified as having a low education level. Unemployment was found in 34 % of cases. The final decision of the forensic committee was full responsibility in 46 % of cases and partial responsibility in 11 % of cases, with 33 % considered non-responsible. A total of 58 % of cases had had contact with psychiatric healthcare prior to the offence and in 9 % of cases contact had been in the previous 12 weeks. A history of similar offences was found in 32 % of cases. In all, 14 % of the offences were murders, 8 % were sexual crimes, and 31 % were violent/simple crimes. Conclusions The ability of the legal system to detect cases was good, while the ability of the healthcare system to predict crimes and offences was weak, as 58 % of cases had had previous contact with the healthcare system previously. Substance abuse, especially amphetamine abuse, played an important role. </p...|$|R

We test whether licencing policies aimed at restricting its spatial and/or temporal availability, including cumulative impact zones, {{are associated with}} reductions in alcohol-related crime. Methods: Reported crimes at English lower tier local authority (LTLA) level were {{used to calculate the}} rates of reported crimes including alcohol-attributable rates of sexual offences and violence against a person, and public order <b>offences.</b> <b>Financial</b> fraud was included as a control crime not directly associated with alcohol abuse. Each area was classified as to its cumulative licensing policy intensity for 2009 – 2015 and categorised as ‘passive’, low, medium or high. Crime rates adjusted for area deprivation, outlet density, alcohol-related hospital admissions and population size at baseline were analysed using hierarchical (log-rate) growth modelling. Results: 284 of 326 LTLAs could be linked and had complete data. From 2009 to 2013 alcohol-related violent and sexual crimes and public order offences rates declined faster in areas with more ‘intense’ policies (about 1. 2, 0. 10 and 1. 7 per 1000 people compared with 0. 6, 0. 01 and 1. 0 per 1000 people in ‘passive’ areas, respectively). Post- 2013, the recorded rates increased again. No trends were observed for financial fraud.

The monograph provides insights into the history of establishment and development of the State Revenue Service in the period of 20 years. Since many essential changes have occurred, the State Revenue Service from a bureaucratic and hierarchical organisation has developed into a modern, open and customer-centric European level service and control institution. Voluntary fulfilment of customs and tax obligations that promotes public loyalty towards tax system and the importance of successful implementation of tax policies have been stressed in many articles included in the monograph. Using modern methods of analysis of social sciences, within the monograph such issues as the performance of the Latvian state in the field of customs administration, tax administration and the fight against criminal offences have been analysed. The first paper is dedicated to the review of the development of customs and tax education, and analysis of successful cooperation between Riga Technical University and the State Revenue Service uniting academic and professional achievements. The second article provides an overview of the most essential achievements in the field of tax administration, paying particular attention to the measures aimed at reorganisation, performance improvement, introduction of risk management mechanisms, administrative load reduction and improvement of customer service quality. The third paper reviews the issues of development of the Latvian Customs Service, in turn, the fourth article is dedicated to the institutional issues regarding crack down on <b>financial</b> and customs <b>offences.</b> Analytical assessment of performance efficiency of the Latvian State Revenue Service as well as future challenges and perspectives in the three basic fields has been made in all sections.

40|$|Manipulacija z vrednostnimi papirji je zagotovo ena hujših zlorab trga z vrednostnimi papirji in je zakonsko prepovedana. Kazenskopravno varstvo manipulacije z vrednostnimi papirji na trgu vrednostnih papirjev ureja Kazenski zakonik (KZ- 1) v 239. členu (zloraba trga finančnih instrumentov). Kot manipulativni pa je moč označiti tudi dejanji po 231. (preslepitve pri poslovanju z vrednostnimi papirji) in 238. (zloraba notranje informacije) členu KZ- 1. Kaznivo dejanje zlorabe trga finančnih instrumentov po novem 239. členu KZ- 1 bistveno povzema definicijo tržne manipulacije prvega odstavka 374. člena Zakona o trgu finančnih instrumentov (ZTFI). Z določenimi vsebinskimi kot tudi jezikovnimi spremembami kaznivih dejanj po 231. in 238. členu KZ- 1 pa se je pojmu manipulacije z vrednostnimi papirji le še približalo. Prekrškovno varstvo manipulacije z vrednostnimi papirji je urejeno v ZTFI, sankcija za ta prekršek pa je globa. Pri tem se zakonski znaki kaznivih dejanj po 231., 238. in 239. členu KZ- 1 popolnoma prekrivajo z zakonskimi znaki prekrška po: petem odstavku 556. člena ZTFI v povezavi s 4. točko prvega odstavka 556. člena ZTFI 1. in 2. točki prvega odstavka 566. člena ZTFIčetrtem odstavku 566. člena ZTFI v povezavi s 374. členom ZTFI. Zakonodajalec bi moral to neskladje odpraviti. Kazenskopravno kot tudi prekrškovno varstvo manipulacije z vrednostnimi papirji pa ni dovolj učinkovito. Velik problem predstavlja dokazovanje protipravnosti ravnanj manipulatorjev. Z optimalnejšo politiko regulacije tega problematičnega področja kot je sprememba sankcij za ta dejanja, uvedba obrnjenega dokaznega bremena, upoštevanje strokovnih mnenj in predlogov pri opisih kaznivih dejanj manipulacije ipd., bi pripomogli k učinkovitejšemu varstvu. Manipulacija z vrednostnimi papirji je kljub zakonski prepovedi v praksi še vedno pogost pojav.

Furthermore, the acts described by the 231 th (swindling in the trade with securities) and the 238 th (misuse of inside information) articles of the same Penal Code can be also interpreted as market manipulation. The criminal act of financial market abuse in the new 239 th article of the Penal Code closely depicts the definition of the market manipulation described by the first paragraph of the 374 th article of the Slovenian Financial Market Law. With certain changes in content and language, the 231 th and the 238 th article of the Penal Code became even closer to the exact definition of the manipulation of <b>financial</b> markets. Minor <b>offences</b> resulting from <b>financial</b> market manipulation are covered by the Slovenian Financial Market Law and are sanctioned by a money fine. Here, the signs of the criminal acts according to the articles 231 th, 238 th and 239 th of the Penal Code directly correspond to the signs of minor offences covered by the fifth paragraph of the 556 th article of the Financial Market Law in connection with the fourth point of the first paragraph of the 556 th article of the Financial Market Lawfirst and second points of the first paragraph of the 566 th article of the Financial Market Law and the fourth paragraph of the 566 th article of the Financial Market Law in connection with the 374 th article of the same act. The lawmaker should therefore abolish these inconsistencies. Criminal offence as well as minor offence protection against the manipulation in the financial markets is however insufficient. A big problem in this context is the proving of the illegal acts of manipulators. With optimized regulation of this problematic area, e. g. change of sanctions for these acts, introduction of reverse burden of proof procedure, consideration of expert opinions and proposals in description of criminal acts of manipulation, etc., we would improve the protection that should be provided by these laws. The financial markets manipulation is still a frequent phenomenon in practice despite the enforcement of corresponding laws. This is evident from numerous cases, which reflect the dangers that market manipulation represents to economic interests of each country...|$|R
