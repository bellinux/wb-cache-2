Initially, the relationship between <b>individual</b> <b>axis</b> errors and contour error is discussed, including insights into the different reasons for implementing CCILC versus <b>individual</b> <b>axis</b> ILC. A Norm Optimal (N. O.) framework is used to design optimal learning filters based on design objectives. The general N.

The weighting approach of this framework enables one to focus on <b>individual</b> <b>axis</b> or contour tracking independently. The performance benefits of N. O.

The Microgravity Analysis Workstation quasi-steady environment calculation and comparison of this calculation with Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment data {{was used to assess}} how appropriate a planned attitude was expected to be for one Crystal Growth Facility experiment sample. The microgravity environment related to several different Orbiter, crew, and experiment operations is presented and interpreted in this report. Data are examined to show the effects of vernier reaction control system jet firings for Orbiter attitude control. This is compared to examples of data when no thrusters were firing, when the primary reaction control system jets were used for attitude control, and when single vernier jets were fired for test purposes. In general, vernier jets, when used for attitude control, cause accelerations in the 3 x 10 (exp - 4) g to 7 x 10 (exp - 4) g range. Primary jets used in this manner cause accelerations in the 0. 01 to 0. 025 g range. Other significant disturbance sources characterized are water dump operations, with Y(sub b) <b>axis</b> <b>acceleration</b> deviations of about 1 x 10 (exp - 6) g; payload bay door opening motion, with Y(sub o) and Z(sub o) <b>axis</b> <b>accelerations</b> of frequency 0. 4 Hz; and probable Glovebox fan operations with notable frequency components at 20, 38, 43, 48, and 53 Hz.

The gradual inclusion of ordinary and dark matters results in an everywhere, but near the origin, smoother and right shifted (along the time <b>axis)</b> <b>acceleration</b> curve. For the 3 -fluid problem, the energy density need not exhibit a plateau during the acceleration period. Much excess in the dark matter and/or ordinary matter energy densities would lead the universe to undergo an eternal deceleration expansion.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the paper}} is to present a {{methodology}} and the related instrumentation for fast energy characterization of industrial machines. Standard energy measurements prescribe acquiring power flowing into the system and into every significant subsystem of the machine using {{a considerable number of}} power meters (or repeated measurements) that determine high installation times, costs and efforts. Often, such measurements are missing additional information about machine activity, needed to understanding energy dissipations. Fast experimental characterization method proposed in the paper assumes to measure solely the total power absorbed by the machine and to estimate the consumptions of machine subsystems by acquiring additional signals, e. g. states and variables, via a newly developed wireless, non-invasive measurement system. Knowledge of these states allows to create an intermediate-precision energy models of the system. A case study is performed to identify and analyse such model of axis in an industrial robot.

A body axis is newly introduced as a trajectory-planning coordinate {{in order to meet}} the position and the velocity matching conditions for a smooth grasp of the fast-maneuvering object. Using the position of the object and the end-effector in the inertia <b>axis,</b> the <b>acceleration</b> commands are generated in the X-, Y-, and Z-directions of the body <b>axis</b> and the <b>acceleration</b> commands are modified considering the torque and the velocity constraints. The trajectory planning in the X-direction becomes the speed planning to achieve the maximum speed, whereas the trajectory planning in the Y- and Z-directions becomes the direction planning where a missile-guidance algorithm is employed to intercept the maneuvering object. Finally, the acceleration commands in the body axis are transformed into the angle commands of the end-effector in the joint axis, which is used as the actual trajectory commands in robot arms.
