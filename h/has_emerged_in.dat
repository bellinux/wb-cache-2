5|$|Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's <b>has</b> <b>emerged,</b> <b>in</b> which {{biological}} {{vulnerability and}} adverse environmental events {{are seen to}} interact. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{collecting}} enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory regains {{the power}} to transform into a comet, and flies to {{the centre of the}} universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that his plan is to rule the entire universe with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach, but Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming everything nearby. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The black hole collapses into a singularity and explodes in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, revealing that dying stars are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, full with all of the creatures he had met in the galaxies, alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the skies.|$|E
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E

25|$|When the USSR was {{dissolved}} {{in the same}} year, Moscow remained {{the capital of the}} Russian SFSR (on December 25, 1991 the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation).

25|$|Though polarized, a {{political}} consensus <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Vancouver around {{a number of}} issues. Protection of urban parks, {{a focus on the}} development of rapid transit as opposed to a freeway system, a harm-reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the political spectrum in Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|The Syrah-dominated appellations (AOCs) of {{northern}} Rhône have, {{like most other}} French appellations and regions, no tradition of varietal labeling of their wines. Indeed, such practices are generally disallowed under AOC rules, and only the AOC name (such as Cote-Rotie, Crozes-Hermitage or Hermitage) appears on the label. Varietal labeling of Syrah/Shiraz wines is therefore a practice which <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the New World, and primarily in Australia.|$|E

25|$|A growing {{population}} of nearly half million Chinese Americans now live on Long Island. Rapidly expanding Chinatowns have developed in Brooklyn (布魯克林) and Queens (皇后), with Chinese immigrants also moving into Nassau County, as did earlier European immigrants, {{such as the}} Irish and Italians. More recently, a Little India (लघु भारत) community <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Hicksville, Nassau County, spreading eastward from the more established Little India enclaves in Queens.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of postcolonial literature {{is that by}} focusing much on the distinct culture of the colonized, it seems to ignore the vast human rights violation {{that many of the}} cultural practices contain in them. Culture cannot be unquestionable as there are universal human rights, which should be respected, and to term everything that <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the West, such as the ideals of liberty, as a negative colonial legacy, is a far-fetched proposition.|$|E
25|$|Radiographers, {{also known}} as radiologic technologists, {{diagnostic}} radiographers and medical radiation technologists are healthcare professionals who specialise in the imaging of human anatomy for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} pathology. Radiographers are infrequently, and almost always erroneously, known as x-ray technicians. In countries which use the title radiologic technologist they are often informally referred to as techs in the clinical environment; this phrase <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> popular culture such as television programmes.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of traffic police in some local departments, all police officers carry small firearms and batons. A criticism that <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> recent years is that police officers generally do not carry any nonlethal weapons aside from batons such as tasers or pepper spray, limiting their options when dealing with violent criminals. Police in Taiwan have sometimes been known to fire warning shots or at the legs of fleeing suspects, though this practice has reportedly decreased in recent years.|$|E
25|$|In June 2017 {{after seven}} months of not {{receiving}} a response from Pope Francis to their request that he clarify highly disputed parts in his apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia (The Joy of Love), four cardinals asked Francis for an audience in April but the Pope has yet to respond, it <b>has</b> <b>emerged.</b> <b>In</b> an April 25 letter hand-delivered to the Holy Father on May 6, Cardinals Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller, Burke and Joachim Meisner wrote to Francis asking for an audience, having received no response to the dubia they sent him on Sept 2016.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} pattern <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> criminal cases. In criminal cases, {{the prosecution}} has {{the burden of proof}} and uses a host of forensic science methods as evidence to prove their case. But, Daubert motions are rarely made by criminal defendants and when they do, they lose a majority of the challenges. Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that Daubert has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts in criminal cases.|$|E
