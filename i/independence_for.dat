40|$|The Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure <b>for</b> Children (WeeFIM) is {{a simple}} tool for {{assessing}} the functional independence of three domains: mobility, self-care, and cognition. Children are usually apprehensive about performing standardized structured language or developmental tests, and only licensed professionals can administer standardized tests. We attempted to apply the Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure <b>for</b> Children for assessing children with developmental delay and to assess for any correlation of these scores with standardized language tests. We recruited 49 children with developmental delay, and the Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure <b>for</b> Children was administered. Two standardized language tests (Symbolic Play Test and Reynell Language Developmental Scale) were administered to assess language age. There was a significant correlation between Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure <b>for</b> Children scores with both verbal comprehension age and verbal expression age. There was no correlation of Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure <b>for</b> Children scores with gender, age, or having domestic helpers. Having trained staff administer the Functional <b>Independence</b> Measure <b>for</b> Children can reliably correlate the current language ability {{of a child with}} developmental delay; thus, the test {{can be used as a}} quick screening tool for targeted training. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|All three {{leaders were}} the descendents of Hova {{who had been}} {{politically}} prominent in the former Merina royal court. The movement was pacifist, and while it sought <b>independence</b> <b>for</b> Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island {{as part of the}} global Francophone economic and cultural community. Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly. The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill to liberate Madagascar from French rule, but French deputies rejected it.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1962 that Australia voted for a UN {{resolution}} condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister Garfield Barwick. Initially in opposition, until he was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a vocal advocate of <b>independence</b> <b>for</b> Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, were active internationally in their support of <b>independence</b> <b>for</b> Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia {{was involved in the}} UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia. Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978, and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.|$|E
