5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of time and they should return to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Ron Swanson {{had been}} {{director}} of Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{for six years}} at the time Parks and Recreation began. A staunch Libertarian, with a distinctive mustache, Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government; despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of taxpayer money. Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government. Ron puts almost no effort into his job, and lets his deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do {{the vast majority of}} the work.|$|E

This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other biohazardous waste before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces used to incinerate and kill off any micro organisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.|$|E

There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> weir next to it, and just west of Binnewater Road is a reservoir that was used to keep the canal full during dry stretches. The slip that the company built for Snyder is also intact, and is possibly the only remaining slip from the original construction along {{the entire length of the}} former canal.|$|E
25|$|Sign {{epistasis}} {{occurs when}} one mutation has {{the opposite effect}} when {{in the presence of}} another mutation. This occurs when a mutation that is deleterious on its own can enhance the effect of a particular beneficial mutation. For example, a large and complex brain <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of energy without a range of sense organs, however sense organs can be more useful if the organism's brain is better able to process the information.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} {{can be used}} {{to allow}} an organism to use a cheaper substrate such as glycerol instead of glucose. Because fermentation processes require glucose derived from foods, butanol production can negatively impact food supply (see food vs fuel debate). Glycerol is a good alternative source for butanol production. While glucose sources are valuable and limited, glycerol is abundant and has a low market price because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product of biodiesel production. Butanol production from glycerol is economically viable using metabolic pathways that exist in Clostridium pasteurianum bacterium.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of time.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the government's assurances that seats will be increased in the institutes so that the general category students don't get affected, another point raised against reservation {{is that most of}} the seats reserved for SC/ST candidates remain empty and hence any more reservation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of resources. A major concern among them is also the fact that implementing reservation in institutes of higher education would be difficult unless the quality of faculty in them is diluted. They back this point by the fact that all IITs and IIMs are facing shortage of faculty and hence increasing the seats will lead to deterioration of education. For example, while IIT Kharagpur requires 667 faculties, it currently has only 470. Similarly, IIT Bombay has just 401 faculties as against the required 529.|$|E
25|$|Zeolites have uses in {{advanced}} reprocessing methods, where their micro-porous ability to capture some ions while allowing others to pass freely, allowing many fission products to be efficiently removed from nuclear waste and permanently trapped. Equally important are the mineral properties of zeolites. Their alumino-silicate construction is extremely durable and resistant to radiation even in porous form. Additionally, {{once they are}} loaded with trapped fission products, the zeolite-waste combination can be hot pressed into an extremely durable ceramic form, closing the pores and trapping the waste in a solid stone block. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> form factor that greatly reduces its hazard compared to conventional reprocessing systems. Zeolites are also used {{in the management of}} leaks of radioactive materials. For example, {{in the aftermath of the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, sandbags of zeolite were dropped into the seawater near the power plant to adsorb radioactive caesium which was present in high levels.|$|E

25|$|Inequality in {{land and}} income {{ownership}} is {{negatively correlated with}} subsequent economic growth. A strong demand for redistribution will occur in societies where a large section of the population does {{not have access to}} the productive resources of the economy. Rational voters must internalize such issues. High unemployment rates have a significant negative effect when interacting with increases in inequality. Increasing inequality harms growth in countries with high levels of urbanization. High and persistent unemployment also has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Unemployment may seriously harm growth because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of resources, because it generates redistributive pressures and distortions, because it depreciates existing human capital and deters its accumulation, because it drives people to poverty, because it results in liquidity constraints that limit labor mobility, and because it erodes individual self-esteem and promotes social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies to control unemployment and reduce its inequality-associated effects can strengthen long-run growth.|$|E
