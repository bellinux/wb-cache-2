40|$|Abstractâ€”Personal Number (PN) {{service or}} <b>Follow-me</b> service allows a user to access {{telecommunication}} services with any terminals (e. g., fixed telephones or mobile phones) in any locations within the service area. To provide this feature, the PN user needs to manually register {{with a phone}} number every time he/she enters a new location. If the user forgets to register the new phone number, the incoming calls will be misrouted. To provide user-friendly <b>Follow-me</b> service, this paper proposes an Automatic <b>Follow-me</b> Service (AFS) approach that automatically updates the PN records in the <b>Follow-me</b> database. The significance of our approach is that AFS can be integrated with existing <b>Follow-me</b> databases to automate PN services offered by different PSTN service providers. We show how AFS can be implemented by using the Voice over IP and Bluetooth technologies. Then, we propose an analytic model to investigate the performance of AFS. The analytic results are validated by simulation experiments. Our study suggests how to select polling frequency to optimize the AFS performance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper gives {{preliminary}} results about {{the utilization of}} an interaction technique called <b>FOLLOW-ME</b> to fasten the selection task for teleoperation system. The implementation of an interaction between a user and a Virtual Environment (VE) in Virtual Reality (VR) may use various techniques. However, {{in the case of}} teleoperation, the interaction must be very precise and comfortable for the user. The model associated to the <b>FOLLOW-ME</b> technique splits the Virtual Environment into three zones in which a specific interaction model is used: a free manipulation zone, a scaled manipulation zone and a precise manipulation zone. Each one of the three zones is characterized by a specific interaction granularity. In the precise manipulation zone, we use the concept of virtual guides in order to assist the user to achieve his task. In this paper, our aim is to show that the <b>FOLLOW-ME</b> technique is well suited for selection in teleoperation tasks. To do this, we have first compared the <b>FOLLOW-ME</b> technique with classical interaction techniques in a virtual environment where different targets are situated at different depth and may move. The {{preliminary results}} show that our technique is more efficient than the classical Go-Go and Ray-casting techniques, in a sense that the task is more reproducible and easier to accomplish by the user. In a second stage, we use this result to design selection procedures for the ARITI tele-operation system and show that the use of <b>FOLLOW-ME</b> induces benefits for the user...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Follow-me</b> {{application}} is a sensor network based active visitor guidance system. It is easy-to-deploy and self-configurable. In the system, sensor nodes with LEDs and buttons are deployed throughout a building, {{one on the}} wall at each office doorway. They blink lights to indicate {{a path through the}} building, guiding a visitor with a "breadcrumb trail" to the destination. The most important aspect of the <b>follow-me</b> {{application is}} location-aware configuration. GPS and similar systems determine location today, but they require substantial infrastructure in the environment or on sensor nodes to locate nodes in a physical coordinate system. For many applications, logical location - the relationship of nodes with each other and their environment - can be more important than physical location. For example, distance along a road and presence of intersections may be more relevant than Euclidean coordinates for applications that track or guide drivers. We developed deployment order, a new algorithm to configure logical location in a sensor network. Deployment order exploits node deployment patterns and simple user interactions to define logical topologies in a completely distributed manner with little human input...|$|E

40|$|Interaction {{techniques}} play a {{vital role}} in virtual environments â€™ enrichment and have profound effects on the userâ€™s performance and sense of presence as well as realism of the Virtual Environment (VE). In this paper we present a new haptic guide model for object selection. It is utilized to augment the <b>Follow-Me</b> 3 D interaction technique dedicated to object selection and manipulation. The fundamental concept of the <b>Follow-Me</b> technique is to divide VE into three different zones (free manipulation, visual and haptic assistance zones). Each one of the three zones is characterized by a specific interaction granularity which defines the properties of the interaction in the concerned zone. This splitting of VE is aimed to have both precision and assistance (zones of visual and haptic guidance) near the object to reach or to manipulate and to maintain a realistic and free interaction in the VE (free manipulation zone). The haptic and visual guides assist the user in object selection.
