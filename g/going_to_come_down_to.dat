She said, 'Make sure certain people are not around when I'm there.' I said, 'No problem.' She's laying the reference for 'Ready Or Not' and then she goes into the bridge and she's crying. I see her crying. She stops and says, 'I can't do this anymore,' and leaves. A couple months later she re-joins the group. She said, 'Let's do 'Ready or Not' again 'cause I was crying. It was emotional.' She goes in the studio to do 'Ready Or Not' again. She was in there five hours doing the hook. Every hit is incredible. But we go back and say, 'There's something about that reference. I don't know if we can touch that.' We end up keeping the reference. That's what the world has come to hear. There's something about that record… That's magic." ...|$|E

Kelly tries in vain to warn the townsfolk and council of the danger, but they fail to heed and evacuate—until the mountain shows ashfall. After several attempts to find a solution, Peter declares that the lava is soon <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> like [...] "a liquid avalanche" [...] which gives Kelly the idea (due to Angel Mountain and some others nearby being snowcapped) of using a snow avalanche to stop the lava flow—at which Peter balks, until Kelly tells him of the lack of other alternatives. The two then set out skiing to planting explosives to set off a controlled avalanche to stop the flow—but in attempting to escape the resulting avalanche Peter gets buried and Kelly makes it into town to witness the result, the snow avalanche blocking off (and solidifying) the lava-flow.

40|$|There {{should be}} two normal testes {{present in the}} scrotum of a male {{to be used for}} {{breeding}} (Fig. 1). A non-castrated male with no testes present in the scrotum is a bilateral cryptorchid (i. e., a bilaterally cryptorchid individual). A male with only one testis present in the scrotum (Fig. 2) is a unilateral cryptorchid. The term cryptorchid means hidden testicle. Unilateral cryptorchidism occurs more commonly than the bilateral condition. Figure 1. Normal anatomy of the scrotum and testicles in the dog.

It is recommended to wait up to about six months of age before declaring a dog or a cat cryptorchid. The reason for the six months wait is that the inguinal rings of most dogs are closed by 6 months of age, precluding movement of the testes from the abdomen to th...|$|R
