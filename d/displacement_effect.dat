5000|$|Example {{taken from}} the Journal of Biology, Volume 3, Issue 2.:The hydrodynamics of dolphin draftingby Daniel Weihs, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.Abstract:BackgroundDrafting in {{cetaceans}} {{is defined as the}} transfer of forces between individuals without actual physical contact between them. This behavior has long been surmised to explain how young dolphin calves keep up with their rapidly moving mothers. It has recently been observed that a significant number of calves become permanently separated from their mothers during chases by tuna vessels. A study of the hydrodynamics of drafting, initiated inmechanisms causing the separation of mothers and calves during fishing-related activities, is reported here.ResultsQuantitative results are shown for the forces and moments around a pair of unequally sized dolphin-like slender bodies. These include two major effects. First, the so-called Bernoulli suction, which {{stems from the fact that}} the local pressure drops in areas of high speed, results in an attractive force between mother and calf. Second is the <b>displacement</b> <b>effect,</b> in which the motion of the mother causes the water in front to move forwards and radially outwards, and water behind the body to move forwards to replace the animal's mass. Thus, the calf can gain a 'free ride' in the forward-moving areas. Utilizing these effects, the neonate can gain up to 90% of the thrust needed to move alongside the mother at speeds of up to 2.4 m/s. A comparison with observations of eastern spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) is presented, showing savings of up to 60% in the thrust that calves require if they are to keep up with their mothers.ConclusionsA theoretical analysis, backed by observations of free-swimming dolphin schools, indicates that hydrodynamic interactions with mothers play an important role in enabling dolphin calves to keep up with rapidly moving adult school members.© 2004 Weihs; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

30|$|The <b>displacement</b> <b>effects</b> that I find {{are larger}} than those {{typically}} found in the studies on international migration. This is not surprising as the Russian immigrants from the former Soviet Union to Russia, who have the same language and similar education and training, {{are likely to be}} much closer substitutes for the local labor force in Russia than typical immigrants in Europe or the US. In addition, the obtained <b>displacement</b> <b>effects</b> {{are less likely to be}} underestimated due to the outmigration of natives from the regions affected by the immigration influx (a typical problem found in studies using spatial variation to identify the effects) as the internal migration in Russia was very low. Hence, estimates reported in this study may be considered as an upper bound on the <b>displacement</b> <b>effects</b> of migration obtained through spatial approach.|$|R

Chinese exports are defined both narrowly and more broadly to include exports from Hong Kong. We investigate whether the <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> on Asian exports differs when exports from Hong Kong and China are combined compared to the narrow case of Chinese exports only. Aggregate and disaggregated analyses are undertaken. In the latter, we explore whether the <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> varies across Asian countries and in trade with different types of countries. We find evidence of a <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> which is more pronounced in developed markets and stronger for Hong Kong and China combined. Further it is the high income Asian exporters that experienced a greater <b>displacement</b> <b>effect.</b> We also investigate whether China’s development has generated any offsetting effects on its neighbours ’ exports to China itself and find that Chinese growth has indeed increased China’s imports from the Asian countries in the sample and in particular Japan and Korea.

30|$|The <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> in {{the labor}} market captures the fact that {{employment}} generated by ALMP might displace or crowd our regular employment, which lowers the effectiveness of the instrument 24. For example, firms hire subsidized workers instead of hiring unsubsidized workers, or unsubsidized employed workers are fired and replaced by subsidized workers. In addition, the <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> also covers the fact that once the subsidy expires, the formerly subsidized worker is fired. Brown et al. (2011) illustrate that this effect can be reduced through effective targeting or tolerated if this enables long-term unemployed workers to reenter employment, regain work-routine and skills on the job, improving their longer-run employability. Often only additional jobs are subsidized, which reduces take-up rates, in order to significantly reduce displacement effects 25. Furthermore, Martin and Grubb (2001) argue that in the medium run, capital will adjust and, thereby, the <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> is only relevant in the short run.|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{statistically}} {{the existence}} of a long-run relationship between public expenditure and GNP (Wagner's Law) using data for Turkey over the period 1950 - 1990 and examines whether there is a structural break in the public expenditure series {{as a result of the}} 1974 Cyprus War (Peacock and Wiseman's <b>Displacement</b> <b>Effect</b> Hypothesis).;In the public finance literature several models have been used to explain public expenditure growth. For example, macro models such as Wagner's Law, Peacock and Wiseman's <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> hypothesis, and microeconomic (or decision process) models of public choice.;This thesis concentrates on macro models. These models try to explain the time pattern of public expenditures relative to broad aggregate variables such as GNP. In terms of macro models, the most prominent empirical generalisations about public expenditure growth are Wagner's Law and the <b>Displacement</b> <b>Effect</b> Hypothesis.;Recent developments in time series analysis, such as cointegration analysis, investigate long-run relationships between variables, which allow us to apply news tests to Wagner's Law. Using the Eagle and Granger cointegration test and Turkish time series aggregate data for the period 1950 - 1990, we find no empirical support for Wagner's Law. Recent advances in times series analysis allow us to test for {{the existence of}} a structural break in the series for public expenditure arising from the 1974 Cyprus War. The results do not support {{the existence of a}} <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> hypothesis due to the Cyprus War.;Using disaggregated data (public expenditure by economic and functional categories), Engle-Granger cointegration and causality test results provide some evidence in favour of Wagner's Law.;Finally, a synthetic approach encompassing various theories of public expenditure growth (e. g.

We show that addressing measurement error problems is crucial to estimate the <b>displacement</b> <b>effect</b> when using survey data. We find that each euro of pension wealth {{is associated with a}} 47 (61) cent decline in non-pension wealth using robust (median) regression. In the presence of biases from measurement errors and omitted (unobserved) variables, we estimate a lower bound to the true offset between 17 % and 30 %, significantly different from zero. Instrumental variables regression estimates, although less precise, suggest full displacement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{seeks to}} {{establish}} the extent of <b>displacement</b> <b>effects</b> across gaming products. This is a particularly difficult question to address with precision. To date, many studies have looked at policy changes such as {{the introduction of a}} new product into the market to assess the severity of <b>displacement</b> <b>effects.</b> However, simple before and after comparisons are invalid. One needs to know what the appropriate counterfactual {{would have been in the}} absence of the policy change - which by its very nature is unobservable. The alternative is to look at identical populations exposed to different regimes. Australia represents such a natural experiment. In Australia, Betting and Gaming legislation is determined at the state level, giving rise to some interesting differentials across states within a single country. This paper estimates a state level (fixed effects) panel data model, exploiting the intra-state differences in the portfolio of gaming products available, to estimate the extent of <b>displacement</b> <b>effects</b> across the gaming sector. The results are particularly relevant to the current UK policy debate which is focused on the potential impact on the existing market following a forthcoming, radical deregulation of the industry (with further liberalisation proposed) ...|$|R
