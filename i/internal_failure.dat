40|$|Nowadays {{the problem}} of {{interferences}} that involve railway signaling systems {{is becoming more and}} more important in some railway networks. New electrical and electronic applications in power supply increase the electromagnetic compatibility problems in particular signalling systems like the Coded Current Automatic Block (BACC), installed on about 4400 km of Italian conventional railway lines. Remaining in the sphere of a traditional 3 kV d. c. traction system and apart from its interaction with other types of system, interferences with signalling systems can be produced by the traction inverters installed on the board of the roiling stock and by the electrical substation (ESS) converters. In this paper critical working conditions of the ESS converters, due to the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>failures,</b> will be analysed.

40|$|Recent work on hot-potato routing [1] has {{uncovered}} that large transit ASs can {{be sensitive to}} hot-potato disruptions.

50|$|The {{spurious}} trip level represents asset loss {{due to an}} <b>internal</b> <b>failure</b> of {{the safety}} function. The more financial damage the safety function can cause due to a spurious trip the higher the STL level of the safety function should be. Each company needs to decide for themselves which level of financial loss they can or are willing to take. This actually depends on many different factors including the financial strength of the company, the insurance policy they have, the cost of process shutdown and startup, and so on. All these factors are unique to each company. The table below shows {{an example of how}} a company can calibrate its spurious trip levels.|$|E

50|$|Electromigration {{occurs when}} some of the {{momentum}} of a moving electron is transferred to a nearby activated ion. This causes the ion to move from its original position. Over time this force knocks a significant number of atoms far from their original positions. A break or gap can develop in the conducting material, preventing the flow of electricity. In narrow interconnect conductors, such as those linking transistors and other components in integrated circuits, this is known as a void or <b>internal</b> <b>failure</b> open circuit. Electromigration can also cause the atoms of a conductor to pile up and drift toward other nearby conductors, creating an unintended electrical connection known as a hillock failure or whisker failure (short circuit). Both of these situations can lead to a malfunction of the circuit.|$|E

50|$|Inspection can {{represent}} {{a significant percentage}} of an existing product's manufacturing cost. DFI may naturally be called for in redesign of a product to reduce that cost component when it is high. However, DFI will not always reduce inspection costs: it can also lead to increased rate of inspection, because more convenient or higher quality measurement may justify increasing measurements, say from a sampling rate satisfactory to support a basic level of tolerance to a higher rate (e.g. to 100%). Or DFI may make it economical for 100% inspections to measure more features or to make repeated measures of the same feature at different points within the manufacturing process. This would be justified if it would reduce <b>internal</b> <b>failure</b> costs (such as costs of rework or scrap) or external failure costs (such as customer returns) within the cost of quality framework.|$|E

However, instead of turning back to Cebu, the pilot decided to continue the flight, until the engine failed completely 37 minutes later and the aircraft crashed during the subsequent attempt to land at Masbate.

50|$|All {{membranes}} are porous to {{a limited}} extent so that, over time, low volumes of leachate will cross the membrane. The design of landfill membranes is at such low volumes that they should never have a measurable adverse impact {{on the quality of}} the receiving groundwater. A more significant risk may be the failure or abandonment of the leachate collection system. Such systems are prone to <b>internal</b> <b>failure</b> as landfills suffer large internal movements as waste decomposes unevenly and thus buckles and distorts pipes. If a leachate collection system fails, leachate levels will slowly build in a site and may even over-top the containing membrane and flow out into the environment. Rising leachate levels can also wet waste masses that have previously been dry, triggering further active decomposition and leachate generation. Thus, what appears to be a stabilised and inactive site can become re-activated and restart significant gas production and exhibit significant changes in finished ground levels.|$|E
