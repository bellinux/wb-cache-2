40|$|This study aims {{to apply}} an {{alternative}} detection model {{to prove that}} the earnings management will be occured when a company has long-term debts as well as the pressure of operating income. Generally, the literature study of earnings management indicates that the detection of earnings management can be grouped into two objectives, 1] to find variables for detecting earnings management (accruals, real activity and classification shifting) and 2] to use some advanced statistical or mathematical models to detect earnings management. This study applies a quantitative approach using secondary data of financial statements. The study was conducted on 50 companies with the largest market capitalization, 50 of the most active companies based on trading volume, 50 of the most active companies based on the value of trade and 50 of the most active companies by frequency trading. All of them are 200   public company (listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange-ID) based on IDX statistical report 2013. The results of this study are expected to provide a new method to detect earnings management and its application in the context of positive accounting theory (PAT). The results of the study proves that the model is able to detect earnings management by utilizing <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> transaction <b>losses</b> and use these models to support PAT (particularly on debt covenant hypothesis). These results contribute that earnings management can be done by using the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> gain / <b>loss.</b> However, the limitation of this study is the model {{has not been able to}} capture the phenomenon of earnings management if a company does not report any long-term debt nor <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> gain/ <b>loss...</b>|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Taxation) One of the {{canons of}} context {{requires}} that a liability {{will be in}} 1986 :para 4. 47). taxation is certainty. "Certainty taxpayer be reasonably certain of what any given set of circumstances" (Margo in this his tax Report, It is submitted that, at present, {{there is not the}} desired certainty regarding the treatment of unrealised foreign exchange differences. This is proven by the internal memorandum circularised by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, advising local Receivers of Revenue to put on hold all income tax returns with unrealised <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> and all objections to the disallowance of these losses until such time that it has, in consultation with professional bodies, been able to establish an acceptable solution to the problem (Commissioner for Inland Revenue, n. d.). No finality has been reached to date and uncertainty therefore still prevails {{on either side of the}} fence, resulting in losses to both parties. As a result of the Commissioner's instruction not to assess income tax returns with foreign exchange differences, Revenue suffers significant losses from a cash flow point of view. This is because a taxpayer is entitled to base his first and second provisional tax payment for a particular tax year on his "basic amount", this being his taxable income or assessed loss for the last tax year for which he has been assessed. For many affected taxpayers, this is their 1984 tax year in respect of which they reported a considerably lower taxable income than for their last year of assessment. This means that their first two provisional tax payments in respect of a particular tax year can be extremely low in comparison to their taxable income for their last year of assessment. There are also quite a few taxpayers who had an assessed loss for their 1984 tax year who are therefore not required to make a payment at all. It follows, therefore, that Revenue could improve its cash flow position by not allowing assessments to fall too far in arrears. Conversely, disallowance response to pay tax on purposes. taxpayers lose where they have objected to the of their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> and are still awaiting a their objections as, in the meantime, they will have to the basis that the losses are not deductible for tax The direct effect of the disallowance of unrealised <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> would be that the after tax cost of borrowings from abroad would be unacceptably high, thus creating a bias towards local borrowing.

40|$|Foreign capital {{investment}} in microfinance has been booming {{over the past}} four years. Commercial cross-border debt and equity invested in microfinance surpassed US$ 11 billion in 2009, representing an estimated 20 percent of the funding base for specialized microfinance providers. 1 Foreign investment brings important benefits for microfinance institutions (MFIs). It can provide longer term debt maturity and risk capital that often is not available in the local market, but it can come with a significant string attached: foreign exchange risk. Seventy percent of cross-border, fixed-income investments are denominated in foreign currencies 2 (meaning currencies other than the currencies in which the MFIs are operating), leaving MFIs with significant foreign exchange exposure. 3 During the most recent global financial crisis, some MFIs that depend on foreign currency-denominated debt have suffered heavy <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> that threaten their overall viability (Littlefield and Kneiding 2009). And local currency hedging needs for microfinance is estimated at US$ 1. 5 billion in 2009. 4 Managing foreign exchange risk has been a persistent challenge for microfinance donors and investors. Some have developed their own internal hedging systems to offer local currency loans, while others, like the Dutch public investor FMO, have sought to establish dedicated vehicles to hedge local currency investments for themselves and other international donors and investors.

40|$|The carry trade, where profits {{can be made}} in {{currency}} markets using price information alone, has been a persistent anomaly in financial markets since the collapse of Bretton Woods. This thesis outlines how, under free floating currencies, there have been waves of financial crises, financial sector growth has decoupled from GDP, and currency market activity has become increasingly concentrated in a few centres. The thesis uses the stock-flow consistent or accounting approach to explain the carry trade. Problems with the quality, coverage and timeliness of the SNA and BOP are discussed, with recommendations to improve the data for research into foreign exchange risks. The persistence of high and low interest rate economies is explained with hedge, speculative and Ponzi models of a simple economy. Disaggregating a typical carry trade strategy shows scant evidence for currency market efficiency or a constant risk premium. Rather, there is the impression that international liquidity is a co-ordination problem, and that <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> are absorbed by the balance sheets of central banks and exporters. The key features of low interest rate economies are summarised as a Financial Consensus underpinned by a liquidity put from central banks during crises. These findings are consistent with the literature on endogenous money. Carry trade indices are suggested as a measure of the success of expansionary and contractionary monetary policy. In parallel, deficit countries would need tough fiscal and regulatory policies to tackle stubborn trade deficits, the risks posed by unsustainable external positions, the risks from leveraged offshore finance, profit accumulation and speculative capital flows. The thesis also outlines strategies for countries to resist losses to financial speculators: to move away from inflation targeting, to put in place mechanisms to recycle your own trade receipts, and to settle foreign exchange and derivative trades in domestic currency...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2006. Currency {{exposure}} {{has become}} a widespread issue as more corporations of all sizes source and sell in overseas markets and compete {{both at home and}} abroad with international companies. Very few companies are unaffected by currency risk, whether directly or indirectly. Businesses that source products from foreign countries face the risk that exchange rate movement will erode gross margins if competition prevents selling prices from rising in tandem, while resource-based companies face the uncertainty associated with the fact that the world's commodities markets are denominated in US Dollars or Pounds Sterling while their costs are often denominated in their local currencies. Businesses that ignore exchange rate volatility expose themselves to unnecessary risk, which could have significant consequences if exchange rates suddenly move unfavourably. The volatility of the South African Rand over the past few years is forcing treasurers and other managers responsible for international trade to look anew at how South African exchange rate fluctuations affect their company's results. Many companies have suffered from the effects of fluctuating exchange rates; some have reported losses running into millions of Rand. While more and more firms realize that they should manage foreign exchange risk, not all of them have come up with an appropriate management strategy. There has always been a great deal of debate over the best approach to hedging, or the best methods to forecast exchange rates; however hedging is of the utmost importance for companies. With the recent volatility of the rand, the multinational firm covered in this thesis, showed <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> amounting to several millions, using forward exchange contracts to cover its high foreign exchange exposures. The major disadvantage of the forward contract as experienced by the firm and shown in this thesis is that it is a legally binding agreement and thus the firm was bound to accept the agreed exchange rate and also the fact that the exchange itself had to be done. If the commercial reason for the exchange disappeared, the cost of cancelling the forward contract would be quite high. In addition, if the exchange rate at maturity was more favourable to the firm than the one agreed to in the forward contract, the firm will still have to honour the contract and will not be able to take advantage of the favourable exchange rate. Thus, with FEC there is the elimination of the opportunity for profit, should exchange rates turn out favourably. When purchasing a currency option, however, the holder is protected from downward movements in the exchange rate whist still having the opportunity to benefit if the currency moves favourably. Hence, the purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the use of currency options as an alternative hedging strategy to forward exchange contracts to manage the firm's foreign exchange risk. It was found that, had the firm used currency options as compared to FEC over the last four years, the firm would have made significant saving in spite of the option premium. The firm would have enjoyed the flexibility offered by currency options, that is, to let the contract lapse when it would not be to the firm's advantage thus making a lower payment for its imports than would be paid under the forward exchange contract for the same period. The results were tested over a period of four years to prove that the difference in payments using the FEC and the currency options were statistically significant. What was apparent from the research, however, was that though the multinational firm could choose from a vast array of financial instruments and currency derivatives to manage its foreign exchange risk, the firm chose to stick to using forward exchange contracts. The reasons varied from fear of dealing with the complexities of the many instruments available on the market to the limited resources within the foreign exchange department to understand the technicalities of the various instruments. The investigation revealed though forward cover as used by the firm was more efficient in terms of ease of use. Currency options when applied to cover the firm's foreign imports resulted in less cash outflow, making it better and more profitable than forward exchange contracts. Options contract, though more expensive, would have allowed the firms to let the option lapse and therefore benefit from spot exchange rates if these were more favourable...|$|E

First, these central banks do not always fully sterilize their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interventions. In addition, they issue regulations and conduct their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> operations in a way that increases the central bank''s information advantage and the size of their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> intervention relative to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market turnover. Some of the central banks also use moral suasion to support their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interventions.
