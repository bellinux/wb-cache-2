5|$|This is the Ottoman {{development}} of the composite bow, presumably brought from the steppes. Turkish bows evolved, after the decline of military archery, into probably the best traditional flight bows.

5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on {{retractable}} supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too <b>delicate,</b> <b>and</b> frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and <b>delicate,</b> <b>and</b> concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|Neighbour Clive (John Biggins) had {{a part in}} {{a single}} scene in the first series, but had a larger part in an episode of the second series; by the third series {{he had become a}} {{prominent}} character, concerned about the well-being of his elderly mother who is very <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> has had problems with losing her cat and having teenagers throwing rubbish over her wall.|$|E
5|$|She {{also became}} {{the theme of}} {{paintings}} by several artists of the epoch, among them Hyppolyte Bellange, Achille Deveria, Philipp Veit, Francois de Villain and Wojciech Kossak. In 1842, J. K. Salomoński published a short biography of Plater in New York, under the title of Emily Plater, The Polish Heroine; Life of the Countess Emily Plater. A lithograph by F. De Villaine, based on Deveria's work, {{became one of the}} most recognizable portraits of her, popularizing her image as a <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> noble female warrior.|$|E

5|$|The Malagasy {{mountain}} mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo (Monticolomys koopmani) is a rodent {{within the}} subfamily Nesomyinae {{of the family}} Nesomyidae, and {{is closely related to}} Macrotarsomys. It is monotypic within the genus Monticolomys. It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> lacks crests and ridges on its roof.|$|E
5|$|With a {{head and}} body length of , Eliurus petteri is a {{moderately}} large species of Eliurus. Its upperparts are gray-brown to gray and contrast {{sharply with the}} white underparts. The tail tuft, a characteristic feature of Eliurus, is weakly developed. The skull is <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are short and narrow. The incisors are weak.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring photographs {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, or he may have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E
5|$|Remains {{thought to}} belong to Nigersaurus were first {{discovered}} during a 1965–72 expedition to the Republic of Niger led by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet, and first mentioned in a paper published in 1976. Although a common genus, the dinosaur had been poorly known until more material of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 1997 and 2000. The limited understanding of the genus {{was the result of}} poor preservation of its remains, which arises from the <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton, in turn causing disarticulation of the fossils. Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a strong light beam was visible through them. Therefore, no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found, and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, {{it is impossible to}} do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E

5|$|The skull is <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> lightly built. The rostrum, {{the front}} {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow {{zygomatic}} plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior digitisation, the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread. Cross-licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation, using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a more <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> elegant design.|$|E
5|$|LeHand {{was born}} in Potsdam, New York, to DanielJ. and MaryJ. (née Graffin) LeHand, who were the {{children}} of Irish immigrants. The parents began their family at age 16 with a son, also called Daniel, followed by Bernard, Anna and finally Marguerite, {{when they were in}} their 40s. When she was a young child, the family relocated to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where LeHand was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. It permanently damaged her heart, causing episodes of atrial fibrillation and leading to her premature death. Eleanor Roosevelt later stated that the disease had left her <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> barred from strenuous exercise. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1917, where she took secretarial courses in preparation for a career. Although she never attended college, in 1937 Rosary College (now called Dominican University) recognized her professional achievements with an honorary Doctor of Laws, presented at the White House.|$|E

5|$|The mounted {{police were}} {{established}} to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield Carbine Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian groups in the United States. These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> did not perform effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee-Metford Magazine Carbine, but these weapons did not perform as well as hoped. The program was halted and instead the Lee-Enfield Magazine Rifle Mark I was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant {{that the police had}} few opportunities to practice with their weapons, and as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.|$|E
5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} <b>delicate</b> <b>and</b> precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E
