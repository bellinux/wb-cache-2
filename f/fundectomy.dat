40|$|The {{effect of}} gastric <b>fundectomy</b> with hypergastrinaemia on the {{pancreas}} in rats was studied for 14 months. Rats with hypercholecystokininaemia that {{had had a}} pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD) operation and sham operated rats served as controls. Fundectomised rats showed {{a significant increase in}} pancreatic weight and total DNA and protein content compared with sham operated rats. DNA flow cytometry showed a significantly higher ratio of tetraploid to diploid nuclei in pancreatic tissue after <b>fundectomy</b> than after sham operation. Mean values of all these variables were significantly lower after <b>fundectomy</b> than after PBD. Acidophilic atypical acinar cell foci of the pancreas were diagnosed in both fundectomised and PBD operated rats, but not in sham operated controls. The volume density and 3 H-thymidine labelling index of the acidophilic atypical acinar cell foci were significantly lower after <b>fundectomy</b> than after PBD. Changes consistent with pancreatic adenoma were diagnosed in the PBD group only. In conclusion, <b>fundectomy</b> lasting about half of the life span in rats causes pancreatic hyperplasia and hypertrophy, as well as development of acidophilic atypical acinar cell foci. Although hypergastrinaemia is a prominent feature, {{it may not be the}} only factor responsible for this pancreaticotrophical effect of <b>fundectomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{stimulation}} of the antral gastrin cells by elevated antral pH was achieved by <b>fundectomy,</b> antrum exclusion, <b>fundectomy</b> plus antrum exclusion, antrocolic transposition, and vagal denervation plus pyloroplasty. For comparison we studied also the effects of pyloroplasty alone and of portacaval shunting. All operations that elevated the antral pH resulted in high gastrin concentrations in serum. Particularly high concentrations were observed in fundectomized rats. Vagal denervation of fundectomized or antrum excluded rats reduced the serum gastrin concentration slightly compared with the corresponding innervated animals. Portacaval shunting reduced the gastrin concentration in serum. The antral gastrin concentration was raised or unchanged following <b>fundectomy</b> and vagal denervation, and reduced following antrum exclusion, antrum exclusion plus vagotomy, <b>fundectomy</b> plus antrum exclusion, <b>fundectomy</b> plus vagotomy, antrocolic transposition and portacaval shunt. The gastrin cell density in the antral mucosa was raised following <b>fundectomy,</b> vagotomy, and <b>fundectomy</b> plus vagotomy, unchanged following <b>fundectomy</b> plus antrum exclusion and antrocolic transposition, and reduced following antrum exclusion and portacaval shunting. Ultrastructurally the gastrin (G) cells in the excluded antrum and in the antrum of fundectomized rats showed signs of secretory activity in that the granule volume density {{or the number of}} granules per unit cytoplasm was lowered. In the fundectomized rats moreover, the endoplasmic reticulum of the G cells was increased, the Golgi area enlarged and the proportion and volume density of electron dense granules greatly increased. The granule profile diameter was not affected by either antrum exclusion or <b>fundectomy.</b> The results on the excluded antrum indicate that elevated antral pH per se is not sufficient to produce gastrin cell proliferation. In the fundectomized rats, where the hyperlasia of antral gastrin cells was considerable, there is the added stimulus of ingested food. In fundectomized plus antrum excluded rats this stimulus is eliminated and no proliferation ensues. The passage of intestinal material, as in the rats subjected to antrocolic transposition, did not elicit gastrin cell proliferation which seems to suggest that the character of the luminal material is important. We propose therefore that gastrin cell proliferation is due to the combined {{stimulation of}} high antral pH and passage of food. Vagal innervation is not required...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{examine the}} effect of gastrin on {{spontaneous}} and induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the hamster. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two sets of experiments were carried out, one involving long term hypergastrinaemia and one involving cancer induction during hypergastrinaemia. The effect of hypergastrinaemia accomplished by gastric <b>fundectomy</b> was studied for eight months. Neither fundectomised hamsters nor sham operated controls developed premalignant or malignant pancreatic lesions. In the <b>fundectomy</b> group, the mean pancreatic weight, total protein content, and DNA content was increased by 28 %, 25 %, and 25 % respectively. No such increases were found in fundectomised animals receiving a cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonist during the last 24 days of the experiment. In the cancer induction study, {{the effect of}} <b>fundectomy</b> on N-nitrosobis(2 -oxopropyl) amine induced pancreatic carcinogenesis was studied for three months. There {{were no significant differences in}} the incidence or [3 H]-thymidine labelling index of focal pancreatic lesions between fundectomised and sham operated control animals. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Fundectomy</b> with chronic hypergastrinaemia induces pancreatic hypertrophy, but does not enhance N-nitrosobis (2 -oxopropyl) amine induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in the hamster. The increases in growth were inhibited by a cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonist, indicating that the trophic effect of <b>fundectomy</b> is mediated by gastrin...|$|E
40|$|Gastrin can induce mitotic {{stimulation}} in the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach, sometimes {{leading to}} abnormal growth. We examined whether gastrin {{was able to}} influence cell proliferation in the oesophageal epithelium. Rats were treated with gastrin, omeprazole or saline for 3 days, or were subjected to <b>fundectomy</b> or sham operation. Bromodeoxyuridine labelling (LI) and mitotic (MI) indices were counted in the proliferative zone of the squamous epithelium. Infusion of exogenous gastrin, treatment with omeprazole or <b>fundectomy</b> raised the LI and the MI values in the oesophageal epithelium, indicating that gastrin stimulates cell proliferation in the oesophageal mucosa in the rat.

40|$|Gastrin {{has been}} shown to be an {{important}} trophic hormone for the mucosa of the stomach and the proximal intestine. In the present study the effect of gastrin on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats was investigated. After partial hepatectomy a significant rise in the concentration of gastrin in portal venous blood was found six, 12, and 18 hours after 70 % hepatectomy. The effect of changes in the endogenous gastrin concentration on the liver regeneration was investigated in rats subjected to antrectomy or to <b>fundectomy.</b> Partial hepatectomy was done three weeks after the primary surgery. We found antrectomy to decrease liver regeneration, whereas <b>fundectomy</b> had no effect. Administration of pentagastrin 300 micrograms/kg sc three times daily for two and four days after partial hepatectomy significantly increased the rate of liver regeneration compared with controls. This study suggests that gastrin has a hepatotrophic effect. Whether this effect is caused by a direct action of gastrin on the hepatocytes or it is an indirect effect mediated by for instance insulin, glucagon or epidermal growth factor has to be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} <b>fundectomy</b> and pyloroplasty on the delay of gastric emptying (GE) and gastrointestinal (GI) transit of liquid due to blood volume (BV) expansion in awake rats. Male Wistar rats (N = 76, 180 - 250 g) were first submitted to <b>fundectomy</b> (N = 26), Heinecke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty (N = 25) or SHAM laparotomy (N = 25). After 6 days, the left external jugular vein was cannulated and the animals were fasted for 24 h with water ad libitum. The test meal was administered intragastrically (1. 5 ml of a phenol red solution, 0. 5 mg/ml in 5 % glucose) to normovolemic control animals and to animals submitted to BV expansion (Ringer-bicarbonate, iv infusion, 1 ml/min, volume up to 5 % body weight). BV expansion decreased GE and GI transit rates in SHAM laparotomized animals by 52 and 35. 9 % (P< 0. 05). <b>Fundectomy</b> increased GE and GI transit rates by 61. 1 and 67. 7 % (P< 0. 05) and prevented the effect of expansion on GE but not on GI transit (13. 9 % reduction, P< 0. 05). Pyloroplasty also increased GE and GI transit rates by 33. 9 and 44. 8 % (P< 0. 05) but did not prevent the effect of expansion on GE or GI transit (50. 7 and 21. 1 % reduction, P< 0. 05). Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked the effect of expansion on GE and GI transit in both SHAM laparotomized animals and animals submitted to pyloroplasty. In conclusion 1) the proximal stomach {{is involved in the}} GE delay due to BV expansion but is not essential {{for the establishment of a}} delay in GI transit, which suggests the activation of intestinal resistances, 2) pyloric modulation was not apparent, and 3) vagal pathways are involve...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective. Gastrin is trophic for the mucosa of the acid-producing {{part of the}} rat stomach, {{notably the}} histamine-producing ECL cells. Gastrin is said to stimulate growth also of colonic mucosa and colon cancer. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine whether {{endogenous}} hypergastrinaemia had trophic effects on normal colonic mucosa and transplanted colon adenocarcinoma in rats. Methods. Rats were subjected to <b>fundectomy</b> (surgical removal of the acid-producing part of the stomach) or treatments known to induce endogenous hypergastrinaemia. The treatments included refeeding after 48 h of food deprivation or administration of omeprazole (400 μmol/kg/day, orally). Other operations included colostomy and sham operation. A K 12 -cell line, originally established from a 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine-induced colon adenocarcinoma, was used for transplantation. The rates of cell proliferation were determined in the oxyntic and colonic mucosa and in the tumour by measuring the proportion of the cells that accumulated bromodeoxyuridine in their nuclei, i. e. the labelling index (LI). The thickness of the oxyntic mucosa and the activity of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the histamine-forming enzyme of the ECL cells, were measured. In addition, the thickness of the colonic mucosa and the weight and volume of the tumour were measured. Results. Refeeding or treatment with a single dose of omeprazole in fasted rats raised the serum gastrin concentration and the LI and HDC activity in the oxyntic mucosa; refeeding but not omeprazole raised the LI in the colonic mucosa. In fed rats, hypergastrinaemia induced by <b>fundectomy</b> or treatment with omeprazole (for 10 days) failed to affect either the LI or the thickness of the mucosa of the proximal colon and the excluded distal colon of the colostomized rats. <b>Fundectomy</b> failed to stimulate the growth of the tumour transplants. Conclusion. Endogenous hypergastrinaemia did not induce trophic effects on rat colonic mucosa and did not promote growth of a transplanted colon adenocarcinoma in the rat.

40|$|The stomach {{helps to}} {{maintain}} calcium homoeostasis by making dietary calcium accessible for uptake in the intestines, although {{the effect of}} the stomach on calcium homoeostasis is poorly understood. We examined the effect on blood calcium of gastric surgery in the rat. Within three weeks gastrectomy and <b>fundectomy</b> (excision of the acid producing part of the stomach) induced a slight lowering of the blood calcium concentration. When parathyroidectomy was combined with either gastrectomy or <b>fundectomy</b> the blood calcium concentrations promptly dropped to values lower than after parathyroidectomy alone. The mortality was close to 100 % during the first three weeks after combined parathyroidectomy and gastric surgery. It was nil in rats subjected to parathyroidectomy alone. Gastrectomised rats absorbed Ca 2 + better than unoperated control rats, possibly reflecting the fact that the serum 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D concentration was raised. Gastrectomised rats had a food intake that was about 70 % of that in intact rats, and the amount of dietary calcium absorbed (net absorption per kg body weight) by the gastrectomised rats was approximately 65 % of that in intact control rats. We conclude that the acid producing part of the stomach is important for calcium homoeostasis, since its removal induced lethal hypocalcaemia in parathyroidectomised rats. One possible explanation for the hypocalcaemia induced by gastrectomy is a progressive calcium deficit. In addition, the loss of calciotrophic hormones originating in the stomach may contribute...|$|E
40|$|Splenic vein {{obstruction}} (usually due to thrombosis) induces left-sided {{portal hypertension}} and isolated fundal varices {{in patients with}} unaffected liver parenchyma and permeable portal vein. Pancreatic etiology {{is among the most}} frequent for splenic vein thrombosis. Hemorrhage from isolated fundal varices is a lifethreatening situation and an unusual endoscopic finding. Isolated splenic vein thrombosis with gastric varices is rare and represents one of the few curable syndromes inducing portal hypertension. The treatment for this situation is controversial, various options being described in the literature: endoscopic injection hemostasis, interventional radiology techniques and surgery. We herein describe the clinical case of a 50 -year old patient with bleeding fundal varices, which proved to be attributable to a blunt abdominal trauma thirty six years previously, successfully managed by stapling <b>fundectomy</b> with splenectomy...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aims of {{the study}} were to {{evaluate}} if multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can be helpful and useful in the decision-making process in sleeve patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms and to demonstrate the reproducibility and accuracy of the technique. Methods: Twenty-three patients submitted to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), complaining upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and/or weight regain and candidated to laparoscopic surgical revision were investigated. All patients underwent upper GI barium study, endoscopy, and MDCT for the identification of esophageal dilatation, neofundus development, thoracic sleeve migration, sleeve dilatation, and/or antrum dilatation. Selected patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve revision, cruroplasty, and/or <b>fundectomy</b> according to MDCT findings. Surgical findings were considered as "gold standard. " Symptom persistence or resolution was investigated after 6  months with a standard clinical questionnaire. A total of 21 patients with sleeve migration or dilatation and neofundus underwent laparoscopic revision. Results: A strong correlation between MDCT preoperative findings and intraoperative findings was observed. The presence of sleeve migration was significantly underestimated by both conventional radiology and upper GI endoscopy (sensitivity of 57. 1 and 50  %, respectively). Symptom remission was observed in 19 out of 21 patients at 6  months. In two cases, surgical revision was not indicated on the basis of MDCT findings. Conclusions: MDCT is more accurate than the conventional radiology and endoscopy for the detection of morphological alteration causing GERD symptoms after LSG and can be considered a valid noninvasive method to guide surgery and monitoring patients following revision. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{a public}} health problem with a prevalence of 345 million people worldwide that it may double by the year 2030 and have a high costs and mortality. Gastrointestinal surgery is accepted {{as a form of}} treatment that was already suggested for obese in 1987 by Pories, confirmed for obese patients by the meta-analysis of Buchwald and the direct comparison of gastric bypass with medical treatment in the study of Schauer that demonstrate a 4 fold greater resolution rate of DM with surgery. Improvement occurs immediately after surgery, before the patients lose weight in with BMI > 35; but there is doubt if the existent evidence is enough to extrapolate these results to patients with BMI < 35 and especially with BMI < 30, in spite that four reviews in patients with this BMI and DM 2 demonstrated the same results when stomach, duodenum and part of jejunum is bypassed as happen gastric bypass (better results with this of one anastomosis than of two anastomosis, Rouxen-Y) BPD. For patients with a BMI between 30 and 35 restrictive techniques: LAGB and SGL are good but not better than the mixed: RYGB, BAGUA, or SG-DJB with remission from 60 to 100 %, minor in the derivative: BPD and above on the IID with a 81 % of remission. There are no differences in the metabolic control in comparison to the obese, It is progressively better with DJB, SDS, IID and BAGUA especially in patients who do not require insulin, have less time with disease, have normal C peptide levels, and not so much relation with the initial BMI that is only important to decide the degree of restriction. Although several mechanisms has been suggesed for explaining these results such as caloric intake, hormonal changes, bypass of the anterior or early stimulation of posterior intestine, <b>fundectomy,</b> intestinal gluconeogenesis and others, new ones will appear in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} is {{the fourth}} most common cancer in the world. Among several etiological factors, gastrin hormone has been considered as a cofactor. Progenitor cells/stem cells and ECL cells are targets of gastrin and have been suggested to be the origin of gastric cancer. Gastric carcinoid (ECLoma) {{is another example of}} tumors arising from long-term hypergastrinemia (induced by e. g. proton pump inhibitor). Much progression has been made during the past decades, but there are still limits in our understanding from gastric physiology to the tumorigenesis. For instance, roles of vagus nerve in regulation of gastric acid secretion and trophic effects of gastrin are unclear. Mechanisms behind gender predominance (i. e., females in ECLoma and males in adenocarcinoma) are unknown. Autophagy plays important roles in both cell survival and suicide, little is known about its role in gastric tumorigenesis. Thus, an improved understanding of the pathobiology with emphasis on the biological factors is important for translating research findings and knowledge into clinical managements of these diseases. Aims and hypotheses: The principle objective was to study the pathobiology of gastric carcinoids and adenocarcinomas in rodent models and patients with attempts to understand the roles of vagus nerve, gender-related factors and autophagy. Three hypotheses were tested: 1) Vagus nerve plays a crucial role in gastrin-ECL cell axis. 2) Female sex hormone plays important roles in regulation of ECL cells. 3) Autophagy pathway is impaired in the tumorigenesis of gastric carcinoids and adenocarcinomas. Methods: Gastrocystoplasty with <b>fundectomy</b> was established in rats, and the ECL cells in stomach as well as in bladder were examined. Rats during pregnancy, lactation, estrous cycle, or after nine months treatment with estrogen-like agents (dieldrin and/or toxaphene) were studied with respect to gastrin and ECL cells. Mastomys model of gastric carcinoids (treated with H 2 receptor antagonist loxtidine), hypergastrinemic cotton rat model of adenocarcinoma and patients diagnosed as carcinoids or adenocarcinoma were studied with respect to autophagy. Serum gastrin concentration was measured. ECL-cell related parameters, including histamine concentration in the oxyntic mucosa, histidine decarboxylase activity, ultrastructural appearance and secretory organelles, cell numbers were determined. Autophagy pathway was examined by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against autophagy-related gene protein- 6 (ATG 6, also called beclin- 1), ATG- 5 and ATG- 16. Results: Rats subjected to gastrocystoplasty and 90 % <b>fundectomy</b> were able to produce acid in the bladder in response to food intake. ECL-cell micronodules with mucosal hyperplasia in the augmented bladder were observed three months postoperatively, and ECL-cell hyperplasia and ECLoma in both the stomach and the segment of oxyntic mucosa developed six months after surgery. The serum gastrin concentration was higher in male than female rats, which was associated with higher HDC activity as well as ECL cell density in females. ECL cells were fully under control of gastrin during pregnancy and lactation and during the estrous cycle, and estrogen-like agents did not induce any changes in the gastrin-ECL cell axis neither in female nor male rats. ECL cells from the ECLoma tissue of Mastomys displayed fewer granules and secretory vesicles (but not microvesicles) in comparison with ECL cells from non-tumor tissue, and were neither hypertrophic nor autophagic (i. e., lack of formation of vacuoles and lipofuscin bodies). There were positive immunostains for ATG- 5, ATG- 16 and beclin- 1 in all tumor-free Mastomys, but negative stains for ATG- 5 and ATG- 16 in tumor-bearing Mastomys (but only 1 of 5 for beclin- 1). Ten patients with gastric carcinoid had similar results as Mastomys. The cotton rats with gastric adenocarcinoma were negative for ATG- 5 and ATG- 16 in the tumor area and adjacent tissue, but positive in the normal area of the same stomach. Beclin- 1 immunostaining was negative in 3 of 5 rats. Ten patients with adenocarcinoma of intestinal type had similar results as the cotton rats. Conclusions: After gastrocystoplasty, gastrin was still capable of stimulating the ECL cells in vagal denervated segment in the augmented bladder, leading to development of ECLoma. The ECL cells in the stomach were activated during lactation but not during pregnancy and they were under control of gastrin but not female hormones. The ECL cells of ECLoma in Mastomys had impaired life cycle of the secretory organelles and autophagy. The impaired autophagy (mainly formation of ATG- 5 -ATG- 12 -ATG- 16 complex) was found in gastric carcinoids of both Mastomys and patients, and in gastric adenocarcinomas of both hypergastrinemic cotton rats and patients. </p...|$|E
