50|$|The highest numbers {{used for}} highway designations include Highway 889 in Little Rock, {{although}} this route is not signed.

50|$|RBAC {{differs from}} access control lists (ACLs), used in {{traditional}} discretionary access-control systems, {{in that it}} assigns permissions to specific operations with meaning in the organization, rather than to low level data objects. For example, an access control list {{could be used to}} grant or deny write access to a particular system file, but it would not dictate how that file could be changed. In an RBAC-based system, an operation might be to 'create a credit account' transaction in a financial application or to 'populate a blood sugar level test' record in a medical application. The assignment of permission to perform a particular operation is meaningful, because the operations are granular with meaning within the application. RBAC {{has been shown to be}} particularly well suited to separation of duties (SoD) requirements, which ensure that two or more people must be involved in authorizing critical operations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for safety of SoD in RBAC have been analyzed. An underlying principle of SoD is that no individual should be able to effect a breach of security through dual privilege. By <b>extension,</b> <b>no</b> person may hold a role that exercises audit, control or review authority over another, concurrently held role.|$|E
5000|$|Buffer {{allocation}} on {{the client}} side breaks GLX assumptions {{in the sense}} that it's no longer possible for multiple GLX applications to render cooperatively in the same window. On the plus side, the fact that the DRI client is in charge of its own buffers throughout their lifetime brings many advantages. For example, it is easy for the DRI3 client to ensure that the size of the render buffers always match the current size of the window, and thereby eliminate the artifacts {{due to the lack of}} synchronization of buffer sizes between client and server that plagued window resizing in DRI2. A better performance is also achieved because now DRI3 clients save the extra round trip waiting for the X Server to send the render buffers. DRI3 clients, and especially compositor window managers, can take advantage of keeping older buffers of previous frames and reusing them as the basis on which to render only the damaged parts of a window as another performance optimization. The DRI3 <b>extension</b> <b>no</b> longer needs to be modified to support new particular buffer formats, since they are now handled directly between the DRI client driver and the DRM kernel driver. The use of file descriptors, on the other hand, allows the kernel to perform a safe cleanup of any unused GEM buffer object [...] - one with no reference to it.|$|E
