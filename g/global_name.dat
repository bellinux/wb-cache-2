40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the {{importance}} of <b>global</b> brand <b>names</b> has increased significantly for  companies in the global market, <b>global</b> brand <b>names</b> are now considered as a fundamental  constituent of the marketing field. The brand name represents a strong impact in the success  of a product or service. Also, previous literature highlighted the relevance to investigate the  relationship of the culture and competition regarding the <b>global</b> brand <b>name</b> strategy.   Consequently, {{the purpose of the}} study is to investigate to what extent global companies  consider factors affecting the <b>global</b> brand <b>name</b> strategy.     The theoretical framework of the study is based on a model which examines the process of  developing a <b>global</b> brand <b>name</b> strategy. In this part, we describe the two major factors  affecting the <b>global</b> brand <b>name</b> strategy such as; the culture and the competition, the different  brand name strategies as well as the notion of standardization and adaptation.     A qualitative method is utilised in order to conduct this study. This choice of methodology is  the most suitable one regarding the purpose of our research. The empirical data is composed  by the primary data collected thanks to one interview and secondary data which was mostly  gathered in companies’ websites and various articles.     A cross-case analysis is applied and it makes it possible to compare two global companies.   The analysis of empirical findings enables us to draw some conclusions which provide  interesting knowledge to the research area of <b>global</b> brand <b>name</b> in international markets. Our  findings reveal that global companies are generally aware that the culture, especially the  language, and competition can affect their <b>global</b> brand <b>name</b> strategy. However, the degree of  consideration differs regarding first on the global company's choices such as, the competitive  advantage, the image and values of their global brand. Secondly, it also varies according to  the company's situation as the number of competitors on the market and the number of  languages they are confronted to.     Keywords: <b>global</b> brand <b>name</b> strategy, <b>global</b> brand <b>name,</b> culture, language, competition. ...|$|R

This {{is contrary to the}} trust management strategy whereby role memberships can be maintained independent of the permissions that are delegated to them. This contrasts with the use of X 500 -like <b>global</b> <b>names.</b> In this case, we assume that the name is non-transitory while the key is transitory. A re-keying results in the issuing of a new identity certificate. The owner uses their new key to re-issue existing authorization certificates, whose permissions refer to the name of the principal rather than the public key. Other authorization certificates signed by other principals remain valid as their permissions are based on non-transitory <b>global</b> <b>names</b> rather than transitory keys.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Web-based social {{networking}} applications gained considerable {{popularity in the}} recent years. However, most {{social networking}} platforms suffer from {{the limits of the}} centralized paradigm they adopted, limiting the mobility of their users, and their chances to benefit from diverse services. In this paper we want to illustrate how these limitations can be overcome by enabling a <b>global</b> <b>naming</b> service for the ’social semantic web’. To do so, we will describe a web tool, called foaf-Omatic, for creating FOAF profiles which is enabled to interact with a <b>global</b> <b>naming</b> system called Entity Name System (ENS). Through a well-known mashup system called Sigma, we will show how the use of globally shared IDs in the definition of user profiles enables frictionless integrations mechanism supporting web-based application interoperability in dealing with users information...|$|R
