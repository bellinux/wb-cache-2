50|$|In {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 and 1584 avoided {{fraudulent}} conveyances as against all parties and voluntary conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most feudal tenures into tenure by <b>free</b> <b>and</b> <b>common</b> <b>socage</b> and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (gifts by will) of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, {{and the laws of}} inheritance and dower were amended.|$|E
40|$|It seems {{a shameful}} thing to confess that {{the quest for}} 2 ̆ 2 tenure 2 ̆ 2 {{of land in the}} American States, so busily carried on in modem times, reminds one of the childish game, 2 ̆ 2 Button, button, who has the button ? 2 ̆ 2 It {{certainly}} appears disrespectful to such an ancient and honorable institution as English land tenure, to associate it with so silly a game. Yet is there not a resemblance? Lands in Colonial America were undoubtedly granted by the English Crown to be held in <b>free</b> <b>and</b> <b>common</b> <b>socage,</b> 2 ̆ 2 as of our Manor at East-Greenwich, in the County of Kent, 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 or, as in the patent given by Charles II to William Penn, 2 ̆ 2 to bee holden of Us Our heires and Successors, Kings of England, as of Our Castle of Windsor in Our County of Berks, in free and comon Socage, by fealty only for all Services, and not in Capite or by Knights Service: Yielding and paying therefore to Us, Our heires and Successors, Two Beaver Skins [...] . 2 ̆ 2 Unquestionably there was land tenure in Colonial lands, even though of the mild and somewhat defeudalized type possible after the statute of 12 Car. II, c. 24. Then what has become of it? Look about as you may, you will see none of the familiar signs of English land tenure; no doing of homage, no swearing of fealty, no reliefs, no rent service or distress in case of grants in fee (except in Pennsylvania), no escheat to the original grantor, even though such grantor be the Federal government, but only to the State in which the land lies. There appears to be no tenure at all. Then who has the button? What can have become of that Colonial tenure, which was so very real and active as to keep the colonists in unceasing conflict and turmoil with the royal governors, or unhappy proprietaries, who attempted {{to take advantage of it}} and enforce the rendering of services reserved, here nearly always taking the form of quit rents, and which did so much to bring on the Revolution? The answer has puzzled our scholars and judges. Professor Gray thought it not probable that so 2 ̆ 2 fundamental an alteration in the theory of property as the abolition of tenure would be worked by a change of political sovereignty...|$|E

60|$|For a {{long time}} there were no mills to grind the corn, and it was pounded into meal for bread with a heavy wooden pestle in a mortar made by {{hollowing}} out some tough-grained log.

But the stills were plentier than the mills, and as much corn was made into whisky as into bread. Men drank hard to soften their hard life, to lighten its heaviness, to drown its cares, to heighten its few pleasures.

Are peer-to-peer forms of cooperation, based on open <b>and</b> <b>free</b> input of voluntary contributors, participatory processes of governance, and universal availability of the output, more productive than centralized alternatives? In this short introduction, Michel Bauwens reviews a number of open <b>and</b> <b>free,</b> participatory <b>and</b> <b>commons</b> oriented practices that are emerging in scientific research and practice, but which ultimately point to a more profound epistemological revolution linked to increased participatory consciousness between the scientist and his human, organic and inorganic research material...|$|R

40|$|Three periods {{could be}} found in the {{development}} of automobile industry in Uruguay since the seventieth: the first with the production oriented to the local market as result of import substitution policies; the second (since the nineties and regional integration) where automobile production was exported to the region and automobile importations supplied the local market; and the third, since the crisis, when production fell dramatically and a new stage appears where new alliances and activities emerge. This paper analyzes different issues about automobile industry in Uruguay. It outlines that the future of this industry has a great grade of incertitude that is associated with the regulations that will be adopted in the framework of MERCOSUR agreement and with the bilateral agreements that Uruguay could sign with its neighbors in the period previous to the common automobile policy.

When controlling for the extensive margin of trade, the multilateral trade resistance terms, and the endogeneity bias we are able to obtain satisfyingly accurate treatment effects of the different types of regional trade agreements. Using a panel of 50 countries over the period 1980 - 1999, we find that customs unions, "deep" <b>free</b> trade agreements, <b>and</b> <b>common</b> markets have stronger effects on bilateral trade than simple free trade agreements...|$|R
