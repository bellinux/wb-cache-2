40|$|Abstract. This paper {{raises a}} model which {{concerns}} about spinning reserve capacity of output and predicted error based on chance-constrained programming. The distribution function is established on the load demand of electric vehicles. Considering the complementarities of electric vehicles and small hydro and wind power generations, this paper constructs a dispatch model on {{the participation of}} electric vehicles in reserve capacity and peak regulation. <b>Joint</b> <b>operation</b> of different <b>units</b> in the system achieved by genetic algorithm examines the influence from joint dispatch of electric vehicles and small hydro and wind power generations on spinning reserve capacity and peak regulation plan, setting different values of confidence to make comparison of electric charge in the entire system. According to the real operation statistics of an electric company in a certain province, the reliability and accuracy of the model was guaranteed...|$|R

[...] Tier 1 and Tier 2 units take leave together within their respective JSOC package. This term is called block leave. Given the wartime tasking of JSOC, an additional deployment package is currently being created. This will allow less operational strain on these units.|$|R
