40|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} that combines Chi-Square Test and Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural network mapping is proposed to <b>Fault</b> Diagnosis <b>of</b> Integrated <b>Navigation</b> Systems. State Chi-Square Test on whole state vector and individual state is performed to detect faults. Then, the pattern of State Chi-Square Test result is used to isolate and identify faults by using two separated FAM networks respectively. The fault magnitude and fault occurring time can be identified by the second FAM. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of the mean of residual and the sum of absolute residuals are introduced in this paper. Both of them along with the fault detection function are used to detect mutant <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the assisted <b>navigation</b> devices in underwater integrated navigation system. (1) The traditional residual 2 detection method is improved according to the structural characteristics <b>of</b> the underwater <b>navigation</b> system. (2) The mean of residual and the sum of absolute residuals are introduced as the characteristics <b>of</b> mutant <b>faults.</b> (3) The improved residual 2 detection method is used to make sure of the happening <b>of</b> the mutant <b>fault</b> firstly. Then the residual mean and the sum of residual absolute values are used to distinguish the noise mutant system fault and the information mutant system <b>fault.</b> The results <b>of</b> simulations and the vehicle tests show that: (1) the mutant <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the sub-system can be detected and the faulty sub-system can be isolated immediately when the fault appears with our novel method; (2) The noise mutant fault and the information mutant fault can be distinguished efficiently according to characteristics of the mean of residuals and {{the sum of the}} absolute residuals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Turbocharged {{diesel engines}} {{are the most}} used prime mover in the ship {{propulsion}} plants, because of their superior power density and efficiency as compared to other thermal engines. So perfect efficiency and reliability of these engines {{is very important for}} ship safety and economy <b>of</b> <b>navigation.</b> For this reason, many papers are presented in technical literature for the diesel engines faults prediction and analysis. In this paper, a detailed and reliable thermodynamic diesel engine simulation model, including the engine-propulsion system governor, is used for the detailed study <b>of</b> several <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> a four stroke marine turbocharged diesel engine. The presented simulation results describe the behaviour variation of different engine components (cylinders, inlet and outlet manifolds, intercooler, turbocharger, etc.), {{as a consequence of the}} considered engine faults, and allow a prediction of the overall engine performance variation. The operating conditions selected for the engine faults simulations are those typical <b>of</b> the ship <b>navigation.</b> In the authors’ opinion the developed model may represent a useful tool to be used for diagnosis and fault prevention purposes and also for engine maintenance staff training...|$|R
