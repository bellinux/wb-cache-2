40|$|Principals in New Zealand {{primary schools}} {{are aware of}} the {{expectations}} placed on them in their role as educational leaders. These expectations include being leaders of change, leaders of learning and leaders who are able to manage the daily operational requirements of a school. Advances in digital technologies have led to changes in the way we communicate, learn, solve problems and consume content. As such, these changes have altered the way key stakeholders in education (students, parents, communities and governments) acquire information, judge teaching and learning, and communicate with schools. The digital landscape is a field that encompasses change and new learning through a rapidly increasing school of thought, and as such, generates experiences that are worthy of investigation. This research critically examined primary school principals’ experiences with identifying and meeting expectations from a variety of stakeholders in regard to the transition of their schools from ‘traditional’ learning environments to digital learning <b>environments</b> (<b>DLEs).</b> It also examined the successes and challenges faced and how principals were best supported to manage challenges when transitioning to digital learning environments. A qualitative methodology was employed for this research using the method of semi- structured interviews. The information gathered from these interviews in relation to the expectations, successes and challenges placed on primary school principals served as the major indicators for the study. Eight Auckland primary school principals from schools with rolls between 200 - 700 students were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. The literature review identified a number of key factors that impact on the effective implementation of digital learning environments. The findings of the research revealed that the expectations prioritised by the principals in leading the change were the need for them to ensure effective professional development in both pedagogical and practical understanding for themselves and staff, and to ensure that effective planning was implemented to meet the infrastructural challenges. This aligned with recent research reviewed in the literature. Due to the rate of change, context of change and speed by which the change occurs because of digital technology, principals believed that the skills of a change leader, which included a clear vision, planning, communicating and managing the change, were essential when transitioning to digital learning <b>environments</b> (<b>DLEs).</b> Lack of personal professional development support for the participants emerged through the course of the interviews. The findings led to the recommendation that principals require greater support from the Ministry of Education and professional development providers to develop their personal understanding of change leadership when transitioning to digital learning <b>environments</b> (<b>DLEs)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline the method of {{research}} used in a PhD project where the aim was to determine the extent to which computers enhanced learning when implemented within a distributed learning <b>environment</b> (<b>DLE).</b> When learning is distributed, cognition is not solely an individual pursuit but is shared with mediating resources found within the learning environment. A type of communal environment is developed within which students, together with other students and resources, construct new knowledge and understandings. In this instance, analysis was based on the nature of discourse to emerge from student interactions around the computer. It was essential, therefore, to adopt a research methodology that would carefully detect the discrete levels of understandings evident within these collaborations. Given the capricious nature of social interactions however, the methodology also needed to be flexible and accommodating. As such, a tentative action research plan was devised to manage these issues...|$|R

Participants were subjected to two intrinsically confusing insight problems in the form of visual digital puzzles. They were asked to solve problems while their eye trajectories were recorded and these data were triangulated with self-ratings of confusion and cued retrospective verbal reports. All participants had a significant increase in fixations on relevant (i. e., related to the solution) and not-relevant areas at an early stage of the problem-solving process. However, only fixations on not-relevant areas were positively correlated with confusion ratings. Moreover, participants who significantly solved the problem differed in their fixations duration on relevant and not-relevant areas from non-solvers. The importance of early detection of confusion and the affordances of emerging technologies for this purpose are discussed. 14 page(s...|$|R

However, {{little is known}} about the development of reading comprehension skills and materials in secondary education, where students do not learn to read, but read to learn. When students read informational textbooks, domain knowledge (e. g., about reading strategies) and topic knowledge become increasingly interconnected. Students’ motivation is also of influence on reading achievement. Students need to recognize the task value or decrease the perceived difficulty of a task in order to be motivated to read a text (Guthrie, Klauda & Ho, 2013). Reading motivation is a problem many content area teachers face. Research has shown that incorporating cognitive, metacognitive and motivational support during instruction increases students’ motivation towards learning from text (Souvignier & Mokhlesgerami, 2006). This semesters’ research uses a digital learning <b>environment</b> (<b>DLE)</b> with two types of support for informational text reading: cognitive and metacognitive hints. In a quasi-experimental design, a total of 228 first grade students from 3 secondary schools were able to use cognitive and metacognitive hints during history lessons (school A: N= 80), during geography lessons (school B: N= 92) or were unable to use hints during these lessons (school C: N= 56). Students’ task value and self-efficacy was measured for all groups using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The effectiveness of available hints on students’ motivation was analyzed using ANOVA, GLM and paired samples t-tests.

In this study I have focused on two areas: how the DLE is collocated and used at upper secondary school libraries, and how these choices can be viewed through theories of connectivism and connectivist learning. I have endeavoured to answer these questions {{through the use of a}} survey and for further depth I have collected information from three semi-structured interviews. The study found that most respondents’ DLE were comprised of combinations of several digital environments. Sometimes there was a division of material between different environments whilst some had tried to consolidate most sources to one of their digital spaces. The most elaborated resources and DLE were found with those who worked according to the latter approach. The literature and research suggests that libraries may be viewed as important access points of information for students in their collection of the information nodes that encompass their connectivistic networks of knowledge. Though, there are rarely any traces of possibilities for user-generated content which would satisfy two purposes for school libraries: increased learning and knowledge via social interaction as well as an increase in the feeling of relevance for the library’s digital learning environment. The study found that the school librarians’ view their DLE as a resource to support learning. Learning goals, such as course or project specific goals or those concerned with information literacy, were often applied in the creation of material and collections of resources made available to students and teachers via the DLE. Based on connectivistic thoughts learning via the DLE would be enhanced through user generated content and discussion boards...|$|R

Additionally, I hypothesized there would be significant differences in Black students' sense of belonging, perceptions of campus climate, witnessed discrimination, experienced discrimination, and institutional satisfaction as a function of gender. Participants in this study were comprised of 228 Black undergraduate students who were representative of students at various stages of their undergraduate careers ranging from 1 st semester (incoming) first year to 2 nd semester (graduating) senior, from a Midwestern public research university. Of the participants, 43. 8 % (n = 74) were male, and 56. 2 % (n = 95) were female, with ages ranging from 18 - 54, and with a mean age of 21. 22. Data consisted of a secondary analysis of an archival dataset. Procedures used to collect the data that were analyzed are described in this section. Data regarding social belonging, perceptions of campus climate, students' witnessed discrimination, students' experience of discrimination, and students' institutional satisfaction were measured by scales from the Diverse Learning <b>Environments</b> (<b>DLE)</b> Core Survey created by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI; [URL] at the University of California, Los Angeles (Hurtado & Guillermo-Wann, 2013). Results of a standard multiple regression suggested that 55 % of the variance in institutional satisfaction was predicted by sense of belonging, perceptions of campus climate, witnessed discrimination, experienced discrimination, and gender; with campus climate shown to have the strongest relationship to institutional satisfaction. Results of a one-way multivariate analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in sense of belonging, perceptions of campus climate, witnessed discrimination, experienced discrimination, and institutional satisfaction by gender. In discussing and describing needed interventions, critical race theory was utilized to highlight the role race and racism plays in the experiences and perceptions of Black college students within the educational system.

Questionnaires were taken on three times (T 1 /T 2 /T 3) during the same school year, with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as theoretical framework. Next to questionnaires, user-logs were collected during the entire school year. A total of 72 teachers completed a questionnaire on at least one occasion: 64 teachers responded at T 1, 41 at T 2, and 55 at T 3. We first investigated which factors influence teachers’ acceptance of a DLE. The main predictors of DLE acceptance were performance expectancy and social influence by superiors to use the DLE. Effort expectancy and facilitating conditions were of minor importance. We then investigated how well the amount of final observed use could be pre- dicted, and found that at T 1 about one third, at T 2 about one fourth and at T 3 about half of the variance in observed use was predicted by attitude, behavioral intention and self-reported frequency of use.

40|$|Teacher {{education}} {{students have a}} significant {{role to play in}} the sustained application of ICT in schools. It is imperative therefore, that they are exposed to effective use of ICT in their training. However, 2 ̆ 7 effective use 2 ̆ 7 is subjective and existing characterisations of this construct appear to drive different ICT implementation plans adopted by teacher education institutions (Steketee, 2005). While most of these plans have achieved varying degrees of success, the 2 ̆ 7 integration approach 2 ̆ 7, has been the most promising.

40|$|In recent times, {{the term}} {{cognitive}} tool {{has been applied}} to computer technology that promotes reflective thinking and student-regulated learning. The interactive qualities of cognitive tools, and their ability to visually represent students 2 ̆ 7 knowledge construction processes, promotes cognitive and metacognitive thinking and fosters learning for understanding. When used appropriately, cognitive tools are purported to bring about advanced cognitive gains through the amplification and augmentation of thinking and learning. These gains, however, have not been widespread given that information on how to use cognitive tools appropriately has largely eluded educators to date. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to identify an implementation framework that facilitated effective use of cognitive tools such that their potential could be maximised. This framework, which emerged from the literature, was based on a social constructivist perspective of learning where discourse and collaboration were highly valued, and students were encouraged to distribute their learning across social, physical, symbolic and intellectual resources. Known as a distributed learning <b>environment</b> (<b>DLE)</b> framework, it also permitted Insight into the extent to which cognitive tools, when used appropriately, contributed to student learning. Using action research methodology, this framework was implemented on two separate occasions into a fourth year tertiary unit. In keeping with the specific features of the DLE framework, modifications were made to the characteristics of the teaching contexts, which ultimately influenced {{the ways in which the}} students approached class activities and their learning in general. In both instances, data was collected from collaborative groups by recording and transcribing their discussions during class activities. Student interviews were also conducted and transcriptions were made of their self-reflective journals. The purpose of the first implementation was to determine the success of the framework in terms of the extent to which it encouraged students to distribute their learning to resources within the classroom. While there were varying degrees of distribution, the data suggests that the students relied heavily on many resources to support their understanding of the unit material. Based on these encouraging findings, the second Implementation proceeded and the DLE framework was used as a catalyst for the introduction of a cognitive tool called Inspiration® into the same unit the following semester. The activities within this unit were based on collaborative group work, the understandings from which were built into a concept-map that each group created for the five modules within the unit. Discourse analysis revealed that this setting enhanced student learning in that deep level socio-cognitive processes were frequently present within the collaborative groups 2 ̆ 7 dialogue. By forming visual, metacognitive, collaborative and motivational partnerships with the cognitive tool, the groups were able to place structure and coherency in their dialogue, identify gaps in their understandings and take the appropriate steps towards integrating knowledge. The major Implication to emerge from this study is that the DLE framework successfully supported the inherent qualities associated with the cognitive tool. Although extensive, its features present educators with a practical opportunity to operationalise current learning theory in their classrooms and, at the same time, implement an environment that embraces and advances the learning benefits associated with cognitive tools...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A five stage systems life-cycle was adopted. Stage 1 involved a literature review and hierarchal tasks analysis of existing European and British heat stress standards. The literature review developed {{the rationale for the}} study by providing a knowledge framework on human thermal environments and human thermoregulation. This was supplement by a review of occupational heat stress. Stage 2 consisted of a series of ten experiments conducted at the Human Thermal Environments Laboratory at Loughborough University to compare the validity of ISO 7933 Required Sweat Rate (SWrcq) and Predicted Heat Strain (PHS) index predictions with observed physiological data. Comparisons were made between the predicted and observed sweat rates and the time it took core temperature to reach 38 °C (Duration Limit Exposures). The results showed that neither the SWieq nor the modified SWreq model were valid predictors of Duration Limit Exposures (DLE) and predicted sweat rate for people wearing protective clothing in warm humid <b>environments.</b> The PHS <b>DLE</b> predictions were more representative of the ISO predictions than observed DLEs in all but one experiment. Although the PHS model predictions of sweat rate were an improvement on the ISO predictions, the model also significantly underestimated the observed sweat rates. Stage 3 provided the Exploratory Stage for the identification of appropriate ergonomic methods to collect the data necessary for the design, development and evaluation of a practical heat stress method for use in British Industry. A heuristic evaluation of the usability of ISO 7933 SWTreq was conducted. This found that the standard is unnecessarily scientific and may not encourage users to use it. The format and the information provided do not satisfy ergonomic guidelines of usability. The need for a more practical heat stress assessment methodology was identified. Stakeholder engagement through a practical field study of heat stress in a paper mill, together with informal interviews and discussion groups with potential users provided a framework for formulating the design, development of a prototype method. Stage 4 was the Design Stage. Expert discussion groups and the results of a postal questionnaire combined with the findings of Stage 3 provided for the user requirements and the functional specification of such a methodology to be established. This showed that a simple approach, together with additional information (e. g. expert systems, job aides etc) was required. A process flow diagram of heat stress risk assessment was developed as was a prototype Observation Checklist. In Stage 5 the Prototype Observation Checklist was evaluated in a comparative study with the Malchaire method (developed as part of the BIOMED II project). Although the Malchaire method was found to easier to use it did not meet the user's requirements. The outcome of Stage 5 was the development of a two part practical heat stress method. Both are based on simple checklists. Part A is concerned with identifying people who may be at added risk from working in the heat. Part B provides a checklist based on the six basic parameters of the human thermal environment; air and radiant temperature, humidity, air movement, clothing and metabolic rate. A score sheet is provided to allow users to identify factors of greatest risk. This forms part of a holistic approach to the Management, Assessment and Control (MA&C) of heat stress. Job aides such competency checklists, specimen record sheets and information for managers are also provided...|$|R
