5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E
