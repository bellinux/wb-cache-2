40|$|A {{number of}} naturalistic studies have {{investigated}} paliperidone palmitate using proxy measures of effectiveness. An unexplored {{option is to}} examine the utility of the mental <b>health</b> <b>clustering</b> tool, because it is used in UK clinical practice, measures patient wellbeing and is linked to allocation of resources. This study evaluated the effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate using the mental <b>health</b> <b>clustering</b> tool, the <b>health</b> of the nation outcome scales and, for comparison, more conventional outcome measures. This was a naturalistic, one-year evaluation of paliperidone palmitate (n = 50) in schizophrenia, alongside a comparator antipsychotic drug group. Changes in the mental <b>health</b> <b>clustering</b> tool ‘cluster-score cost ranking’ and four ‘health of the nation outcome scales-derived factors’ were analysed using a mixed model statistical analysis to explore the utility of these measures. At one year, 30 patients (60 %) continued paliperidone palmitate treatment. The mean ‘cluster-score cost ranking’ (- 1. 5) and Severe Disturbance factor scores (- 1. 1) were significantly lower [p-value (adj) = 0. 0003, p-value (adj) = 0. 002, respectively] after one year of antipsychotic treatment but no differences were found between paliperidone palmitate and the comparator antipsychotic drug group. Patients prescribed paliperidone palmitate were 1. 8 times (95 % CI 1. 1 − 3. 1) more likely to be discharged from hospital than those in the comparator antipsychotic drug group. Paliperidone palmitate’s continuation rate after one year made the study similar to existing evaluations, and it was possible to prospectively evaluate antipsychotic effectiveness using the novel measures although these did not discriminate between paliperidone palmitate and the comparator group. The investigation illustrates that in principle these novel measures are meaningful in naturalistic study designs...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: to {{identify}} variables which predict health service utilisation (HSU) by adults with mental disorders in the UK, {{and to determine}} the evidence level for these predictors. Design: a narrative synthesis of peer-reviewed studies published after the year 2000. The search was conducted using four databases (i. e. PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus with full text, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) and completed on March 25 th, 2014. Setting: the majority of included studies were set in health services across primary, secondary, specialist, and inpatient care. Some studies used data from household and postal surveys. Participants: included were UK-based studies that predicted HSU by adults with mental disorders, Participants had a range of mental disorders including psychotic disorders, personality disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and dementia. Primary outcome: {{a wide range of}} HSU outcomes were examined, including GP contacts, medication usage, psychiatrist contacts, psychotherapy attendances, inpatient days, accident and emergency admissions, and ‘total HSU’ Results: taking into account study quality, 28 studies identified a range of variables with good preliminary evidence supporting their ability to predict HSU. Of these variables, comorbidity, personality disorder, age (heterogeneous age ranges), neurotic symptoms, female gender, a marital status of divorced, separated or widowed, non-white ethnicity, medication, high previous HSU, and activities of daily living were associated with increased HSU. Moreover, good preliminary evidence was found for associations of accessing a primary care psychological treatment service and medication use with decreased HSU. Conclusions: the findings can inform decisions about which variables might be used to derive mental <b>health</b> <b>clusters</b> in ‘payment by results’ systems in the UK. The findings also support the need to investigate whether combining broad diagnoses with care pathways is an effective method for mental <b>health</b> <b>clustering,</b> and the need for research to further examine the association between mental <b>health</b> <b>clusters</b> and HSU. <br/...|$|R

40|$|In the United Kingdom, {{payment for}} mental health {{services}} follows a system of payment-by-results. A mental <b>health</b> <b>clustering</b> tool, classifying individuals into clusters based on service needs, was developed as a broad-based means of planning care packages. It is yet unknown whether payment-by-results clusters will be reflective of the occupational needs of service users. To evaluate the relationship between service users' membership in service need clusters and occupational groupings based on outcomes from an independent measure on participation and engagement in self-care, productivity, and leisure (Model of Human Occupation Screening Tool [MOHOST]), retrospective medical record data were gathered from 675 service users {{with a range of}} psychiatric disorders from two organizations in England. Using six subscales of the MOHOST, the two-step cluster analysis identified occupational groupings. Then the multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine whether the mean scores of the six MOHOST subscales were significantly different across the occupational groupings. Finally, participants' membership in the payment-by-results clusters was compared to their membership in the occupational groupings. Participants fell into one of three levels: high-, middle-, or low-functioning occupational groups. These groups did not bear direct relationships with the individual payment-by-results clusters. This suggests that the mental <b>health</b> <b>clustering</b> tool and the MOHOST are likely targeting different characteristics in the service users.

DATA SOURCES: A survey of 224 patients with ventricular arrhythmias treated at Kaiser Permanente of Northern California. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Physical functioning was measured using the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), and mental status and vitality using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form- 36 items (SF- 36). A "k-means" clustering algorithm was used to identify prototypical health states, in which patients in the same cluster shared similar responses to items in the survey. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The clustering algorithm yielded four prototypical health states.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Firms tend to cluster in a relatively small geographical location. As a result, the distribution of the most of the economic activities is not even across space. There are advantages firms can get by being in a cluster. These advantages arise from the agglomeration economies either by localization economies or by urbanization economies. A cluster is an outcome of many firms' location decisions. The location of an industrial cluster is determined by nature and economic objective(s) of a firm. This study attempts to examine the clustering issue in the health care sector. Specifically, this study examines the distribution pattern of <b>health</b> care <b>clusters</b> and identifies the factors affecting <b>health</b> care <b>clustering.</b> It also examines the spatial interaction and spatial dependence between clusters. In order to examine these objectives, 930 CBSAs are selected from the 48 contiguous states of the US. The results show that the <b>clustering</b> process of <b>health</b> care sector has been continued over the years in the CBSA regions. The major <b>health</b> care <b>clusters</b> are located in the East and West coasts, and the Sunbelt regions of the country. A panel data model is used to identify the factors affecting <b>health</b> care sector <b>cluster.</b> Among the competitive panel models, the fixed effects panel model turns out to have the best fit. The result of the fixed effects model identifies factors like local competition, a number of small size establishments, localization economies index, neighboring cluster, neighboring employment in the health care sector, the neighboring population, and health GDP as significantly contributing to <b>health</b> care <b>clustering.</b> In addition, this study also examines the spatial interactions between clusters. The the result of the spatial interaction between the clusters shows that a relatively small <b>health</b> care <b>cluster</b> like Columbia, MO has more influencing power to its neighboring clusters than St. Louis, MO or Los Angeles, CA.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis article {{discusses}} {{the factors that}} favored creation and expansion of the health organization cluster {{in the city of}} Ceres, Goiás. Despite the small population of some 19, 000 inhabitants, Ceres is recognized as a center for health services. This article investigates the creation and expansion of the <b>health</b> <b>cluster</b> in Ceres from two perspectives. The first considers the existence of so-called economic factors such as demand, infrastructure, presence of specialized skills, government policies, invitation to specialized professionals by businessmen and location on an important access route. The second takes into account sociological factors, highlighting social networks, professional and family ties, trust, values, rules and traditions as responsible for the multiplication of companies in the same sector in this location. Through an exploratory study based on interviews with 20 of the 65 physicians in the city, it is concluded {{that in the case of}} Ceres, great demand for health services, government actions to populate Brazil’s Mid-West and the activities of pioneers incentivating the entrepreneurial spirit of physicians were determining factors in the creation and expansion of this <b>health</b> <b>cluster...</b>|$|E
