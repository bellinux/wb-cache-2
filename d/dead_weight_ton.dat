50|$|As of 2016, {{there were}} more than 49,000 {{merchant}} ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> <b>tons.</b> Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships. Military forces operate vessels for naval warfare and to transport and support forces ashore. As of 2016, among the world's 104 navies, Korean People's Navy of North Korea had the most surface vessels (967), followed by People's Liberation Army Navy of China (714), the United States Navy (415), Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (398), and Russian Navy (352). The top 50 navies had a median fleet of 88 surface vessels each, according to various sources.|$|R
40|$|The {{seizure of}} the {{very large crude carrier}} (VLCC) Sirius Star (see {{previous}} article) unfortunately represents only the latest, though certainly the most high-profile, incidence of 2 ̆ 2 piracy 2 ̆ 2 in the Horn of Africa region. Indeed, as this article was going to press, numerous fresh incidents were being reported daily - notably the 30 November attack on the luxury cruise liner the M/S Nautica, carrying 656 passengers and 399 crew members. While the Nautica got away, largely by piling on speed and in effect outrunning the pirates (who reportedly got within 300 m of the vessel and fired eight shots at it), the brazen nature of the attack emphasizes that virtual no civilian vessel is immune from attack. While there has been a surge in piratical attacks in this region in recent months, the issue of armed attacks against shipping in these waters is of long-standing. Indeed, there were more than 700 piracy-style attacks recorded in the region in the 1993 - 2005 period. The seizure of such a large and modern vessel with such apparent ease and impunity has, however, seized the public imagination. At 330 metres long, the 318, 000 <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> <b>tons</b> Sirius Star is around the same length as an aircraft carrier. The ship cost around US 150 million to build and was only launched in April of this year. Even the (unsuccessful) 2005 attack on the luxury liner Seabourn Spirit, seizure of vessels carrying humanitarian aid and, more recently, the hijacking of a Ukrainian (though Belize registered) freighter, the MV Faina, carrying 33 Russian-made T- 72 tanks in October this year, dramatic as these events were, did not make such an impression. This is despite the fact that, with regard to the latter incident, controversy arose over the actual destination of this arms shipment in question (whilst it was stated that the arms were destined for the Kenyan Army, there were allegations that they were actually meant for the government of independence-seeking South Sudan - a charge strenuously denied by the Kenyan government). It is clear {{that there has been a}} significant surge in piracy attacks in recent weeks and months. According to the IMB 2 ̆ 7 s Piracy Reporting Centre, as of 22 November 2008, 92 attacks on vessels had taken place thus far in 2008 in the Gulf of Aden and off the east coast of Somalia - 36 of which had resulted in vessel hijackings. On the same date pirates were holding 14 vessels and 268 crew hostage. The IMB noted that between 10 and 16 November alone there had been 11 attacks in the region with three vessels hijacked and a further four fired upon with the Director of the IMB observing, with some understatement, that 2 ̆ 2 this criminal phenomenon is getting out of control. 2 ̆ 2 Citizens from many countries are involved: the crew of Sirius Star included Britons, Croats, Filipinos, Poles, and Saudis. How do these pirates operate and what are the factors behind these attacks...|$|R

5000|$|A simple {{vertical}} crack with {{a freshly}} fractured surface and old rust {{marks on the}} face was easily distinguished {{to the side of}} the centre joint, extending from the bottom flange to the top of the girder. This was associated with a casting defect hidden behind a surface skin of sound metal at the thickest part of the section where the flanges met the web. This was described by the accident report as a large honeycomb, or drawhole, which measured 3½ ins (c 90 mm) across at the face, and narrowed to about l½ ins (c 40 mm). inside , 2⅜ ins (c 60 mm) in extreme depth and 6ins (c 150 mm). in extreme length, extending inwards and downwards ...but not within 1 ½ ins of the outer face of the joint flange. The total capacity of the hole, measured by filling it with water, was 15 ½ cubic inches (about 250 ml) and, as the metal immediately round the hole was not sound, this amount does not measure the actual extent of the flaw. [...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a cold shut (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the line of holes. Whilst the metal appeared to be of good quality to the naked eye, the tested tensile strength of the metal varied widely from the lowest of ~4.5 tsi (c 70 MPa) (close to the honeycombing) with a mean of 7.5 tsi (c 115 MPa).The accident report says that the girder if sound would have had a breaking strength of 80 tons and concludes that the theoretical strength of the girder was ‘above but only just above’ the Board of Trade requirement (live load x 6 + dead load x 3) (However this appears inconsistent with the figures quoted by the report for <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> (21 <b>ton</b> shared between 2 girders) and live load (21 ton shared between two girders))The actual strength fell below this because of the casting defect; [...] "The sectional area of the bottom flange would at one place be reduced from 36 (sq) ins to only 28 (sq) ins, thus enormously reducing the strength of the girder" ...|$|R
