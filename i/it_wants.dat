5|$|The party {{supports}} {{an increase}} in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. <b>It</b> <b>wants</b> to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences. The party also wants to establish an ombudsman for victims and relatives, as it believes today's supportive concern focus {{too much on the}} criminals rather than the victims. <b>It</b> <b>wants</b> the police {{to be able to use}} more non-lethal weapons, such as electroshock weapons. It also does not accept any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Little brown bats produce {{calls that}} are high {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz. Bats usually emit 20 calls per second when in flight. When pursuing prey, a bat emits 200 calls per second. It also emits a high-pulse repetitive call if <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to land.|$|E

Development projects for Slettebakken, Wergeland, Paradis and Lagunen have been announced by private developers.

60|$|And he {{disappointed}} Princhester {{with his}} equipage. Princhester {{had a feeling}} that it deserved more for coming over to the church from nonconformity as it was doing. <b>It</b> <b>wanted</b> a bishop in a mitre and a gilt coach. <b>It</b> <b>wanted</b> a pastoral crook. <b>It</b> <b>wanted</b> something to go with its mace and its mayor. And (obsessed by The Snicker) <b>it</b> <b>wanted</b> less of Lady Ella. The cruelty and unreason of these attacks upon his wife distressed the bishop beyond measure, and baffled him hopelessly. He could not see any means of checking them nor of defending or justifying her against them.|$|R

5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> {{to start a}} data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E
5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} version, the Enterprise visits Naterra and meets the planet's leader, Zxolar, who {{is concerned that}} Captain Kirk is an alien called Komether who is due to return within twenty days to destroy their world. Zxolar suddenly collapses and Doctor McCoy tries to help him but an energy surrounds the doctor's head and he runs at a wall and disappears. The landing party search for McCoy {{but to no avail}} and Zxolar is beamed to the Enterprise. Doctor Chapel attempts to help him but the energy appears around her and she passes out. Xon and Kirk discuss the energy and realize <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> Zxolar to die as it has attacked anyone who helps him. The pair beam back down the planet to investigate the palace they met Zxolar in and discover an archive which shows them {{the original}} agreement made by six philosophers, including a much younger Zxolar, and Komether a thousand years earlier. They note one of the philosophers is Zxolar and the Komether is the energy being which attacked the two doctors. As in the later version used on Star Trek: The Next Generation, the agreement was that the being would correct the pollution of the planet in return for ownership of the planet a thousand years later. Xon and Kirk decide to move Zxolan to a life support table and ask for other volunteers as it is apparent that Komether will attack them as they attempt to save him. Scotty, Sulu and Chekov all volunteer as well, and the alien disables each of them as they move Zxolar. It is only because of Xon's strength as he is being attacked that they manage to attach Zxolar to a life support machine and his life signs immediately improve. Zxolar tells Kirk about the contract, who retrieves it from the planet's surface and challenges it. Komethar appears and agrees to a trial with the Enterprises computer acting as an impartial judge. Kirk realises that Komethar was created by the six philosophers and so as the last remaining, Zxolar is in control of it. Zxolar manages to defeat the creature using his will and releases the stunned crewmen. He finds that McCoy was trapped in the wall itself and releases him too, the Enterprise departing shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|GreenLeft values {{individual}} {{freedom and the}} rule of law. The party wants to legalise soft drugs. <b>It</b> <b>wants</b> to protect civil rights on the Internet by extending constitutional protection for free communication to email and other modern technologies. It also favours a reform of copyright to allow non-commercial reproduction and the use of open-source software in the public sector. In the long term, it seeks to abolish the monarchy and create a republic. It also favours a reduction {{of the size of the}} government bureaucracy, for instance by decreasing the number of Dutch ministries and abolishing the Senate. Finally, GreenLeft favours liberal immigration and asylum policies. <b>It</b> <b>wants</b> to empower victims of human trafficking by giving them a residence permit and <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to abolish the income requirements for marriage migration.|$|E

GreenLeft wants to increase spending on development aid to 0.8% of the gross national product. <b>It</b> <b>wants</b> to open the European markets to goods from Third World countries, under conditions of fair trade. In order to ensure free and fair trade, <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to increase and democratise international economic organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The party also favours greater international control over financial markets. GreenLeft favours European integration, but is critical about the current policies of the European Commission. It favoured the European Constitution, but after it was voted down in the 2005 referendum, GreenLeft advocated a new treaty which emphasised democracy and subsidiarity. The party is critical about the war against terrorism. <b>It</b> <b>wants</b> to strengthen the peacekeeping powers of the United Nations and reform the Dutch armed forces into a peace force, with the functions of NATO to {{be taken over by}} the European Union and the United Nations.|$|E
