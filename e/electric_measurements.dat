40|$|In medical devices, like stents being {{implanted}} {{into human}} body or apparatus for {{storage and transport}} of human blood, {{it is important to}} detect, reduce or prevent clot formation being dangerous for patients. Object of this thesis is a method for detecting clot formation and monitoring blood coagulation, said method making use of electric effects during blood coagulation. (Di) electric effects known for Naphtalin, water and polymers have to be verified for blood. For this purpose, (di) <b>electric</b> <b>measurements</b> are made on coagulating blood. Blood plasma becomes opaque when coagulating, thus coagulation of blood plasma is monitorable by optical measurements. The experimental setup comprises optical components as well as electrodes adapted to parallel optical measurement. Coagulation of blood being a viscoelastic material can be monitored by rheological measurements wherein storage modulus characterises coagulation of a blood sample. Both plates of the rheometer when isolated can be used as electrodes. Oscillatory rheological measurements on coagulating blood are combined with parallel <b>electric</b> <b>measurements</b> by means of an electrometer triggered by rheometer software. Parallel coagulation and <b>electric</b> <b>measurements</b> on blood plasma and blood demonstrate that electric signals arise and have characteristic parts according to the coagulation curves. The electric signals indicate start, progress and end of coagulation of the blood probe according to thickness of coagulated region for optical measurements on blood plasma and storage modulus for rheological measurements on blood. Coagulation of blood as a biopolymer comprises formation of a clot of fibrin. The biopolymerisation of fibrinogen to fibrin causes free charge carriers and/oder electric dipole moments providing electric fields being measurable. As a result, electric effects arise during blood coagulation and can be measured for detecting clot formation and monitoring blood coagulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In the {{deregulated}} electric industry, the generation, transmission, {{and distribution}} systems have become highly decentralized due to which estimating {{the state of}} the grid has become extremely complicated. Current state estimation methods are severely limited {{due to the lack of}} adequate interaction among subsystems in terms of exchanging <b>electric</b> <b>measurements.</b> There has been surge of research addressing this critically important issue using wide area measurement techniques, e. g., phasor measurement units, and employing sensor networks. This position paper outlines our research in the novel application of wireless sensor technology for assessing the structural health of transmission lines (mechanical measurements) to improve the observability and reliability of power systems. The use of mechanical measurements- such as temperature, tension, vibration, tilt – together with <b>electric</b> <b>measurements</b> enables not only to better estimate {{the state of the}} system, but also to detect imminent faults that are likely to occur in the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology through simulation studies using AREVA dispatch training simulator.
