25|$|Many early RISC designs {{also shared}} the {{characteristic}} {{of having a}} branch delay slot. A branch delay slot is an instruction space immediately following a jump or branch. The instruction <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>space</b> is executed, {{whether or not the}} branch is taken (in other words the effect of the branch is delayed). This instruction keeps the ALU of the CPU busy for the extra time normally needed to perform a branch. Nowadays the branch delay slot is considered an unfortunate side effect of a particular strategy for implementing some RISC designs, and modern RISC designs generally do away with it (such as PowerPC and more recent versions of SPARC and MIPS).|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} the uniform metric space M3 consisting of three points, each at unit distance from each other. The Vietoris–Rips complex of M3, for δ=1, includes a simplex for every subset of points in M3, including a triangle for M3 itself. If we embed M3 as an equilateral triangle in the Euclidean plane, then the Čech complex of the radius-1/2 balls centered at {{the points of}} M3 would contain all other simplexes of the Vietoris–Rips complex but would not contain this triangle, {{as there is no}} point of the plane contained in all three balls. However, if M3 is instead embedded into a metric space that contains a fourth point at distance 1/2 from each of the three points of M3, the Čech complex of the radius-1/2 balls <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>space</b> would contain the triangle. Thus, the Čech complex of fixed-radius balls centered at M3 differs depending on which larger space M3 might be embedded into, while the Vietoris–Rips complex remains unchanged.|$|E

25|$|Among the Horseman's Word {{group in}} Angus, {{initiation}} ceremonies typically {{took place at}} night, preferably {{at the time of}} the full moon, in an isolated barn, byre, stable, or steading. An individual known as the High Horseman would be seated <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>space,</b> holding a cloven goat's hoof in his hand; he would preside over the ceremony. The apprentice was then stripped to the waste and blindfolded, and spun around by his fellows in order to disorient him before being brought into the ceremonial space and made to stand before the High Horseman. The High Horseman asked a series of set questions of his fellows at which they responded with a series of set answers. Turning to the initiate, who I made to kneel and has his blindfold removed, the High Horseman then commanded the newcomer to provide vows to keep to the group's secrets. This achieved, all those assembled then recited the Horseman's Creed, which reminded them of the punishments that should befall them should they break their vows. Following the ceremony, a ceilidh was held in which toasts were made and the assembled horsemen drank from whisky that the apprentice had been required to bring with him.|$|E
25|$|Network {{effect is}} a benefit to {{society as a whole}} because it {{positively}} relates to and affects the Intellectual Commons, Property Rights, and Cultural Commons of the world. One form of network externality is social media, which is a peer-to-peer network ran by a privately held for profit business. Although the creation of a large network creates a barrier to entry according to Porters five forces and may prevent a few from creating a new form of P2P networking, it largely benefits society as whole and provides a new form of a common-pool resource so largely scalable that the entire world has the ability to use it. Although the barrier to entry may be high, there is no true form of monopoly in the P2P social sharing market. For example, Facebook holds a large stake in the P2P social sharing market, but it is not mutually exclusive, meaning users can have an account on Facebook and also have an account on Twitter.

The front line was relatively short: it stretched from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, near El Alamein railway station, to the effectively impassable Qattara Depression in the south, a distance of only about 30 miles.
