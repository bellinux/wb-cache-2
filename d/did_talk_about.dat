25|$|Griffin divulged in her standup {{that she}} is now banned from The View after talking about the gig on her {{televised}} comedy special, Kathy Griffin: Straight to Hell. While declining to discuss the ban on Access Hollywood, during the filming of an episode for My Life on the D-List with former View co-host/moderator Rosie O'Donnell, Griffin <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the ban, specifically targeting View executive producer Bill Geddie. Griffin had also been mentioned as a possible replacement for Walters when she departed the show. As of August 2009, Griffin had been un-banned from The View and was a guest on September 18, 2009, and June 15, 2010. However, {{in an interview on}} The Talk, Griffin has stated she has been re-banned from The View, due to an argument with View co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Griffin has since been unbanned once again and has appeared several times on the show, including as a guest co-host.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

The first appearance was in Justice Murphy's concurrence in Ex parte Endo, [...] The term was also used in other cases, such as Duncan v. Kahanamoku, [...] and Oyama v. California, [...] It then disappeared from the court's lexicon for 18 years—it reappeared in Brown v. Louisiana, [...] It did not appear in Loving v. Virginia, , even though that case <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> racial discrimination and interracial marriages.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Wikileaks {{published}} diplomatic cables attributing controversial {{comments on}} Islam to Lee. Wikileaks quoted Lee as having described Islam as a [...] "venomous religion". Lee called the remarks [...] "false" [...] {{and looked up}} to MFA's filenote of meeting and found no record of claim, he said [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> extremist terrorists like the Jemaah Islamiyah group, and the jihadist preachers who brainwashed them. They are implacable in wanting to put down all who {{do not agree with}} them. So their Islam is a perverted version, which the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Singapore do not subscribe to". He added that [...] "Singapore Muslim leaders were rational and that the ultimate solution to extremist terrorism was to give moderate Muslims the courage to stand up and speak out against radicals who hijacked Islam to recruit volunteers for their violent ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Richardson's early years beyond the few things that Richardson was willing to share. Although he was not {{forthcoming}} with specific events and incidents, he <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the origins of his writing ability; Richardson would tell stories to his friends and spent his youth constantly writing letters. One such letter, written when Richardson was almost 11, was directed to {{a woman in her}} 50s who was in the habit of constantly criticizing others. [...] "Assuming the style and address of a person in years", Richardson cautioned her about her actions. However, his handwriting was used to determine that it was his work, and the woman complained to his mother. The result was, as he explains, that [...] "my mother chid me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her years" [...] but also [...] "commended my principles, though she censured the liberty taken".|$|E

60|$|It was Morris's habit, {{whenever}} he could secure an evening to himself, {{which was not}} very often, {{to walk to the}} Rectory and smoke his pipe in the company of Mr. Fregelius. Had Mary chanced to be invisibly present, or to peruse a stenographic report of what passed at one of these evening calls--whereof, for reasons which she suppressed, she did not entirely approve--she might have found sufficient cause to vary her opinion. On these occasions ostensibly Morris went to talk about parish affairs, and, indeed, to a certain extent he <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them. For instance, Stella who had been so fond of music, once described to him the organ which she would like to have in the fine old parish church of Monksland. Now that renovated instrument stood there, and was the admiration of the country-side, as it well might be {{in view of the fact}} that it had cost over four thousand pounds.|$|E

And how she <b>did</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> you, and how she did long that the two ships might come together again! She kept asking me what I thought about the condition of your vessel and whether {{it would be like to}} sink if a storm came on. I could not help thinking that, as far as I knew anything about ships, you'd be likely to float for weeks after we'd gone down, but I didn't say that to her. And then she began to wonder if you had understood that she had received your message and was glad to get it. And I told her over and over and over again that you must have heard me, for I screamed my very loudest. I am very glad that I didn't know that you only caught those two words." ...|$|E
