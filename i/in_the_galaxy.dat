5|$|Although {{it appears}} that {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the first}} stars to be produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy,</b> their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is because there is a lack of star-forming gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> which results in old stellar populations.|$|E

5|$|No known {{globular}} clusters display active star formation, {{which is consistent}} with the view that {{globular clusters}} are typically the oldest objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 2010, astronomers using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory {{announced}} that, while {{viewing the}} remnant of SN 1979C <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> Messier 100, they have discovered an object {{which could be}} a young, 30-year-old black hole. NASA also noted the possibility this object could be a spinning neutron star producing a wind of high energy particles.|$|E
5|$|The third project {{topic was}} disk mass potential. This topic was {{designed}} to make measurements of the distances to disk stars {{as well as their}} proper motions. The results of the third topic of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental galactic parameters portion of the study to determine the Solar System's position and velocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b> The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Galaxy,</b> out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). They were to then use two different tests to determine the galactic potential at large radii.|$|E

5|$|Bornstellar and {{the humans}} awaken the Didact, a Warrior class {{who was one}} of the commanders of Forerunner {{military}} in the Forerunner-human war. He was exiled to stasis after coming into conflict with the Master Builder, the leader of the Forerunners. The Master Builder is responsible for the creation of the titular Halo superweapons. The Didact is married to the Librarian, one of the most powerful and influential Lifeworkers to have lived. She is a Lifeshaper, the highest rank a Lifeworker can achieve, and is responsible for indexing every species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> in the Ark.|$|E
5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E
5|$|In a post-credits cutscene, UNSC forces {{descend on}} the city of New Phoenix, the {{location}} the Didact used the Composer on, to find its inhabitants composed. In a narration, the Didact proclaims the Forerunner's role as custodians of the galaxy having to bear the Mantle of Responsibility, and humanity as the greatest threat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b> Master Chief removes his armor aboard Infinity; if the player completes the game on Legendary difficulty, the Chief's eyes are briefly shown.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} from a radio survey of <b>galaxies</b> detected by <b>the</b> IRAS minisurvey. It {{was found that the}} main difference between <b>galaxies</b> selected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> far infrared and those selected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> optical is that the former have higher radio luminosities and that the radio emission is more centrally concentrated. There is some evidence that the strong central radio sources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> selected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared are due to star formation, the star formation rate divided by <b>the</b> volume <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> star formation is occuring is 100 to 1000 times greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxies</b> selected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disks of normal galaxies...|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, {{the presence or absence of}} an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E
5|$|In series 3, {{after the}} events of series 2 are {{revealed}} to be a hallucination, Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect find themselves again stuck on prehistoric Earth. After being rescued, they find themselves transported to Lord's Cricket Ground just before it is destroyed by 11 white robots. Slartibartfast teaches Dent how cricket {{is based on the}} history of the worst wars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy,</b> and the pair travel to Krikkit in order to prevent another war. In the final part, Dent and Trillian meet the computer behind the Supernova Bomb and there is another attempt to find the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe and Everything.|$|E
5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E

5|$|Reception of {{the book}} has {{generally}} been positive. It has also become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps. Ender's Game won the 1985 Nebula Award for best novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for best novel. Its sequels, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind and Ender in Exile, follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b> In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts and novel Ender's Shadow take place {{during the same time}} period as the original.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{encounters}} heavy {{resistance from}} the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus. Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault {{with the assistance of}} the Galactic Federation navy. As they gain control of a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet create a wormhole and warp to Phaaze—the source of all Phazon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b> Samus travels to its core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Eventually, Samus appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished. Samus then takes off for Elysia, where she reflects on her deceased fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurement}} of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder {{that is used}} to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b>|$|E
