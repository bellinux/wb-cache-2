500|$|Of Rubber Souls [...] "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: [...] "it's like {{a million}} other songs written around the D chord. If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies... <b>it</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> that people still find new {{permutations}} of the same notes." [...] His other contribution to the album, [...] "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as [...] "ambiguous tonal coloring", using chromaticism in G major with a [...] "strange" [...] mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a [...] "tour de force of altered scale degrees". In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] and a guitar counter-melody on [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] mirrors Lennon's vocal line {{in much the same}} way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.|$|E

60|$|Strasbourg. We {{have seen}} Strasbourg--a palpably conquered city--and the Cathedral, which beats {{everything}} we have ever seen. Externally, <b>it</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>me,</b> which somehow I hadn't expected it to do. Strasbourg is gloomy, battered and painful; but apparently already much Germanized. We take tomorrow the formidable journey to Paris....|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you mean," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "that that pirate, after whom I {{sent the}} Badger, is your father? <b>It</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me!</b> The {{similarity}} of names did not strike me; I never imagined {{any connection between}} you and the captain of that pirate ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} {{observed}} how little young ladies are interested by books {{of a serious}} stamp, though written solely for their benefit. <b>It</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me,</b> I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin." ...|$|E
60|$|Really, Arthur, <b>it</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> {{that a man}} in your {{position}} can be influenced by such absurd trifles. It's so unfair, when a boy has a dozen solid real virtues that you should refuse to recommend him for a job because he hasn't got in your opinion a frivolous, unsubstantial advantage like charm.|$|E

60|$|It {{was only}} then that I really got on to the {{extremely}} rummy attitude of the chappie, {{in view of the fact}} that a quite unexpected mess of the right stuff had suddenly descended on him from a blue sky. To my mind it was an occasion for the beaming smile and the joyous whoop; yet here the man was, looking and talking as if Fate had swung on his solar plexus. <b>It</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{had it all}} fixed up. The whole lovely {{programme}} {{from start}} to finish. <b>It</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>me</b> to think that one so divinely beautiful could {{at the same time}} be so fiendishly vindictive. It occurred to me, however, that she had overlooked one little factor in her revenge, and so, without any intent to add to her discomfiture, but rather to permit her to rearrange her plans along more practical lines, I pointed to the nearest port-hole.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Captain Bassett,' she has said, 'how very splendid of you! Ever since I {{first saw}} him have I loved Alexander. I cannot tell you how {{grateful}} I am.

6000|$|... "He amazes me, this man," [...] said he, in his slow, languid {{voice that}} {{never seemed to}} change its level. [...] "That he should alter his course for us is in itself matter for wonder; but that he should take a risk on our behalf--that he should venture into Jamaica waters.... <b>It</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me,</b> as I have said." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carley {{leaned her}} {{elbows on the}} table and gazed at him curiously and admiringly. [...] "Old fellow, you're a wonder. I can't tell you how proud I am of you.

Of course it was right that I should speak, and, in as few words as possible, I told her what Kitty and I had been saying to each other. I never saw Kitty's mother look so cheerful and so {{handsome}} as when she came forward and kissed her daughter and shook hands with me. She seemed so perfectly satisfied that <b>it</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>me.</b> After a little Kitty left us, and then Mrs. Carson asked me to sit by her on a rustic bench.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Wooster, I am {{not ashamed}} {{to say that the}} tears came into my eyes as I listened to them. <b>It</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> that a man as young as you can have been able to plumb human nature so surely to its depths; to play with so unerring a hand on the quivering heart-strings of your reader; to write novels so true, so human, so moving, so vital!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I!" [...] the King answered. [...] "Yet I {{know your}} terms {{as they were}} {{proposed}} to Nicholas of Reist, and <b>it</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> only {{that you should have}} expected men in whose hands remain the destinies of their country to give you even a patient hearing. My Councillors, give this man the answer his insolent mission deserves, and let him be shown across the frontier. We will before long show Europe how we deal with our enemies. The Turks are not yet at the gates of the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|And Jude {{fell into}} thought. [...] "I {{have seemed to}} myself lately," [...] he said, [...] "to belong to that vast band of men shunned by the virtuous--the men called seducers. <b>It</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> when I think of it! I have not been {{conscious}} of it, or of any wrongdoing towards you, whom I love more than myself. Yet I am one of those men! I wonder if any other of them are the same purblind, simple creatures as I? ... Yes, Sue--that's what I am. I seduced you... You were a distinct type--a refined creature, intended by Nature to be left intact. But I couldn't leave you alone!" ...|$|E
60|$|Upon {{going to}} dinner one day, I found him soberly seated {{at my own}} mess; and at first I could not but feel some very serious scruples about dining with him. Nevertheless, {{he was a man}} to study and digest; so, upon a little reflection; I was not displeased at his presence. <b>It</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>me,</b> however, that he had wormed himself into the mess, since so many of the other messes had {{declined}} the honour, until at last, I ascertained that he had induced a mess-mate of ours, a distant relation of his, to prevail upon the cook to admit him.|$|R

[...] "I didn't think it would work," [...] Chuck D admitted of the full-length performance. [...] "But it ended up being something that worked tremendously well. Now we have a problem to get away from <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>me</b> {{that a lot of people}} who have gravitated to the album weren't even born when it was recorded.

5000|$|Of the {{recording}} process, Marshall Chess, {{the president of}} Rolling Stones Records at the time, said in 2002, [...] "We used to book studios for a month, 24 hours a day, so that the band could keep the same set-up and develop their songs in their free-form way, starting with a few lyrics and rhythms, jamming and rehearsing while we fixed the sound. <b>It</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>me,</b> as an old-time record guy, that the Stones might not have played together for six or eight months, but {{within an hour of}} jamming, the synergy that is their strength would come into play and they would lock it together as one..." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have only}} to add to this first preface, that the boldness of the pamphlet,--ungraceful enough, it must be admitted,--has done no one any harm, that I know of; but on the contrary, some {{definite}} good, as far as I can judge; and that I republish the whole now, letter for letter, as originally printed, believing it likely to be still serviceable, and, on the ground it takes for argument, (Scriptural authority,) incontrovertible {{as far as it}} reaches; though <b>it</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> to find on re-reading it, that, so late as 1851, I had only got the length of perceiving the schism between sects of Protestants to be criminal, and ridiculous, while I still supposed the schism between Protestants and Catholics to be virtuous and sublime.|$|E
6000|$|I {{am telling}} a story, and not propounding {{theories}} in this book; and chiefly I am {{telling of the}} ideas and influences and emotions that have happened to me--me {{as a sort of}} sounding board for my world. The moralist is at liberty to go over my conduct with his measure and say, [...] "At this point or at that you went wrong, and you ought to have done"--so-and-so. The point of interest to the statesman is that it didn't for a moment occur to us to do so-and-so when the time for doing it came. <b>It</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> now to think how little either of us troubled about the established rights or wrongs of the situation. We hadn't an atom of respect for them, innate or acquired. The guardians of public morals will say we were very bad people; I submit in defence that they are very bad guardians--provocative guardians.... And when at last there came a claim against us that had an effective validity for us, we were in the full tide of passionate intimacy.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it {{happened}} to the Canadian Bagne, who went in 1927 in the best flying-ship ever made, and which it was supposed could be steadily kept upon its way {{without regard to the}} influence of the strongest winds; but a great hurricane came down from the north, as if square miles of atmosphere were driving onward in a steady mass, and hurled him and his ship against an iceberg, and nothing of his vessel but pieces of wood and iron, which the bears could not eat, was ever seen again. This was the last polar expedition of that sort, or any sort; but my plan is so easy of accomplishment--at least, so it seems to me--and so devoid of risk and danger, that <b>it</b> <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> that it has never been tried before. In fact, if I had not thought that it would be such a comparatively easy thing to go to the pole, I believe I should have been there long ago; but I have always considered that it could be done at some season when more difficult and engrossing projects were not pressing upon me.|$|E
