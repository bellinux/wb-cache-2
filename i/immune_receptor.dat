30|$|Cell surface <b>immune</b> <b>receptors,</b> {{which often}} {{perceive}} conserved microbial signatures present outside host cells, represent a {{first line of}} defense against potential pathogens. Well characterized plant cell surface <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> include Arabidopsis FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS 2), which recognizes a 22 amino acid epitope derived from bacterial flagellin (flg 22) (Boller and Felix 2009), EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) which recognizes an 18 amino acid epitope derived from bacterial elongation factor-Tu (elf 18) (Zipfel et al. 2006), and rice XA 21, which recognizes a 21 amino acid tyrosine-sulfated epitope derived from the bacterial protein REQUIRED FOR ACTIVATION OF XA 21 -MEDIATED IMMUNITY X (RaxX; RaxX 21 -sY) (Pruitt et al. 2015). These <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> fall into the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase class (LRR-RLK) consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide, predicted extracellular LRR domain, transmembrane domain and an intracellular kinase domain. Upon microbial recognition, the kinase domain is hypothesized to initiate a signaling cascade that leads to resistance against specific pathogens. These <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> require the presence of LRR-RLK co-receptors {{that are part of the}} SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) family. For example, FLS 2 -mediated immune response requires the BRI 1 -ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE (BAK 1) (Chinchilla et al. 2007) and XA 21 -mediated immune response requires OsSERK 2 (Chen et al. 2014).|$|R
50|$|Immunoglobulin E (IgE) {{signaling}} is {{the first}} convincingly demonstrated lipid rafts involving signaling process. Evidence for this fact includes decreased solubility of Fc-epsilon receptors (FcεR) in Triton X-100 from steady state to crosslinking state, formation of patches {{large enough to be}} visualized by fluorescence microscopy from gangliosides and GPI-anchored proteins, abolition of IgE signaling by surface cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and so on. This signaling pathway can be described as follows: IgE first binds to Fc-epsilon receptors (FcεR) residing in the plasma membrane of mast cells and basophils through its Fc segment. FcεR is a tetramer consist of one α, one β and two γ chains. It is monomeric and binds one IgE molecule. The α chain binds IgE and the other three chains contain <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM). Then oligomeric antigens bind to receptor-bound IgE to crosslink two or more of these receptors. This crosslinking then recruits doubly acylated non-receptor Src-like tyrosine kinase Lyn to phosphorylate ITAMs. After that, Syk family tyrosine kinases bind these phosphotyrosine residues of ITAMs to initiate the signaling cascade. Syk can, in turn, activate other proteins such as LAT. Through crosslinking, LAT can recruit other proteins into the raft and further amplify the signal.|$|E

[...] During his DFG-funded fellowship in the laboratory of Prof. Arthur Krieg in Iowa City (USA) in 1998/1999 he identified the molecular patterns that are responsible for immunorecognition of DNA (so-called CpG motifs detected via the innate <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> Toll-like receptor 9, TLR9). [...] Back in Munich he continued to work on the immunological activities of CpG oligonucleotides in the human system. He found that the direct recognition of CpG motifs via TLR9 is restricted to B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the only two immune cell subsets in humans that express TLR9. Notably, CpG DNA was the first molecularly defined stimulus to activate the plasmacytoid dendritic cell, a cell type first described only in 1999. Based on the insight in the biological function he established different classes of CpG oligonucleotides (CpG-A, CpG-B and CpG-C). Together with Arthur Krieg he published the CpG oligonucleotide ODN 2006 which later was clinically developed by Coley Pharmaceuticals and is currently (2013) studied in phase III clinical trials as immune adjuvant in a novel type of cancer vaccine.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The rice XA 21 <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> kinase and the {{structurally}} related XA 3 receptor confer {{immunity to}} Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight.

Rice plants silenced for OsSerk 2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK 2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK 2 undergoes bidi-rectional transphosphorylation with XA 21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA 21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK 2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interac-tion with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK 2 -meditated regulation of rice XA 21, XA 3, and FLS 2 differs from that of AtSERK 3 /BAK 1 -mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS 2 and EFR.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of the immunological repertoire {{has long been a}} subject of research focus, providing important insights into the adaptive immune system. Rapid developments in next generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the way immunological repertoires are analyzed, providing unprecedented high-resolution data. Nonetheless, these high-throughput approaches also present unique computational challenges that must be addressed through the development of accurate and efficient bioinformatics pipelines. In this thesis, we demonstrated a complete bioinformatics workflow for processing and analysis of high-throughput sequences from immune receptors, and applied these tools to explore research questions relating to the {{diversity of}} <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes in human populations. An aspect of the immunological repertoire that is frequently of immediate interest to immunologists is the distribution of different <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> clonotypes among individuals, as knowledge of this could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamics of the immune system in different conditions. We first implemented a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze next generation sequencing data from T cell receptors and immunoglobulins. This pipeline featured an ultra-fast and accurate fast-tag-searching algorithm for VDJ alignments, which outperformed all the other similar pipelines on benchmarking. In addition to that, this pipeline included two novel functional components. The first function was polymorphism analysis, which reports putative novel SNPs found in the input sequences. The second novel function was the ability to construct lineage mutation trees to describe the affinity maturation process of immunoglobulins. No matter how sophisticated the alignment algorithms are, accurate gene alignment always requires the right reference database. Unfortunately, the IMGT database, which is the most widely used reference database in immunological repertoire analysis pipelines, has been shown to be incomplete and to contain numerous errors. Thus, the second task undertaken in this PhD thesis was to create a more comprehensive reference database for T cell receptors and immunoglobulin genes by exploiting the large volume of publicly available human genome resequencing data generated in recent years. Based on the variant calling information retrieved from the 1000 Genomes Project and the current human reference genomes, we were able to infer a set of putative alleles of <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes. Lym 1 k, our database of these inferred alleles, provided a more comprehensive collection of <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> alleles found in global human populations, as evidenced by a significantly improved alignment performance on real datasets compared to IMGT. The <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> loci are among the most dynamic regions of the human genome, with a high rate of structural variation, as well as high allelic diversity. Previous analyses of the allelic diversity of <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes in global human populations were constrained by the limited size of human genome resequencing data. We focused on addressing three research questions relating to the allelic diversity of <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes in our last research chapter. Firstly, it has been shown by many studies that African populations have greater overall allelic richness than other human populations, we thus compared the allelic diversity between African and Non-African populations for <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes. Not surprisingly, the <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> alleles in African populations were more diversified compared to Non-African populations. As the <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes with the same gene type are located adjacent to each other on the chromosome, we secondly investigated if genomic location was associated with allelic diversity, potentially reflecting differences in the frequency of receptor gene use between genes located towards the proximal or distal ends of the arrays of genes of a given type. However, we did not find an effect of position on allelic diversity. Lastly, we hypothesized that <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes that are more frequently selected during rearrangement are under higher diversifying selection pressure, and this would lead to a higher allelic diversity. Surprisingly, the correlation was absent from most of the gene types except for weak positive correlations in TCRA genes. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated several novel high-throughput approaches and strategies for immunological repertoire analysis. It also addressed some important biological questions relating to the allelic diversity of <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> genes by exploiting public biological resources, which could potentially inform subsequent studies...|$|E

40|$|Background: The plant {{immune system}} is innate and encoded in the germline. Using it efficiently, plants are capable of {{recognizing}} a diverse range of rapidly evolving pathogens. A recently described phenomenon shows that plant <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> are able to recognize pathogen effectors through the acquisition of exogenous protein domains from other plant genes. Results: We show that plant <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> with integrated domains are distributed unevenly across their phylogeny in grasses. Using phylogenetic analysis, we uncover a major integration clade, whose members underwent repeated independent integration events producing diverse fusions. This clade is ancestral in grasses with members often found on syntenic chromosomes. Analyses of these fusion events reveals that homologous receptors can be fused to diverse domains. Furthermore, we discover a 43 amino acids long motif associated with this dominant integration clade and that is located immediately upstream of the fusion site.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plants deploy <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> {{to detect}} pathogen-derived {{molecules}} and initiate defense responses. Intracellular plant <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> called nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins contain a central nucleotide-binding (NB) domain {{followed by a}} series of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and are key initiators of plant defense responses. However, recent studies demonstrated that NLRs with non-canonical domain architectures {{play an important role in}} plant immunity. These composite <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> are thought to arise from fusions between NLRs and additional domains that serve as "baits" for the pathogen-derived effector proteins, thus enabling pathogen recognition. Several names have been proposed to describe these proteins, including "integrated decoys" and "integrated sensors". We adopt and argue for "integrated domains" or NLR-IDs, which describes the product of the fusion without assigning a universal mode of action. RESULTS: We have scanned available plant genome sequences for the full spectrum of NLR-IDs to evaluate the diversity of integrations of potential sensor/decoy domains across flowering plants, including 19 crop species. We manually curated wheat and brassicas and experimentally validated a subset of NLR-IDs in wild and cultivated wheat varieties. We have examined NLR fusions that occur in multiple plant families and identified that some domains show re-occurring integration across lineages. Domains fused to NLRs overlap with previously identified pathogen targets confirming that they act as baits for the pathogen. While some of the integrated domains have been previously implicated in disease resistance, others provide new targets for engineering durable resistance to plant pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: We have built a robust reproducible pipeline for detecting variable domain architectures in plant <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> across species. We hypothesize that NLR-IDs that we revealed provide clues to the host proteins targeted by pathogens, and that this information can be deployed to discover new sources of disease resistance...|$|R

ELR associates with the immune co-receptor BAK 1 /SERK 3 and mediates broad-spectrum recognition of elicitin proteins from several Phytophthora species, including four diverse elicitins from P. infestans. Transfer of ELR into cultivated potato resulted in enhanced resistance to P. infestans. Pyramiding cell surface pattern recognition <b>receptors</b> with intracellular <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> could maximize the potential of generating a broader and potentially more durable resistance to this devastating plant pathogen. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important non-grain food crop and a major source of calories for the world's poor 5. Increasing potato production is critical to prevent global malnutrition and hunger in an era of expanding world population. Unfortunately, potato suffers from the devastating late blight disease, which is {{caused by the}} notorious oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. To limit losses to late blight, potato breeders rely on fungicide treatment and breeding of disease resistance (R) genes, all of which identified thus far belong to the coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) class of <b>immune</b> <b>receptors.</b> These intracellular proteins recognize pathogen avirulence (Avr) proteins of the RxLR class of effectors to mount defence responses. However, RxLR effectors display high evolutionary rates 4, and as a result, P. infestans can rapidly circumvent recognition by intracellular R <b>immune</b> <b>receptors,</b> thereby limiting the development of sustainable and durable genetic resistance. Therefore, novel types of <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> that recognize a broader spectrum of pathogen molecules are needed. To fend off pathogens, plants rely on two classes of <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> that either reside inside the plant cell (NB-LRRs) or on the cell surface. The first line of defence is initiated by surface receptors, also called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs are characteristically receptor-like proteins (RLPs), such as Ve 1 /Ve 26, Cfs 7, 8 and LeEIX 19, or receptor-like kinases (RLKs), such as FLS 2, EFR and XA 2110. PRRs typically recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 11. So far, only a relatively few cell surface receptors against agronomically important pathogens have been identified. Elicitins are structurally conserved extracellular proteins in Phytophthora and Pythium pathogen species (Pfam PF 00964) 12,​ 13,​ 14. P. infestans contains six elicitin genes that are conserved among different strains 13, 15. Elicitins are recognized as oomycete PAMPs but their intrinsic function in oomycetes is to bind lipids. Some elicitins sequester sterols from plants, thereby fulfilling an important biological function in Phytophthora and Pythium species that cannot synthesize sterols 12. Targeting such conserved ‘Achilles heel’ proteins of pathogens is expected to lead to a more broad-spectrum resistance. To identify novel types of potential <b>immune</b> <b>receptors</b> against the potato late blight pathogen, we initiated the cloning of ELR, a gene that determines response to elicitins 16. We screened a collection of wild Solanum germplasm by Potato virus X (PVX) agroinfection for responses to INF 1, a secreted elicitin of P. infestans (Fig. 1 a). Solanum microdontum genotype mcd 360 - 1 consistently responded to INF 1 with a cell death response (Fig. 1 b). We crossed mcd 360 - 1 with S. microdontum ssp. gigantophyllum gig 714 - 1 that does not respond to INF 1.

40|$|The <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> {{signaling}} pathway is used by nonimmune cells, but the molecular adaptations that underlie its functional diversification are not known. Circulating platelets use the <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> homologue glycoprotein VI (GPVI) to respond to collagen exposed at sites of vessel injury. In contrast to immune cell responses, platelet activation must take place within seconds to successfully form thrombi in flowing blood. Here, we show that the GPVI receptor utilizes a unique intracellular proline-rich domain (PRD) to accelerate platelet activation, a requirement for efficient platelet adhesion to collagen under flow. The GPVI PRD specifically binds the Src-family kinase Lyn and directly activates it, presumably through SH 3 displacement. In resting platelets, Lyn is constitutively bound to GPVI in an activated state and platelets lacking Lyn exhibit defective collagen adhesion like that of platelets with GPVI receptors lacking the PRD. These findings define a molecular priming mechanism that enables an immune-type receptor to adopt a hemostatic function. These studies also demonstrate that active kinases can constitutively associate with immune-type receptors without initiating signal transduction before receptor ligation, consistent with a recent molecular model of <b>immune</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling in which receptor ligation is required to bring active kinases to their receptor substrates...|$|E
