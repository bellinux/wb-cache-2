5000|$|AC to DC {{synchronous}} <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> {{were made}} obsolete by mercury arc rectifiers in the 1930s {{and later on}} by semiconductor rectifiers in the 1960s. Some of the original New York City Subway substations using synchronous <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> operated until 1999. Compared to the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter,</b> the mercury arc and semiconductor rectifiers did not need daily maintenance, manual synchronizing for parallel operation, nor skilled personnel, and they provided clean DC power. This enabled the new substations to be unmanned, only requiring periodic visits from a technician for inspection and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> over the discrete motor-generator set is that the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> avoids converting all of the power flow into mechanical energy and then back into electrical energy; some of the electrical energy instead flows directly from input to output, allowing the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> to be much smaller and lighter than a motor-generator set of an equivalent power-handling capability. The advantages of a motor-generator set include adjustable voltage regulation which can compensate for voltage drop in the supply network; it also provided complete power isolation, harmonics isolation, greater surge and transient protection, and sag (brownout) protection through increased momentum.|$|R
50|$|One way to {{envision}} {{what is happening}} in an AC-to-DC <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> is to imagine a rotary reversing switch that is being driven at a speed that is synchronous with the power line. Such a switch could rectify the AC input waveform with no magnetic components at all save those driving the switch. The <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> is somewhat more complex than this trivial case because it delivers near-DC rather than the pulsating DC that would result from just the reversing switch, but the analogy may be helpful in understanding how the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> avoids transforming all of the energy from electrical to mechanical and back to electrical.|$|R
50|$|At each facility, {{power from}} an AC power grid was {{converted}} to DC to feed into an overhead line or a third rail of a railway. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converter</b> plants {{were also used}} for coupling power grids of different frequencies and operation modes.

The substation received 11000 volts AC electricity from the New Farm Power station, via an underground feeder cable. The transformer reduced this supply, which the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> then converted to 600 volts DC for the tramways network.|$|R

50|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, 25 Hz power was much more readily available from commercial electrical utilities. The vast majority of urban subway systems used 25 Hz power to supply their lineside <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> used to generate the DC voltage supplied to the trains. Since <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> work more efficiently with lower frequency supplies, 25 Hz was a common supply frequency for these machines. <b>Rotary</b> <b>converters</b> have been steadily replaced over the past 70 years with, at first, mercury arc rectifiers and more lately solid-state rectifiers. Thus, the need for special frequency power for urban traction has disappeared, along with the financial motivation for utilities to operate generators at these frequencies.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{electrical}} rail vehicles employ four-quadrant {{voltage source}} converters, which allow independent control of real and reactive power. This thesis focuses {{the control of}} reactive power at the vehicle regarding load flow and stability. Settings for power factor {{as a function of}} voltage were proposed in a project fall 2010, aiming to reduce line loss and increase transmission capacity. This thesis is mainly a further investigation of some of the settings proposed. One of the proposed settings for controlling reactive power is found to reduce the load of a <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> station in the range of 0 - 3 %. Total system losses are reduced by 0. 21 - 0. 33 %. During traction, the problematic issue regarding stability is found to be speed oscillations of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter.</b> Controlling reactive power is found to have a limited damping effect on speed oscillations of a <b>rotary</b> <b>converter.</b> Other works have investigated how speed oscillations of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> can be damped by controlling the real power of the vehicle; the real power control is found to have a clearly better effect than reactive. During no-load operation, the problematic issue regarding stability is found to be oscillations caused by the vehicle and its control system. The vehicle control system and its response to the line voltage may cause instability, especially at long line lengths, regardless of any <b>rotary</b> <b>converter.</b> As reactive power has a significant effect on the line voltage, reactive power may be controlled in a manner increasing the damping of such oscillations significantly. Finally the thesis describes how a simulation model of a modern electrical rail vehicle for stability analysis can be made from the steady state characteristics and the input admittance of the vehicle, without knowing the complete vehicle model. The settings which where proposed and investigated in this project are optimized for a system fed by stiff voltage sources, not by <b>rotary</b> <b>converters,</b> and a more complete optimization for a system fed by <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> would be of interest. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Modern {{electric}} rail vehicles cause low-frequency rotor oscillations in the <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> of the Norwegian railway power supply.

Further it is described qualitatively how interaction between these modes may lead to power system instability...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> can {{be thought}} of as a motor-generator, where the two {{machines}} share a single rotating armature and set of field coils. The basic construction of the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> consists of a DC generator (dynamo) with a set of slip rings tapped into its rotor windings at evenly spaced intervals. When a dynamo is spun the electric currents in its rotor windings alternate as it rotates in the magnetic field of the stationary field windings. This alternating current is rectified by means of a commutator which allows DC current to be extracted from the rotor. This principle is taken advantage of by energizing the same rotor windings with AC power which causes the machine to act as a synchronous AC motor. The rotation of the energized coils excites the stationary field windings producing part of the DC current. The other part is AC current from the slip rings which is directly rectified into DC by the commutator. This makes the <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> a hybrid dynamo and mechanical rectifier. When used in this way it is referred to as a synchronous <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> or simply a synchronous converter. The AC slip rings also allow the machine to act as an alternator.|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian {{traction}} power {{system is a}} 15 kV single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power system. The {{traction power}} system is mainly supplied by <b>rotary</b> frequency <b>converters</b> that convert three-phase 50 Hz power from the utility grid to single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power. In recent times, static frequency converters (power electronic converters) have also been introduced. Parts of the traction power system are quite weak; consisting of long, radial lines with high impedance. Since the 1990 s, the introduction of advanced rail vehicles has revealed a poorly damped eigenmode around 1. 6 Hz in the <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> used to supply power to the system. In weak parts of the traction power system, the advanced rail vehicles can excite this eigenmode with their fast control systems, creating low frequency voltage oscillations in the traction power system. This thesis presents the work in investigating whether the static converters in the traction power system {{could be used to}} dampen low frequency oscillations and stabilise the traction power system. A central part of the work is the developing a model of a static converter in the PSCAD/EMTDC software, including a control system. For the purpose of recreating the low frequency oscillation problem, a <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> is also modelled, modifying synchronous machine models in the PSCAD model library. The traction power system is synchronised with the 50 Hz utility grid, so a control algorithm governing the frequency and phase angle of the static converter is implemented in the static converter control system, to allow both the static <b>converter</b> and <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> model to maintain synchronism and operate in parallel. An existing advanced rail vehicle model developed in [4] and implemented in PSCAD in [8] is also added, forming a small model of a traction power system. The model of a static <b>converter,</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> and advanced rail vehicle are combined to form a test-bench to study the how the static converter control system can be used to mitigate the low frequency oscillation problem. A Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller is implemented in the static converter's control system and tested. The static converter is found to provide extra stability to the traction power system when interconnected with a <b>rotary</b> <b>converter,</b> compared to situations were only <b>rotary</b> <b>converters</b> are present in the system, or worse, when a <b>rotary</b> <b>converter</b> operates in stand-alone mode. Implementation of a POD controller was also found to be effective in adding additional damping to the low frequency oscillations, but also revealed potential negative interaction issues with advanced rail vehicles. </p...|$|R
