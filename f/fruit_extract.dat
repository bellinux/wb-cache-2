40|$|PURPOSE: To {{explore the}} {{usefulness}} of <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> as enhancers of the oral absorption of esterase-sensitive prodrugs. METHODS: Inhibition of esterase-mediated degradation by nature-identical <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> was evaluated using 1) p-nitrophenylacetate (model substrate for esterase-activity) in rat intestinal homogenates and 2) bis(isopropyloxycarbonyloxymethyl) -(R) - 9 -[(2 -phosphonomethoxy++ +) propyl]adenine [bis(POC) -PMPA] (esterase-sensitive prodrug of the antiviral agent PMPA) in Caco- 2 cell homogenates and in intestinal homogenates from rat, pig and man. Subsequently, transport of the ester prodrug was studied across Caco- 2 monolayers in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts.</b> RESULTS: In homogenates from rat ileum, the esterase activity could be reduced significantly by the inclusion of <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> (1 %) : the initial enzymatic degradation of p-nitrophenylacetate was inhibited by 77 % (strawberry), 16 % (passion fruit) and 57 % (banana). A similar inhibition of bis(POC) -PMPA metabolism by <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> was observed in intestinal homogenates from several species and in homogenates from Caco- 2 cells. Transport of total PMPA across Caco- 2 monolayers was enhanced 3 -fold by co-incubation with strawberry extract (1 %). The fraction of intact prodrug appearing in the acceptor compartment increased from virtually zero to 67 %. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that co-incubation with nature-identical <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> might be useful as a strategy to enhance the transepithelial transport of esterase-sensitive prodrugs through inhibition of intracellular metabolism of the prodrug. status: publishe...|$|R

The antioxidant activities were evaluated by four assays: a biological assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DPPH radical scavenging activity, chelating ability for ferrous ions and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The phenols and flavonoids contents of the hot water extracts were in the range of 17. 7 to 94. 7 mg/g and 12. 3 to 295. 4 mg/g, whereas the endopolysaccharides lie in the range of 4. 5 to 77. 4 mg/g and 22. 7 to 230. 0 mg/g.

40|$|Background: Nowadays {{antioxidants}} {{from plants}} origin are {{considered as a}} promising source of biologically active substances; as synthetic agents are accompanied {{with a number of}} side effects. Materials and Methods: Three <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> Prunus domestica (plum), Prunus persica (peach) and Prunus avium (cherry) of family Rosaceae and genus Prunus were prepared and characterized. These natural antioxidant extracts were used for the development of stable oil/water emulsions. DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) assay was used to evaluate antioxidant activities of various <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> alone and in emulsions containing these extracts. Novel o/w emulsions were developed by using a suitable combination of oil phase and aqueous phase loaded with natural <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts.</b> Physicochemical parameters i. e. organoleptic evaluation (color, liquefaction and phase separation), pH and conductivity were monitored at 8 oC, 25 oC, 40 oC, 40 oC + 75 % relative humidity and 50 oC for 3 months as per stability studies guidelines. Results: Various <b>fruit</b> <b>extracts</b> and emulsions containing these extracts showed good and comparable antioxidant activities.
