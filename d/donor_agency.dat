40|$|The {{failure of}} {{development}} in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, {{since the beginning of}} the post-independence era, has resulted in intense discourse both in academia and in the public domains. The blame game between the so-called “developing countries” and their donor counterparts has, over the past six decades, been an area of intense analysis due to the conditions often imposed by <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> on their recipients. The unequal relationship between the recipient and the donor has influenced the success and/or failure of donor-funded development programs. This article is theory-based; and, it examines the skewed relationship between sub-Saharan African governments and international <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> and its influence on success and/or failures of such interventions. Data was gathered using a systematic review of the literature with specific focus on themes related to <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> and their relationship with Africa. The analysis was thematic; isolating key issues relevant to the topic. The article argues that states in sub-Saharan Africa should manage and govern the seemingly ungovernable <b>donor</b> <b>agencies.</b> Importantly, politicisation of foreign development assistance for Africa should be eliminated through approaches that develop solid resource-base and increased African state capacity manage and govern own affairs with minimal, if any, external influence of the stultifying <b>donor</b> <b>agencies...</b>|$|R

50|$|Typically, a <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> (such as UK’s Department for International Development (DfID), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)) hires a {{development}} contractor (such as KPMG or Palladium International) {{to host the}} funding competition around a broader sector (such as food trade, agriculture, or education in a specific geography) to solicit innovative proposals that otherwise may not be discovered through more traditional grant-making or funding mechanisms. Alternatively, challenge funds are often used as ways to address what development partners describe as a Grand Challenge, which is a challenge fund focused on soliciting proposals around a very specific critical barrier that, if removed, would help solve an important health problem in the developing world, with a high likelihood of global impact through widespread implementation.|$|E

Some research has tried to test some of the ideas involved and at least one <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> issued a guidance note for its own programmes. [...] Important critiques were developed by NGOs such as Conciliation Resources and The Asia Foundation, focused primarily on Whaites proposition that a 'political settlement' drives state-building. There have also been attempts to test out the thesis by looking at individual areas of state provision, particularly the area of healthcare. Further research on state society relations has also been undertaken by groups including the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium and the Crisis States Research Centre.|$|E

50|$|Firstly, {{large sums}} of foreign aid inhibit {{accountability}} relations {{between the government and}} its citizens. Governments develop a responsibility towards the donors when receiving aid but not towards taxpayers, therefore undermining the responsiveness towards citizens. Only when aid {{is in the form of}} a loan, and citizens understand that it will be repaid with their taxes, accountability links are fostered. Secondly, aid can affect the legitimacy of a state and this can potentially impact tax revenues therefor creating a vicious circle. When citizens identify that foreign aid sponsored the infrastructure development or health improvements, they might be less likely to pay their taxes and comply with their responsibility as citizens, which would in turn affect the national revenues and the state capacity to invest in development. Finally, foreign aid does not require governments to develop a strong revenue collection capacity. On the contrary, aid needs governments that lack capacity and therefor creates incentives for both <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> employees and host country employees to resist effective revenue collection capacity building. Taxation on the other hand does require capacity, and as countries move down the scale from simple trade taxes to consumption and income taxes, the demands on capacity rise. This creates an effective stimulus that donor’s conditionality has not been able to provide. Although there are special cases where foreign aid can lead to further development of institutions, as the example of Zambia in the 1990s suggests, most cases indicate that, in fact, there exists a negative association between foreign aid and tax revenue.|$|E

This study examines the practices of Sida engaged as a <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> in a PPP with UNIDO and Volvo in a project called Heavy Duty Equipment and Commercial Vehicles Maintenance Training Academy (HDECoVA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The analysis of documents and interviews collected during a field trip to Ethiopia reveals that a mismatch exists between the results captured by the project’s measurement frameworks and progress reports developed by UNIDO, and the expectations of the Swedish government. The study further reveals that this mismatch can lead to tension between the different actors in the partnership and an increased vulnerability of Sida. The findings of this research lead to the conclusion that there are reasons to believe these challenges could become a constrain for donor agencies to address complex development challenges in the future or pose challenges for the collaborative process of PPPs...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> observes the performance of the aid recipient imperfectly; the <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> and the aid recipient are subject to inefficiency; the aid recipient experiences corruption; and adjustment of aid recipient performance is costly. Incentives between the aid donor and the aid recipient are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in the aid recipient increase under performance intensity of aid. Moreover, performance intensity of aid has fundraising effects. While the aid recipient also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for the poorest aid recipients and provided that the <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in the aid recipient. The importance of aid agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in aid recipients. Second, performance intensity of aid maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by the aid recipient. Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in aid recipients will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so. Performance intensive policy may thus appear to fail - immediately after imposition. ...|$|E

40|$|In the 1980 's, {{education}} sector studies {{emerged as}} a predominant approach to policy analysis by most <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> involved in the identification and design of policy measures for education sector adjustment programs in Sub-Saharan African countries. International <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> often used a "technocratic approach" {{in the conduct of}} these studies, exercising excessive control and allowing for little indigenous participation in the policy analysis process. Limited indigenous participation in and appropriation of education sector studies became identified as an obstacle to improved education policy implementation. The "participatory approach" to development was soon adopted by some <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> as a means to build educational research and policy analysis capacity in Sub-Saharan African countries. This study examined a set of ten donor supported education sector studies undertaken between 1990 and 1994 in Sub-Saharan African countries, determined the extent of indigenous participation and identified the conditionalisites that explain its presence or absence. In general, the research findings indicated that the practice of education sector analysis fell far short of the rhetoric which had embraced the need for increased indigenous participation. Constraints within <b>donor</b> <b>agencies</b> were traced to the administrative procedures and incentives related to project funding and disbursement pressures, while those in Sub-Saharan countries were linked to nascent democratic values and systems of governance, lack of political leadership and a public service life with inter-ministerial conflict and self-interest...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced. The <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> observes the true performance of the aid recipient with error. The <b>donor</b> <b>agency</b> itself operates under stochastically variables e¢ciency. The aid recipient experiences rent-seeking behaviour. E¤ort in the aid recipient is subject to variable e¢ciency. Finally, adjustment of performance in the aid recipient is costly both in the level of e¤ort, and in the time rate of change in the performance measure. The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance intensity of aid, in the sense that more aid comes to be allocated to aid recipients with good governance. Second, performance intensity of aid generates incentive e¤ects, such that the optimal level of governance in the aid recipient will increase under strengthening performance intensity of aid. Thirdly, improving governance in the aid recipient in turn was shown to lead to increased budgetary allocations to aid in the legislature that allocates aid resources. Performance intensity of aid thus has fundraising e¤ects. Policy slippage also carries impacts, however. The …rst of these is that the e¤ectiveness of the performance intensity of aid appears to depend strongly on the degree of e¢ciency of own e¤ort in the aid recipient country. At the same time, the aid budget provided by the legislature for allocation by th...|$|E
