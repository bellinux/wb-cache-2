5|$|Although his {{links to}} Bulgarian culture were {{weakened}} by his father's departure, Cerna, who was baptized in the Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church, became fluent in Bulgarian. According to literary critic George CÄƒlinescu, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> some difficulties conversing in Romanian, but could write it with ease.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes {{during the}} Druze revolt, the authorities, with whom <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a tense relationship, grew wary of his {{strength}} and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid. He was sent to Istanbul by sea and from there {{he was sent to}} serve a prison sentence at the Widin fortress on the Danube River. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an Albanian inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached Salonica. From there, Aqil departed to Anatolia and then Aleppo. Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E

5|$|The novel Soon I Will Be Invincible is {{the first}} novel by Austin Grossman, an {{established}} video games designer. Grossman {{had come from a}} literary family, son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman, which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel. Instead, Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> an interest in the superhero genre, citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences. In the mid-1990s, the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him {{in the form of a}} supervillain's voice. Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible, adding supporting characters, and writing short stories. By 2006, Penguin's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK, as did Rizzoli for an Italian version. By the time, the book was being published Grossman was 37 years old and had entered the University of California-Berkeley's doctoral program studying English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature.|$|E

25|$|When North Vietnam invaded in March 1975, {{the promised}} American {{intervention}} never materialized. Congress reflected the popular mood, halting {{the bombing in}} Cambodia effective 15 July 1973, and reducing aid to South Vietnam.

25|$|The Rebbe's {{decision}} {{to move to the}} United States was not a permanent one. Throughout his travails in the Holocaust, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> in mind the goal of settling in Israel. Toward that end, he established the Kiryat Sanz neighborhood in the beachside city of Netanya in 1958. In so doing, he was the first Rebbe to establish a Haredi neighborhood in an Israeli development town. Over the next few years, he raised money for the establishment of key neighborhood institutions, including girls' and boys' schools and yeshivas, an orphanage, and an old-age home.|$|E

In recognition of his services, Alexander II appointed him Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1865. In all Konstantin was President of the Council of State for sixteen years. Though lacking in tact, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> the Tsar's ear and defended the council's view. This also made him many enemies.|$|E
25|$|The {{example of}} the {{relations}} with Portugal illustrated that De Witt's diplomatic gifts were necessary as much within the Republic, as without. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> to make internal deals to accompany the external deals he made with foreign powers. In {{the case of the}} Hague treaty, Zeeland at first refused to ratify (and the requirement of unanimity in cases of peace and war in the Union of Utrecht made its position strong). De Witt persuaded the Zeeland States to acquiesce by giving the Zeeland salt-refiners {{the best part of the}} business of refining the salt that Portugal paid as its indemnity.|$|E
25|$|A {{contemporary}} account, however, suggests more mundanely that Peter Niers was {{a master}} of disguise: In a circulated warrant from 1579, based on confessions from his captured underlings, when Niers was thought {{to operate in the}} Schwarzwald area, it is stated that he frequently changed his appearance and costume, sometimes masquerading as a common soldier, at other times as a leper, {{and a number of other}} disguises. The same warrant states, however, that some things stayed constant: <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a lot of money on him, he carried two loaded pistols in his trousers, and a huge two-handed sword.|$|E

25|$|Pinkney L. Near (1927 - 1990) was {{curator of}} the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts for thirty years. He was {{responsible}} for the museum's acquisition of many treasured works of European art, including arranging for the museum to purchase from John Lee Pratt the Francisco Goya portrait of General Nicolas Guye (long believed to be the most valuable work of art in the museum's collections). The Guye portrait by Goya is now on view in the posthumously created Pinkney Near Gallery at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. In 1989 Pinkney Near was named to the newly created post of Paul Mellon Curator and senior research curator, a post in which he worked closely, as <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> as chief curator, with the Mellon Collection and with Paul Mellon.|$|E
25|$|Wardell's {{conversion}} to the Roman Catholic faith {{was the result}} of a period of deep internal reflection. This affiliation to a more high church ritual was manifested in his architectural interests which concentrated on the more Gothic designs of England's medieval architecture. For the remainder of his life he saw architecture as a means of praising God. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a room in his home set aside as a chapel for personal devotion which he visited several times during the course of a day. Dominating this room was an ancient carved wooden French cross that now belongs to the Melbourne Diocesan Historical Commission, who also own several other mementos of his persona devotion. Wardell also wrote, in particular two prayers devoted to the Virgin Mary, who he seems to have regarded as his especial saint. It is known that he frequently prayed for help and guidance when working on plans of church buildings.|$|E
25|$|Ford was {{renowned for}} his intense {{personality}} and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark {{glasses and a}} patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker {{and while he was}} shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchiefâ€”each morning his wife would give him a dozen fresh handkerchiefs, {{but by the end of}} a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its use, especially in front of a woman, would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on the mantel in his home.|$|E

500|$|Albert Daniels as Brooklyn, a New York {{transplant}} {{and one of}} Rashad's closest friends. Robinson {{had known}} Daniels {{since he was a}} fifteen-year-old production assistant on his music video shoots in New York. [...] "He was an annoying little kid who got fired every time he was a P.A. because he was so inquisitive. But every time they fired him I'd bring him back because I felt like <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> something." [...] Eight years later, Robinson ran into Daniels at a poetry reading in New York City, and told him to audition for the film. Daniels didn't have any money to get to Atlanta where he had to audition, so he hustled money doing poetry in subways, and bought a bus ticket to get there.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{does not}} feature Scully, as Gillian Anderson was busy still filming her final parts of Fight the Future. Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales. He was {{requested}} {{for the part}} especially by Chris Carter. Casting director Rick Millikan noted, [...] "McGavin was Chris's inspiration for writing this series. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> Darren in mind to use somewhere, {{and that was really}} his doing. He said 'I want Darren McGavin for this,' and he happened to be available, and we got him." [...] McGavin had originally been casting directors' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson for the second season opener [...] "Little Green Men". McGavin was later sought out to be Mulder's dad, but he again eluded the staff. In the end, McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Dales, the agent who founded the X-Files.|$|E
500|$|Courtney Love: [...] "We {{actually}} show Anne Boleyn too. She was Henry VIII's {{wife who}} had her head chopped off. When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E
