40|$|The rate of {{deterioration}} and dilapidation {{of housing}} stock in Lagos, Nigeria is appalling and increasing slum areas {{which have become}} contemporary social problem in the state. The paper seeks to assess the level of practice of do-it-yourself (DIY) maintenance approaches to housing improvement in Lagos state. In the process the study identified the level of practice within the study area. To achieve the objective, the study adopted research survey technique. A total of 300 structured questionnaires were used for data collection. The survey covered 300 buildings which was selected from fifteen (15) local government areas in Lagos state based on stratified random sampling technique. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics. The findings of the study revealed that, {{the level of the}} practice of do-it-yourself (DIY) maintenance is low compared to other maintenance outsourcing options. Cleaning of drainage, cutting of <b>grass,</b> <b>clearing</b> of blocked drains, replacement of faulty electrical sockets, improved door security lighting and internal space re-arrangement are the most predominant service being carried out with the system. The low participation of end-users in maintaining their homes and environment has led to the appalling state of housing in the State. The implementation of the system will assist in retaining the performance of buildings in the study areas in terms of functionality, economical and social values. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper on}} {{strategies}} for school environmental management in Nigerian secondary schools {{was carried out}} in Calabar, Nigeria. To guide the study three research questions were formulated. This was achieved through administration of structured questionnaires in three randomly sampled schools. Findings show regular <b>grass</b> <b>clearing,</b> sweeping of the school compound and painting, landscaping and planting of flowers, good drainage and refuse disposal are strategies adopted for managing the school environment.   While lack of gardeners to keep the school compound clean, erosion, students and teachers not being responsive to environmental issues, difficulties to inculcate in students environmental values due to different home upbringing, lack of funds to procure working tools/implements and waste disposal challenges were some identified challenges in the school environmental management. Three hypotheses were put forward to be tested in the study: 1) There is no significant difference in strategies adopted in the management of school environment 2) Management of school environment has no significant effect on student study/reading habit 3) The challenges of managing school environment have no significant effect on the quality of school environment. Statistical results from tested hypotheses show significant relation and correlation in all. Result for hypothesis one shows that there is significant difference in strategies adopted in the management of school environment. Hypothesis two statistically proved that management of school environment has significant effect on students’ study/reading habit; while the last stated hypothesis revealed that the challenges of managing school environment have significant effect on the quality of school environment. For enhanced and better school environment for sound academic exercise, school environmental management team (SEMT), fore-plan for drainage and waste disposal, school location consideration for new schools, employment of gardeners and cleaners, fumigation of schools, terminal orientation programmes, development of curriculum on environmental management, School inspection and competitions and awards were recommended. </p...|$|E

40|$|This project {{improves}} on {{the existing}} manual herbicides tanks used by farmers at oil palm plantations. The main objective is to design and construct an automated machine that can facilitate the farmer's work of <b>clearing</b> <b>grass</b> at small scale oil palm plantations. In this project, a portable machine trolley which can be handled with ease was contructed. This machine allows the farmers to freely control the flow of herbicide directly towards the grass using one hand. The system will automatically pump the fluid inside the tank and, indicate the signal for high and low water level. The herbicides tank can accommodate 30 L at one time and regulate the pressure manually. This system is controlled by a relay circuit. As a result, {{the output of the}} pump can produce a pressure of 0. 7 MPa or 7 Bar and the distance of the water from static machine can spray out up to 15 m. The maximum flow of water measured is 5. 0 L per minute maximum. As a result, it gives farmers more options for <b>clearing</b> <b>grass</b> at oil palm plantations...|$|R
50|$|Originally, the stadium's {{surface was}} a Tifway 419 Bermuda grass, {{specifically}} bred for indoor use. The dome's ceiling contained thousands of semitransparent panes made of Lucite.

However, within a few months, the grass died from lack of sunlight. For most of the 1965 season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and dead <b>grass.</b> The <b>clear</b> panels also added a problem when combined with the natural grass.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of factors affecting FMNR in the Sahel {{did not find}} many household’s characteristics constraining significantly the FMNR practice {{in more than one}} country. However, several institutional factors have been identified as promoting or limiting the potential for FMNR, such as rights and regulation rules over trees and natural resources in general. For example in the Sahel, the use of fire and free grazing systems generates benefits in terms of <b>grass</b> regeneration, <b>clearing</b> of debris, catching wild rodents for food {{and in the case of}} free grazing, offering a cheap mechanism for feeding livestock. Thus, it is not easy to find institutional reforms that can accommodate the interests of FMNR with others. However, practices such as controlled fires, rotational grazing and the promotion of livestock corridors through local conventions are all options that have been successfully implemented in the drylands.|$|R
