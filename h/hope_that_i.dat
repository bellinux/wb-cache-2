25|$|Runs did not flow; {{they were}} grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as {{delivery}} after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb. For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through {{the cover and}} mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. When I joined him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single. If he ever scored a better hundred I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am there to see it.|$|E

I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E

Lopez stated that: [...] "They all express {{different}} moments in love and that's what this album was about.

MTV News noted that on the songs, Lopez might be [...] "giving us some insight about what she was dealing with in her personal life in the months before it was released".|$|E

500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can come back and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April. Stevenage ended the 2012–13 campaign in 18th-place, and Westley released four players and transfer-listed three others.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Closing Time are often noted for their lyrical content and vary in form. [...] "Ol' '55" [...] narrates {{the story of}} a man riding [...] "lickety splitly" [...] in a car and is often seen as a song about escapism, [...] "like his near-contemporary Bruce Springsteen." [...] This theme is also present in [...] "Old Shoes" [...] which narrates another story about [...] "a footloose young stud hitting the road and semi-sneering", {{particularly}} in lyrics such as [...] "your tears cannot bind me anymore" [...] and [...] "my heart was not born to be tamed." [...] Other lyrics on the album are described as melancholic, particularly [...] "Lonely", [...] "I <b>Hope</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Don't Fall in Love with You" [...] and [...] "Grapefruit Moon", which are [...] "both self-conscious and lacklustre." [...] The intro to [...] "Midnight Lullaby" [...] borrows lyrics from the English nursery rhyme [...] "Sing a Song of Sixpence". This form of song-writing became a lifelong habit of Waits following the writing of [...] "Midnight Lullaby", in which he [...] "assembled lyrics from fragments of oral tradition." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1812, Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Wellington (and future duke), again {{attempted}} to take Badajoz, {{which had a}} French garrison of about 5,000 men. Siege operations commenced on 16 March; by early April, there were three practicable breaches [...] in the walls. These were assaulted by two British divisions on 6 April, reputed to be [...] "Wellington's bloodiest siege", {{with a loss of}} some 5,000 British soldiers out of 15,000, after a five-hour onslaught the storming of the breaches failed. The French also lost some 1,200 of their 5,000 soldiers in the battle. Despite the failure at the breaches, the castle and another section of undamaged wall had been attacked and the town was successfully taken by the British. The victorious troops massacred about 4,000 Spanish civilians. Wellington wrote to Lord Liverpool, [...] "The capture of Badajos affords as strong an instance of the gallantry of our troops as has ever been displayed, but I anxiously <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall never again be the instrument of putting them to such a test as that to which they were put last night." [...] However, Wellington's storming of San Sebastián in 1813 was much like that of Badajoz.|$|E

500|$|Closing Time {{reached a}} wider {{audience}} through cover versions of its songs by more successful artists and have since continued to have been covered. Later in 1973, Tim Buckley released the album Sefronia, with a cover of [...] "Martha," [...] the first ever cover of a Waits song by a known artist. Buckley's version was {{also included in the}} 1995 tribute compilation [...] [...] "Martha" [...] was covered again in 1979 by Bette Midler on Saturday Night Live and by Meat Loaf on Welcome to the Neighborhood (1995). [...] "Ol' '55" [...] was recorded by The Eagles for On the Border (1974). [...] "Rosie" [...] was recorded by The Beat Farmers for their album The Pursuit of Happiness. (1987) [...] "Ice Cream Man" [...] was covered in 1991 by Screamin' Jay Hawkins for Black Music For White People and [...] "Lonely" [...] was covered live by Bat for Lashes and included on the deluxe edition of her album Two Suns (2009).

500|$|... "Fast Lane" [...] was {{received}} favorably by critics. Upon the release on the EP, , Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz published a track-by-track review. According to Lipshutz, [...] "Fast Lane" [...] is [...] "G-funk on steroids, with sing-song refrain breaking up crushing mic-trading bout between Royce da 5'9" [...] and Eminem." [...] He {{also referred to}} [...] "Fast Lane" [...] {{as one of the}} highlight songs of the album. Rolling Stone gave a positive review. According to Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone, [...] "Eminem kicks 'Fast Lane' 1999-style, reconnecting with the hungry young lunatic who sounded like he only had a stanza to blow us away or it was back to the auto plant." [...] Dolan also commented on the infamous lyric [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't sound too heinous when I say this, Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus," [...] saying that Eminem has been much more heinous before. According to Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly, Royce da 5'9" [...] performs extremely well on the [...] "hard-hitting" [...] song, even calling him a [...] "lyrical beast". Although music website Consequence of Sound gave a rather mixed review on the EP as a whole, editor Winston Robbins favored [...] "Fast Lane" [...] and said that it is [...] "hands down one of the best hip-hop tracks of 2011" [...] and that the rapping is [...] "second to none".|$|E
500|$|Tom Waits {{began his}} musical career in 1970, {{performing}} every Monday night at The Troubadour, a venue in Los Angeles, California. Waits' setlist at these series of shows, described as [...] "hootenanny nights", consisted primarily of Bob Dylan covers, although it included songs which would later appear on Closing Time and its successor, The Heart of Saturday Night (1974). Among the songs performed were [...] "Ice Cream Man", [...] "Virginia Avenue", [...] "Ol' '55", [...] "I <b>Hope</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Don't Fall in Love with You", [...] "Shiver Me Timbers" [...] and [...] "Diamonds on my Windshield." [...] Around this time, Waits began {{working as a}} doorman at a San Diego, California, club, The Heritage, which was a coffee house by day. In November 1970, Waits performed his first paid show at The Heritage, earning $25 for his performance. At a Troubadour performance in summer 1971, Herb Cohen inadvertently spotted Waits and became his manager. Through Cohen's contacts, Waits recorded demos in Los Angeles in late summer 1971 with producer Robert Duffey, later released as The Early Years in two volumes, against Waits' wishes. In order to focus on his career, Waits relocated from San Diego to Los Angeles in early 1972 and performed more frequently at The Troubadour, where David Geffen discovered him performing [...] "Grapefruit Moon." [...] The performance, which [...] "floored" [...] Geffen, led Geffen to negotiate with Waits' manager Cohen, and Waits signed to Asylum Records within a month.|$|E
