25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took me almost seven hours. But neither would I pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E
25|$|Hugh Evan-Thomas {{was born}} the son of Charles Evan-Thomas, who was High Sheriff of Brecknockshire for 1885 and died at Cople in Bedfordshire aged 65 on 30 August 1928. A {{memorial}} service was held at Eglwys Oen Duw church in Llwynmadoc, Wales. A brass plaque in the church records his death. A year later, the council of Neath, Glamorgan purchased the Gnoll estate where Evan-Thomas was born {{to serve as a}} public park, where a war memorial would be erected. Jellicoe wrote a tribute to Evan-Thomas saying, 'If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> loyal and splendid supporter during the Great War in the Grand Fleet, one who never failed me, one who led his ships magnificently, and not only led them magnificently but brought them to a pitch of efficiency that was a pattern for the whole of the Grand fleet, It was Admiral Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas'.|$|E
500|$|Barney did {{not take}} her poetry as seriously as Vivien did, saying, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> {{ambition}} it was to make my life itself into a poem." [...] Her plays were only performed through amateur productions in her garden. According to Karla Jay, most of them lacked coherent plots and [...] "would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience." [...] After 1910 she mostly wrote the epigrams and memoirs for which she is better known. Her last book of poetry was called Poems & Poemes: Autres Alliances and came out in 1920, bringing together romantic poetry in both French and English. Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems but then ignored the detailed recommendations he made.|$|E

The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it." [...] In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled All Wound Up. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for each day's filming, she had the Trill spots applied by makeup artist Mary Kay Morse, with Michael Westmore working on her detailing instead. This was a change from when Farrell had portrayed Jadzia, as in that case, Westmore had applied the spots himself each day. She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, [...] "Image in the Sand", for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. [...] "I came in and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> line — that's it, I hadn't even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn't found a place to live." [...] She began {{to understand what was}} required of her from her second episode onwards. She later explained that [...] "I never really got too freaked in the beginning. I thought more of this as the biggest job I've ever had, than going into the whole Star Trek phenomenon. I just wanted to do a good job." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was the first full episode of the show that Daniels wrote. The Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who were show runners during the previous two seasons, {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. They left the idea with David Mirkin, who took over the job as show runner during this season. Mirkin said he was [...] "very excited and intrigued" [...] with the idea of the episode. Soon thereafter, he assigned Daniels to write the script because he knew that Daniels would [...] "step up" [...] and [...] "throw himself into it". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mirkin stated that when he took over the show, he wanted to [...] "bring it back" [...] to character and story, unlike the previous season which got [...] "so fast-moving and so full of cutaway gags". Mirkin added: [...] "I explored the characters a little more, took them a little further. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> of the first episodes where Homer was really tempted by another woman, [...] "The Last Temptation of Homer", and Bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself, [...] "Bart's Girlfriend", plus more of a focus on side characters. We did the first episode to really feature Apu as a main character. Those were my goals." [...] Kirkland said he was grateful that he got to work with a [...] "wonderful crew" [...] on the episode, including Bob Anderson, who he thought was a [...] "wonderful" [...] director. Kirkland said that Anderson assisted him on the episode and did [...] "fine animation throughout".|$|E

500|$|Southey {{intended}} Madoc {{to rival}} {{the works of}} Homer, and Coleridge believed that the poem {{would be better than}} the Aeneid. However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another felt that it was unreadable. In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was [...] "highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much, except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and human heart. There is nothing that shows the hand of the great Master". He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying [...] "Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, according to my notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived". Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that [...] "We have read Madoc with great delight [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me to do, and that the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affection." ...|$|E

In 2000, following John Bercow MP's resignation from the front bench and the defection of Shaun Woodward MP to Labour, Massow too left the Conservative Party to join the Labour Party, where he was welcomed by Mo Mowlam. However Massow later returned to the Conservatives, subsequently claiming that the brief defection to Labour had a particular motivation: [...] "I knew if I switched it would be front page news.
