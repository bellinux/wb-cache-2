5|$|Del Potro {{started his}} 2010 {{season at the}} AAMI Kooyong Classic in Melbourne, Australia with a win over Croatian world No. 24 Ivan Ljubičić. On 11 January, he moved up to a career high world No. 4. He was {{scheduled}} to face Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on day 2 of the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament, but withdrew due to a wrist injury. He came into the 2010 Australian Open with the injury not healed, {{and was forced to}} take a month off after the event. In the fourth round, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> eventual semifinalist Marin Čilić.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the 413th {{overall pick}} in the 14th round, {{selected}} by the Anaheim Angels. Angels scout Dan Radcliff and director of scouting Eddie Bane convinced Adenhart to forego a scholarship offer from the University of North Carolina and signed him to a $710,000 bonus ($ in 2010) on July 26, 2004. After having Dr. James Andrews perform the Tommy John surgery, Adenhart spent the next year rehabilitating his elbow at the Angels' rehab facility in Tempe, Arizona. During that time, Adenhart also attended classes at Arizona State University.|$|E
5|$|In {{all four}} 2013 Grand Slam tournaments, Raonic matched his {{previous}} best result. He reached the fourth {{round of the}} Australian Open, falling to world No. 2 Federer. At the French Open, he lost {{in the third round}} to Kevin Anderson. At Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Igor Sijsling. At the US Open, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> world No. 9 Richard Gasquet in the fourth round, despite a career-high 39 aces.|$|E
60|$|In {{his hand}} is the magic sword with which <b>he</b> <b>fells</b> <b>to</b> the ground the now {{powerless}} Cacti; then, in majestic anger, challenges to single combat the vile usurper.|$|R

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2003–04 season, Jovanovski {{suffered}} a third-degree shoulder separation {{during a game}} against the Nashville Predators on January 25, 2004. Colliding with opposing forward Martin Erat, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> ice and slid into the rink boards. He returned late in the season to help the Canucks secure the Northwest Division title. In 56 games, he scored seven goals and 23 points. Adding four assists in seven 2004 playoff games, the Canucks were defeated in the first round by the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} death {{directly}} related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the Whitby Dunlops, a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's Major League Hockey, died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the ice, he hit his head. His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics. In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} Bowyer's first {{win in the}} 2010 season, and the third of his career. The result {{advanced}} Bowyer to second in the Drivers' Championship, thirty-five points behind Hamlin and ten ahead of Kevin Harvick, although <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> twelfth in the standings after receiving a post-race penalty. Chevrolet maintained its lead in the Manufacturers' Championship, thirty-two points ahead of Toyota and seventy-four ahead of Ford, with nine races remaining in the season. Attendance was 95,000, while 3.68 million watched it on television.|$|E
50|$|Dixon {{held the}} SRU's {{coaching}} development role until 2009 when <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> victim <b>to</b> cost cutting.|$|R

5000|$|George [...] "Sjoppie" [...] Fles (1908-1939) was a Dutch {{translator}} with {{a strong}} communist conviction. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> victim <b>to</b> Stalin's repressions.|$|R
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Alonso moved back into the lead of the Drivers' Championship on 231 points. Webber's failure to score meant <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> second, eleven points behind Alonso. Hamilton's second-place finish resulted in him moving ahead of Vettel, with Button remaining in fifth. Red Bull still led the Constructors' Championship despite not getting both cars to the finish. McLaren remained in second with 399 points; Ferrari had caught up to McLaren, the gap between the two teams reduced to 25 points with two races of the season remaining. Given Alonso's new lead, Vettel acknowledged his team had the fastest car in the season's two remaining races and remained confident of winning the Drivers' Championship. After the conclusion of the championship in Vettel's favour by four points, Webber's manager Flavio Briatore highlighted the Korean Grand Prix as one of Webber's most obvious lost opportunities in his bid to win the title.|$|E
5|$|Back in England for the 1929 season, Larwood {{made three}} Test {{appearances}} against the visiting South Africans, for modest returns: {{a total of}} eight wickets at 23.25, and with the bat 50 runs at 12.50. He was injured during the third Test, and thus missed {{the last two games}} of the series and several county matches. His overall bowling figures for the 1929 season were less impressive than in the two previous years; with 117 wickets at 21.66 <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> 25th place in the national averages. The 20-year-old Voce, whose fast-medium bowling style had now fully developed, was the county's most successful bowler. Together, Larwood and Voce helped Nottingham to secure the County Championship that had narrowly evaded them two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Born in Alexandria, Virginia, Latos' {{family moved}} to Florida when he was young. He played {{baseball}} at Coconut Creek High School, where {{he became one of}} the best high school players in the state. Highly regarded for his talent before the 2006 MLB draft, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the 11th round due to questions about his maturity. After pitching at Broward College for a season, the San Diego Padres signed him for a $1.25 million bonus. He debuted for the Padres in 2009, and established himself in their starting rotation. The Reds traded four players, including three prospects, to acquire Latos before the 2012 season.|$|E

50|$|William Courtleigh Jr. (1892-1918) was American silent film actor whose {{promising}} {{career was}} cut short after <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> victim <b>to</b> the 1918 flu pandemic.|$|R
50|$|When he {{returned}} <b>to</b> England <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> victim <b>to</b> anti-Irish racism, {{but was also}} rejected in the Irish community there because of his outspoken views.|$|R
5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that kept him from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the ground and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Bräck {{remained}} {{the leader in}} the Drivers' Championship with 83 points, while Andretti's victory advanced him to second place. Castroneves' retirement meant <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> third place, five points ahead of Franchitti. De Ferran moved down to fifth place with 58 points. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Honda maintained the lead with 158 points. Toyota remained in second with 142 points, 12 points ahead of Ford Cosworth. The race, which was broadcast live in the United States on ESPN, averaged 726,000 viewers, earning a 0.88 rating and a share of two. Andretti's victory was rated as ninth in the top ten Indy Toronto races by the Toronto Star in 2015.|$|E
60|$|He {{quickly put}} out his foot and tripped Philip up. Philip was always rather {{unsteady}} on his feet, and <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> heavily <b>to</b> the ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>fell</b> victim <b>to</b> a Cossack pogrom {{during the}} Ukrainian {{struggle}} for independence in 1919. He was murdered in a synagogue while holding a sefer Torah.|$|R
50|$|Snow {{was buried}} where <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> due <b>to</b> decomposition. The others were taken back by wagon and buried about ten {{miles east of}} Cloverdale, New Mexico.|$|R
5|$|The {{result of}} the round meant Vandoorne {{increased}} his advantage in the Drivers' Championship on 114 points. Rossi's strong results meant he moved into second place, 40 points behind Vandoorne, while Haryanto's poor form meant <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> third. Despite not scoring any points in the round, Evans and Lynn remained in fourth and fifth positions with 28 and 25 points respectively. ART Grand Prix extended its lead over Racing Engineering in the Teams' Championship to be two more points ahead of the Spanish team. Campos Racing remained in third position on 68 points, and had increased their advantage over DAMS in fourth place, while Russian Time rounded out the top five with eight rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute later}} Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was shown a yellow card for a foul on García. The {{resulting}} free-kick found Steven Gerrard, but <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the ground after a challenge from Claude Makélélé. The referee Steve Bennett ignored Liverpool claims for a penalty and Chelsea went straight on the attack, but {{an effort by}} Drogba went wide of the Liverpool goal. Chelsea continued to attack {{in an effort to}} score an equalising goal, but attempts by Duff and Joe Cole failed to find the target. Liverpool defender Djimi Traoré was the third player to be shown a yellow card for a foul on Ferreira in the 35th minute. However, minutes later he made an important tackle as Duff beat the Liverpool offside trap, but a poor touch outside of the Liverpool penalty area allowed Traoré to dispossess him. As half-time approached Liverpool were content to remain in their own half and allow Chelsea to attack them, but any attack was dealt with by the Liverpool defence.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
50|$|Debuting in November 1984, {{he reached}} the second highest jūryō {{division}} in March 1991. His first tournament in the top makuuchi division was in July 1992. Scoring only three wins there <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>to</b> jūryō, but reappeared in makuuchi in March 1993. He reached his highest rank of komusubi in May 1995. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>to</b> maegashira 4 in July but turned in a strong 11-4 record, defeating yokozuna Akebono and returning to komusubi in September 1995. He also defeated yokozuna Takanohana in May 1996, the only wrestler {{to do so in}} that tournament.|$|R
60|$|Pak Chung Chang trembled. Well he {{knew the}} King's {{business}} was ever a terrible business. His knees smote together, and <b>he</b> near <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> the floor.|$|R
25|$|In the mid-1960s, {{while still}} active, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> victim <b>to</b> a serious disease which {{prevented}} him from continuing to work. Italo Mus died in Saint-Vincent on 15 May 1967.|$|R
5|$|Barnes {{passed his}} century and began {{accelerating}} before finally falling for 141, leaving Australia at 2/296 in 277 minutes, after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball off the inside edge, but Miller survived a loud lbw appeal on Yardley's hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but Bedser then moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. It was the fourth time out of four innings in the series that Bedser had dismissed Bradman. This left Australia at 4/329 and the next day, Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch {{so that he could}} attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. The Australian captain declared on the following day of play at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. England lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|Bradman was on 89 {{and heading}} towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> Bedser again, this time {{courtesy}} of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's leg cutter moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times {{so far in the}} Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over square leg into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 {{at the end of the}} third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was not so much a sign of an English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic {{would then}} suffer his own {{thrashing}} {{at the hands}} of Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals of the French Open, when he lost in straight sets, including losing the third set 6-0, his first bagel at a grand slam tournament since 2005. This further emphasised that Djokovic was still very far from his best form. Following this loss, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> world No.4, his lowest ranking since October 2009 and his first time outside the top two of the rankings since March 2011. In contrast, Nadal breezed through to the French Open final without dropping a set, including a third round match where he only lost one game. Murray, meanwhile, bounced back from his recent poor form by reaching the semi-finals, but lost to Stan Wawrinka in a five-set epic. Nadal then defeated Wawrinka in the final to become the first player in the Open Era to win ten titles at a single slam. This win also ended a three-year drought of slam titles for the Spaniard, his last title coming at the French Open in 2014. Following the win, Nadal returned to world No. 2, his highest ranking since October 2014.|$|E
