5000|$|<b>Individual</b> fishing <b>quotas</b> (IFQs) {{also known}} as [...] "individual {{transferable}} quotas" [...] (ITQs) are one kind of catch share, {{a means by which}} many governments regulate fishing. The regulator sets a species-specific total allowable catch (TAC), typically by weight and for a given time period. A dedicated portion of the TAC, called quota shares, is then allocated to <b>individuals.</b> <b>Quotas</b> can typically be bought, sold and leased, a feature called transferability. As of 2008, 148 major fisheries (generally, a single species in a single fishing ground) around the world had adopted some variant of this approach, along with approximately 100 smaller fisheries in individual countries. Approximately 10% of the marine harvest was managed by ITQs as of 2008.

40|$|<b>Individual</b> <b>quota</b> (IQ) {{programs}} are a promising and increasingly common means of regulating fisheries. This paper examines how profit maximizing fishers respond to {{different types of}} IQ programs in fisheries where many types of fish are harvested simultaneously. This analysis shows that the most common types of <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> programs can induce discarding, and that <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> programs that regulate the value of harvest never induce discarding. Since discarded fish have a high mortality rate, "value-based" <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> {{programs are}} superior to their more conventional counterparts in that they waste fewer fish. The disadvantages of value-based quotas are also examined. Results are driven {{by the fact that}} the harvest technology examined here does not satisfy a "free-disposal" assumption.

40|$|Abstract OnlyIn 2010, the New England Groundfish fishery {{adopted a}} sector-based {{management}} plan, wherein self-identifying groups of harvesters are allocated their collective total {{share of the}} harvest of each species as a group right, that they may manage in any way they wish. This means a single fishery with a single set of overall total allowable catches can be managed by multiple management systems concurrently. We ask whether common pool or <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> type management systems {{are more likely to}} emerge as groups gain experience with their collective rights. In a novel quasi-continuous time experimental environment with a contemporaneous price externality, harvesters can choose to affiliate with a common pool managed group, or an <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> managed group. The common pool group engages in a fishing derby and receives lower prices, whereas the <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> group achieves stable harvest levels throughout each season to minimize the price externality. Through successive fishing seasons, the frequency of choosing <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> rises from about half to over 90 % of subjects. This suggests that the efficiencies associated with strong individual fishing rights may emerge endogenously from the sectorization process, even without imposing them through regulation. The choice to remain in the common pool is explained by competitive success, but not risk preferences, social preferences or competitiveness...|$|E

40|$|North Sea cod Gadus morhua {{stock is}} outside safe {{biological}} limits, and {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) management has proved ineffective to rebuild the stock. The European Commission is considering {{the imposition of a}} discard ban to preserve vulnerable and economically important fish stocks. We explored the potential effects of a discard ban in mixed fisheries management using the French mixed fisheries in the Eastern English Channel as a model system. We examined in particular the performance of 2 different management scenarios: (1) <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> management with a tolerance for discarding and (2) <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> management in combination with a discard ban, using a dynamic state variable model. The model evaluates a time series of decisions taken by fishers to maximize profits within management constraints. Compliance to management was tested by applying an in-height varying fine for exceeding the quota. We then evaluated the consequences of individual cod quota in both scenarios with respect to over-quota discarding, spatial and temporal effort allocation and switching between métiers. <b>Individual</b> <b>quota</b> management without a discard ban hardly influenced fishers' behaviour as they could fully utilise cod quota and continue fishing other species while discarding cod. In contrast, a discard ban forced fishers to reallocate effort to areas and weeks in which cod catch is low, at the expense of lower revenue. In general, a restrictive policy for <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> for cod needs to be combined with a discard ban and a high fine (> 20 times the sale price) to reduce over-quota discardi...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{assess the}} effect that two {{different}} fishery management regimes have on {{the duration of the}} fishing trip. A basic theoretical model predicts that trip duration should increase with temporal closures and decrease with an <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> system. Therefore, we propose and apply an empirical trip duration model. Estimations are based on data for the pelagic fleet in central-southern Chile. Conforming to the theoretical predictions, the results indicate that temporal closures tend to increase trip duration, whereas individual quotas reduce it. Moreover, the regulatory regimes also affect the magnitude of the impact that other determinants have on trip duration. The results are consistent with increased efficiency in fleet operation under an <b>individual</b> <b>quota</b> system. ...|$|E
