40|$|Bone mass is {{the most}} {{important}} determinant of the mechanical strength of bones, and spatial structure is the second. In general, the spatial structure and mechanical properties of bones such as the breaking strength are direction dependent. The mean intercept length (MIL) and line frequency deviation (LFD) are two methods for quantifying directional aspects of the spatial structure of bone. Young’s modulus is commonly used to describe the stiffness of bone, which is also a <b>direction-dependent</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>property.</b> The aim {{of this article is to}} investigate the relation between MIL and LFD on one hand and Young’s modulus on the other. From 11 human mandibular condyles, 44 samples were taken and scanned with high-resolution computer tomography equipment (micro-CT). For each sample the MIL and LFD were determined in 72 602 directions distributed evenly in 3 D space. In the same directions Young’s modulus was determined by means of the stiffness tensor that had been determined for each sample by finite element analysis. To investigate the relation between the MIL and LFD on one hand and Young’s modulus on the other, multiple regression was used. On average the MIL accounted for 69 % of the variance in Young’s modulus in the 44 samples and the LFD accounted for 72 %. The average percentage of variance accounted for increased to 80 % when the MIL was combined with the LFD to predict Young’s modulus. Obviously MIL and LFD to some extent are complementary with respect to predicting Young’s modulus. It is known that directional plots of the MIL tend to be ellipses or ellipsoids. It is speculated that ellipsoids are not always sufficient to describe Young’s modulus of a bone sample and that the LFD partly compensates for this...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMechanical {{signaling}} {{plays an}} important role in cell physiology and pathology. Many cell types, including neurons and glial cells, respond to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of their environment. Yet, for spinal cord tissue, data on tissue stiffness are sparse. To investigate the regional and <b>direction-dependent</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of spinal cord tissue at a spatial resolution relevant to individual cells, we conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation and tensile measurements on acutely isolated mouse spinal cord tissue sectioned along the three major anatomical planes, and correlated local <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> with the underlying cellular structures. Stiffness maps revealed that gray matter is significantly stiffer than white matter irrespective of directionality (transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes) and force direction (compression or tension) (Kg= ∼ 130  Pa vs. Kw= ∼ 70 Pa); both matters stiffened with increasing strain. When all data were pooled for each plane, gray matter behaved like an isotropic material under compression; however, subregions of the gray matter were rather heterogeneous and anisotropic. For example, in sagittal sections the dorsal horn was significantly stiffer than the ventral horn. In contrast, white matter behaved transversely isotropic, with the elastic stiffness along the craniocaudal (i. e., longitudinal) axis being lower than perpendicular to it. The stiffness distributions we found under compression strongly correlated with the orientation of axons, the areas of cell nuclei, and cellular in plane proximity. Based on these morphological parameters, we developed a phenomenological model to estimate local <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Our study may thus ultimately help predicting local tissue stiffness, and hence cell behavior in response to mechanical signaling under physiological and pathological conditions, purely based on histological data...|$|R
40|$|The {{articulation}} of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is composed {{of the temporal bone}} dorsally, the mandibular condyle ventrally and a fibrous articular disc. The TMJ disc plays an essential role in distributing load between the two articular surfaces. Degeneration of the disc in the presence of joint pathology has been shown in man; however, TMJ pathology has not been documented previously in tigers (Panthera tigris). The mandibular condyle and TMJ disc of a Bengal tiger (P. tigris tigris) and a Siberian tiger (P. tigris altaica) were evaluated grossly and the TMJ disc was characterized biochemically and mechanically. Characterization of the TMJ disc verified region- and <b>direction-dependent</b> biochemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties,</b> reflective of the functional demands on the joint. Degenerative joint disease was observed in both cases and this was more severe in the Siberian tiger. Simultaneous evaluation of joint pathology, biochemical composition and <b>mechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of the TMJ disc revealed a loss in functional properties (tensile anisotropy) of the disc as joint pathology advanced from moderate to severe. TMJ degeneration may compromise the ability of the animal to eat and thrive and may be a factor contributing to the endangered status of these species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
