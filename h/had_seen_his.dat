5|$|Metzen {{began his}} career in design after {{applying}} to Blizzard Entertainment, then known as Chaos Studios, {{on the recommendation of}} a friend who <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> work. He was quickly recruited by the company, although Metzen states that at the time he did not really know what Blizzard Entertainment dealt with, assuming it was a graphic design studio rather than a video game developer.|$|E
5|$|Milne's form at Bristol City {{was enough}} to {{convince}} Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson {{that he was still}} worth a contract with a top-flight club. In November 1988 he moved to Old Trafford in a £170,000 deal. Ferguson was looking to build a title winning side two years after joining United, but <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> side finish second in the league the previous season and now they were on a winless run in the league that saw them mid-table. He put Milne on the left-wing as Gordon Strachan was already established on the right-wing.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E

5000|$|The poem dramatizes one of Stevens's major themes, the {{relationship}} between imagination and reality. [...] "Colloquy with a Polish Aunt," [...] though, is one of Stevens' many poems that resists the intelligence almost successfully. The scholar Helen Vendler writes of this poem that [...] "Some readers <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> subject as an epistemological one, and have written about his views on the imagination and its uneasy rapport with reality. Others <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> subject as a moral one, a justification of an aesthetic hedonism. Still others <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> subject as a native humanist one, the quest of the American Adam for a Paradise in the wilderness." ...|$|R
5|$|McLachlan found {{success on}} the Fox {{television}} series Millennium, earning several awards {{for his work on}} the show. He was head-hunted for the series by its creator Chris Carter, who <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> work on the series Strange Luck. McLachlan was initially offered a position shooting Carter's other active series, The X-Files, then in its third season, but was unable to start work in time. He developed a distinctive style for the series, shooting it with desaturated colours and lighting scenes as though they were to be filmed in black and white; he also made use of high-intensity strobe lighting usually employed for advertising and macro cinematography. McLachlan has noted that this style briefly became popular after the series' broadcast but that other cinematographers had difficulty adjusting to it.|$|E
5|$|The jury heard how {{the murder}} weapons {{had been found}} in a shed at Nazir's house along with two bags of bloodied clothes. DNA and {{fingerprints}} belonging to Nazir was found on the hunting knife and Parker's blood was found on both the hammer and knife. His blood was also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist told how marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed told the court he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> brother cleaning the murder weapon {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing. Further witnesses reported Nazir admitting to beating someone up, Mahrad admitting to kicking Parker and Awan recalling stabbing him. A witness also saw all four defendants kicking Parker.|$|E
5|$|The spy {{followed}} the court mystic to Mount Tai, where he performed a ritual with his followers, {{although no one}} saw any immortals. Luan Da ordered his followers to stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals, telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants. The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and reported that he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> immortal master {{and that they were}} to report back to the emperor. Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu. The emperor, incensed at Luan Da's confidence tricks, decided to play along when the mystic returned to see what lies he would tell.|$|E

Order after order was reiterated, but his disobedience arose with an elastic spring in proportion to the pressure that was upon it.|$|R

Some areas of the city saw temporary truces between the Crips and Bloods gangs, which fueled speculation among LAPD officers that the two gangs' truce was going to be used to unite against the department.|$|E
25|$|Personnel issues {{also played}} {{their part in}} a poor season. Head Coach Willy Roy, who had led the Sting to two NASL titles, was {{replaced}} by his assistant Eric Geyer in late December, and Karl-Heinz Granitza, the club's all-time leading goalscorer, who {{at the beginning of}} the season <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> annual salary cut by $100,000 to $65,000, was suspended indefinitely on March 21 after an argument with owner Lee Stern.|$|E
25|$|The Honeydrippers: Volume One is an EP {{released}} on 24 September 1984, by a band led by rock singer Robert Plant. The project originated when Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegün wanted to record {{an album of}} his favourite songs from the 1950s. Plant was chosen because Ertegün <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> pick-up band the Honeydrippers performing 1950s standards. Included in the band were Chic front man Nile Rodgers, and former Yardbirds guitarists Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page—the latter was also Plant's former band mate in Led Zeppelin.|$|E

25|$|By 1905, Mayo had amassed enough {{wealth to}} build a larger home in Paintsville. He had married Alice Jane Meek and they now had two children, John C.C. 2nd and Mary Margaret. Mayo had {{originally}} planned a modest twenty room house, but following trips to the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, and having in 1904 acquired Varina Farms, the Powhatan Plantation in Mayo's ancestral Virginia, he decided {{to build a}} mansion which would rival those he <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>His</b> plans were expanded for a classic revival mansion with forty rooms.|$|E
25|$|Once {{funding was}} secure, Langley devoted {{his time at}} the Observatory {{initially}} in researching the sun. He used his draftsman skills (from his first job right out of high school) to produce hundreds of drawings of solar phenomena, {{many of which were}} the first the world <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>His</b> 1873 remarkably detailed illustration of a sun spot, observed while using the observatory's 13-inch Fitz-Clark refractor became a classic. It is featured on page 21 of his book, The New Astronomy, but was also widely reprinted – in the Americas as well as throughout Europe.|$|E
25|$|Waugh was a {{candidate}} at the 1979 election, indulging {{another of his}} pet hates, former Liberal Leader Jeremy Thorpe, {{who was about to}} stand trial for conspiracy to murder in a scandal that Waugh had helped expose. It was alleged that Thorpe had links to an incident in which a man called Norman Scott, who claimed to have had an affair with Thorpe, <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> dog shot dead. Waugh stood against Thorpe for the Dog Lovers' Party in North Devon and Thorpe obtained an injunction against Waugh's election literature. Waugh polled only 79 votes, but Thorpe lost his seat.|$|E

25|$|Simeon the Just (a High Priest) {{was opposed}} to the nazirite vow and ate of the {{sacrifice}} offered by a nazirite on only a single occasion. Once a youth with flowing hair came to him and wished to have his head shorn. When asked his motive, the youth replied that he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> own face reflected in a spring and it had pleased him so that he feared lest his beauty might become an idol to him. He therefore wished to offer up his hair to God, and Simeon then partook of the sin-offering which he brought.|$|E
25|$|Whitehead's work {{remained}} mostly {{unknown to}} the public and aeronautical community after 1911 until a 1935 article in Popular Aviation magazine co-authored by educator and journalist Stella Randolph and aviation history buff Harvey Phillips. Randolph expanded the article into a book, Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead, published in 1937. Randolph sought out people who had known Whitehead and <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> flying machines and engines. She obtained 16 affidavits from 14 people and included the text of their statements in the book. Four people said they did not see flights, while the others said they saw flights of various types, ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of feet, to more than a mile.|$|E
25|$|The Gemara related {{another story}} of Mar Ukba's charity. A poor man lived in Mar Ukba's {{neighborhood}} {{to whom he}} regularly sent 400 zuz {{on the eve of}} every Yom Kippur. Once Mar Ukba sent his son to deliver the 400 zuz. His son came back and reported that the poor man did not need Mar Ukba's help. When Mar Ukba asked his son what he <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>his</b> son replied that they were sprinkling aged wine before the poor man to improve the aroma in the room. Mar Ukba said that if the poor man was that delicate, then Mar Ukba would double the amount of his gift and send it back to the poor man.|$|E
