40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} performed for quantification {{of the differences}} in aircraft reaction between space-fixed and time-fixed wake <b>encounter</b> simulations. In DLR’s terminology, “space-fixed” <b>encounter</b> simulation means that the aircraft <b>encounters</b> the wake on a free flight path, whereas for “time-fixed” <b>encounter</b> simulations the vortex induced forces and moments for a specific, predefined flight path through the vortex’ flow field are evaluated and recorded prior the actual <b>encounter</b> simulation. These pre-recorded force and moment histories are then played back during the <b>encounter</b> simulation time-based and independent on the actual position of the aircraft. The results show a good accordance in aircraft reaction between both <b>encounter</b> simulation methods in most cases. Only very long lasting <b>encounters</b> (e. g. due to very small <b>encounter</b> angles) showed considerable differences, although the maxima were of comparable magnitude. Assuming, that space-fixed <b>encounter</b> simulations show realistic <b>encounter</b> characteristics, the results show that time-fixed <b>encounters</b> are indeed less realistic but can be regarded as reasonable approach for <b>encounter</b> simulation...|$|R
40|$|The tourist-to-tourist <b>encounter</b> is an {{important}} topic in tourism business. When people travels abroad, they would have high opportunity to interact directly and indirectly with other tourists.

Consequently, the objective of this research is to investigate the relationship among tourist-to-tourist interactions, role typology, nationality, and tourist’s reaction to <b>encounter.</b> This research concluded that Taiwanese have more experience on <b>encounter</b> conflict than Japanese; higher level of Tourist-to-Tourist <b>encounter</b> could shorten the social distance; and different perception of role play would affect the <b>encounter</b> reaction: conflict and mutual understanding. Finally, the tourist’s role typology moderates the relationship between <b>encounter</b> level and <b>encounter</b> conflict; and the nationality moderates the relationship between <b>encounter</b> level and social distance...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{fact that}} {{patients}} and relatives experience poor healthcare <b>encounters</b> {{is evident in}} the number of complaints to patients’ advisory committees, and from studies and statistics. Looking at ‘the other side of the coin’, research into good caring <b>encounters</b> experienced as meaningful <b>encounters</b> in healthcare is scarce. Aim: To illuminate the signification of meaningful <b>encounters</b> in healthcare. 124 narratives from patients, relatives and healthcare staff regarding experiences of meaningful <b>encounters</b> in Swedish healthcare were analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic research method. Conclusions: The results indicate that a meaningful <b>encounter</b> means gratefulness, is founded on trust, cooperation and courage, and results in self-trust through wellbeing, increased understanding and life-changing insights. The <b>encounters</b> have given insight into, and increased understanding of, the patient’s own life, the families’ lives, and/or healthcare professionals’ lives. With this, and awareness of the importance and power of meaningful <b>encounters,</b> healthcare staff might use a meaningful <b>encounter</b> as a powerful instrument in caring. Implications for practice: For patients and relatives, trust derived from meaningful <b>encounters</b> in healthcare leads to self-trust Caring within healthcare consisting of meaningful <b>encounters,</b> ‘the other side of the coin’ gives important knowledge that could facilitate improvements in healthcare staff’s <b>encounters</b> with patients and relatives, and also enrichment in their own professional development Increased understanding and awareness of the power of meaningful <b>encounters</b> can be discussed in terms of patient safet...|$|R

40|$|A flight {{simulator}} {{study has been}} carried out to evaluate the performance of modern flight control systems <b>encountering</b> curved wake vortices. During the decay process the shape of wake vortices alters significantly which has an influence on the <b>encounter</b> characteristics and thus on the <b>encounter</b> hazard. To analyse most realistic wake <b>encounters,</b> flow fields of matured vortices have been generated with large-eddy-simulations. These were used for the determination of induced force and moment histories during the <b>encounter.</b> The force and moment histories have been implemented into the equations of motions of a 6 DoF flight simulation. For the sake of comparison <b>encounters</b> have also been simulated with straight vortices as they were mostly used for many other investigations. The most important goal {{of the study was to}} analyse the difference between these ideally straight vortices and vortices with a more realistic shape regarding <b>encounter</b> acceptance. The simulator study was conducted in an A 330 motion-based full-{{flight simulator}} with pilots-in-the-loop. The analysed scenario was a wake <b>encounter</b> during final approach. The <b>encounter</b> conditions corresponded to a heavy-behind-heavy situation for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations. The aircraft was flown either manually (in normal law) or with autopilot engaged. Altogether 93 <b>encounters</b> have been simulated, 38 with straight and 55 <b>encounters</b> with curved vortices. For <b>encounters</b> under manual control the simulator study revealed a potential risk of pilot induced oscillations (PIO) during <b>encounters</b> with curved vortices. With autopilot engaged not even one <b>encounter</b> with curved vortices was classified to be unacceptable. Although significant aircraft response was experienced the autopilot never disengaged automatically in any <b>encounter.</b> Altogether about 12 percent of the <b>encounters</b> were not accepted by the pilots. This is indeed a significant number, especially as the analysed scenarios can be regarded to be realistic situations which can occur in reality even if the applicable separation distances are applied. ...|$|R
40|$|Walking along {{a street}} in the city, we <b>encounter</b> countless signs, sounds, smells, materialities, people, and movements. <b>Encountering</b> places in {{everyday}} life, one engages the place with all senses, interacting with others, with the materiality, and with {{the atmosphere of the}} place.

We are bringing specific meanings into places and into social groups. These meanings are not set and static; they are socially constructed. <b>Encounters</b> are part of this process of constructing meanings.
