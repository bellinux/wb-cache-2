Concerning all these interrelations, this exploratory research aims to explore and reveal the effects of the strategic developments focused on the international <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> corridors on the Turkish seaborne trade. To reach this particular aim, a through literature review was carried out concerning the international <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> corridors <b>and</b> international <b>energy</b> sector. This literature review was followed by certain content analysis regarding the effects of the developments in the above mentioned areas on Turkey in general and a Delphi research involving the effects of such developments on the Turkish seaborne trade in particular. The research was concluded with a discussion on the statements agreed during Delphi research process. The discussion created certain recommendations and revealed that Turkey can maintain and sustain her effectiveness on the international <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> corridors only <b>and</b> only through having a powerful and effective seaborne trade structure...|$|R

40|$|Total <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> {{subsidies}} in Australia during 2005 - 06 {{of between}} $ 9. 3 billion and $ 10. 1 billion {{according to this}} report by Chris Riedy. The <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> sectors are responsible for almost 70 % of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and emissions from these sectors continue to grow rapidly (AGO 2006 a). It is in these sectors that responses to climate change are most urgently needed. Emissions from <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> are high because {{of the use of}} fossil fuels – coal, oil and natural gas – to provide most of Australia’s energy needs. One obvious response is to shift away from fossil fuels <b>and</b> towards renewable <b>energy</b> sources that do not generate greenhouse gas emissions, such as wind power, bioenergy and solar power. However, at present, the cost of many renewable energy technologies is significantly higher than the cost of energy derived from fossil fuel. The higher cost of renewable energy technologies acts as a major barrier to their widespread introduction in Australia. At present, governments in Australia provide substantial financial support for the production and use of fossil fuels, through direct payments, favourable tax treatment and other actions. These subsidies keep the cost of fossil fuel <b>energy</b> artificially low <b>and</b> make it harder for renewable energy to compete. They distort energy markets, encourage greater use of fossil fuels, create higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions and improve the profitability of energy companies that produce or use fossil fuels. In an era when climate change response has become urgent, continuing to subsidise fossil fuel production and consumption is unacceptable. This report provides an estimate of the size of subsidies to fossil fuels <b>and</b> renewable <b>energy</b> in the Australian <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> sectors during the 2005 - 06 financial year. It provides details on specific subsidies and offers recommendations on subsidy removal...|$|R
