5|$|In Baxter's eyes, {{the main}} {{role of the}} {{university}} was to provide trained engineers and technologists for industry, which he believed was suffering from a critical skill shortage. With this constantly in mind, he pursued a rapid expansion of the university. Student numbers grew from 3,751 when he became vice-chancellor in 1955, to over 15,988 when he retired in 1969. This was {{far short of the}} university of 25,000 students that he had hoped to create, but in the 1950s the idea of a university that large horrified some academics. Baxter considered it wasteful when good students returned to academia after only a brief time working in industry, but even more so when they dropped out or failed their courses. While his critics saw high failure rates as the inevitable result of lowering admission standards in order to boost student numbers, Baxter viewed it as result of poor teaching and inefficient administration. He walked out of a heated Staff Association meeting on the matter. To help industry, he established Unisearch Limited, a company that provided <b>expert</b> <b>assistance</b> in 1959.|$|E

The demining is performed by 35 licensed companies, employing 632 demining professionals and 58 auxiliary personnel. The companies do their work with 681 metal detectors, 55 mine rollers and mine flails, and 15 mine-detection dogs. Mine-clearing machines include locally designed models produced by DOK-ING.

500|$|Lord Phillips {{said that}} the appeal raised the [...] "narrow issue" [...] of whether [...] "the act of {{preparing}} a joint witness statement is one in respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit", and the broader issue of whether [...] "public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence {{in relation to the}} performance of his duties in that capacity." [...] He said that it was surprising that the immunity had simply been accepted in the past and never challenged. He noted that the immunity dated back to Cutler v Dixon in 1585, over 400 years ago, before English tort law developed the modern law of negligence. It was originally a complete protection for witnesses against claims for defamation, before developing to cover protection from other tort claims. [...] He noted that it was difficult to draw the line at present between <b>expert</b> <b>assistance</b> that was immune from claim and that which was not: it might be that the earlier advice was negligent, not the evidence given in court resiling from that earlier advice, even if it was the later developments about which the client complained.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to America, his newly {{imported}} horses became part of his Davenport Desert Arabian Stud in Morris Plains, New Jersey. By 1908, however, the Davenport Desert Arabian Stud was listed in the Arabian Stud Book as located in Hingham, Massachusetts, and he remained closely affiliated with Bradley's Hingham Stock Farm, which became the sole owner of the horses after Davenport's death in 1912. [...] In 1908, Davenport {{became one of the}} five incorporators of the Arabian Horse Club of America (now the Arabian Horse Association). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognized the organization as the official registry for Arabian horses in 1909. [...] Prior to that time, the Thoroughbred stud books of both the United Kingdom and the United States also handled the registration of Arabian horses. [...] The reason a new organization, separate from the American Jockey Club, was needed to register Arabians came about largely because of Davenport. He had meticulously sought horses with pure bloodlines and known breeding strains with the <b>expert</b> <b>assistance</b> of Haffez, [...] but once out of the desert, he was not aware that he also needed to obtain written affidavits and other paperwork to document their bloodlines. Additionally, because his Arabians were not shipped via Britain, they were not certified by the United Kingdom's Jockey Club before arriving in America, and without that authentication, the American Jockey Club refused to register his imported horses. [...] Another factor may have influenced the organization's stance: in a cartoon, Davenport had satirized Jockey Club President August Belmont.|$|E

Since the 1990s the golf course has continued to make improvements by rebuilding tee boxes, upgrading irrigation systems, reshaping bunkers, improving sand quality and, most recently in 1999, rebuilding of four new greens on holes 12, 13, 16 and 17. In 2011, the Cameron 9-hole golf course was remodeled to accommodate a new driving range and practice facility.|$|E

5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an <b>expert's</b> <b>assistance</b> in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection.

These decision makers need an <b>expert's</b> <b>assistance</b> in reengineering the software. Many studies attempt to support decision makers.

2500|$|Fitzpatrick's {{training}} was often credited {{as the reason}} why so few Michigan football players were injured during his years as trainer. Michigan's legendary football coach Fielding H. Yost held a high opinion of Fitzpatrick and praised {{his role in the}} success of Michigan's football teams:"Fitz and I worked together for nine years. [...] We were like brothers during that association at Michigan. There is no one person who contributed so much to the University of Michigan as this great trainer. His wonderful personality, his <b>expert</b> <b>assistance</b> and that great optimism of his stood out as his leading qualifications. My association with him is one of the pleasantest recollections of my life. [...] He put men in shape, trained them and developed them. They were 'usable' all the time. He is a trainer who has his men in the finest mental condition possible. [...] I don't think there was ever a trainer who kept men more fit, physically and mentally, than Keene Fitzpatrick." ...|$|E

You will command a power in the country." ...|$|E
