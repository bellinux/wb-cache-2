40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumer</b> communities, which are groups of people producing, sharing and consuming electricity locally. This paper focuses on building a rigorous mathematical framework in order to formalise sequen- tial decision making problems that may soon be encountered within <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumer</b> communities. After introducing our formalism, we propose a set of optimisation problems reflecting several types of theoretically optimal behaviours for energy exchanges between prosumers. We then discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of centralised and decentralised schemes and provide illustrations of decision making strategies, allowing a prosumer community to generate more distributed electricity (compared to commonly applied strategies) by mitigating over- voltages over a low-voltage feeder. We finally investigate how to design distributed control schemes that may contribute reaching (at least partially) the objectives of the community, by resort in to machine learning techniques to extract, from centralised solution(s), decision making patterns to be applied locally. First empirical results show that, even after a post-processing phase so that it satisfies physical constraints, the learning approach still performs better than predetermined strategies targeting safety first, then cost minimisation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-level control scheme {{for the energy}} management of an <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumer</b> node equipped with controllable loads, local generation, and storage devices. The main control objective is to optimize the prosumer’s energy bill by means of intelligent load shifting and storage control. A generalized tariff model including both volumetric and capacity components is considered, and user preferences {{as well as all}} technical constraints are respected. Simulations based on real household consumption data acquired with a sampling period of 1 s are discussed. The proposed control scheme bestows the prosumer node with the flexibility needed to support smart grid use cases such as bill optimization (i. e., local energy trading), control of the profile at the point of connection with the grid, demand response, and reaction to main supply faults (e. g., islanding operation), etc...|$|E
40|$|Surplus energy {{can be a}} {{recurrent}} phenomenon in zero-energy buildings (ZEBs) with onsite generation systems, usually resulting in the export of excess electricity. Yet, converting electricity into heat and exporting it could improve the overall energy balance. This study analyses the energy and exergy performance of a Finnish nearly zero-energy building (nZEB) as a heat and <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumer,</b> and proposes alternative energy topologies to improve energy and exergy levels, primary energy demand and CO 2 emissions. The results show that increasing the installed capacity of the photovoltaic systems would lead to zero energy, exergy, emissions and a balance of primary energy. However, by instead using the surplus electricity to drive a heat pump and export heat, the currently installed capacity {{would lead to a}} net energy export of over 4000  kWh/a. Thus, energy conversion could significantly enhance the contribution from heat and electricity prosumers to smart energy grids, though not without affecting other criteria. Two management strategies arise: favouring heat export improves the net energy and CO 2 emissions reduction but lessens the net exergy, while favouring electricity export improves the net exergy and primary energy reduction. The findings highlight that energy conversion can enhance nZEB performance and its exchange with hybrid grids.

40|$|This paper gives a brief {{overview}} about electricity consumption optimization based on consumption profiles of <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumers</b> that are connected to smart grids. The main object {{of this approach is}} identification of informatics solutions for electricity consumption optimization in order to decrease electricity bill. In this way, larger scale integration of renewable energy sources is allowed therefore entire society will gain benefits. This paper describes the main objectives of such informatics system and stages for its implementation. The system will analyze the specific profile and behavior of each <b>electricity</b> consumer or <b>prosumer,</b> automatically assist him to make right decisions and offer optimal advice for usage of controllable and non-controllable appliances. It will serve, based on big data transfer from <b>electricity</b> consumers or <b>prosumers,</b> as a powerful tool for grid operators that will be able to better plan their resources...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a deep {{discussion}} going on among the power system society about {{the architecture of the}} future system. In practice, the smart grid concept is expected to be applied in various different forms {{and there will be a}} need for significant investments in both existing and new infrastructures. In this drastically evolving environment, policy makers and electric utilities are finding themselves in challenging positions to plan and prioritize methodologies and initiatives for future developments. Among others, decentralized power generation is gaining significance in liberalized electricity markets, and small size electricity consumers become also producers (prosumers). The scope of this paper is to map those factors (and their interactions) that influence the load profile, and provide a methodology for modeling the behavior of <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumers.</b> Simulations provide a time and cost effective way to vision the future power system and promote the most efficient solutions. The importance of including the behavior of a large amount of small size prosumers in power system simulations will be outlined, and this concept will be illustrated through an example of modeling car drivers' behavior in order to assess the grid impact of electric vehicles charging in Dutch residential areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of low-cost renewable energy generators transforms households into <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumers.</b> Given that generation from renewable sources is highly volatile {{and does not}} perfectly match the daily demand pattern of households, electricity storage has been proposed for balancing energy generation and demand. In this work, we suggest that, due to {{the high cost of}} Energy Storage Systems (ESS), prosumers should deploy and share ESSs in a collaborative fashion. This will allow them to leverage the temporal diversity in their energy generation and consumption patterns, so as to reduce the cost paid to the main grid and even to cover the deployment cost of ESSs. We address the question 'How much storage capacity should be placed and in which locations in the distribution network?'. In order to answer this question, we need also to consider how much each prosumer should charge and discharge each deployed ESS. The solution of this joint ESS placement-dimensioning and utilization problem depends on the energy distribution losses, expected electricity prices, and the diversity of prosumers' profiles. Accordingly, we employ the Nash bargaining framework to determine how this cost should be shared in a fair, and hence self-enforcing, fashion among prosumers. Based on realistic demand and generation traces, we show that collaborative prosumption of energy through properly placed ESS can lead to significant savings of up to 50 % compared to a non-cooperating setting. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Smart {{distributed}} {{power systems}} {{are an important}} part of the energy shift that is currently taking place. Electricity generation, as well as power system control is moving from central operation towards local distribution grid operation, mainly due to the new possibilities that come along with distributed energy resources (DERs). These allow local consumers to generate their own <b>electricity</b> (<b>prosumer),</b> and offer support services to the grid, such as frequency control for example. Smart distributed grids can improve the local operation of DERs by coordinating demand and supply in real-time, and as such improve the power quality of the distribution grid, as well as improve the security of energy supply on local level. However, intelligent control systems, such as design of the H 2020 project EMPOWER that will be used in this work, bring along complex new interconnections in the distribution grid, that may lead to increased risk of failure propagations in the distribution grid. As this, and several other challenges of the smart distributed grid could counteract the anticipated benefits, the need arises to evaluate how well an intelligent control system can cope with constantly evolving interconnections in the distribution grid, with the addition of new technologies, with the grid vulnerabilities regarding cyber security, etc. Evaluating how a system behaves when going through changing conditions, or when undergoing a disturbance, can be defined as resilience analysis, and this is what this thesis will be about. First, resilience will be defined in the context of smart distributed power systems through an extensive literature review, after which a resilience framework will be developed, based on the existing EMPOWER smart distribution grid. The technical characteristics, as well as the functionalities of the system will be defined and represented in an entity-relationship model. This model will serve as a basis to assess the level of dependencies that each main system functionality has in relation to three elements: the physical infrastructure of the system, its socio-economic environment, and the ICT network. Moreover, the attributes, or properties of the system components will be used to formulate resilience indicators against different types of disturbances of the smart distribution grid...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} interface between technology and society in the emerging electricity systems {{and in particular the}} role of the energy prosumer in the energy transition. It contributes {{to the understanding of the}} role of consumers in emerging electricity systems within the current EU energy policy context where consumer active participation is regarded as "a prerequisite for managing the energy transition successfully and in a cost-effective way". Emerging energy systems are characterized by a high level of complexity, especially for what concerns the behaviour of social actors. Social actors interact through physical and social networks by sharing information and learning from one another through social interactions. These interactions determine self-organization and emergent behaviours in energy consumption patterns and practices. I argue that the best suited tool to study emergent behaviours in energy consumption patterns and practices, and to investigate how consumers' preferences and choices lead to macro behaviours is agent based modelling. To build a sound characterization of the energy prosumer, I review the current social psychology and behavioural theories on sustainable consumption and collect evidence from EU energy prosumers surveys, studies and demand side management pilot projects. I employ these findings to inform the development of an agent based model of the <b>electricity</b> <b>prosumer,</b> Subjective Individual Model of Prosumer - SIMP, and its extended version, SIMP-N, that includes the modelling of the social network. I apply SIMP and SIMP-N models to study the emergence in consumer systems and how values and beliefs at consumer level (as defined by social psychology and behavioural theories and informed by empirical evidence) and social dynamics lead to macro behaviours. More specifically, I explore the diffusion of smart grid technologies enabled services among a population of interacting prosumers and evaluate the impact of such diffusion on individual and societal performance indicators under different policy scenarios and contextual factors. The analysis of the simulation results provides interesting insights on how different psychological characteristics, social dynamics and technological elements can strongly influence consumers' choices and overall system performance. I conclude proposing a framework for an integrated approach to modelling emerging energy systems and markets that extend the SIMP model to also include markets, distribution system operator and the electricity network...|$|E
30|$|The model {{represents}} a LEM with individual residential agents {{operating on a}} short-term merit order market in 15 min time slots. An agent is an autonomous entity which can act proactively inside a common environment and {{with the ability to}} interact with the other agents. Our model includes the agent types of prosumers, consumers and producers. Consumer agents are households without <b>electricity</b> generation assets. <b>Prosumer</b> agents are households with electricity generation assets (PV or CHP). They act as producers on the LEM whenever their generation exceeds their demand and as consumers otherwise.|$|R
40|$|Prosumers are {{households}} {{that are both}} producers and consumers of <b>electricity.</b> A <b>prosumer</b> has a grid-connected decentralized production unit (DPU) and makes two types of exchanges with the grid: energy imports when the local production is insufficient to match the local consumption and energy exports when local production exceeds it. There exists two systems to measure the exchanges : a net metering system that uses a single meter to measure the balance between exports and imports and a net purchasing system that uses two meters to measure separately power exports and imports. Both systems are currently used for residential consumption. We build a model to compare the two metering systems. Under net metering, the price of exports paid to prosumers is implicitly set {{at the price of}} the electricity that they import. We show that net metering leads to (1) too many prosumers, (2) a decrease in the bills of prosumers, compensated via a higher bill for traditional consumers, and (3) a lack of incentives to synchronize local production and consumption.

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{is a vital}} asset and a priority for {{the social and economic}} development of today’s world. Building energy infrastructures with high efficiency and renewable energy sources is an important yet challenging task for a sustainable future. Smart grid is a term referring to a modernized electrical grid that uses information and communications technology to gather and act on information, such as information about the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in an automated fashion to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity. The main issue of this thesis is to propose new solutions which help end-users to optimize their consumption and better manage their own electricity costs. More specifically, the challenge is to make elastic the demand for, and the supply of, <b>electricity</b> of <b>prosumers</b> in order to optimize their energy cost based on power market conditions and on suitable constraints on their power consumption. By definition, a prosumer is a user that not only consumes, but also produces and stores electricity. In our work, we focus on power market models in which prosumers interact in a distributed environment during the purchase or sale of electric power. We have chosen to follow the distributed power market model DEZENT. Our contribution is the planning phase of the consumption of prosumers based on the negotiation mechanism of DEZENT. We propose a controller for the planning of the consumption which aims at minimizing the electricity cost achieved {{at the end of a}} day. Our controller model exploits the standard dynamic programming algorithm and in the thesis we discuss the assumptions on which the controller design is based. In order to evaluate the performance of our introduced controller, we performed extended experimental studies based on the available DEZENT simulator and on the Java implementation of the optimal controller. Our main result is that the highest energy cost reduction was obtained when we have a high variance on the profile cost of the <b>electricity,</b> the <b>prosumer</b> environment is in the undersupply situation and the reserve capacity of the controller is infinite. Vice versa, the lowest energy cost reduction corresponds to low variance, oversupply situation and finite reserve capacity. Furthermore the study of the problem of (sub) optimal repeated re-planning for the rest of the day has shown that a prosumer having to consume more than expected will pay a remarkable additional cost at the end of the day which depends also on the increased unit costs; in the case in which a part of the available energy reserve is lost, the additional cost paid is proportional to the amount of energy lost. In summary the general idea behind the planning (optimization) phase of a consumer is to plan consumption as smartly (delay or anticipate the consumption) as possible during a day, a week, a month or even a year. The results of this behavior is the minimization of the electricity cost in the long run, under certain assumptions on energy costs, as resulted by local negotiations, and on the acceptable variations of consumer requests. One of the open issues is the global effect of our introduced controller in a prosumer population since each prosumer can make use of it. We believe that the issue can lead to a congestion problem similar to that of the minority game problem proposed in economics literature...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons {{attributed}} to the slow uptake of grid-connected residential PV (photovoltaic) systems, is the lack of information about the near-term economic beneﬁts which are as important as long-term viability for residential customers. This paper presents a comparative assessment of the near-term economic beneﬁts of grid-connected residential PV systems. Case studies from the UK and India are taken as examples, as they vary signiﬁcantly in solar resource, customer demands, electricity prices and ﬁnancial support mechanisms. A metric termed PEUC (<b>prosumer</b> <b>electricity</b> unit cost) is proposed to develop an economic evaluation methodology to assess the near-term beneﬁts from PV systems. The results obtained showed that, under the present ﬁnancial support mechanisms, domestic PV systems provide near-term economic beneﬁts in most locations in India. For most locations in the UK, cost reduction is needed to achieve near-term ﬁnancial beneﬁts and this varies depending on the location of installation. The results presented demonstrate the importance of location speciﬁc system planning and demand-generation matching through optimal sizing of the PV system and demand side management...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed at finding {{solutions}} for the optimization of operating modes of a small-scale power system, which consists of Renewable and Distributed Energy Resources, <b>electricity</b> consumers and <b>prosumers</b> (consumers with own generation), micro-grids with smart metering and technologies. Consideration of market volatility and variance of forecast parameters (ambient temperature, energy consumption and price, water inflow) make {{the solution of the}} problem much more complicated and require implementation of new technologies, algorithms and software tools. A brief review of smart grid technologies in Latvia is provided in this paper. The algorithm of profit maximization for prosumers is described, taking into account the random nature of the state variables. Mathematical description is given in a stochastic manner. When the energy resources are limited, their optimum distribution for the considered time period becomes especially important. A case study is provided for the existing micro-scale combined heat and power plant and demonstrates the operability and feasibility of the proposed stochastic optimization algorithm. It is concluded that the algorithm could increase the effectiveness of the operation of prosumers at the conditions of limited resources...|$|R
30|$|LEMs {{support the}} {{decentralization}} of energy systems by including the end users into the energy market (Kamrat 2001; Buchmann et al. 2013; Hvelplund 2006). We define a LEM as a geographically distinct and socially close community of residential prosumers and consumers who may trade locally produced electricity within their community. For this, all actors {{need to have}} access to a local market platform on which (buy) bids and (ask) offers for local electricity are matched. LEMs serve different objectives, i.e. strengthening the local economy by keeping financial benefits local, increasing the level of the community’s energy autarky, creating incentives to buy energy locally, and empowering energy end users (Koirala et al. 2016; Rosen and Madlener 2013; Mengelkamp et al. 2018 a; Olivella-Rosell et al. 2018). The most important stakeholders on a LEM are: 1. <b>Electricity</b> (end) consumers, <b>prosumers</b> and producers, 2. Electricity retailers, 3. Suppliers and generators, 4. Local authorities, and 5. Governments (Kamrat 2001). The enumeration does not represent an ordering of importance. In stakeholder category 1., (end) prosumers and producers related to a small-scale, i.e. residential level, while stakeholder category 3. relates to middle-large scale, e.g. central generation plants. In the long run, LEMs can help to build up a sustainable energy system based on RES by developing local energy balances. Thus, a sustainable energy system that relies on the bottom-up integration of RES can be developed.|$|R
40|$|A risk bidding {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} to help prosumers formulating optimal quantity-price bids for the day-ahead energy market. A prosumer is {{the manager of}} a Low Voltage (LV) Micro-Grid (MG), connected to the main electric grid, where generators are paired with renewable energy sources (RES). To present the optimal bidding in the wholesale <b>electricity</b> market, the <b>prosumers</b> need to resolve a short-term management problem and need to identify all influencing variables (i. e. energy exchange, internal production, level of storage, Photovoltaic power plants (PV)). They also {{have to take into account}} the uncertainty in RES energy production to evaluate different risks associated with their tolerance preferences. A heterogenous MG which pairs traditional thermal and electrical generators with a PV power production is simulated. An economic model based on genetic algorithms is proposed to formulate the optimal bidding. Although in literature it is possible to find similar decision support models, one of the main original contributions of this work is to estimate the RES input of the proposed model with Analogs Ensemble (AnEn) approach, which is used here to provide day-ahead PV energy forecasting. The results of the model are analyzed evaluating the risk associated with the different prosumer's choices by the expected utility theory. The analyzed case study uses on residential MG and different prosumer risk tolerances (adverse, neutral and incline). Results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodolog...|$|R
40|$|A {{prosumer}} is {{a customer}} that both uses and supplies energy, such as electricity or district heat. These are already {{a part of}} the <b>electricity</b> system. Lately, <b>prosumers</b> have also been discussed as {{a part of the}} district heating systems. This calls for more knowledge in this area. The present study seeks to evaluate the potential for district heating contribution from small scale prosumers, based on excess heat, and their environmental impact in an area with diverse building types. The results were mainly developed through a case study performed on Hyllie, an area under construction in Malmö, Sweden. Data from property developers and some measured data were used to evaluate the annual prosumer potential of buildings. Environmental calculations were performed by simulations in the commercial simulation programme NetSim and data from Swedish literature. Four cases were investigated, based on whether the prosumers were allowed to deliver heat beyond the Hyllie borders or not and on two different ways of managing the supply temperature. The temperature of the excess heat was either raised with a heat pump, or directly utilised in the district heating network. In the latter case, the temperature of the domestic hot water was raised with electricity. The results showed that the potential for excess heat prosumers is fairly big, in Hyllie around 50 - 120 % of the annual heat demand. Most of the excess heat is however produced during the summer months. The environmental results showed that the environmental output of the electricity applied in the prosumer solution decided whether or not the prosumer solution was better than the conventional district heating solution...|$|R
