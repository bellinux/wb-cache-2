40|$|In {{almost every}} field of law,from tort and {{contract}} to environmental law and criminal justice, issues about 'risk' are increasingly {{of interest to}} lawyers. At the same time, {{there has been little}} <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> into the nature of the contact between law and risks. This book argues that ideas about risk have not traditionally been absent from law, as is sometimes supposed. Lawyers and legal theorists have used and conceptualised risk in particular ways, and ideas of risk have had significant influence in key elements of legal theory including questions of justice and responsibility. The book explores the conceptual place of risk across a number of fields of law; and identifies some significant challenges for law and legal theory arising from broader debates about risk. It therefore sheds light on areas that are under-explored despite current interest among lawyers, and aims to provide an accessible guide to emerging controversies and challenges for law in this area while explaining their significance...|$|E

All errors and omissions remain the authors. Executive Summary There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the use of psychometric tests for selection purposes has increased in recent years. However, the data are almost entirely crosssectional. Thus, while the propensity to test, and levels of test use, can be related to various organisational characteristics such as size, costs of hiring and firing, or adoption of formal personnel policies, there is very little information on the underlying reasons for changes (and increases) in use. (See Jenkins, 2001 a; Jenkins and Wolf, 2002.) This paper reports findings from a series of in-depth interviews with senior human resources staff responsible for using selection testing. These formed part of a more <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> into patterns, and correlates, of test use, and drew on hypotheses which had been examined using national cross-sectional datasets. The interviews addressed directly the reasons for changes in test use, and so were deliberately focused on organisations (private and public) in which tests were already being used. As such, they obviously cannot provid...|$|E
40|$|The avowed aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to show that}} there are some {{synthetic}} necessary truths, or that synthetic apriori knowledge is possible. This is really a pretext for an investigation into the general connection between meaning and truth, or between understanding and knowing, which, as pointed out in the preface, is really the first stage in a more <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> concerning meaning. (Not all kinds of meaning are concerned with truth.) After the preliminaries (chapter one), in which the problem is stated and some methodological remarks made, the investigation proceeds in two stages. First there is a detailed inquiry into {{the manner in which the}} meanings or functions of words occurring in a statement help to determine the conditions in which that statement would be true (or false). This prepares the way for the second stage, which is an inquiry concerning the connection between meaning and necessary truth (between understanding and knowing apriori). The first stage occupies Part Two of the thesis, the second stage Part Three. In all this, only a restricted class of statements is discussed, namely those which contain nothing but logical words and descriptive words, such as "Not all round tables are scarlet" and "Every three-sided figure is three-angled".

40|$|In the Introduction I {{explore the}} reasons for my enquiry, and outline the inadequacies {{of some of the}} {{existing}} attempts to determine the aims and purposes of mathematics in education. In Part 1 I discuss the scope and validity of the justification of mathematics {{on the basis of its}} supposed usefulness. From there I defend the view that, in principle at least, there are different kinds of reasons for learning mathematics. In Parts 2 and 3 I attempt to explain whether or not mathematics is fit for two particular non-utility purposes claimed by various writers, and if so, how. Thus, in Part 2, I examine the rather strong claim that mathematics is afine art, and hence or otherwise that it is a source of aesthetic satisfaction. In Part 3, I explore the claim that mathematics provides mental training. Here I shall show that 'mental training', is a broad notion ranging from the rather moral character training to the more restricted notion of training in logic. Between these extremes lies a more modest notion which I argue is the most plausible. The thesis is thus both a history of ideas and a clarification of the concepts used in describing fairly established purposes and rejecting those that seem to me to be unattainable or at least scarcely attainable by studying mathematics. The reason for the study is twofold. I see it as a particular case of the <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> into the aims of education. So that my conclusions should inform those who want to justify the place of mathematics on the curriculum. Also, however, I want to suggest that the purposes of mathematics education are internally related to understanding the subject, so that the pupil will gain understanding from a clearer notion of what he or she is doing mathematics for...|$|E
40|$|Accurately characterizing a drug's {{safety profile}} is essential. Trial harm and {{tolerability}} assessments rely, in part, on participants' reports of medical histories, adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medications. Optimal methods for questioning participants are unclear, but different methods giving different results can undermine meta-analyses. This study compared methods for eliciting such data and explored reasons for dissimilar participant responses. Participants from open-label antimalarial and antiretroviral interaction trials in two distinct sites (South Africa, n = 18 [all HIV positive]; Tanzania, n = 80 [86 % HIV positive]) {{were asked about}} ill health and treatment use by sequential use of (1) general enquiries without reference to particular conditions, body systems or treatments, (2) checklists of potential health issues and treatments, (3) in-depth interviews. Participants' experiences of illness and treatment and their reporting behaviour were explored qualitatively, as were trial clinicians' experiences with obtaining participant reports. Outcomes were the number and nature of data by questioning method, themes from qualitative analyses and a theoretical interpretation of participants' experiences. There was an overall cumulative {{increase in the number}} of reports from <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> through checklists to in-depth interview; in South Africa, an additional 12 medical histories, 21 AEs and 27 medications; in Tanzania an additional 260 medical histories, 1 AE and 11 medications. Checklists and interviews facilitated recognition of health issues and treatments, and consideration of what to report. Information was sometimes not reported because participants forgot, it was considered irrelevant or insignificant, or they feared reporting. Some medicine names were not known and answers to questions were considered inferior to blood tests for detecting ill health. South African inpatient volunteers exhibited a "trial citizenship", working to achieve researchers' goals, while Tanzanian outpatients sometimes deferred responsibility for identifying items to report to trial clinicians. Questioning methods and trial contexts influence the detection of adverse events, medical histories and concomitant medications. There should be further methodological work to investigate these influences and find appropriate questioning methods...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is no {{consensus}} on the ideal methodology for eliciting participant-reported harms, but question methods influence the extent and nature of data detected. This gives potential for measurement error and undermines meta-analyses of adverse effects. We undertook to identify barriers to accurate and complete reporting of harms data, by qualitatively exploring participants’ experiences of illness and treatment, and reporting behaviours; and compared the number and nature of data detected by three enquiry methods. Methods: Participants within antiretroviral/antimalarial interaction trials in South Africa and Tanzania were asked about medical history, treatments and/or adverse events by general enquiries followed by checklists. Those reporting differently between these two question methods were invited to an in-depth interview and focus group discussion. Health narratives were analysed to investigate accuracy and completeness of case record form data and to understand reasons for differential reporting between question methods. Outcomes were the number and nature of data by question method, themes from qualitative analyses and a theoretical interpretation of participants’ experiences. Results: We observed a cumulative increase in sensitivity of detection {{of all types of}} reports while progressing from <b>general</b> <b>enquiry,</b> through checklist, to in-depth interview. Questioning detail and terminology influenced participants’ recognition of health issues and treatments. Reporting patterns and vocabulary suggest influence from the relative importance that illnesses and treatments have for participants. Perceptions were often dichotomised (e. g. ‘street’ versus clinic treatments, symptoms experienced versus tests and examinations performed, chronic versus acute illness, persistent versus intermittent symptoms, activity- versus malaria-related symptoms) and this differentiation extended to ideas of relevance to report. South African participants displayed a ‘trial citizenship’, taking responsibility for the impact of their reporting on trial results, and even reaching reporting decisions by consensus. In contrast, Tanzanians perceived their role more as patients than participants; the locus of responsibility for knowing information relevant to the trial fell with trial staff as doctors rather than with themselves. Conclusions: Our observations of how reporting relates to participant perceptions inside and outside trials could help optimise how harms data are elicited. Questions reflecting the different ways that biomedically defined illness and treatment data are perceived by participants may help them understand relevance for reporting. We will theorise how these two disparate trial environments may have influenced how participants understood their role, as this could help researchers achieve empowered participation in similar trials...|$|E

40|$|Real-time signal {{extraction}} (RTSE) {{concerns the}} determination of optimal asymmetric filters {{towards the end of}} a time series where- otherwise desirable- symmetric filters cannot be applied anymore. The attractiveness of this particular estimation problem resides in the generality of its scope.

Traditionally, the estimation problem addressed by RTSE is tackled in the methodological framework of the classical maximum likelihood paradigm. We here question the adequacy of this general parametric approach. In particular, we review a statistical apparatus- the DFA- consisting of optimization criteria, diagnostics and tests which accounts for alternative user-relevant aspects of the estimation problem. Interestingly, this customization relates to an uncertainty principle which entails a fundamental shift of perspective. As a result, RTSE emerges as an autonomous discipline with proprietary concepts and statistics.
