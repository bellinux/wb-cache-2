50|$|Because of {{possible}} phosphorus deficiencies in farmed animals, phosphorus is supplied {{in the form}} of inorganic feed phosphates. Consequences of deficiencies are known and well documented. The initial effect is a fall in blood plasma levels, followed by withdrawal of calcium and phosphorus from the skeleton. Loss of appetite and reduced productivity are common in all animal species. A poor feed conversion efficiency and a lowered live weight gain are well known production related indicators. Other deficiency includes reduced fertility in cattle, but also reduced milk yield (milk contains on average 1 g of P per kg), stiffness and in extreme cases even enlarged joints or deformed bones and lameness. Other well known symptoms are In layers reduced <b>egg</b> <b>yield</b> and, in case of chicks, reduced hatchability, together with cage layer fatigue syndrome. Also for all species osteomalacia and reduced fertility are possible. All these symptoms are more or less irreversible, resulting in economic losses for the farmer.|$|E

For this purpose, the foreign brown commercial layer genotype which coded YB and native brown egg layer Atak-S genotype was compared in terms of yield and egg quality characteristics. This study included 150 hens from each genotype and a total of 300 chickens were used. Each genotype divided into three groups among themselves and 50 hens were raised each group. In the poultry house with deep-litter ground system, 5 chickens were raised in the unit area (m 2) and, 4 m 2 grazing area was allocated per each hen in the grazing area. The pullets that hatched on the same day were obtained from a commercial firm at 16 weeks of age. 	The study was carried out until 80 weeks of age. <b>Egg</b> <b>yield</b> and egg quality characteristics were determined during this period. There was no difference between the genotypes in terms of 50 % <b>egg</b> <b>yield</b> age, egg weight, hen-day <b>egg</b> <b>yield,</b> hen-house <b>egg</b> <b>yield,</b> viability, albumen index, yolk index, haugh unit and yolk color. In contrast, the difference between the genotypes was found to be important in terms of body weight at weeks of 18 th and 80 th age, feed consumption, feed conversation ratio, shape index, shell thickness, density, meat-blood spot ratio and egg shell color. In this study, genotypes were not superior to each other in terms of all traits.

In both experiments, YSCP was substituted for 0, 33, 66 or 100 % of the protein of soybean meal (SBM). Pooled data from the first seven 28 -day periods of experiment 2 showed that replacing SBM with YSCP did not affect egg production but reduced egg weight, <b>egg</b> <b>yield,</b> feed consumption and body weight gain. At the end of the seventh period, methionine supplementation was increased to. 13,. 22, and. 28 % in diets containing 6. 55, 12. 90 and 19. 15 % YSCP, respectively.

Inclusion of YSCP in the diets during the breeder phase did not significantly affect productivity of hens or hatchability of eggs.

Groups were consisted of 6 replications and in each replication there were 10 hens reared in individual cages. Moult was induced by feeding hens a commercial compound feed containing high levels of added Zn (15, 000 ppm) as Zn oxide during the first 10 days, and following 40 days they were fed laying diet (17 % crude protein and 2700 kcal ME/kg; 75 g/day).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of hatching egg weight of broiler parent stocks on hatching results, chick performance, carcass characteristics, internal organ weights and some blood stress parameters. Eggs were divided into 3 egg weight groups (55. 0 to 60. 0 g (light), 60. 1 to 65. 0 g (medium) and 65. 1 to 70. 0 g (heavy)) for the experiments. After incubation, mixed-gender broiler chicks from the hatcher were placed into 27 grower pens (2 x 1 m) with 9 replications for 3 weight groups by using randomized block design. Each pen had 25 broiler chicks. Therefore, 225 chicks were used for each group and 675 chicks in total. The experiment was designed with nine replicates. Chi-square test, variance analysis test and Duncan multiple range test were used during statistical analysis. Hatching egg weight significantly affected egg shell thickness (p= 0. 042), egg weight loss on 18 th day of incubation (p< 0. 001), number of healthy chick (p= 0. 001) and deformed chicks (p= 0. 003), hatchability (p= 0. 003), hatchability yield (p= 0. 002), hatching weight and 7 day chick body weight (p= 0. 001), fresh carcass yields (p= 0. 002), and cooled carcass yields (p< 0. 001), blood triglyceride level (p= 0. 031), back toe relative asymmetry (p= 0. 032) and back toe fluctuating asymmetry (p= 0. 038). It was concluded in the present study that medium-weight <b>eggs</b> <b>yielded</b> better hatching results and the chicks of medium-weight <b>eggs</b> also <b>yielded</b> better outcomes with regards to other investigated parameters...|$|R
