60|$|On {{the brow}} of this precipice stood a great {{building}} of the same granite that formed the cliff, built on three sides of a square, the fourth side being open, save {{for a kind of}} battlement pierced at its base by a little door. This imposing place we afterwards discovered was the palace of the queen, or rather of the queens. At the back of the palace the town sloped gently upwards to a flashing building of white marble, crowned by the golden dome which we had already observed. The city was, with the exception of this one building, entirely built of red granite, and laid out in regular blocks with splendid roadways between. So far as we could see also the houses were all one-storied and detached, with gardens round them, which gave some relief to the eye wearied with the vista of red granite. At the back of the palace a road of extraordinary width stretched away up the hill for a distance of {{a mile and a half}} or so, and appeared to terminate at an open space surrounding the gleaming building that crowned the hill. But right in front of us was the wonder and glory of Milosis -- the great staircase of the palace, the magnificence of which took our breath away. Let the reader imagine, if he can, a splendid stairway, sixty-five feet from balustrade to balustrade, consisting of two vast flights, each of one hundred and twenty-five steps of eight inches in height by three feet broad, connected by a flat resting-place sixty feet in length, and running from the palace wall on the edge of the precipice down to meet a waterway or canal cut to its foot from the river. This marvellous staircase was supported upon a single enormous granite arch, of which the resting-place between the two flights formed the crown; that is, the connecting open space lay upon it. From this archway sprang a subsidiary <b>flying</b> <b>arch,</b> or rather something that resembled a <b>flying</b> <b>arch</b> in shape, such as none of us had seen in any other country, and of which the beauty and wonder surpassed all that we had ever imagined. Three hundred feet from point to point, and no less than five hundred and fifty round the curve, that half-arc soared touching the bridge it supported for a space of fifty feet only, one end resting on and built into the parent archway, and the other embedded in the solid granite of the side of the precipice.|$|E
60|$|This {{staircase}} {{with its}} supports was, indeed, {{a work of}} which any living man might have been proud, both on account of its magnitude and its surpassing beauty. Four times, as we afterwards learnt, did the work, which was commenced in remote antiquity, fail, and was then abandoned for three centuries when half-finished, till at last there rose a youthful engineer named Rademas, {{who said that he}} would complete it successfully, and staked his life upon it. If he failed he was to be hurled from the precipice he had undertaken to scale; if he succeeded, he was to be rewarded by the hand of the king's daughter. Five years was given to him to complete the work, and an unlimited supply of labour and material. Three times did his arch fall, till at last, seeing failure to be inevitable, he determined to commit suicide on the morrow of the third collapse. That night, however, a beautiful woman came to him in a dream and touched his forehead, and of a sudden he saw a vision of the completed work, and saw too through the masonry and how the difficulties connected with the <b>flying</b> <b>arch</b> that had hitherto baffled his genius were to be overcome. Then he awoke and once more commenced the work, but on a different plan, and behold! he achieved it, and {{on the last day of}} the five years he led the princess his bride up the stair and into the palace. And in due course he became king by right of his wife, and founded the present Zu-Vendi dynasty, which is to this day called the 'House of the Stairway', thus proving once more how energy and talent are the natural stepping-stones to grandeur. And to commemorate his triumph he fashioned a statue of himself dreaming, and of the fair woman who touched him on the forehead, and placed it in the great hall of the palace, and there it stands to this day.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{runs through}} a cutting, design by Brunel.

For extra stability, these arches were ballasted with high mounds of copper slag.|$|R
50|$|Just west of Swansea, the 829 yard Cockett Tunnel {{suffered}} a partial collapse in 1899, long after Brunel's death.

50|$|The South Wales Railway at Llansamlet, near Swansea, {{runs through}} a cutting {{designed}} by Brunel. After a landslip {{in the opening}} year of 1850, Brunel then designed four 70 foot <b>flying</b> <b>arches</b> to hold the cutting walls apart. For extra stability, these arches were ballasted with high mounds of copper slag, a dense waste product conveniently available locally. The four arches are now individually Grade II listed.|$|R
50|$|A <b>flying</b> <b>arch</b> {{is a form}} of {{arch bridge}} that does not carry any {{vertical}} load, but is provided solely to supply outward horizontal forces, to resist an inwards compression. They are used across cuttings, to avoid them collapsing inwards.|$|E
50|$|Like the <b>flying</b> <b>arch,</b> the {{inverted}} arch is {{not used}} to support a load, as for a bridge, but rather to resist sideways, inwards loads. The conventional arch supports a vertical load downwards on {{the centre of the}} arch and translates this into forces both downwards and outwards {{at the base of the}} arch. In most cases, this sideways force is a nuisance and must be resisted by either strong foundations or a further 'bowstring' girder, in the form of a tied-arch bridge.|$|E

50|$|The first {{portion of}} the line was opened on 18 June 1850, from Chepstow to Swansea. It {{consisted}} of 75 miles of double track, on the broad gauge, using Brunel's longitudinal timber track. Engines and rolling stock were provided by the Great Western Railway; they arrived by coastal shipping, as the line was not connected to any other line. Soon after the opening a slip in the deep cutting slope took place at Llansamlet, between Neath and Swansea. To stabilise it, Brunel erected the so-called <b>flying</b> <b>arches,</b> loaded with slag, to resist the thrust.|$|R
50|$|The first railway use of {{constructed}} <b>flying</b> <b>arches</b> was at Chorley, on the Bolton and Preston Railway, in 1841. These were {{a series}} of narrow 25 foot long, strut-like arches between two masonry retaining walls. The retaining walls constrained the side forces such that they could only act axially along the columns; between earth banks, such narrow arches {{would otherwise have been}} at risk of collapse from off-axis forces. In 2008 the original stone arches were replaced by steel during work to lower the running lines in order to create clearance for electrification work. The stone arches were subsequently restored atop the new steel structures in 2014.|$|R
50|$|The {{main body}} of St. John's Church in Little Wilbraham dates from the mid 13th century. The first known rector of the church was Walter, son of William, who lived around 1230. Late in the 13th century, the north aisle was added, {{probably}} originally as a chapel. On the outside, set into the flint wall, are {{the remains of the}} lower half of a crusader cross and this, along with the memory of the Order of the Templars, demonstrates the close links between the village and one of the Military Orders of the Crusading period. The 14th century saw major changes to the church. Early in the 14th century, the square tower was added at the west end, strengthened by supporting abutments or <b>flying</b> <b>arches.</b> On the north side, the wall was reconstructed so {{the top half of the}} crusader cross was lost. New windows were built in. Nearing the end of the 14th century, five ornate windows were also added.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel {{suffered}} a partial collapse in 1899, {{which was held}} to {{have been caused by}} the resumption of pumping operations at the long-closed Weig-fawr colliery, owned by Philip Richard (II), the flooded workings of which extended beneath the tunnel. The tunnel was completely closed for four weeks, after which traffic was resumed on a single line, but it was not fully restored until 1903, by which time steel ribs had been inserted into the bore of the tunnel at its eastern end (not the location of the collapse) to strengthen the roof. These were found to unduly restrict the loading gauge within the tunnel and were subsequently removed (by 1916). The eastern end of the tunnel was opened out (reducing the length to 788 yards) and the cutting sides were supported by two brick-built <b>flying</b> <b>arches</b> (...) [...] The banks of the cutting were so unstable that even during this opening-out work, timber horseshoe shoring was required.|$|R

50|$|Tetraplatia volitans has s spindle shaped body 4-9mm {{long with}} a {{transverse}} groove nearer the aboral end. Four <b>flying</b> buttresses <b>arch</b> over this groove and connect the oral and aboral ends. It has four longitudinal rows of nematocysts with four shorter rows in between. There are eight pairs of lappets with sense organs between. The species has a cosmopolitan distribution, being found worldwide {{from the surface}} down {{to a depth of}} about 900 meters. It feeds on small zooplankton.|$|R
50|$|Its {{final design}} shows {{a mix of}} {{influences}} from the various Gothic architectural styles of the Middle Ages, identifiable in its pointed <b>arches,</b> <b>flying</b> buttresses, a variety of ceiling vaulting, stained-glass windows and carved decorations in stone, and by its three similar towers, two on the west front and one surmounting the crossing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flying</b> {{buttress}} (arc-boutant, <b>arch</b> buttress) is {{a specific}} form of buttress composed of an arched structure that extends from the upper portion of a wall to a pier of great mass, in order to convey to the ground the lateral forces that push a wall outwards, which are forces that arise from vaulted ceilings of stone and from wind-loading on roofs.|$|R

50|$|Belarusian Gothic (Belarusian беларуская готыка hotyka, Russian белорусская готика gotika) is the {{architectural}} style of ecclesiastical buildings constructed during the 15th and 16th centuries {{in parts of}} modern-day Belarus, Lithuania and eastern Poland. Although these buildings have features typical of Gothic architecture such as lofty towers, <b>flying</b> buttresses, pointed <b>arches</b> and vaulted ceilings, they also contain elements not typically considered Gothic by Central and Western European standards.|$|R
50|$|A further {{development}} was the <b>flying</b> buttress which <b>arched</b> externally from the springing of the vault across {{the roof of}} the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall. These piers were often surmounted by a pinnacle or statue, further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.|$|R
50|$|Wardell's ANZ Gothic Bank {{is located}} on Collins Street in Melbourne and is {{considered}} by many to be the finest secular Neo-Gothic building in Australia. It was built between the years of 1883 to 1887. It was the largest bank in Australia at the time, and also the most expensive (£77,000). In 1987 it was voted Victoria's favorite building by readers of The Age newspaper. The bank manager, Sir George Verdon, was responsible for commissioning the bank's lavish design. He lived in an apartment above the bank. The banking chamber is supported by teal columns with floral Crockett capitals, and the ceiling is hand-painted in gold leaf. The interior features spectacular <b>flying</b> Gothic <b>arches,</b> which appear out of place in a secular building. One noteworthy aspect to the exterior is an octagonal turret. Supported by a ribbed corbel it rises into a small medieval spire, demonstrating Wardell's love of asymmetry.|$|R
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century, French {{builders}} developed the Gothic style, {{marked by the}} use of rib vaults, pointed <b>arches,</b> <b>flying</b> buttresses, and large stained glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.|$|R

50|$|Through {{the use of}} {{the pointed}} arch, architects could design less massive walls and provide larger window {{openings}} that were grouped more closely together, so they could achieve a more open, airy and graceful building. The high walls and vaulted stone roofs were often supported by <b>flying</b> buttresses: half <b>arches</b> which transmit the outward thrust of the superstructure to supports or buttresses, often visible on the exterior of the building. The barrel vaults and groin vaults characteristic of Romanesque building were replaced by rib vaults, which made possible a wider range of proportions between height, width and length.|$|R
50|$|The various {{elements}} of Gothic architecture emerged {{in a number}} of 11th- and 12th-century building projects, particularly in the Île de France area, but were first combined to form what we would now recognise as a distinctively Gothic style at the 12th century abbey church of Saint-Denis in Saint-Denis, near Paris.

40|$|Traditional masonry {{is today}} an unusual material, it is alien {{to us at}} the {{beginning}} to the 21 st. century. The usual assumptions for structural materials: homogeneity, isotropy, elastic constants (Young=s modulus, Poisson=s coefficient), etc., do not apply or are irrelevant in respect to masonry. Most important, though masonry presents a good strength in compression, is very weak to tension; its behaviour is >unilateral'. This fact has paramount importance in masonry behaviour. Besides, real masonry structures are cracked. A different approach is needed and it was used indeed when this type of structures were designed during the 18 th. and 19 th. centuries. Since the 1960 =s Professor Heyman has rigorously introduced the theory of masonry structures within the frame of Limit Analysis, and has clarified {{many aspects of the}} analysis of masonry architecture. To teach a new theory (in fact a forgotten one) presents serious difficulties. Not the least is that the listeners (students, practicing architects or engineers, even professors [...] .) must Aforget@ the usual frame of reference (elastic analysis, framed or trussed structures, etc [...] ) and contemplate, as did for example the gothic masters, a masonry building as a "heap of stones" in equilibrium under its own weight. But, one can add to his or her knowledge, but not subtract to it. In fact, we must reconcile the intuition of the old master builders with the teachings of modern structural theory. The theory can be studied but, how to teach the intuition, this feeling of the behaviour which has a fundamental importance in structural analysis and design? After more than fifteen years of teaching masonry structural behaviour I have found the use of physical models of extraordinary help. I do not mean the complicated models of laboratory, made by skilled workmen, but very simple models that the students may replicate at home for experiment, study and reflection. I use normally only two types of models. The first is Hooke=s hanging chain. The second is a Aplane@ block (voussoir) model made of thick cardboard. It is a personal invention, an idea which occurred to me when, at the beginning of my studies of arch behaviour, I was struggling with three dimensional models. It applies to arches or masonry structures of any kind as far as its thickness in one direction could be considered uniform: barrel vaults, but also buttresses or <b>flying</b> buttresses, double <b>arches,</b> etc. The paper will present the use of this two basic models: 1) for the teaching and appreciation of the fundamental assumptions; 2) to assure {{a better understanding of the}} Fundamental Theorems of Limit Analysis applied to masonry structures; 3) to study and understand the basic crack configurations of masonry arches and vaults. But to appreciate the use of models, a brief summary of the essentials of masonry structural theory should be given beforehan...|$|R
