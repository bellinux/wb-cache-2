[...] After travelling at 400mph (644km/h), the 67-year-old Frenchman said [...] "C'était magnifique... It was all I <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> in aviation—no propellers, no vibration."

500|$|The {{curriculum}} at Oxford before the reforms was notoriously narrow and impractical.

[...] He says, [...] "few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> passing through a university career." [...] He quotes the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: [...] "The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry."

500|$|Garfield and his {{supporters}} knew they would face a difficult election {{without the support of}} the New York Stalwarts and decided to offer one of them the vice presidential nomination. [...] Levi P. Morton, the first choice of Garfield's supporters, consulted with Conkling, who advised him to decline, which he did. [...] They next approached Arthur, and Conkling advised him to also reject the nomination, believing the Republicans would lose. Arthur thought otherwise and accepted. [...] According to a purported eyewitness account by journalist William C. Hudson, Conkling and Arthur argued, with Arthur telling Conkling, [...] "The office of the Vice-President is a greater honor than I <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> attaining." [...] Conkling eventually relented, and campaigned for the ticket.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing Harrison's musical {{career in}} a 2002 issue of Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that [...] "Love You To" [...] "opened {{creative}} doors through which Harrison's bandmates may not – and [...] Martin {{certainly would not}} – have <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> passing". Rolling Stone contributor Greg Kot pairs it with [...] "Taxman" [...] as two [...] "major contributions" [...] that saw Harrison [...] " [...] into his own as a songwriter" [...] on Revolver. Kot describes [...] "Love You To" [...] as [...] "a boldly experimental track" [...] and [...] "the first full-scale incorporation of Eastern instruments on a Beatles album". Writing on his music website Elsewhere, Graham Reid views the song as a [...] "classic" [...] due to its standing as [...] "arguably the first in Western pop … which owes nothing to pop music traditions.

500|$|The family {{returned}} to Downe on 27 August, and Darwin again {{wrote to the}} Gardeners' Chronicle appealing for assistance as he was [...] "very anxious to examine a few exotic forms". His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration {{of plants and animals}} had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley was strongly influenced by German idealism and in 1856 had asked if it was [...] "to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline... are any good to the animals?... Who has <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers... ?" [...] Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case.

500|$|... "Cherry on Top" [...] is a pop and R {{track with}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 48 seconds. Unlike the majority of Oh Land's songs, it is not an uptempo track. Instead, it contains [...] "piano instrumentals" [...] and [...] "light background harmonies". It features lyrics with a [...] "relatable" [...] message and [...] "figurative imagery". Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal". She proceeds in the chorus: [...] "You can have it all but you never stop / 'Cause all you ever want is the cherry on top" [...] / [...] "And all you <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of,</b> it ain't enough / You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top".|$|E

500|$|Garfield and the Ohio {{delegation}} desired a New York Stalwart as Garfield's {{vice presidential}} running mate, partly to placate Conkling, and partly {{to balance the}} ticket geographically. [...] Levi P. Morton declined after consulting with Conkling, who was still unhappy over Grant's loss and advised Morton not to accept. [...] The nomination was then offered to Chester A. Arthur, who had close Stalwart ties to Conkling, but who had impressed delegates with his work to broker the compromise on {{the selection of a}} convention chairman. Conkling tried to talk Arthur out of accepting, but Arthur insisted that he would, calling the Vice Presidency [...] "a greater honor than I <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> attaining." [...] Arthur won the nomination after he received 468 votes, next to the 193 for Elihu Washburne, and 44 for the third major candidate, Marshall Jewell. Former Governor Edmund J. Davis of Texas and several others were also nominated, but received little support. After convention chairman Hoar banged his gavel at 7:25 P.M. on June 8, the longest ever Republican National Convention was adjourned.|$|E

Greg Bone and Anderson played the guitars, while Anderson played the drums and keyboards. Produced by Brothers in Rhythm and Minogue, [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a pop rock song. Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine commented on Minogue's departure from dance music and bubblegum pop and her maturity since {{her work with}} Stock, Aitken and Waterman, stating [...] "Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up her sleeve this time than Stock, Aitken and Waterman <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully-cultivated bow." [...] British writer Sean Smith, author of Kylie (2014), commented that [...] "Did It Again" [...] was another track, along with [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", from Impossible Princess that [...] "didn't really sound like Kylie". He further commented that [...] "Did It Again" [...] was [...] "a blend of drums and electric guitar that might have found its way onto The Beatles' famous Revolver album." [...] Reviewing her compilation album Greatest Hits 87–97 (2003), Michael Paoletta from Billboard magazine viewed the composition as progressive rock.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Allmusic's Chris True had {{selected}} the song as an album stand {{out and a}} career stand out track. While reviewing her 2002 compilation Confide in Me, True stated “Impossible Princess, both of which found her stretching and growing beyond the pop princess image she had previously. Dark, noisy tracks like [...] "Limbo," [...] the trip-hoppy [...] "Jump," [...] and the more rock-oriented [...] "I Don't Need Anyone" [...] and [...] "Some Kind of Bliss"—both of which were co-written by the Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfield—found her trying on different styles to replace the bubblegum pop of the past.” A reviewer from Who Magazine called the song [...] "Funky , Spunky, Rocky, Big." [...] Gareth Gorman {{said that while the}} song showcased Minogue's [...] "thin vocals", he followed saying [...] "it still works due to one of those melody lines that is inevitable stunning, simple and effective."

Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded.

2500|$|Wall told Alison Gardner from What's on TV that Grace feels [...] "jittery" [...] in {{the days}} before her wedding because she is thinks Trevor is having an affair. Grace is terrified that she will be jilted. She {{described}} a pivotal scene in the story in which Grace and Trevor discuss her childhood dreams. Wall explained that Grace opens up about her wedding day being all she had <b>ever</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> growing up. She also pleads with him to not ruin her day. British paparazzi had acquired photographs of on location filming which appeared to suggest a funeral for Trevor was imminent. The reports were accurate as Grace's wedding episode was broadcast. Trevor decides that he wants to be with Grace. Sienna's daughter Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) discovered Trevor's affair. The murderess character is furious with Trevor for ruining her family unit with Ben. She approaches Trevor outside the church and stabs him before fleeing the scene. Trevor recalls his promise to not let Grace down on her wedding day. He gains composure, hides his stabbing wound and enters the church to complete the wedding ceremony. They manage to marry, but Trevor collapses and dies at the altar.|$|E
