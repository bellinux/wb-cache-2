5|$|Breckinridge was {{appointed}} as the state's attorney general soon after arriving. In November 1797, he resigned and {{was elected to}} the Kentucky House of Representatives the next month. As a legislator, he secured passage of a more humane criminal code that abolished the death penalty for all offenses except first-degree murder. On a 1798 trip to Virginia, an intermediary gave him Thomas Jefferson's Kentucky Resolutions, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts. At Jefferson's request, Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly; Jefferson's authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge's death. He opposed calling a state constitutional convention in 1799 but was elected as a delegate. Due to his influence, the state's government remained comparatively aristocratic, maintaining protections for slavery and limiting the power of the electorate. Called the father of the resultant constitution, <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state's Democratic-Republican Party and was selected Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800.|$|E
5|$|This {{incurred}} Johnson's wrath; at {{a cabinet}} meeting immediately afterward, Johnson accused Grant of breaking {{his promise to}} remain Secretary of War. Grant disputed that he had ever made such a promise although cabinet members later testified he had done so. Newspapers friendly to Johnson published {{a series of articles}} to discredit Grant over returning the War Department to Stanton, stating that Grant had been deceptive in the matter. This public insult infuriated Grant, and he defended himself in an angry letter to Johnson, after which the two men were confirmed foes. When Grant's statement became public, it increased his popularity among Radical Republicans and <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the controversy unscathed. Although Grant favored Johnson's impeachment, he took no active role in the impeachment proceedings, which were fueled in part by Johnson's removal of Stanton. Johnson barely survived, and none of the other Republican leaders directly involved benefited politically in their unsuccessful attempt to remove the president.|$|E
5|$|As the {{championship}} {{moved into the}} second half of the season, Fernando Alonso maintained a thirty-four-point lead over his nearest rival, Mark Webber, with Sebastian Vettel a further ten points behind. Alonso's outlook for the race was dour, qualifying sixth and pinning his hopes on a wet race as Lewis Hamilton continued McLaren's mid-season resurgence, returning to pole position for the first time since the Malaysian Grand Prix. Following an aborted start triggered by Michael Schumacher lining up in the wrong grid position and then shutting his engine off in the confusion, Hamilton and Grosjean lead the field away. After prematurely moving Jenson Button onto a three-stop strategy, McLaren gave Hamilton the order to hold position as the tight confines of the Hungaroring circuit forced the teams to try to make up positions in the pits. This was evidenced by Kimi Räikkönen, who inherited the lead after the first set of stops and produced a series of fast laps that allowed him to rejoin in second, coming dangerously close to team-mate Grosjean under brakes as <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the pit lane. Despite taking two seconds out of Hamilton's lead within five laps of rejoining the race, Räikkönen was powerless to reel Hamilton in any further. Hamilton won the race, the nineteenth of his career, with Räikkönen second and Grosjean in third. Hamilton's victory brought with it twenty-five points that put him back in championship contention, while a late decision by Red Bull to move Mark Webber onto a three-stop strategy saw the Australian slip further behind Fernando Alonso, as the Spaniard extended his championship lead to forty points.|$|E

The fighting took place near Sant Llorenç de la Muga, {{the site of a}} cannon ammunition foundry. The Spanish assault, carried out by 14,000 regular infantry and 6,000 provincial militia, failed to break the French defenders, who received some help from Pérignon's division in the center. Sauret's defenses, on the eastern flank, were not threatened.|$|E

In January 1956 he recorded two Granz-produced sessions including a reunion with pianist Teddy Wilson, trumpet player Roy Eldridge, trombonist Vic Dickenson, bassist Gene Ramey, and drummer Jo Jones – which were issued as The Jazz Giants '56 and Pres and Teddy albums. 1956 {{was a relatively}} good year for Lester Young, including a tour of Europe with Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Quartet and a successful residency at Olivia Davis' Patio Lounge in Washington, DC, with the Bill Potts Trio. Live recording of Young and Potts in Washington were issued later.|$|E

In 1307, both the current and former kings met with Bularghu, the Mongol representative in Cilicia, at his camp just outside Anazarba. Bularghu, a recent convert to Islam, murdered the entire Armenian party. Oshin, brother of Het'um, immediately marched against Bularghu to retaliate and vanquished him, forcing him to leave Cilicia. Bulargu was executed by Oljeitu for his crime {{at the request of}} the Armenians. Oshin was crowned new king of Cilician Armenia upon his return to Tarsus.|$|E

25|$|Like Macario Sakay, his {{subsequent}} successor as President, Malvar was an original Katipunero. That is, {{he joined the}} Katipunan before the Philippine Revolution. When the Revolution began by August 1896, <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> a leader of a 70-man army to being the military commander of Batangas. As military commander, he coordinated offensives with General Emilio Aguinaldo, leader of the revolutionaries in Cavite and General Paciano Rizal, leader of the revolutionaries in Laguna. He once fought alongside General Edilberto Evangelista, Malvar's senior officer at the time, at the Battle of Zapote Bridge, where the former died in battle. That was February 17, 1897. Succeeding Evangelista's generalship, Malvar had set up his own headquarters at Indang, Cavite where he stayed until the Tejeros Convention.|$|E
25|$|Beauregard {{was born}} on 14 February 1734 at Saint-Palais-sur-Mer, France. He entered the Noailles Cavalry Regiment in 1755 as a cadet and served in the Seven Years' War. He {{transferred}} to the Clermont Volunteers in 1758 as a lieutenant of dragoons and was discharged in 1760. He became a captain of infantry in 1766, transferred to the dragoons on 29 February 1768 and transferred again to the Penthièvre Dragoon Regiment on 9 December 1776. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Order of Saint-Louis on 8 April 1779. He was incarcerated for three months in the Château de Ham starting on 7 October 1781 for disrespect toward his commanding officer, a brigadier general. When <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> prison on 28 December 1781 he was placed on retirement.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, the era {{of peace}} was coming to a close. The United States had annexed the Republic of Texas, and the islands of the Caribbean seemed to be likely targets for further expansion. The Republic of Santo Domingo (the present-day Dominican Republic) had broken off from the Republic of Haiti in 1844, and the United States State Department needed to {{determine}} the new nation's social, political, and economic stability. The suitability of the Bay of Samana for U.S. Navy operations was also of interest. To find out, Secretary of State James Buchanan asked Porter to undertake a private investigation. He accepted the assignment, and on March 15, 1846, he left home. He arrived in Santo Domingo after some unexpected delays and spent two weeks mapping the coastline. On May 19, he began a trek through the interior that left him without communication for a month. On June 19, <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the jungle, bitten by insects, but with the information that the State Department wanted. He then discovered {{that while he was}} away the United States had gone to war with Mexico.|$|E

25|$|On November 1913, Manalo secluded {{himself with}} {{religious}} literature and unused notebooks in a friend's house in Pasay, instructing {{everyone in the}} house not to disturb him. <b>He</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> seclusion three days later with his new-found doctrines. Manalo, together with his wife, went to Punta, Santa Ana, Manila, in November 1913 and started preaching. He left the congregation {{in the care of}} his first ordained minister and returned to his native Taguig to evangelise; there, he was ridiculed and stoned at his meetings with locals. He was later able to baptize a few converts, including some of his persecutors. He later registered his new-found religion as the Iglesia ni Cristo (English: Church of Christ; Spanish: Iglesia de Cristo) on July 27, 1914, at the Bureau of Commerce as a corporation sole, with himself as the first executive minister. Expansion followed as INC started building congregations in the provinces in 1916, with Pasig (then in Rizal province) having two locals established. The first three ministers were ordained in 1919.|$|E
25|$|Gale's {{approach}} to military affairs emerged from both his personal history and personality. Gale, a 'tall, bluff, ruddy' individual, {{with a reputation}} as 'a bit of a buccaneer' but allegedly possessing a 'hectoring manner and a loud voice', {{was one of a}} number of First World War veterans to challenge the military status quo that had led to the terrible losses on the Western Front. Events such as the losses in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 heavily influenced Gale's thinking, and <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the war with a suspicion of predominantly firepower-led operations. Looking back, Gale was to remember the 'wonderful panorama' of the infantry successfully advancing using modern infiltration tactics on a clear day in the spring of 1918, contributing to his embracing the interwar manoeuvrist theorists during his time at the Staff College, Quetta in the early 1930s. Gale saw a narrative in the sequence of developments from the creation of the new infantry tactics of 1918, through to the tanks and airborne forces of the 1940s, that demonstrated the 'fundamental necessity of mobility on the battlefield', and the importance of surprise at all levels of warfare.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the bout, {{there was}} {{the belief that the}} fight was largely personal, with Royce looking to avenge his brother and Sakuraba looking to atone for his stablemate's defeats and vindicate {{professional}} wrestling and the UWFi once and for all. However, following the stoppage, Sakuraba embraced Royce in the ring, albeit having a brief and friendly verbal confrontation with Hélio Gracie, who was at ringside. Exhausted from his battle with Royce, Sakuraba surprised many when <b>he</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the locker room for the tournament semi-finals. His opponent, Igor Vovchanchyn, outweighed him by close to sixty pounds (Sakuraba had come into the bout with Royce lighter than usual, at 176 pounds) and was considered to be the top heavyweight striker of the day. Sakuraba surprised many by taking Vovchanchyn down and nearly finishing him with an armbar. Sakuraba was actually leading the fight past the 10-minute mark, but near the end Igor was able to reverse a takedown and draw the first round even with ground strikes. After the first round was declared a draw Sakuraba's corner threw in the towel before the beginning of overtime, primilary due to fatigue.|$|E
