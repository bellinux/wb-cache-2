40|$|In this paper, the {{complexities}} of government intervention design in the waste realm are addressed. More specifically, we compare two waste tax regimes (optimal and <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery),</b> allowing for the possible presence of criminal organizations in the waste cycle. Our main conclusions suggest that a <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> tax reacts less than an optimal tax to changes in enforcement, and that higher illegal disposal and larger entry incentives for the mafia may result under <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery.</b> Finally, we illustrate a case under which the <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> equilibrium is closer to first best when the mafia is present...|$|R

This side-channel attack exploits the fact that Libgcrypt used a sliding windows method for exponentiation which leads to the leakage of exponent bits and to <b>full</b> key <b>recovery.</b>|$|R

Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. Although she has made an almost <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British medical journal The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E

More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E

They were set to tour with Chimaira and All That Remains from January through March 2008, but due to singer Moody developing cysts on his vocal cords they were forced to pull out.

5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a <b>full</b> <b>recovery</b> is expected. Patients who present early to medical {{facilities}} and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Although Uganda's {{official}} {{policy is to}} promote tariffs that cover all costs, the NWSC tariff actually covers only operation and maintenance costs. According to a 2003 published report, the second performance contract between the government of Uganda and NWSC provided for a tariff policy {{that in the long}} term covered operation, maintenance, and a part of the future investments. Although the current tariff structure does recover operation and maintenance costs, the tariffs are not high enough to finance system expansion, leaving system improvement and extension investments to the national government and international donors. According to UN-Water, <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> tariffs including investments would require a significant rise of tariffs. William T. Muhairwe in 2006 asserted that <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> in least developed countries is a myth. According to him, tariffs would have to increase by 90 percent to provide <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery.</b>|$|R
40|$|Microfinance can be {{harnessed}} {{to serve}} both relief and development purposes in post-conflict environments, supporting survival, reconstruction and social reconciliation objectives {{in the immediate}} conflict aftermath, as well as longer-term economic re-building through microenterprise development. Independence from donor subsidies is widely viewed as a desirable goal in the microfinance industry, {{and a number of}} donors are building <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> objectives into their support for post-conflict microfinance programs. The appropriateness of the <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> paradigm in post-conflict environments is questionable, given the high operating costs faced by post-conflict micro finance agencies, weak demand for the most profitable microfinance services, and limitations on rapid improvements in local economic capacity, particularly in remote. areas. This paper reviews the issues raised by <b>full</b> cost <b>recovery</b> in post-conflict environments, with particular reference to a microfinance scheme in Bougainville, a province of Papua New Guinea currently in recovery from a prolonged period of armed conflict...|$|R
