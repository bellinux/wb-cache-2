40|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>poppy</b> (Papaver somniferum L.) is a {{traditional}} crop {{that had already been}} cultivated in Slovenia in the past for the production of seed and oil. During its re-introduction in present time, numerous agro-technical dilemmas have been raised for the processes from sowing to harvesting and have to be studied in our present growing conditions. On the fields of the Ograjšek farm in Cerklje ob Krki two field experiments in complete randomized design had been sown in 2013 and 2014 to establish the influence of the sowing date and fertilization on morphological properties and crop yield of <b>garden</b> <b>poppy</b> seed of the Austrian variety 'Zeno 2002 '. Results have shown that the average yield of seed in both trials (1643 kg/ha) is more than one time higher than the average crop yield recorded globally (700  kg/ha), proving how suitable growing conditions in the area of eastern Dolenjska are for the cultivation of poppy. Analysis of crop yield per plot showed there is no statistically significant interaction between the considered factors. The yield of poppy seed in the spring sowing term was 1742 ± 77 kg/ha and in the autumn sowing was 1545 ± 122 kg/ha. The difference is not statistically significant (p  =  0. 1845). Recorded yield per plant was higher for the autumn term but that was not transferred to the total crop yield due to poor overwintering and consequentially lower plant density at the time of harvest. Both sowing dates have confirmed that exposure to light and duration of growing period had an important impact on plants height – average height of plants sown in autumn was 139 ± 1 cm, which is more than 60 cm higher than the average height of the plants sown in spring (p = 0. 0000). A strong statistical dependence of the yield of seed per capsule on diameter of the capsule was proved (p = 0. 0000). It can be concluded that when the capsule diameter increases by 10  mm, the seed yield increases for 2. 1 g to 2. 3 g with 95 % confidence. Dependence of the average seed yield on the number of lateral shoots per plant also proved to be statistically significant (p  =  0. 0000). Linear model was used for the comparison of the four lines showed that the lines representing poppy sown in autumn and spring are statistically different for the control and for the ENTEC; the slope was higher for the poppy sown in autumn. These trials have given the first practical advice for production of <b>garden</b> <b>poppy</b> in Slovenia and should be continued for further useful results...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{described}} a soft rot of opium poppy, due to a bacterial pathogene. The disease attacks shoot and stem showing purplish brown or dark brown lesions which become rot in watery appearance. The causal organism is different from Bac. Papaveris, Bac. carotovorus and Bac. aroideae, those causing soft rot of poppy {{in the presence of}} mono-polar flagella and minor differences are noticed in cultural characters of agar and milk. The organism is pathogenic to Papaver somniferum, P. Rhoeas and P. orientale. As for as are known no bacteria are described identical with the organism is question, therefore Bacterium Papaveris is proposed for the organism with technical descriptions. 花卉として栽培せらるる罌粟科の植物中には細菌の寄生に因りて屡々腐敗を生ずることあり, 筆者は曩に Bacillus aroideae の寄生に因るヒナゲシ (Papver Rhoeas L.) の腐敗病を記載し, C.

50|$|The next day, the Warden and his spoiled, {{overweight}} son {{return from}} their vacation. Dan informs the Warden about the incidents during his absence, including the <b>poppy</b> <b>garden</b> which infuriates the Warden. Dan escorts the Warden to Ricky's cell. As the Warden questions him, Tarzan bursts {{through the wall}} and fights Ricky once again, which ends with Ricky brutally defeating Tarzan. The Warden then activates a ceiling trap to crush Ricky.

5000|$|Since [...] "opium poppy and poppy straw" [...] {{are listed}} in Schedule II of the United States' Controlled Substances Act, a DEA license may be {{required}} to grow poppies in ornamental or display gardens. In fact, the legal status of strictly ornamental <b>poppy</b> <b>gardens</b> is more nuanced, and destruction of ornamental poppy installations or prosecution of gardeners (except those caught extracting opium via capsule scarification or tea extraction) are virtually unheard of. During the summer, opium poppies can be seen flowering in gardens throughout North America and Europe, and displays are found in many private plantings, as well as in public botanical and museum gardens such as United States Botanical Garden, Missouri Botanical Garden, and North Carolina Botanical Garden.|$|R
60|$|And on the morrow the old man, who {{was indeed}} the subtlest of the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, 'In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold. One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red. To-day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes. Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee {{at the door of}} the garden. See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.' And he bound the eyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the <b>garden</b> of <b>poppies,</b> and up the five steps of brass. And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.|$|R
60|$|Again, {{the enemies}} of grey (those astute, daring and evil-minded men) are fond of {{bringing}} forward the argument that colours suffer in grey weather, and that strong sunlight is necessary to all the hues of heaven and earth. Here again there are two words to be said; and {{it is essential to}} distinguish. It is true that sun is needed to burnish and bring into bloom the tertiary and dubious colours; the colour of peat, pea-soup, Impressionist sketches, brown velvet coats, olives, grey and blue slates, the complexions of vegetarians, the tints of volcanic rock, chocolate, cocoa, mud, soot, slime, old boots; the delicate shades of these do need the sunlight to bring out the faint beauty that often clings to them. But if you have a healthy negro taste in colour, if you choke your <b>garden</b> with <b>poppies</b> and geraniums, if you paint your house sky-blue and scarlet, if you wear, let us say, a golden top-hat and a crimson frock-coat, you will not only be visible on the greyest day, but you will notice that your costume and environment produce a certain singular effect. You will find, I mean, that rich colours actually look more luminous on a grey day, because they are seen against a sombre background and seem to be burning with a lustre of their own. Against a dark sky all flowers look like fireworks. There is something strange about them, at once vivid and secret, like flowers traced in fire in the phantasmal garden of a witch. A bright blue sky is necessarily the high light of the picture; and its brightness kills all the bright blue flowers. But on a grey day the larkspur looks like fallen heaven; the red daisies are really the red lost eyes of day; and the sunflower is the vice-regent of the sun.|$|R
50|$|The series {{revolves}} around five small petals {{who live in}} a large, overgrown <b>garden.</b> Bougie, Boronia, <b>Poppy,</b> Notsy and Imp greet each day in wide-eyed wonder as their explorations among the giant flowers and trees uncover surprises and delights. However the Petals are just small little people that you can't see but you can imagine them. They're also not fairies and don't have magical powers, but they're very athletic and only Bougie and Poppy are able to fly. Here they discover many surprises, delights and adventures such as helping a baby bird, picking berries, helping Imp turn a dripping tap off, playing a game of hide and seek, making bubbles with some soap, Imp rescuing Notsy with fireflies when she got lost, using a broken mirror to frighten Jeffrey and putting on a show to cheer up Worm when he had a kink in his tail. Joining them in their adventures were five other characters who were all insects. They were Cicada, Ant, Spider, Worm and Ladybird. There's also an orange playful cat named Jeffrey who likes to hang around in the garden and cause trouble for the Petals.|$|R
