5|$|The {{specific}} devolved {{matters are}} all subjects {{which are not}} explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as reserved matters. All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Most importantly, this includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, economic development, education, environment, food standards, consumer advocacy, health, abortion, home affairs, Scots law, courts, legal profession, police and fire services, prisons, control of air guns, local government, sport and the arts, transport, road signs, speed limits, rail franchising, training, tourism, research and statistics, social work and various welfare and housing related benefits. In terms of tax powers, the Scottish Parliament has <b>full</b> <b>control</b> over income tax rates and thresholds on all non-savings and non-dividend income liable for tax by taxpayers resident in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament also has <b>full</b> <b>control</b> over Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and Scottish Landfill Tax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After {{resources}} {{are committed to}} a voluntary social arrangement, claim to theses resources is defined either by <b>full</b> private <b>control,</b> a property rights system that upholds private ownership at all points in time, or by <b>full</b> common <b>control,</b> a system that disallows unilateral private transfer of previously-owned resources out of the arrangement. When a social arrangement produces non-rivalrous benefits for its members and external benefits {{for the rest of}} society, <b>full</b> common <b>control</b> is Pareto preferred to <b>full</b> private <b>control</b> when Pigouvian intervention is unfeasible. Marriage contracts, religious congregations, and aboriginal land offer examples of the utility of this point in property law. In the absence of market failure, economic theory correlates efficient distribution of inputs with institutions that guarantee <b>full</b> private <b>control</b> (FPC) of resources. Consider the following example of childhood play. A group of children come together in the park to play a Saturday afternoon game of baseball. Every child contributes a unique item tha...|$|R

5|$|The {{warning was}} appropriate, {{for in the}} Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including <b>full</b> <b>control</b> in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts {{were two of the}} few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E
5|$|Ariel and Eric reunite on {{the surface}} before Ursula gains <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of the entire ocean, {{creating}} a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. In her attempt to murder Ariel, Ursula herself is impaled to death {{by one of the}} wrecked ships. With Ursula slain, Triton and the other polyps are restored to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton willingly changes her from a mermaid into a human and approves her marriage to Eric. Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.|$|E
5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to {{encircle}} Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining <b>full</b> <b>control</b> {{of the river and}} isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E

When the other Replicators take <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of the submarine, O'Neill orders the forces outside to destroy the submarine and prepares for the end, but Thor beams the team onto his ship before the explosion occurs. With the imminent Replicator threat over, Thor promises that when the Asgard defeat the Replicators, he will come to assist Earth {{in the war against}} the Goa'uld.|$|E
5|$|Campaigns for {{regional}} autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies {{for the three}} Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the parish and town council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government {{with the power to}} make laws and <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the Air Board again assumed <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, {{having been}} re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flight crew}} {{may have been}} {{confused}} about their true altitude, due to misinterpretation of the aircraft's drum-type altimeter after descending through 0 feet (relative to the airport altitude), or {{they may have had}} their hands <b>full</b> <b>controlling</b> the plane in severe weather and simply failed to notice the readings on the altimeter.|$|R

Although {{his intention to}} take <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of the club initially came to nothing. GIH completed the purchase in October 2009 at a total cost of £81.5M, re-registered the club as a private company, and renamed the holding company Birmingham International Holdings (BIH).|$|E
5|$|In early December, the US {{military}} personnel occupying the base, {{along with all}} military equipment, were shifted to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan via US military aircraft. On 10 December, Pakistani troops from the Frontier Corps took <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of the airfield as scheduled, and by 11 December all remaining American staff were evacuated. Upon establishing control of the airfield, the United States flag {{was removed from the}} base and replaced with the flag of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December, von Frank {{informed}} Potiorek that {{he considered}} it impossible for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much longer. As a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces {{in the city to}} withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary under the cover of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of the city {{by the end of the}} following day.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an end}} as soon as the Central Bank assumes <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Republican National Convention convened at the Wigwam, a {{temporary}} structure in St. Louis, on June 16. With most credentials battles settled in McKinley's favor, {{the roll of}} delegates drawn up by the RNC heavily favored the Ohioan, though Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay remained in the race. The credentials report served as a test vote, which the McKinley forces won easily. Hanna, who was a delegate from Ohio, was in <b>full</b> <b>control</b> of the convention.|$|E
5|$|The Army took <b>full</b> <b>control</b> {{over the}} OSRD's {{research}} and development contracts as they lapsed. Production contracts were terminated and transferred to the Army, mostly on March 31, 1943.

Bush and Conant continued to influence the Manhattan Project through participation in the MPC.|$|E
