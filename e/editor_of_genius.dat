The Artisan is he who merely applies the rules which others have detected. There has been no man of pure Genius; as there has been none wholly destitute <b>of</b> <b>Genius.</b>|$|R

40|$|In today’s global celebrity culture it’s hard {{to imagine}} a word more over-used and abused than ‘genius’. It is a {{slippery}} word with a long and contradictory conceptual history. Yet, in the Land of the Tall Poppy, self-confessions <b>of</b> <b>genius</b> invariably have paved a broad road to public ridicule and denigration. Xavier Herbert’s notion <b>of</b> <b>genius</b> was not static. It changed throughout his life and it evolved through his writing. He agreed with Carlyle that the first condition <b>of</b> <b>genius</b> must always be a ‘transcendent capacity of taking trouble’ and on this foundation he built his own concept <b>of</b> <b>genius,</b> as the unending ‘capacity for loving’.
