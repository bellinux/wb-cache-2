In some cases, severe life-threatening reactions have been reported. Here we describe the case of a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia, who developed severe exceptional skin toxicity in terms of auricular oedema and palmar <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema</b> after the application of low-dose cytarabine.

40|$|A 16 {{years old}} female patient, {{affected}} by atopic dermatitis and rhinoconjunctivitis allergica since childhood, requested a dermatologic consultation for lesions which had appeared after 3 months of local treatment with clobethasole propionate. The histological analysis confirmed {{the diagnosis of}} <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema</b> and the microbiological smears demonstrated a significant infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The risk of developing corticosteroids’ side-effects depends on the potency of the product, extended period of use and the volume of product applied. Clobetasol propionate is a group I- highly potent corticosteroid, which {{should be used for}} a maximum period of 2 weeks. Several authors have found that this agent has cumulative depot effect, persisting in the epidermis for 4 days after only one application. Taking together these observations, sustained by the clinical case presented above, we can conclude that the infectious risks associated with topical corticosteroid treatment must not be neglected, particularly since treated patients are fragile, and frequently have multiple well-known risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Two {{dermatologic}} patients displaying peripheral {{and central}} nerve damage, respectively, are described. Cutaneous nerve fibers in both patients were studied in skin biopsy specimens taken from neuropathic areas {{and from the}} contralateral side, immunocytochemistry being applied to a pan-neuronal marker, a protein gene-product (PGP 9. 5). One of the patients, suffering from compression of the ulnar nerve, had <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema</b> of the hands that was absent on areas of skin that were neuropathic. The cutaneous innervation (most of which was sensory) was reduced by 50 % in the neuropathic area {{as compared with the}} contralateral side. The other patient had unilateral pruritus on the parethic side after a stroke. The cutaneous innervation of that side was reduced by 80 % as compared with the other side.

40|$|Scoring {{systems have}} been {{developed}} to interpret the disease severity objectively by evaluating the parameters of the disease. Body surface area, visual analogue scale, and physician global assessment are the most frequently used scoring systems for evaluating the clinical severity of the dermatological diseases. Apart from these scoring systems, many specific scoring systems for many dermatological diseases, including acne (acne vulgaris, acne scars), alopecia (androgenetic alopecia, tractional alopecia), bullous diseases (autoimmune bullous diseases, toxic epidermal necrolysis), dermatitis (atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema),</b> hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutismus, connective tissue diseases (dermatomyositis, skin involvement of systemic lupus erythematosus (LE), discoid LE, scleroderma), lichen planoplaris, mastocytosis, melanocytic lesions, melasma, onychomycosis, oral lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic arthritis, nail psoriasis), sarcoidosis, urticaria, and vitiligo, have also been developed. Disease severity scoring methods are ever more extensively used in the field of dermatology for clinical practice to form an opinion about the prognosis by determining the disease severity; to decide on the most suitable treatment modality for the patient; to evaluate the efficacy of the applied medication; and to compare the efficiency of different treatment methods in clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) {{infection}} of the hand resulting in lymphatic complications such as lymphangitis and lymphedema is exceedingly uncommon. Although these complications typically resolve in 21 days, they can be persistent and may not resolve even with antiviral use, thereby mimicking <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema</b> or a bacterial event and often being misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated as such. We report a case of frequently recurring HSV {{infection of}} the hand {{over a long period}} of time resulting in refractory lymphedema which did not resolve with antiviral treatment. We further endeavor to raise awareness about this highly unusual presentation of HSV infection. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted for similar cases using PubMed and Medline. Case Report: This is the first reported case with nearly a decade-long interval between the onset of primary HSV infection and the development of chronic lymphedema. Although valacyclovir significantly reduced the episodic aggravation of the lymphedema, it did not entirely resolve it. Similar cases of persistent lymphedema also included a long history of untreated and recurrent HSV {{infection of the}} hand, suggesting that this lymphatic outcome may be circumvented by prompt treatment with antivirals. Conclusion: This case report not only presents a highly uncommon lymphatic manifestation and unusual timeline of exacerbation of the very common HSV infection, but also highlights the importance and benefits of early initiation of antiviral therapy and the prevention of reactivation. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Keratolysis exfoliativa (KE), {{also known}} as {{dyshidrosis}} lamellosa sicca, is a palmoplantar dermatosis characterized by air-filled blisters and collarette desquamation. It has been regarded as a subtype of <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema,</b> a fungal infection or a dermatophytid reaction. KE may also resemble acral peeling skin syndrome and localized epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Although KE is a common disorder, it is a rarely reported and is an under-recognized dermatosis. Objectives To delineate the characteristic features of KE. Methods We investigated the clinical, immunohistopathological, ultrastructural and molecular features of KE. Patients were included from the clinical records. Additional diagnostic research consisted of mutation analysis of the candidate genes TGM 5, KRT 5, KRT 14, FLG, SPINK 6 and SPINK 9. Results A total of 24 patients with KE were identified, six with familial and 18 with sporadic KE. Lesions consisted of air-filled blisters only on palmoplantar skin, followed by collarette and lamellar peeling. Both light microscopy and electron microscopy showed cleavage and partially degraded corneodesmosomes within the stratum corneum, whereas immunofluorescence microscopy showed normal expression of corneodesmosomal components. No mutations were found in TGM 5, KRT 5 / 14 and SPINK 6 / 9. There was no clear link with atopy or with FLG mutations. Conclusions Our study suggests premature corneodesmolysis as the main pathological mechanism of this palmoplantar skin disorder. We conclude that KE {{appears to be a}} distinct peeling entity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of skin diseases among soldiers who were assigned duties in Kahramanmaras, a province of east Mediterranean region of Turkey. One hundred eighty-eight soldiers were assessed for skin diseases by a complete dermatological examination and the findings were recorded to a form. Apart from the low number of older ones, the soldiers were of 20 – 22 years. The diagnosis of superficial fungal infections {{was made by the}} use of potassium hydroxide preparations in addition to clinical appearance. On completion of the study period, the data were evaluated, and patients were grouped. Pitted keratolysis was the primary dermatologic disease in 34. 5 % of the soldiers, 29. 2 % were diagnosed with oral candidiasis, and 25. 5 % suffered from tinea pedis. Among the soldiers suffering from a cutaneous disease, <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema</b> (18. 6 %), intertrigo (excluding candidal intertrigo) (17 %), acne (17 %), seborrheic dermatitis (14. 9 %), plantar hyperkeratosis (14. 3 %), contact dermatitis (13. 8 %), and folliculitis (12. 2 %) were the other most frequent dermatoses. Other less frequent dermatoses were asteatotic eczema, callus, onychomycosis, traumatic onychodystrophy, and so on. We conclude that the prevalence of skin diseases in soldiers is very high {{and is one of the}} major public health problems that have a significant burden on our nation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is unclear}} whether the {{respiratory}} tract is involved in eliciting or aggravating eczematous lesions in patients with vesicular hand eczema. Objectives. To investigate the effect of inhalation of house dust mite (HDM) on vesicular hand eczema. METHODS: Eighteen patients with vesicular hand eczema and HDM allergy received inhalation challenges with four concentrations of HDM in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Early asthmatic reactions and late asthmatic reactions were defined as a placebo-corrected fall of 15 % or more from baseline of forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Hand eczema was scored according to the <b>Dyshidrotic</b> <b>Eczema</b> Area and Severity Index (DASI) at baseline, and 1, 6, 24 and 48 hr. RESULTS: The median DASI increased significantly as compared with baseline at 6 and 48 hr after HDM inhalation. This increase was significantly different between the provocations at 6 hr. The median vesicles score increased significantly from baseline at 24 and 48 hr. Patients with a placebo-corrected {{increase in the number}} of vesicles at 24 hr and 48 hr had significantly more often late asthmatic reactions than those without an {{increase in the number of}} vesicles. Patients with a placebo-corrected increase of the DASI score at 24 hours had as a group a higher mean total IgE level than those without an increase of the DASI score. CONCLUSION: Hand eczema increased significantly more after HDM provocation than after placebo provocation. An increase in the number of vesicles was preceded by late asthmatic reactions. The group patients with an increase of hand eczema tended to have a higher mean total IgE level...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous {{immunoglobulin}} (IVIg) {{therapy is}} increasingly {{used to treat}} a variety of immune mediated disorders [1], including several neurological conditions [2]. It is relatively safe and often effective for patients unresponsive to other therapies. Adverse reactions are usually minor and are said to affect no more than 10 % of patients [3]. Various skin reactions (urticaria, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, baboon syndrome, erythema multiforme, petechiae, alopecia, fl ushing, palmar pruritus, hyperhidrosis, eczematous dermatitis, and <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema</b> or pompholyx) have been described [4 - 8]. A 40 -year-old woman diagnosed with autoimmune cerebellar disease was treated with a 5 -day course of IVIg therapy (Flebogamma 5 %, Instituto Grifols SA, Parets del Vallès, Spain) at the standard dose of 0. 4 g/kg/d. On {{the last day of}} the fi rst cycle of 5 days, an acute reaction involving pruritic erythematous papules and vesicles appeared on her palms. No other drugs were taken before or during treatment. The lesions persisted for more than 2 weeks. Before the next cycle 6 months later, a course of antihistamines (dexchlorpheniramine) was added to the treatment in order to prevent the lesions, but a similar reaction occurred, this time also affecting the right side of the face and with mild general symptoms (malaise and febrile sensation). Topical steroids were prescribed and the lesions subsided again after 2 weeks. The patient was then referred for further evaluation.

40|$|Hypertrichosis cubiti, {{also known}} as hairy elbows syndrome, is an {{uncommon}} form of localized congenital hypertrichosis in which an excessive amount of long, fine, lanugo-type hair is found on skin of normal texture and morphology. The hair growth follows a bilateral symmetrical distribution and affects the extensor surface of the distal third of the upper arms and the proximal region of the forearms. The condition usually appears appeared on her foot. The patient tried her right shoe on her left foot, {{and after a few}} hours lesions appeared on the foot along with distant lesions on her chest. Patch testing was performed with a standard series and a shoe series, the latter proving positive for 4 -aminoazobenzene; however, there was no cross-reactivity with paraphenylenediamine (Figure 3). The rubber and dyed leather of the shoe were also patch tested and the reaction was positive. The definitive diagnosis was contact dermatitis caused by shoe dye. Since she stopped using the shoes, the patient has not presented further lesions. Therefore, we describe a case of unilateral contact dermatitis caused by footwear. This atypical presentation delayed diagnosis and led us to consider different options, such as factitious dermatitis. Footwear contact dermatitis typically presents bilaterally and commonly affects the dorsa of the feet. Diagnosis is made difficult by the existence of atopic dermatitis and pre-existing or overlapping infection. Moreover, other conditions that can be misdiagnosed, such as nummular eczema, tinea pedis, <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema,</b> contact dermatitis caused by topical medication, etc. 1, 2 4 -Aminoazobenzene is an intermediate in the production of diazo dyes used in the textile and footwear industry.

40|$|UVA 1 {{therapy is}} a {{relatively}} new form of light therapy for atopic dermatitis. We describe that after 4 weeks of UVA- 1 patients were better capable to maintain clinical improvement than after 3 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, UVA 1 therapy proved to be better than placebo therapy in patients with <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema.</b> Also, we described the favorable effect of UVA 1 therapy in chronic, generalized lichen ruber planus. Because of deep penetration of UVA 1, it could not only influence dermal inflammatory infiltrates in T-cell mediated diseases mentioned above, but also reach circulating activated B-cells in dermal capillaries in SLE. We investigated the effect of 6 and 12 J/cm 2 UVA 1 in SLE patients, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross over study. Three weeks of 12 J/cm 2 resulted in improved disease activity and proved to be more effective than placebo. Furthermore, a decrease of auto-antibody titers was observed in several patients. In vitro we showed that 40 % of UVA 1 reached the dermis and increasing numbers of PBMCs died after rising doses of UVA- 1. Also, immunoglobulin production by activated B cells decreased after increasing doses of UVA 1. It would be interesting to investigate UVA 1 therapy for other auto immune diseases. Promotor: R.

40|$|Background: Dyshidrotic hand eczema is a {{relatively}} common vesicobullous disorder of the palms and soles. It {{is also known as}} pompholyx, dyshidrotic hand dermatitis, and palmoplantar eczema. It is characterized by pruritic lesions that can erupt in a chronic or relapsing pattern with episodes lasting months to years. The condition can be difficult to treat because of the thickness of the affected skin and the numerous sweat glands. Current treatments are not always effective and pose their own risks. Studies have shown associations between hyperhidrosis and dyshidrotic hand eczema. Botulinum toxin A (BTXA) has been used to treat hyperhidrosis with success. This leads to the possibility that BTXA may be an effective treatment option for refractory cases of dyshidrotic hand eczema. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, EBMR Multifile, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The keywords <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema,</b> eczema, pompholyx, and botulinum toxins were used in the search. The relevant articles were evaluated for quality using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Results: Two prospective control studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. The first study investigated whether BTXA injections used with topical corticosteroids could treat dyshidrotic hand eczema better than topical therapy alone. Eight adult patients were enrolled with dyshidrotic hand eczema. Itching and vesiculation were inhibited earlier when using both BTXA and corticosteroids compared to corticosteroids alone. The second study evaluated the effects of BTXA injections as a treatment for dyshidrotic hand eczema with the other hand as an untreated control. Ten patients with bilateral hand eczema enrolled in the study. There were significant reductions in patient important outcomes and disease processes in the BTXA treatment hand compared to the control. Conclusion: BTXA can be a reasonable treatment option for patients with refractory dyshidrotic hand eczema. This treatment may be even more valuable in patients with hyperhidrosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: It was {{reported}} in two studies that inhalation challenges with HDM aggravated skin lesions in patients with atopic dermatitis, especially in those with concomitant allergic asthma. The effect of HDM inhalation on aggravating skin responses in patients with hand eczema had never been investigated. Method: Of 18 patients with vesicular hand eczema and HDM allergy (positive SPT to D. pteronyssinus) were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled, cross-over study. Increasing concentrations of standardised HDM (80, 400, 2000, 10 000 BU/ml) were inhaled for 1 min at intervals of 15 min. The FEV 1 was measured immediately before and after each dose, after the last challenge every 10 min for 1 h, and thereafter every hour for 7 h. The placebo challenge procedure {{was the same as}} described for the active suspension. The time interval between HDM and placebo was 2 - 4 weeks. Early asthmatic reactions and late asthmatic reactions (LAR) were defined as a placebocorrected fall of 15 % or more from baseline of FEV 1. Hand eczema was scored according to the <b>Dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema</b> Area and Severity Index (DASI) at baseline, 1, 6, 24 and 48 h. Total IgE was measured {{at the start of the}} first provocation day and serum eosinophils on both provocation days before the first challenge and 24 h later. Results: Significant increases in median DASI score and median DASI sub-scores were seen only after HDM provocation. After placebo provocation, no significant differences from baseline were seen. The median DASI increased significantly as compared with baseline at 6 and 48 h after HDM inhalation. This increase was significantly different between the provocations at 6 h. The median vesicles score increased significantly from baseline at 24 and 48 h. Patients with a placebo-corrected increase of vesicles at 24 and 48 h had significantly more often a LAR than those without an increase of vesicles. Patients with a placebo- corrected increase of the DASI at 24 h had as a group a higher mean total IgE level than those without an increase of the DASI. The increase in serum eosinophils 24 h after HDM provocation was not significantly different between the placebocorrected skin responders and non-skin responders. Conclusion: Hand eczema increased significantly more after HDM provocation than after placebo provocation. An increase of vesicles was preceded by a LAR.

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{develop a}} self-administered short {{questionnaire}} to assess patient satisfaction with medical treatment for hand eczema (dermatitis) with good psychometric properties. Method The {{content of the}} questionnaire was determined {{on the basis of}} clinical consultation with groups of patients, from studying the existing instruments, and from discussions with a panel of seven experts. A first draft version containing 38 items organised in six dimensions was tested on a pilot sample of patients to assess its legibility. The extended version was then tested on a sample of 217 patients of both genders enrolled at 18 hospitals representative of the national distribution. The questionnaire was supplied together with the Morisky-Green compliance questionnaire, the health-related quality of life (HRQL) SF- 12 questionnaire, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) of perceived health status to assess concurrent validity. The dimensionality was reduced by means of exploratory factor analysis, and reliability was evaluated on the basis of internal consistency and two halves reliability estimates. Item discriminant capability and questionnaire discriminant validity with respect to known groups of patients (by gender, principal diagnosis, age, disease severity and treatment) were also assessed. Results The reduction and validation sample was composed of 54 % women and 46 % men, of various educational levels with an average age of 43 years (SD = 13. 7). Of those who responded, 26 % were diagnosed with hyperkeratotic dermatitis of the palms and 27 % of the fingertips, and 47 % with recurring palmar <b>dyshidrotic</b> <b>eczema.</b> The questionnaire was shortened to a version containing 17 items grouped in six dimensions: effectiveness, convenience, impact on HRQL, medical follow-up, side effects, and general opinion. Cronbach's alpha coefficient reached a value of 0. 9. The dimensions showed different degrees of correlation, and the scores had a normal distribution with an average of 58. 4 points (SD = 18. 01). Treatment satisfaction scores attained correlations between 0. 003 and 0. 222 with the HRQL measures, and showed higher correlations with the effectiveness (r = 0. 41) and tolerability (0. 22) measures, but very low correlation with compliance (r = 0. 015). Significant differences were observed between some diagnoses and treatments. Conclusions The shortened questionnaire proved to have good psychometric properties, providing excellent reliability, satisfactorily reproducing the proposed structure and supplying evidence of validity. </p...|$|E
