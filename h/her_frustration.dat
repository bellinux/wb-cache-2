25|$|Лоза (The Vine, 1923) {{contained}} 23 poems, which trace Parnok's {{life from}} her physical {{birth to her}} spiritual rebirth in Sudak.

Her poetry is very personal, influenced by her own family condition and forced isolation; she wrote on impulse in order to vent <b>her</b> <b>frustration,</b> without any literary adornment or formal elegance.|$|E

25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to take <b>her</b> <b>frustration</b> out on {{inanimate objects}} in their yard and worked to {{verbally}} deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language {{she began to}} gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E
25|$|Sherine first {{proposed}} {{the campaign in}} June 2008 in a guardian.co.uk Comment is Free blog post, Atheists – gimme five in the Guardian. She expressed <b>her</b> <b>frustration</b> that the Christian organisation JesusSaid.org was allowed to use bus advertising to promote the web address of a website that said that all non-Christians would burn in hell for all eternity. Sherine called on atheists to counter this kind of evangelical advertising by donating five pounds towards a positive philosophical advert. Her idea was taken up by political blogger Jon Worth, {{who went on to}} set up a PledgeBank page. The PledgeBank page closed on 31 July 2008, having received 877 of the 4,679 pledges necessary for the original target of £23,400. This event attracted some limited comment in the mainstream media early in August. Sherine then wrote a follow-up Comment is free article, Dawkin 'bout a Revolution, detailing events since the original piece. In response, the British Humanist Association offered to lend the campaign its official support and undertook to administer all donations. Sherine then asked Richard Dawkins for a quote for the campaign, at which point he offered to match the first £5,500 raised.|$|E
25|$|She {{picked up}} her first victory on the edition of September 17 of Impact! by {{defeating}} Cody Deaner in an intergender Lumberjack match. The win, though, was largely due to interference {{from all the other}} Knockouts who were lumberjacks. Frustrated at her lack of meaningful victories, Flash interrupted an interview with newcomer Hamada by voicing <b>her</b> <b>frustration</b> at the lack of fanfare her arrival in the company received in comparison to foreign Knockouts Sarita and Hamada.

The two met weeks later on October 8 Impact! in an eight-woman elimination tag team match; when both were legal members in the ring they brawled out onto the floor until they were counted out and eliminated. The following week on Super Impact! the two met in a Falls Count Anywhere match which Flash lost after taking a moonsault from Hamada through a table. She finally scored an unassisted singles win on November 12 against Traci Brooks. After not being used by the company thereafter, Anderson requested her release which was granted on January 21, 2010.
