40|$|An {{extensive}} {{program to}} improve {{the operation of the}} Ames 16 Inch Shock Tunnel was carried out. This included reduction of driver slosh wave amplitudes and detonation risk by the use of premixed He/O 2 gas, longer wait times between the last gas load and driver gas ignition, an improved gas loading sequence, the use of four instead of one <b>ignition</b> <b>wire,</b> and the use of lower <b>ignition</b> <b>wire</b> voltages. Successful operation of the tunnel at pressures of 2000 - 6000 psi and enthalpies up to 12, 000 J/gm was achieved. A new diaphragm breaking technique, self break on the driver combustion pressure rise, was tested and found to produce clean breaks over the full pressure range of the tunnel. Improvements were made to the driver gas loading manifold and a preliminary design was made of a gas mixing system which mixes all three gases on the fly just before injection into the driver. Other improvements as well as tests are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} energy in the spark {{required}} to ignite the air-fuel mixture varies depending on the pressure and composition of the mixture, and on the speed of the engine. Under laboratory conditions as little as 1 millijoule is required in each spark, but practical coils must deliver much more energy than this to allow for higher pressure, rich or lean mixtures, losses in <b>ignition</b> <b>wiring,</b> and plug fouling and leakage. When gas velocity is high in the spark gap, the arc between the terminals is blown away from the terminals, making the arc longer and requiring more energy in each spark. Between 30 and 70 milli-joules are delivered in each spark.|$|R

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described here}} {{show that the}} cracking at sharp bends, observed in the insulation of internal combustion engine high tension <b>ignition</b> <b>wires</b> after service, {{is due to a}} chemical attack upon the rubber by the ozone produced by the electric discharge that takes place at the surface of the cable. This cracking does not occur if the insulating material is not under tension, or if the cable is surrounded by some medium other than air. But it does occur even if the insulation is not subjected to electric stress, provided that the atmosphere near the cable contains ozone. The extent of this cracking varies greatly with the insulating material used. The cracking can be materially reduced by using braided cable and by avoiding sharp bends...|$|E

5000|$|The {{accessory}} end had a one- or two-speed engine-driven supercharger {{that might}} have a second stage with or without an intercooler, the ignition magnetos and the customary assortment of oil and fuel pumps, all dictated by the application requirements. The front of the engine could have {{one of a number}} of different output drives. The drive might be a [...] "long-nose" [...] or close coupled propeller reduction gear, an extension drive to a remote gearbox, or a gearbox that could drive two wing-mounted propellers from a fuselage-mounted engine. Another key feature of the V-1710 design was its ability to turn the output shaft clockwise or counter-clockwise by assembling the engine with the crankshaft turned end-for-end, by installing an idler gear in the drive train to the supercharger, camshafts, and accessories, installing a starter turning the proper direction, and re-arranging the <b>ignition</b> <b>wiring</b> on the right side to accommodate a changed firing order. No change to the oil pump nor coolant pump circuits was needed. [...] The ability to reverse the direction of rotation with a minimum of extra parts to achieve the task allowed the use of either a [...] "tractor" [...] or [...] "pusher" [...] propeller. This approach allowed easy changes of the supercharger(s) and supercharger drive-gear ratio.

50|$|The {{origins of}} Autolite {{can be traced}} to 1911, when Electric Autolite was founded. The company {{produced}} a generator to power early day auto lamps or buggy lamps. In 1927, Electric Autolite acquired the Prest-O-Lite Battery Company from The Union Carbide Corporation which produced automotive batteries. In 1935, Royce G. Martin, President of the Electric Autolite Company, decided that the company should enter the business of manufacturing spark plugs. Robert Twells, a ceramic engineer, led the development team. A few months later, the company was selling their first spark plug. Electric Autolite's products were expanded further to include: Starting Motors, Generators, Regulators, <b>Ignition</b> Systems, <b>Wire</b> and Cable Products. Autolite enjoyed instant success, as it had secured supply contracts with leading car manufacturers such as Chrysler, Studebaker, Packard, and Willys.|$|R

A 36,000-volt ignition coil, usually located at the front right of the engine, provided electrical power to the center of the distributor cap, where a spinning rotor directed the power to each of the individual cylinders' spark plug <b>wires.</b> <b>Ignition</b> dwell, advance and retardation were electronically controlled by the SBEC.|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} for initiation and propagation {{of the reaction}} forming the intermetallic compounds Ti_ 5 Si_ 3 and NiSi from mixtures of elemental powders of varying porosity have been investigated using shock waves of different pressure and at atmospheric pressure using hot <b>wire</b> <b>ignition</b> in air and in an argon atmosphere. In each case, the reaction either went to completion or the powder remained essentially unreacted. The {{conditions for}} the initiation of the reaction in Ti/Si {{are sensitive to the}} presence of air. Two regimes of porosity and shock pressure are found for the Ti/Si mixture which cause complete reaction. A low-energy regime with a high initial porosity (producing a low shock pressure) with 0. 1 torr of residual air triggers the reaction, while no reaction is observed with a 128 pct higher shock energy and a lower initial porosity (producing a higher shock pressure) when the residual air is replaced with argon. Hot <b>wire</b> <b>ignition</b> of porous Ti/Si powder at room temperature initiates a self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction more easily in air than in an argon atmosphere, while the Ni/Si powder must be heated to allow the SHS reaction to propagate in high- or low-porosity mixtures in air. These observations are compared to published work on self-sustaining reactions in multilayer films. Reasons for the difference in behavior of the two powder mixtures are discussed...|$|R

On {{adjusting}} a platina wire at x (1081.) so that {{it should}} not be ignited by the current passing through it whilst contact at G and E was continued, and yet become red-hot by a current somewhat more powerful, I was readily able to produce its ignition upon making contact, and again upon breaking contact. Thus the momentary retardation in ABD on making contact was again shown by this result, as well also as the opposite result upon breaking contact. The two <b>ignitions</b> of the <b>wire</b> at x were of course produced by electric currents moving in opposite directions.|$|R
40|$|A {{family of}} new, low toxicity, high energy monopropellants is {{currently}} being evaluated at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center for in-space rocket engine applications such as reaction control engines. These ionic liquid monopropellants, developed {{in recent years by}} the Air Force Research Laboratory, could offer system simplification, less in-flight thermal management, and reduced handling precautions, while increasing propellant energy density as compared to traditional storable in-space propellants such as hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. However, challenges exist in identifying ignition schemes for these ionic liquid monopropellants, which are known to burn at much hotter combustion temperatures compared to traditional monopropellants such as hydrazine. The high temperature combustion of these new monopropellants make the use of typical ignition catalyst beds prohibitive since the catalyst cannot withstand the elevated temperatures. Current research efforts are focused on monopropellant ignition and burn rate characterization, parameters that are important in the fundamental understanding of the monopropellant behavior and the eventual design of a thruster. Laboratory studies will be conducted using alternative ignition techniques such as laser-induced spark <b>ignition</b> and hot <b>wire</b> <b>ignition.</b> Ignition delay, defined as the time between the introduction of the ignition source and the first sign of light emission from a developing flame kernel, will be measured using Schlieren visualization. An optically-accessible liquid monopropellant burner will be used to determine propellant burn rate as a function of pressure and initial propellant temperature. The burn rate will be measured via high speed imaging through the chamber s windows...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ignition</b> of {{electrical}} <b>wires</b> by external heating is investigated {{in order to}} gain a better understanding of the initiation {{of electrical}}-wire fires. An ignition-to- spread model is developed to systematically explain ignition and the following transition to spread. The model predicts that for a higher-conductance wire it is more difficult to achieve ignition and the weak flame may extinguish during the transition phase because of a large conductive heat loss along the wire core. Wires with two metal-core materials, nichrome and copper having three different diameters, with polyethylene coatings of three different thicknesses are employed and a coil heater was adopted as the ignition source in the experimental study. Experiments show that additional heating times after flash are required in order to fully pass the transition and achieve a spreading flame, agreeing with model predictions. In addition, the effects of different heating lengths, ambient pressures and oxygen concentrations on <b>wire</b> <b>ignition</b> are discussed. Steady flame spread horizontally along thin electrical wires in normal and oxygen-enriched oxygen/nitrogen atmospheres is also investigated both theoretically and experimentally {{to gain a better understanding}} of the development of in electrical fires occurring in normal and modified environments. A simplified flame-spread model is developed in an effort to identify the most important effects of the wire thermal conductivity and diameter, the thickness of the insulation, and the oxygen concentration. The experimental results agree qualitatively with the model predictions in a number of respects, while no qualitative disagreements were found. This study may be useful for upgrading the design and standards of future fire-safe wire...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{industrial}} sectors that {{are affected by}} dust explosions, the metal working industry {{is one of the}} most frequently involved. Metal dusts are often the by-products of mechanical workings. Dust producing machines are widely distributed, small in size and are generally located in workplaces. Abatement plants are also often located in the working area. The companies that are involved in these explosions are often small, and thus often have limited resources. These factors generally lead to difficulties in managing the risk of explosions. This paper has the aim of investigating the flammability of waste dust produced by metal workings, and to define the dust properties that are more likely to lead to an explosion. For this purpose, a simple and fast flammability test has been used as a cheap way of characterise the flammability of the samples. The test has been called the Speedy Esplosibility Test (SET), and it is similar to the procedure suggested in the new ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 2016) that came into force recently. SET is composed of 4 different tests, derived from standard procedures, each of which represents a different ignition mechanism: • High voltage continuous arc <b>ignition</b> and glowing <b>wire</b> <b>ignition</b> in a Hartman 1. 2 l tube (based on UNI EN 13821 : 2004); • Dust cloud ignition in a G-G furnace and dust layer ignition on a hot plate (based on UNI EN 50281 : 1999). The SET results are compared with the standard flammability classification obtained according to ISO, 2016 ISO/IEC 80079 : 2016, with the standard KSt measurement in the 20 -L Siwek Sphere, and with tests in the 20 -L sphere with 2 × 1 kJ igniters, respectively according to the UNI EN 14034 : 2011 part 2 and part 3. Moreover, the morphology and chemical nature of the dusts have also been determined and their effects on dust explosibility are discussed...|$|R
