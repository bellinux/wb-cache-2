40|$|AbstractKearns-Sayre {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} commonly diagnosed mitochondrial cytopathy and produces severe neuromuscular symptoms. The most frequent cause is a mitochondrial DNA deletion that removes a 4977 -base pair segment of DNA that includes several genes encoding for respiratory chain subunits. Treatment of AIDS patients with nucleoside analogs {{has been reported to}} cause mtDNA depletion and myopathies. Here, we report that azidothymidine, dideoxyguanosine, and <b>dideoxycytidine</b> cause a depletion of wild-type mtDNA while increasing the levels of deleted mitochondria DNA in Kearns-Sayre syndrome fibroblasts. The result of these effects is a large increase in the relative amounts of ΔmtDNA in comparison to wild type mtDNA. We found that Kearns-Sayre syndrome fibroblasts are a mixed population of cells with deleted mtDNA comprising from 0 to over 20 % of the total mtDNA in individual cells. Treatment of cloned cell lines with <b>dideoxycytidine</b> did not result in increased levels of ΔmtDNA. The results suggest that nucleoside analogs may act to increase the average ΔmtDNA levels in a mixed population of cells by preferentially inhibiting the proliferation of cells with little or no ΔmtDNA. This raises the possibility that modulation of deleted mtDNA levels may occur by similar mechanisms in vivo, in response to the influence of exogenous agents...|$|E

After prolonged cultivation of fibroblasts {{in the presence of}} carbovir, resistant cells with a very high level of telomerase activity were obtained. Azidothymidine and carbovir, but not <b>dideoxycytidine,</b> induced senescence-like processes in cultures of immortal mouse fibroblasts. After long-term incubation, cell proliferation gradually decreased, their morphology becoming similar to that of the senescent ones.

40|$|An ectopic {{reentrance}} {{into the}} cell cycle with ensuing DNA replication is required for neuronal apoptosis induced by beta-amyloid. Here, we investigate the repertoire of DNA polymerases expressed in beta-amyloid-treated neurons, and their specific role in DNA synthesis and apoptosis. We show that exposure of cultured cortical neurons to beta-amyloid induces the expression of DNA polymerase-beta, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and the p 49 and p 58 subunits of DNA primase. Induction requires the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. The knockdown of the p 49 primase subunit prevents beta-amyloid-induced neuronal DNA synthesis and apoptosis. Similar effects are observed by knocking down DNA polymerase-beta or by using <b>dideoxycytidine,</b> a preferential inhibitor of this enzyme. Thus, the reparative enzyme DNA polymerase-beta unexpectedly mediates a large component of de novo DNA synthesis and apoptotic death in neurons exposed to beta-amyloid.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{controlled}} clinical trial of zidovudine (AZT) was terminated {{in the fall of}} 1986, much has been learned concerning the use of this agent in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The recent report of HIV resistance associated with long-term AZT therapy has accelerated the sense of urgency about the development of additional agents for use- either alone or in combination with AZT- against this in-fection. Several new agents are in various stages of preclinical or clinical evaluation. Some, such as <b>dideoxycytidine,</b> dideoxyinosine, dideoxydidehydrothymidine, azidouridine, and foscarnet, inhibit viral DNA synthesis through inhibition of reverse transcriptase. Other potentially useful agents presumably act at different stages of infection. Soluble CD 4, for example, is a soluble form of the receptor to which HIV must bind to infect cells, and castanospermine represents a new classof compounds that block the maturation process of the viral glycoprotein. An apparently more potent and less toxic analogue of the latter agent, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, is currently in phase I testing.

40|$|Since 1987 major {{advances}} {{have been made}} in our understanding of the patho-genesis of infection and the possible inhibition of the HIV virus. Various drugs targeted to the different steps of viral replication have been selected, but drugs such as soluble CD 4 or dextran derivatives aimed to inhibit or interfere with the GP, 2 () -CD 4 attachment step have shown little or no clinical benefit. Protease inhibitors or interferons acting at the post-transcriptional level are currently under phase I to II investigation. The only group of compounds clinically active belong to the nucleosides analogues that act as DNA chain terminators and by inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase.

40|$|When {{zidovudine}} and <b>dideoxycytidine</b> (ddC) {{were given}} on schedules of I week on drug and I week off, results differed substantially in effects on HIV (human immunodeficiency virus type I) -induced immune activation. Zidovudine (200 mg every 4 h) caused marked lowering toward normal of serum neopterin and p 2 -microglobulin within I week. This effect was lost within I weekoff zidovudine. Intermittent ddC (0. 03 mg/kg every 4 h) had a smaller I-week effect {{but had a}} delayed cumulative suppressive effect on HIV-associated immune activation that was not seen with intermittent zidovudine therapy. Zidovudine and ddC given in alternating weeks had syner-gistic effects in the first 10 weeks (e. g., early and rapid reduction followed by cumulatively greater effects on immune cell activation). The identical sawtooth effect of intermittent zidovudine was also evident in serum HIV p 24 antigen levels. This {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that the increased serum levels of the immune activation markers seen in HIV infection reflect stimula-tory effects of HIV viral components on immune system cells.

For comparison, we also tested rats with painful peripheral neuropathy caused by nerve trauma and to the anti-human immunodeficiency virus nucleoside analog 2 ′, 3 ′ <b>dideoxycytidine</b> (ddC). Normal naïve (without neuropathy), paclitaxel-treated, and vincristine-treated rats received the following intrathecal injections: TMB- 8 (46 nmol), Quin- 2 (1. 8 nmol), EGTA (0. 1 μmol), EGTA-AM (0. 1 μmol), and their vehicle controls. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats were examined after TMB- 8 and Quin- 2 injections, and ddC-treated rats were examined after receiving TMB- 8. Mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia were evaluated after each injection. Drug effects on heat hyperalgesia were also tested in CCI rats. All four Ca 2 +-reducing drugs significantly inhibited mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia in the rats treated with paclitaxel, vincristine, or ddC, but no effects were seen in the CCI or naïve rats.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of mitochondrial DNA replication {{is a subject}} of intense debate. One model proposes a strand-asynchronous replication in which both strands of the circular genome are replicated semi-independently while the other model proposes both a bidirectional coupled leading- and lagging-strand synthesis mode and a unidirectional mode in which the lagging-strand is initially laid-down as RNA by an unknown mechanism (RITOLS mode). Both the strand-asynchronous and RITOLS model have in common a delayed synthesis of the DNA-lagging strand. Mitochondrial DNA is replicated by a limited set of proteins including DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) and the helicase Twinkle. Here, we report the effects of expression of various catalytically deficient mutants of POLG 1 and Twinkle in human cell culture. Both groups of mutants reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number by severe replication stalling. However, the analysis showed that while induction of POLG 1 mutants still displayed delayed lagging-strand synthesis, Twinkle-induced stalling resulted in maturated, essentially fully double-stranded DNA intermediates. In the latter case, limited inhibition of POLG with <b>dideoxycytidine</b> restored the delay between leading- and lagging-strand synthesis. The observed cause-effect relationship suggests that Twinkle-induced stalling increases lagging-strand initiation events and/or maturation mimicking conventional strand-coupled replication...|$|E
40|$|Individuals {{infected}} with the HIV and taking certain antiretroviral drugs to suppress viral replication have a high prevalence of neuropathic pain that is not alleviated by analgesic/adjuvant drugs that are often efficacious for the relief {{of other types of}} neuropathic pain. There is therefore a great need for new analgesics to alleviate the pain of antiretroviral toxic neuropathy (ATN). Small-molecule angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2) R) antagonists, with >= 1000 -fold selectivity over the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, produced analgesia in the chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve rat model of peripheral nerve trauma. Hence, the present study was designed to assess their analgesic efficacy in a rat model of ATN. The analgesic efficacy of small-molecule AT(2) R antagonists (EMA 200 and EMA 300) was assessed in a rat model of <b>dideoxycytidine</b> (ddC) -induced ATN. Single intraperitoneal bolus doses of EMA 200 (0. 3 - 10 mg/kg) induced dose-dependent analgesia in ddC-rats; the mean ED 50 was 3. 2 mg/kg. Twice-daily intraperitoneal administration of EMA 300 at 30 mg/kg to ddC-rats for 3 days produced significant analgesia on days 2 and 3 of the treatment period. Therefore, small-molecule AT(2) R antagonists should be investigated further as novel analgesics for the relief of ATN...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{transcription}} factor A (TFAM) is an abundant mitochondrial protein of the HMG superfamily, with various putative roles in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) metabolism. In {{this study we}} have investigated the effects on mtDNA replication of manipulating TFAM expression in cultured human cells. Mammalian mtDNA replication intermediates (RIs) fall into two classes, whose mechanistic relationship is not properly understood. One class is characterized by extensive RNA incorporation on the lagging strand, whereas the other has the structure of products of conventional, strand-coupled replication. TFAM overexpression increased the overall abundance of RIs and shifted them substantially towards those of the conventional, strand-coupled type. The shift was most pronounced in the rDNA region and at various replication pause sites and {{was accompanied by a}} drop in the relative amount of replication-termination intermediates, a substantial reduction in mitochondrial transcripts, mtDNA decatenation and progressive copy number depletion. TFAM overexpression could be partially phenocopied by treatment of cells with <b>dideoxycytidine,</b> suggesting that its effects are partially attributable to a decreased rate of fork progression. TFAM knockdown also resulted in mtDNA depletion, but RIs remained mainly of the ribosubstituted type, although termination intermediates were enhanced. We propose that TFAM influences the mode of mtDNA replication via its combined effects on different aspects of mtDNA metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Cell fusion {{induced by}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is usually assessed by counting multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) visualized by light microscopy. Currently used methods do not allow quantification of syncytia, nor do they estimate the number of cells involved in cell fusion. We describe two fluorescence-based methods for the detection and quantification of HIV- 1 -induced in vitro syncytium formation. The lymphoblastoid cell lines MT- 2 and SupT 1 were infected with syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV- 1 isolates. Syncytia were detected by DNA staining with propidium iodide using flow cytometry to determine cell size or by two-color cytoplasmic staining of infected cell populations by using fluorescence microscopy. Both methods were able to detect and quantify HIV-induced syncytia. The methods could distinguish between SI and non-SI HIV isolates and could be used {{with at least two}} separate types of CD 4 + T-cell lines. Small syncytia can be readily identified by the two-color cytoplasmic staining method. Both methods were also shown to be useful for evaluating antiretroviral compounds, as demonstrated by the accurate assessment of HIV inhibition by azidothymidine (zidovudine), <b>dideoxycytidine</b> (zalcytibine), and hydroxyurea.

ZDV, ddI, and ddC susceptibility data have been collected from clinical HIV- 1 isolates obtained by five clinical centers and their respective retrovirology laboratories. All subjects were treated only with ZDV. Clinical HIV- 1 isolates were isolated, amplified, and assayed for drug susceptibility in standardized cultures of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} obtained from healthy seronegative donors. All five cohorts showed a correlation between decreased in vitro susceptibility to ZDV and decreased susceptibility to ddI and ddC.

Detailed analysis of this enzyme has been limited, however, by its low abundance and instability. Using oligonucleotides based on primary amino acid sequence derived from purified dCyd kinase, we have screened T-lymphoblast cDNA libraries and identified a cDNA sequence that encodes a 30. 5 -kDa protein corresponding to the subunit molecular mass of the purified protein. Expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli results in a 40 -fold increase in dCyd kinase activity over control levels. In dCyd kinase-deficient murine L cells, transfection with dCyd kinase cDNA in a mammalian expression vector produces a 400 -fold increase over control in dCyd phosphorylating activity.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of nucleoside analogs {{used for the}} treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection is due primarily to the inhibition of replication of the mitochondrial genome by the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ). The severity of clinically observed toxicity correlates with the kinetics of incorporation versus excision of each analog as quantified by a toxicity index, spanning over six orders of magnitude. Here we show that the rate of excision of <b>dideoxycytidine</b> (zalcitabine; ddC) was reduced fourfold (giving a half-life of ∼ 2. 4 h) by the addition of a physiological concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) due to the formation of a tight ternary enzyme-DNA-dNTP complex at the polymerase site. In addition, we provide a more accurate measurement of the rate of excision and show that the low rate of removal of ddCMP results from both the unfavorable transfer of the primer strand from the polymerase to the exonuclease site and the inefficient binding and/or hydrolysis at the exonuclease site. The analogs ddC, stavudine, and ddATP (a metabolite of didanosine) each bind more tightly at the polymerase site during incorporation than normal nucleotides, and this tight binding contributes to slower excision by the proofreading exonuclease, leading to increased toxicity toward mitochondrial DNA...|$|E

After 8 - 12 months of treatment with saquinavir alone (600 mg, 3 times/day) or in combination with zidovudine (200 mg, 3 times/ day), ~ 45 % of all patients carried provirus with mutant proteinase; the incidence was lower (22 %) in patients treated {{with a combination of}} saquinavir, zidovudine, and <b>dideoxycytidine.</b> There was a good relationship between genotypic analysis of saquinavir resistance and data from virus assays, confirming that Leu 90 -Met and Gly 48 -Val are the essential exchanges in the proteinase that determine loss of sensitivity to this inhibitor.

The concentration of phosphonoformate reducing virus replication by 50 % was 80 microM. 2 ', 3 '-Dideoxynucleosides were potent inhibitors of visna virus replication. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations for dideoxyguanosine, dideoxyadenosine, and <b>dideoxycytidine</b> were 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 microM, respectively. In contrast, weak inhibition was produced by 100 microM dideoxythymidine. These {{results are consistent with}} the reported susceptibility of HIV replication to inhibition by these compounds in vitro. The interaction of visna virus reverse transcriptase with several inhibitors was also examined. Reverse transcriptase was inhibited by phosphonoformate, ribavirin 5 '-triphosphate, ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP. The last four compounds inhibited incorporation of homologous 2 '-deoxynucleoside 5 '-triphosphates into polynucleotides by a competitive mechanism. In view of the biological similarities between visna virus and HIV and the similar in vitro susceptibility of visna virus replication to known inhibitors of HIV, visna virus may provide a good model for studying the inhibition of HIV replication in vitro. Because visna virus is not pathogenic to humans, this model may facilitate the identification of compounds for further investigation into the treatment of HIV-induced disease...|$|E
40|$|Baseline and posttreatment human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) isolates from 38 symptomatic, zidovudine-experienced HIV- 1 –infected children enrolled in a prospective trial of zalcitabine (<b>dideoxycytidine)</b> monotherapy (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 138) were studied {{for the presence of}} syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype and zalcitabine resistance. Twenty of the isolates were SI and 18 were non-SI (NSI) at baseline. After 44 weeks of zalcitabine treatment, the SI and NSI phenotypes were maintained in 16 and 17 patients, respectively. One patient had an NSI-to-SI phenotypic switch, while SI-to-NSI reversion occurred in 4 children (20 %). Isolates from 30 of these patients were analyzed by in vitro drug susceptibility assay: Mean IC 50 values were 0. 14 mM at baseline and 0. 18 mM following zalcitabine treatment. Only 1 child (3 %) developed zalcitabine resistance. Knowledge of the low incidence of zalcitabine resistance and the switch from SI to NSI phenotype in some children may prove useful when selecting antiretroviral drugs to be used in combination. The syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype of human immuno- 1 [8]. It has been shown to have modest benefit in slowing HIV- 1 related disease progression and survival when used asdeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) has been associated with in-creased virus burden and decreased CD 4 lymphocyte counts treatment in adults and children [8, 9].

40|$|The {{antiviral}} {{activity of}} azidothymidine (AZT), <b>dideoxycytidine</b> (ddC), and dideoxyinosine (ddI) against HIV- 1 was comparatively evaluated in PHA-stimulated PBM. The mean drug concentration which yielded 50 % p 24 Gag negative cultures were substantially different: 0. 06, 0. 2, and 6 microM for AZT, ddC, and ddI, respectively. We found that AZT was preferentially phosphorylated to its triphosphate (TP) form in PHA-PBM rather than unstimulated, resting PBM (R-PBM), producing 10 - to 17 -fold higher ratios of AZTTP/dTTP in PHA-PBM than in R-PBM. The phosphorylation of ddC and ddI to their TP forms was, however, much less efficient in PHA-PBM, resulting in approximately 5 -fold and approximately 15 -fold lower ratios of ddCTP/dCTP and ddATP/dATP, respectively, in PHA-PBM than in R-PBM. The comparative order of PHA-induced increase in cellular enzyme activities examined was: thymidine kinase > uridine kinase > deoxycytidine kinase > adenosine kinase > 5 '-nucleotidase. We conclude that AZT, ddC, and ddI exert disproportionate antiviral effects {{depending on the}} activation state of the target cells, i. e., ddI and ddC exert antiviral activity more favorably in resting cells than in activated cells, while AZT preferentially protects activated cells against HIV infection. Considering that HIV- 1 proviral DNA synthesis in resting lymphocytes is reportedly initiated at levels comparable with those of activated lymphocytes, the current data should have practical relevance {{in the design of}} anti-HIV chemotherapy, particularly combination chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|In Parkinson’s disease (PD), {{neuronal}} cells undergo mitotic catastrophe and endoreduplication {{prior to}} cell death; however, the regulatory mechanisms {{remain to be}} defined. In this study, we investigated cell cycle regulation of DNA polymerase b (poly b) in rotenone-based dopaminergic cellular and animal models. Incubation with a low concentration (0. 25 mM) of rotenone for 1. 5 to 7 days resulted in a flattened cell body and decreased DNA replication during S phase, whereas a high concentration (2 mM) of rotenone exposure resulted in enlarged, multi-nucleated cells and converted the mitotic cycle into endoreduplication. Consistently, DNA poly b, which is mainly involved in DNA repair synthesis, was upregulated to a high level following exposure to 2 mM rotenone. The abrogation of DNA poly b by siRNA transfection or <b>dideoxycytidine</b> (DDC) treatment attenuated the rotenone-induced endoreduplication. The cell cycle was reactivated in cyclin D-expressing dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra (SN) of rats following stereotactic (ST) infusion of rotenone. Increased DNA poly b expression was observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNr) of rotenone-treated rats. Collectively, in the in vitro model of rotenone-induced mitotic catastrophe, the overexpression of DNA poly b promotes endoreduplication; in the in vivo model, the upregulation of DNA poly b and cell cycle reentry were also observed in the adult rat substantia nigra. Therefore, the cell cycle regulation of DNA poly b {{may be involved in}} th...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) NS 5 B {{protein is}} an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) essential for replication of the viral RNA genome. Purified NS 5 B {{has been reported}} to exhibit multiple activities in vitro. Using a synthetic heteropolymeric RNA template with <b>dideoxycytidine</b> at its 3 ′-end, we examined de novo initiation and primer extension in a system devoid of self-priming and terminal nucleotide transferase activities. Products predominantly of template size and its multiples were detected. High concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates (Kappm ∼ 100 – 400 μm) corresponding to the first three incorporated nucleotides were found to be required for efficient de novo RNA synthesis. In the presence of initiating di- or trinucleotides, however, the amount of NTP needed to achieve maximal activity dropped 103 - to 104 -fold, revealing a much reduced nucleotide requirement for elongation (Kappm ∼ 0. 03 – 0. 09 μm). Accordingly, single round extension from an exogenous primer following preincubation of the enzyme with template and primer could also be supported by < 0. 1 μm levels of NTP. De novo synthesis at high NTP concentrations was shown to be preferred over primer extension. On a dideoxycytidine-blocked synthetic RNA template derived from the 3 ′-end of the HCV(–) UTR, the addition of the corresponding initiating trinucleotide also dramatically reduced the NTP levels needed to achieve efficient RNA synthesis. Thus, distinct nucleotide requirements exist for initiation and elongation steps catalyzed by the HCV NS 5 B polymerase...|$|E
