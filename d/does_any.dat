5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case <b>does</b> <b>any</b> matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of evolution, {{polymorphism}} results from evolutionary processes, as <b>does</b> <b>any</b> aspect of a species. It is heritable and is modified by natural selection. In polyphenism, an individual's genetic make-up allows for different morphs, and the switch mechanism that determines which morph is shown is environmental. In genetic polymorphism, the genetic make-up determines the morph. Ants exhibit both types in a single population.|$|E
25|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept across a distant object, the spot of laser light can easily be made to move across the object at a speed greater than c.

25|$|General {{relativity}} predicts gravitational waves, as <b>does</b> <b>any</b> {{theory of}} gravitation in which {{changes in the}} gravitational field propagate at a finite speed. Since gravitational waves can be directly detected, {{it is possible to}} use them to learn about the Universe. This is gravitational-wave astronomy. Gravitational-wave astronomy can test general relativity by verifying that the observed waves are of the form predicted (for example, that they only have two transverse polarizations), and by checking that black holes are the objects described by solutions of the Einstein field equations.|$|E
25|$|A dancer {{will appear}} {{to defy the}} laws of physics when ballon is {{exhibited}} effectively. For example, during a grand jeté, the dancer may appear to hover in the air. Physically, the dancer's center of mass follows a ballistic trajectory, as <b>does</b> <b>any</b> projectile, but observers have limited ability to reckon center of mass when a projectile changes its configuration in flight. By raising the arms and legs while ascending and lowering them while descending, the dancer alters the apparent path of the center of mass and, in so doing, seems to observers to be momentarily floating in the air.|$|E
25|$|Apex graphs {{are closed}} under the {{operation}} of taking minors: contracting any edge, or removing any edge or vertex, leads to another apex graph. For, if G is an apex graph with apex v, then any contraction or removal that does not involve v preserves the planarity of the remaining graph, as <b>does</b> <b>any</b> edge removal of an edge incident to v. If an edge incident to v is contracted, {{the effect on the}} remaining graph is equivalent to the removal of the other endpoint of the edge. And if v itself is removed, any other vertex may be chosen as the apex.|$|E

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one <b>does</b> <b>any</b> wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

500|$|Around 40% of the {{population}} has access to sewers. However, only the toilet waste is connected to the sewer while sullage is discharged into the drains.

[...] "There is dialogue with subtext [...] There is intriguing parallel plotting [...] And there's the surprisingly swift, violent dénouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they can do the same to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for our hero, who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order."
