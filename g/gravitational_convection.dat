On the base of the data obtained, reasons of the growth of salt ions `overlimiting' mass transfer in electrodialysis desalination channels with intermembrane distance and different NaCl solution concentration were analysed.

Model performance over the three-month interval, September to November 2001, is assessed against available tide gauge and velocity profiler data before using the model to describe the circulation as driven by rivers, tides, and winds. Because of a mean wind velocity vector directed down the estuary axis, we ran a parallel model experiment without winds to distinguish the estuarine circulation by <b>gravitational</b> <b>convection</b> from the mean wind effects. With or without winds, Tampa Bay exhibits a robust, two-layered estuarine circulation that concentrates on the deep channels. The mean outflow at the surface tends to converge on the channels where the free surface elevation is locally minimum. The mean inflow near the bottom also concentrates in the channels where the baroclinic pressure gradient force is largest. Geometry thus guides the mean circulation and salinity distributions. at the Tampa Bay mouth, mean outflows exist both in the deeper Egmont Channel and the shallower South Pass, whereas a mean inflow {{is limited to the}} Egmont Channel. A residence time based on the Egmont Channel influx is estimated to be about 100 days.

In this paper, we describe in detail a method for implementation of a realistic equation of state, the electron capture and the neutrino cooling in a multidimensional, fully general relativistic code.

Until the convective activities set in, our results approximately agree, or at least are consistent, with those in the previous so-called state-of-the-art simulations. In particular, the radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities and the time evolution of the neutrino luminosities agree quantitatively.

In some cases, such as for spherically symmetrical droplet burning, the absence of buoyancy is desirable for matching analytical treatments with experiments. In other cases, however, it can be more valuable to arbitrarily control the flame's convective environment independent of the environmental gravitational condition. To accomplish this, we propose the use of ion generated winds driven by electric fields to control local convection of flames. Such control can produce reduced buoyancy (effectively zero buoyancy) conditions in the laboratory in 1 -g facilitating a wide range of laser diagnostics that can probe the system without special packaging required for drop tower or flight tests.

40|$|A linear {{stability}} {{analysis has}} been performed onto a self-gravitating magnetized gas disk bounded by external pressure. The resulting dispersion relation is fully explained by {{three kinds of}} instability: a Parker-type instability driven by self-gravity, usual Jeans <b>gravitational</b> instability and <b>convection.</b> In the direction parallel to the magnetic fields, the magnetic tension completely suppresses the convection. If the adiabatic index Î³ {{is less than a}} certain critical value, the perturbations trigger the Parker as well as the Jeans instability in the disk. Consequently, the growth rate curve has two maxima: one at small wavenumber due to a combination of the Parker and Jeans instabilities, and the other at somewhat larger wavenumber mostly due to the Parker instability. In the horizontal direction perpendicular to the fields, the convection makes the growth rate increase monotonically upto a limiting value as the perturbation wavenumber gets large. However, at small wavenumbers, the Jeans instability becomes effective and develops a peak in the growth rate curve. Depending on the system parameters, the maximum growth rate of the convection {{may or may not be}} higher than the peak due to the Jeans-Parker instability. Therefore, a cooperative action of the Jeans and Parker instabilities can have chances to over-ride the convection and may develop large scale structures of cylindrical shape in non-linear stage.

A copper plate (anode) and a stainless steel particulate bed (cathode) were respectively placed at the upper and bottom side of a thin vertical cell which was filled with copper sulfate solution. After the application of electricity, cupric ion which is provided from the copper plate to the solution transfers under the influence of gravity and it is consumed by deposition at the particulate bed.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanism}} that drives accretion {{has been the}} primary challenge in accretion disk theory. Turbulence provides a natural means of dissipation {{and the removal of}} angular momentum, but firmly establishing its presence in disks proved for many years to be difficult. The realization in the 1990 s that a weak magnetic field will destabilize a disk and result in a vigorous turbulent transport of angular momentum has revolutionized the field. Much of accretion disk research now focuses on understanding the implications of this mechanism for astrophysical observations. At the same time, the success of this mechanism depends upon a sufficient ionization level in the disk for the flow to be well-coupled to the magnetic field. Many disks, such as disks around young stars and disks in binary systems that are in quiescence, are too cold to be sufficiently ionized, and so efforts to establish the presence of turbulence in these disks continues. This dissertation focuses on several possible mechanisms for the turbulent transport of angular momentum in weakly-ionized accretion disks: <b>gravitational</b> instability, radial <b>convection</b> and vortices driving compressive motions.

Matrix glasses are basaltic andesite and contain 80 - 150 ppm S, 190 - 250 ppm Cl, 440 - 630 ppm F, and 0. 0 Â± 0. 7 wt. % H 2 O. MELTS modeling suggests that all crystallization occurred at P 50 m of vertical deformation, but there is no visible bulging of the edifice or mass wasting of the cone caused by deformation-induced <b>gravitational</b> instability. Instead, <b>convection</b> of magma in a volcanic conduit with â¼ 5 m diameter is the most likely mechanism for transporting both the volatiles and heat to produce the observed gas emissions and prevent the lava lake from solidifying.
