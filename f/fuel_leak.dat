5|$|On 19 August 2013, B-1B (AF Ser. No. 85-0091) out of Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota {{crashed in}} a remote area near Broadus, Montana. All four crew members survived by {{ejecting}} before the aircraft crashed. A report found that the crash was due to a mechanical failure leading to a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> and explosions.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} {{believed to have been}} in contact with the heat shield. This fault may have caused chafing and may lead to a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak.</b> The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and could eventually detach, leading to a loose-fitting windscreen.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.|$|E
50|$|RTGs pose {{a risk of}} {{radioactive}} contamination: if the container holding the <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks,</b> the radioactive material may contaminate the environment.|$|R
5000|$|On planes, tracer-gas {{leak testing}} {{is used to}} quickly and safely locate <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks,</b> {{as well as to}} check oxygen {{distribution}} devices and cabin pressurization systems.|$|R
50|$|It was {{realized}} that, {{because of}} weight limitations, {{it was not}} practical to simply add armor plate to aircraft fuel tanks; a method of stopping <b>fuel</b> <b>leaking</b> from damaged tanks was necessary.|$|R
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak.</b> The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld lost {{hydraulic}} {{pressure on the}} grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same {{because he had a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen made the best start, moving from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Häkkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010 in the United States, Lamborghini {{recalled}} 428 of its 2007–2008 Murciélago coupés and roadsters {{because of}} the possibility of weld failure on the fuel pump support inside the fuel tank, potentially leading to a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> and possible fire.|$|E
50|$|On July 26, 2013, {{there was}} bad weather in Atlanta, and many Atlanta-bound flights were {{diverted}} to Montgomery including an American Eagle ERJ-145 from Miami, FL, a Delta Connection CRJ-200 from Monroe, LA, two Delta MD-88s from Dallas, TX, and one Delta MD-88 from Fort Myers, FL. While a Delta MD-88 was refueling, <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> {{from the plane}} {{and there was a}} fuel spill. Flights were delayed and passengers were not let off the <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> plane because there was not a tug big enough at the airport to tow the plane away from the spill. The plane departed safely for ATL.|$|R

50|$|Another NASCAR transplant, {{which was}} brought into use {{after the death of}} Fireball Roberts, was the fuel cell. This bladder is placed into the fuel tanks of non-nitromethane fueled {{vehicles}} to prevent <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks,</b> and explosions.|$|R
25|$|Nigerian AAIB {{examined}} both engines' {{fuel system}} components. Investigators {{revealed that the}} fuel feeder lines that attach to the No. 5 fitting (primary and secondary) were both fractured flush. These fractures caused <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> which explained why the engines went unresponsive even when the crew applied throttle movements on the lever.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1959 RAAF A89-308 crashed at RAAF Richmond, NSW, Australia. All eight crew died. The port engine {{began to}} {{disintegrate}} causing a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> in the wheel well. The resulting fire severed the magnesium wing spar, and the aircraft {{fell from the}} sky before the crew could bail out.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is believed}} to have suffered a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> during mid-air refuelling while it was monitoring a NATO offensive against Taliban insurgents west of Kandahar. The fuel appears to have leaked into the bomb bay where it caught fire, either as the result of an electrical fault or hot air leaking from a heating pipe.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent a boiler explosion, the steam machine driver and fireman dumped their firebox on the ground. The hot coals and ashes ignited diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>leaking</b> from the first railcar, and the train burst into flame.|$|R
5|$|This {{aircraft}} was given J57-P-43W engines {{with a larger}} capacity water injection system to provide greater thrust than previous models. This model had problems with <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks</b> which were eventually solved by several service modifications: Blue Band, Hard Shell, and QuickClip.|$|R
50|$|On 18 March 2010, a DHL Antonov An-26 {{aircraft}} made {{an emergency}} landing on the ice of Lake Ülemiste. Approximately 1 ton of <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> {{out of it and}} two members of the crew were injured. Fortunately, all of the pollution was eventually removed.|$|R
25|$|By December 2012 ULA had {{determined}} {{the cause of}} the anomaly to be a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak,</b> and Delta IV launches resumed in May 2013. After two more successful launches, further investigation led to the delay of Delta flight 365 with the GPS IIF-5 satellite. Originally scheduled to launch in October 2013, the vehicle lifted off on February 21, 2014.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 2007, XV235 was {{involved}} in a midair incident over Afghanistan when the crew noticed a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> during air-to-air refuelling. After transmitting a mayday call, the crew landed the aircraft successfully. The incident came only a month before the issue of the report of a Board of Enquiry into 2 September 2006 fatal accident to XV230 in (likely) similar circumstances. The RAF subsequently suspended air-to-air refuelling operations for this type.|$|E
25|$|Brown has {{successfully}} dealt with many F-22 emergencies including a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> at 30,000 feet while traveling at nearly {{the speed of}} sound. On another flight, a mechanical problem affected {{one of the two}} jet engines shortly after take off. Aware of a similar situation that resulted in the loss of an F-117, Brown idled the ailing engine rather than shut it down. The second engine began losing power during the landing approach. Brown's unconventional technique to handling the initial problem allowed him to narrowly avoid a much more serious situation.|$|E
500|$|On 21 December 2013, three CV-22s {{came under}} small arms fire {{while on a}} mission to {{evacuate}} American civilians in Bor, South Sudan during the 2013 South Sudanese political crisis. The three aircraft were damaged and four crew wounded; the mission was aborted and the aircraft flew [...] to Entebbe, Uganda. South Sudanese officials stated that the attackers were rebels. The CV-22s, of the 8th Special Operations Squadron, had flown to Bor over three countries across [...] The formation was hit 119 times, causing flight control failures and hydraulic and <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks</b> on all three aircraft. Due to <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks,</b> multiple air-to-air refuelings were performed en route. Following the South Sudan incident, AFSOC developed optional armor floor panels for the V-22.|$|R
2500|$|Prophet {{predicted}} {{nuclear war}} {{would cause the}} end of the world in March 1990. [...] Adherents started construction of a large bomb shelter in the church compound in Corwin Springs. Construction was halted by court order when large amounts of stored diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> and contaminated the area.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to nutrient pollution, more toxic agents have drained {{into the lake}} from time to time. In 1998, about 20 gallons of diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> into the lake following a [...] "freakish accident" [...] {{in the basement of}} the Caltrans building in the 100 block of Grand Avenue.|$|R
25|$|On 5 January 2006, BFL1405, a Douglas C-54G (C-GXKN), had {{departed}} Norman Wells Airport {{when the number}} two engine caught fire and stopped. The crew attempted {{to put out the}} fire but were not successful. While feathering the number two propeller, number one also feathered, leaving them with only two engines. They returned to Norman Wells and performed an emergency landing, but the aircraft left the runway and ploughed through the snow. The four crew were unhurt, but the aircraft was written off and the nose was later used to repair another C-54. The fire was caused by a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 22, 1968, Apollo 5 {{lifted off}} just before sunset. The Saturn IB worked perfectly, {{inserting}} {{the second stage}} and LM into a 163 x 222km orbit. The nose cone was jettisoned and after a coast of 43 minutes 52 seconds, the LM separated from its adapter, with a 167 x 222km orbit. After two orbits, the first planned 39 second descent engine burn was started, but aborted by the Apollo Guidance Computer after only 4 seconds. Shortly before launch there was a suspected <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> and {{a decision was made}} to delay arming the engine until the time of ignition.|$|E
25|$|The Mr. Fusion {{can provide}} {{enough power to}} the flux {{capacitor}} but is not used to power up the DeLorean itself, which makes use of an ordinary gasoline combustion engine to reach the 88mph speed necessary for it to time travel, a limitation that proved itself crucial in the third movie when Doc and Marty find themselves stuck in 1885 and unable to return with the DeLorean out of gas (due to a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak).</b> The vehicle's hover system is powered by Mr. Fusion and is capable of bringing the DeLorean up to the required 88mph; the combustion engine was also probably left on board as a backup. However, the flight systems were destroyed {{as a result of}} a lightning strike, leaving Marty to rely on the original combustion engine, which in turn was disabled.|$|E

Construction was halted by court order when large amounts of stored diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> and contaminated the area.|$|R
50|$|As Naval {{planners}} {{established a}} submarine blockade of Truk {{in connection with}} the offensive in the Solomon Islands, Grayling began her third war patrol 14 July 1942 around the Japanese stronghold. She damaged a Japanese submarine tender 13 August, but was forced to return to Pearl Harbor 26 August by <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A pop valve, {{like the}} later forms of steam {{locomotive}} safety valve, only flows once a certain pressure has been reached. It then opens sharply, allowing full flow. This {{is used to}} make a sharp, abrupt start to fuel injection. This ensures that no <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks</b> into the cylinder until full combustion is imminent.|$|R
25|$|Further, the {{commission}} {{found that the}} fire {{was caused by a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> ignited by a short circuit. This spread to the fuel tanks, leading to the scale of the inferno. Supply of ample oxygen was provided by an engine still running. All people on board had a chance of survival, but that rapid and correct evacuation was decisive for actual survival. Although the fire crew were quick to the scene, they were hindered by the terrain, preventing efficient containment of the fire during the crucial evacuation period. The aircraft and crew were found to be fit, airworthy and certified. No training or procedures were available in case spoilers failed to deploy, and that these could have prevented the accident. The airport's physical geography and lack of adequate safety were decisive in the outcome of the accident.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 1966 her turbine {{couplings}} failed off {{the coast}} of Kobe, Japan, and in 1967, in Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal, she collided with the dock. In 1968, in the same port, Iberia suffered the same blackout incident she had had in Auckland, New Zealand. P switched the London-Sydney route to a Southampton-Sydney route, and on her first run from Sydney to Southampton, Iberia caught fire, went through a third electric blackout, had an engine failure and suffered a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak.</b> At Southampton, she was temporarily laid up for repairs. In 1969, she had a second stabilizer breakdown. In 1971, Iberia sailed on her last voyage from Southampton to Sydney. Because of her frequent breakdowns and mechanical problems, Iberia was taken out of service in 1972, a year earlier than Chusan and Himalaya. In October 1973, she was scrapped in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, alongside Chusan. Arcadia remained in operation until 1979.|$|E
25|$|At {{around this}} time, the Eagle engine was {{cancelled}} {{and it was}} found that there were insufficient pre-production engines available to complete all the prototype and pre-production aircraft. Specification N.12/45 was therefore issued for the Wyvern TF.2, to be powered by a turboprop engine: either the Rolls-Royce Clyde or the Armstrong Siddeley Python. A single Clyde-powered prototype was ordered along with two with Pythons. A Clyde-powered TF.2 first flew on 18 January 1949. Both the piston-powered and turboprop versions shared many common components including wing and tail units, and essentially the same basic cockpit structure. The flight was cut short to only three minutes when shortly after takeoff, the cockpit filled with smoke from a <b>fuel</b> <b>leak</b> onto the exhaust ducting. Clyde development was subsequently cancelled by Rolls-Royce after only 50 hours of flight time for the TF.2, and the aircraft was delivered to Napier & Son to be fitted with the Nomad turbo-compound engine. The latter engine never materialised, however and this aircraft was used for crash barrier trials.|$|E
50|$|In November 2013, Ford {{recalled}} over 160,000 Escape and Kuga with 1.6 ecoboost engines {{because of}} oil and <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks</b> {{that could lead to}} engine fires, after 13 fires caused by leaks were reported to Ford; the recall also covered about 12,000 to correct fuel lines installed incorrectly that could become chafed and leak gas.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 June 1957, an Eastern Air Lines Douglas DC-7B (N808D) {{had just}} {{returned}} from a training flight and was taxiing to the maintenance hangar at Miami International Airport when it collided with a parked Eastern Air Lines L-1049 Super Constellation (N6212C) near the hangar. <b>Fuel</b> <b>leaked</b> and both aircraft caught fire and burned out.|$|R
50|$|The Mallard was {{designed}} in the 1940s with a so-called 'wet wing' where the fuel tanks, instead of being separate items within the wing, are constructed from sealed-off portions of the wing structure itself. This eliminates the additional weight of the tanks and also allows more fuel to be contained within a given wing size. The drawback of this form of construction {{is that all the}} joints around the tank seams must be sealed in order to ensure the tank is fuel-tight. In addition, the normal flexing of the wing in flight has a tendency to open seams over extended periods of time, leading to <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks.</b> Grumman, the manufacturer, had issued warnings as early as 1963 about <b>fuel</b> <b>leaks</b> from the Mallard's wing being indicative of possible structural problems. However, for unknown reasons the airline did not consider this particularly relevant to its own aircraft.|$|R
