The results showed 47 detected odors in the unaged wines, 50 in the 1. 5 -years-old wines and 59, 61 and 69 in the wines aged 2. 5, 4. 5, and 6 years, respectively.

40|$|Sulphanylalkyl {{alcohols}} {{and their}} corresponding acetates were investigated in 14 commercial Belgian beers. Although {{it was the}} major peak at the pulsed-flame photometric detector, the <b>empyreumatic</b> 2 -sulphanylethyl acetate was found at concentrations below its individual odour threshold, estimated at 40 mg/L (0 – 4 mg/L in most fresh beers, 5 – 12 mg/L in three fresh high-bitter beers). Both the Ehrlich pathway and hop constituents contribute to this content. In 11 of the investigated samples, synthesis of 2 SE-A and 3 -sulphanylpropyl acetate (roasted, burned) continued {{during the first three}} months of storage. Although below their individual thresholds, these compounds might interact by synergy with other aged flavours. As yeast was absent from most of the investigated bottles, chemical degradation of precursors is suspected...|$|E
40|$|The {{manganese}} nodules {{occur in}} greater or less quantity {{all over the}} ocean-bed, and most abundantly in the Pacific. They occur in all sizes, from minute grains to masses of a pound weight, and even greater, and form nodular concretions of concentric shells, round a nucleus, which is very frequently a piece of pumice or a shark's tooth. Their outside has a peculiar and very characteristic mammillated surface, which enables them to be identified at a glance. When freshly brought up they are very soft, being easily scraped to powder with a knife. They gradually get harder on exposure to the air. The powder, heated in a closed tube, gives out water which re-acts alkaline, and has an <b>empyreumatic</b> odour. Heated with strong hydrochloric acid, it liberates abundance of chlorine, and the residue which remains is white, consisting of silica, clay, and sand, the sand being the same as {{is found in the}} bottom mud from the same locality. Their composition varies greatly, different nodules containing different quantities of mechanically admixed mud, and the number of different elements found in them is very large. Copper, iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, alumina, lime, magnesia, silica, and phosphoric acid have been detected in a large number; but I have not as yet been able to make a complete analysis of any of them. I have, however, made a few determinations of the most important component substances. For this purpose the outside and densest layers of the nodules were selected, and portions of them were pulverised and dried for ten or twelve hours at 140 ° C. The amount of chlorine liberated on treatment with hydrochloric acid was determined by Bunsen's method, and the iron was determined by titration with stannous chloride. The samples analysed were from four different localities...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of our thesis was to evidence how polyfunctional thiols evolve through beer aging. Thiols were investigated in various fresh beers. By applying pHMB extractions and GC-PFPD analyses, the profiles {{were shown to}} be significantly different between beer samples, mainly depending on the hopping procedure and the yeast strain. During beer aging, thiols evolve in different ways. In the early period of storage, both synthesis and degradation were observed. Yet after one year of aging, most compounds revealed to be strongly degraded. In oxidized aged beer, the ribes off-flavor exhaled by 3 S 3 MB-F was shown to occur. This thiol can appear very early, with concentration up to 1230 ppt for a sensorial threshold assessed at 57 ppt. Combinatorial syntheses of 2 - and 3 -sulfanyl- 3 -methylbutyl formates and acetates allowed us to evidence how different can be their descriptors. Both formates bring the ribes note, while their acetates were vinegar-like. Another polyfunctional thiol which was often generated {{at the beginning of}} aging is 2 SE-A. This <b>empyreumatic</b> odorant is usually the major thiol in fresh beer, with concentration up to 10 ppb for a sensorial threshold assessed at 40 ppb. For a same content of cysteine and homocysteine in wort, very different concentrations of 2 SE-A can be generated in fresh beer, according to the yeast strain used. When high levels are found in fresh beer, significant degradation can be observed through aging. Commercially unavailable Cys- 2 SE-A was synthesized for the first time, from acetylation of the S-cysteine conjugate of 2 SEol. The low degradation ratios measured by Cys- 2 SE-A spiking experiments seem sufficient to explain the production of ppb levels of 2 SE-A through beer aging. For other minor thiols, a similar pattern was observed through aging. When commercial felinine or synthesized Cys- 3 SHol were spiked into fresh beer, the corresponding free thiols were generated after 5 days at 60 °C (molar conversion ratio of 0. 1 - 0. 2 %; cysteine adducts recovery factor = 43 - 84 %). As shown by experiments conducted in model aqueous media, chemical degradation of cysteine adducts are most probably favored in a complex medium like beer. A modified Strecker degradation pathway of cysteine adducts in presence of beer dicarbonyls was proposed. (AGRO - Sciences agronomiques et ingénierie biologique) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
