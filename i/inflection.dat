5|$|Ottawa has {{complex systems}} of both inflectional and derivational {{morphology}}. Inflectional morphology has {{a central role}} in Ottawa grammar. Noun <b>inflection</b> and particularly verb <b>inflection</b> indicate grammatical information through the use of prefixes and suffixes that are added to word stems.|$|E
5|$|New <b>inflection</b> points {{cannot be}} created by the curve-shortening flow.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Mokhtarian and Mackworth {{involves}} computing the curve-shortening flow, tracking the <b>inflection</b> {{points of the}} curve as they progress through the flow, and drawing a graph that plots {{the positions of the}} <b>inflection</b> points around the curve against the time parameter. The <b>inflection</b> points will typically be removed from the curve in pairs as the curve becomes convex (according to the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem) and the lifetime of a pair of points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape.|$|E

40|$|Research {{strongly}} suggests that printed words are recognized {{in terms of their}} constituent morphemes, but researchers have tended to consider the recognition of derivations and <b>inflections</b> in separate theoretical debates. Recently, Crepaldi et al. (2010) proposed a theory that claims to account for the recognition of both derivations and <b>inflections.</b> We investigated brain potentials in the context of masked priming to test two key predictions of this theory: (a) that regular <b>inflections</b> should prime their stems to a greater degree than irregular <b>inflections</b> should prime their stems; and (b) that priming for regular <b>inflections</b> should arise earlier in the recognition process than priming for irregular <b>inflections.</b> Significant masked priming effects were observed for both regular and irregular <b>inflections,</b> though these effects were greater for regular <b>inflections.</b> ERP data further suggested that masked priming effects for regular and irregular <b>inflections</b> had different time courses. Priming for regular but not irregular <b>inflections</b> emerged in a time window reflecting processing up to 250 ms post target onset, and while priming for regular and irregular <b>inflections</b> was observed in a time window reflecting processing 400 - 600 ms post target onset, these effects arose earlier and were of greater magnitude for the regular <b>inflections.</b> These findings support a form-then-meaning characterisation of the visual word processing system such as that proposed by Crepaldi et al.

5|$|Verbalisation {{involves}} re-analysing {{the entire}} coverb - including its suffix -ma, which serves merely {{to indicate that}} it is unmarked for aspect - as a verb root, and then to apply the usual obligatory verbal <b>inflection</b> affixes for person, number and tense. As there is no discrete morpheme {{that serves as a}} 'verbaliser', the process is one of conversion.|$|E

5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed <b>inflection</b> and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E
5|$|The finale is in sonata form. It {{features}} significant {{developments of}} a simple motif, and considerable dialogue between the four parts. The finale also contains {{a high degree of}} chromaticism, a feature that links the four movements of the work. The musicologist W. Dean Sutcliffe points to the recurrence of C at key points in each movement, serving at different times to create dissonance, to commence modulation (music) away from the tonic, or, {{as in the case of}} the finale, as a device for <b>inflection.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) {{and eight}} cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal <b>inflection</b> for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, {{as well as}} for case.|$|E

5|$|The main voice castincluding Conroy as Batman, Sorkin as Harley Quinn, Valenza as Poison Ivy, and Wingert as Riddlerwas well received, but Hamill's {{performance}} received consistent praise, with reviewers commenting {{upon his}} excellent <b>inflection</b> and timing on a cackling, maniacal performance that steals the show. Nguyen said that Dini and Hamill's Joker {{was the best}} depiction of the character outside of The Killing Joke and Heath Ledger's incarnation in The Dark Knight (2008).|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal <b>inflection</b> through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the <b>inflection</b> of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

These are imperfect av- present subjunctive ai- future and conditional aur- simple past and past subjunctive e- (not pronounced: eus, eusse are pronounced as bare <b>inflections</b> [...] ).

The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike <b>inflection.</b> The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little <b>inflection,</b> a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward <b>inflection.</b> The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
