[...] "Harvick pulled a slide job on my {{earlier in the}} day, I crossed over and passed him clean.

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you will}} be sorry for him: I'm afraid he cries about {{something}} when I don't see him. But {{that was not the}} reason I went <b>to</b> <b>him</b> first; it was because <b>I</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and show him my baby, and he was a stranger that lived nowhere, and I thought you wouldn't care so much about my <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> And <b>I</b> think he is not a bad old man, and he wanted to come and sleep on the straw next to the goats, and I made Monna Lisa say, `Yes, he might,' and he's away all the day almost, but when he comes back <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and take <b>him</b> something <b>to</b> eat." ...|$|R
2500|$|Roger Troutman {{developed}} [...] "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] {{around the}} theme of romantic commitment. [...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit." [...] Troutman took the idea and began working on a track similar in style to [...] "Computer Love," [...] a 1986 hit for his band Zapp. [...] "I was playing in Dallas and [...] flew out. We sat {{in the hotel room}} one day and wrote the song. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about what I was trying to say and one thing led to another.

2500|$|The Brothers Karamazov {{has had a}} deep {{influence}} on many writers, philosophers, and public figures over the years. Admirers of the novel include Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Cormac McCarthy, Kurt Vonnegut, Haruki Murakami, Vladimir Putin, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton. C. P. Snow, writing about Einstein's admiration of the novel, wrote, [...] "The Brothers Karamazov - that for him in 1919 was the supreme summit of all literature. It remained so when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in 1937, and probably {{until the end of}} his life." [...] Sigmund Freud called it [...] "the most magnificent novel ever written" [...] and was fascinated with the book for its Oedipal themes. In 1928 Freud published a paper titled [...] "Dostoevsky and Parricide" [...] in which he investigated Dostoyevsky's own neuroses. Freud claimed that Dostoyevsky's epilepsy was not a natural condition but instead a physical manifestation of the author's hidden guilt over his father's death. According to Freud, Dostoyevsky (and all other sons) wished for {{the death of his father}} because of latent desire for his mother; and as evidence Freud cites the fact that Dostoyevsky's epileptic fits did not begin until he turned 18, the year his father died. The themes of patricide and guilt, especially in the form of moral guilt illustrated by Ivan Karamazov, would then obviously follow for Freud as literary evidence of this theory.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> (Dr. Scott) {{for some}} time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, {{who was looking}} thin and weak. (15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.
