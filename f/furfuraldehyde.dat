30|$|Wet {{oxidation}} {{is one of}} {{the simple}} methods of lignocellulosic pretreatment where the air/oxygen along with water or hydrogen peroxide is treated with the biomass at high temperatures (above 120  °C for 30  min) (Varga et al. 2003). Earlier this method as also used for waste water treatment and soil remediation (Chaturvedi and Verma 2013). This method is most suitable for lignin enriched biomass residues. The efficiency of wet oxidation is dependent on three factors: oxygen pressure, temperature, and reaction time. In this process, when the temperature is raised above 170  °C, water behaves like an acid and catalyzes hydrolytic reactions. The hemicelluloses are broken down into smaller pentose monomers and the lignin undergoes oxidation, while the cellulose is least affected by wet oxidation pretreatment. Besides these, reports on addition of chemical agents like sodium carbonate and alkaline peroxide in wet oxidation reduced the reaction temperature, improved hemicellulose degradation and decreased the formation of inhibitory components such as furfurals and <b>furfuraldehydes</b> (Banerjee et al. 2011). This pretreatment method is unlikely to reach industrial scale of biomass pretreatment because of the high cost of the hydrogen peroxide and the combustible nature of the pure oxygen (Bajpai 2016). Szijártó et al. (2009) applied wet oxidation for the pretreatment of common reed (Phragmites australis). The treatment resulted in three fold increase in digestibility of reed cellulose by cellulase as compared to control. 51.7 % of hemicellulose and 58.3 % of lignin was solubilised and 82.4 % of cellulose got converted into cellulose on enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated fibers. The pretreated fibers produced 0.87 % ethanol when underwent simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Banerjee et al. (2009) optimized the wet oxidation conditions for rice husk for the production of ethanol. The optimized conditions of 0.5  MPa pressure, 185  °C temperature for 15  min yielded 67 % of cellulose, removed 89 % lignin, and solubilised 70 % hemicellulose. Reducing sugar yields up to 70 % have been obtained by utilizing this pretreatment process. Alkaline Peroxide-Assisted Wet Air Oxidation (APAWAO) treatment on rice husk resulted in solubilization of 67 and 88 wt% of hemicellulose and lignin, respectively. The glucose amount increased 13 -fold as compared from untreated rice husk (Banerjee et al. 2011). This pretreatment method is unlikely to reach industrial scale of biomass pretreatment because of the high cost of the hydrogen peroxide and the combustible nature of the pure oxygen (Bajpai 2016).|$|R

Electro-oxidation of organic compounds has been dealt with. Galvanostatic polarisation measurements have been carried out extensively. The effect of current density, temperature and acid concentration on the yield of the product has been dealt with elaborately. An account of direct oxidation of <b>furfuraldehyde</b> to maleic acid on lead dioxide electrode has been given. Various parameters affecting the current efficiency for the formation of maleic acid are given. Probable oxidation products of <b>furfuraldehyde</b> have been given to explain the lesser yield of maleic acid. The oxidation of p-Xylene to terephthalic acid is given. As there is no good efficiency for the oxidation, two stage processes for the oxidation has been suggested. Chromic acid is used for the chemical oxidation of p-Xylene to terephthalic acid. During the oxidation, chromic acid gets reduced to trivalent chromium. The hexavalent chromium is regenerated by electrolytic oxidation at lead dioxide electrode in sulphuric acid medium. Use of blue asbestos fibre instead of a separate cathode chamber has been found useful in the regeneration process. The electro reduction at dissolving type of cathode and the electro reduction of p-nitrosodimethyl aniline at copper cathodes are elaborated.

40|$|Honey and ghee {{are the two}} food {{substances}} used {{widely in}} our diet. In Ayurveda, it is quoted that heated honey and honey mixed with equal amount of ghee produce deleterious effects. Hence, it was of our interest to study the physicochemical characteristics and chemical constituents of heated honey and honey mixed with ghee, and their effect on daily food intake and organ weights of rats. The specific gravity of samples showed {{a significant decrease in}} honey and ghee samples heated to 140 °C. The pH of honey heated to 140 °C was elevated with a reduction in the specific gravity. There was a significant rise in hydroxymethyl <b>furfuraldehyde</b> (HMF) in 60 º and 140 °C heated honey samples. The browning and total antioxidant of honey mixed ghee samples was significantly higher when compared to ghee samples. Further, the authors have also evaluated the effects of consumption of heated honey, ghee, honey mixed with equal amount of ghee and heated honey mixed with heated ghee in rats. The feeding of heated honey and honey mixed with ghee for 6 weeks showed no significant change in the food intake, weight gain and relative organ weights. The study revealed that the heated honey mixed with ghee produces HMF which may cause deleterious effects...|$|E
40|$|High voltage {{transformers}} use {{paper to}} insulate the electrical windings {{present in the}} core which is then subsequently immersed in oil. In service, {{the temperature of the}} windings will increase to typically 80 degrees C. If the transformer is loaded to beyond its design ratings, the temperature can exceed 100 degrees C causing the cellulose chains in the paper to cleave at an accelerated rate, resulting in the degradation of mechanical strength and performance of the insulation. If unchecked, this can lead to catastrophic failure of the transformed and accompanying disruption to electricity supply and large economic losses to the operating utility. <b>Furfuraldehyde</b> (FFA) is a chemical by-product which is released into the oil by the thermal degradation of the paper winding. The concentration of FFA within the oil has been directly related to the condition of the paper insulation. We have developed absorbance and fluorescence optical techniques incorporating a novel FFA- sensitive material which we have invested at our laboratories. This material has been incorporated into a prototype portable optoelectronic instrument for the measurement of FFA {{at the site of the}} transformer. Results of experiments will be presented, and the implication of these results for condition monitoring of HV transformer will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Coordination {{compounds}} of Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) {{with the}} Schiff base obtained through the condensation of L 1 and L 2 (L 1 – obtained through the condensation of 4 -aminoantipyrine with <b>furfuraldehyde</b> and L 2 – derived from 2 -aminobenzothiazole and 3 -nitrobenzaldehyde) were synthesized under reflux conditions. The newly formed complexes were characterized using elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance, 1 H NMR, UV–Vis., IR and ESR techniques. Cyclic voltammogram of the complexes in DMSO solution at 300  K was recorded and their salient features were summarized. The X-band ESR {{spectrum of the}} copper complex in DMSO solution at 300 and 77  K was recorded. The in vitro biological screening of the investigated compounds was tested against the bacterial species, and fungal species by disc diffusion method. The antimicrobial activity of metal complexes was dependent on the microbial species tested, ligand and the metal salts used. A comparative study of inhibition values of Schiff bases and their complexes indicates that the complexes exhibit higher antimicrobial activity than the free ligands. The DNA binding studies were performed for the complexes using cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption spectra. Superoxide dismutase activity of these complexes has also been examined...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{testing has}} found {{widespread}} use {{in assessing the}} quality of the insulation system of a transformer. Techniques such as Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) have been proven to be reliable in this task, but are expensive, laborious and time consuming. It is also not available for field use. This paper proposes the combined use of gas and optical sensing technology for the testing of transformer oil. It provides a low-cost, portable technology capable of fast and reliable field screening of transformers. The method consists of an oil handling and unit as well as a gas and optical sensor array. Gas sensing targets moisture, hydrocarbons and other volatile compounds dissolved in transformer oil; optical measurements provide information on the absorption properties of transformer oil, within a band of frequencies made possible by the recent advances in Blue-LED technology. These measurements are then combined through a pattern recognition system producing a collective decision {{on the state of the}} transformer. The performance of the method was evaluated on a database of 26 transformer oil samples, using a leave-one-out validation technique. Our results indicated that the method was capable of categorizing transformer oil into three classes, ‘acceptable,’ ‘marginal’ and ‘bad’ with reasonable accuracy, based on the acidity and <b>furfuraldehyde</b> levels estimated from gas-optical measurements. The results need to be further validated using a larger database of transformer oil samples...|$|E
