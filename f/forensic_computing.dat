There is a generally shared assumption that <b>forensic</b> <b>computing</b> activities are legitimate and {{in the best interests of}} society. This article aims to shed doubt on that prevailing narrative. The article uses some of the concepts of critical theory as applied in critical research in information systems and critical legal studies to point to some potential problems of <b>forensic</b> <b>computing</b> in the workplace. Drawing on traditional critical theory, the article argues that <b>forensic</b> <b>computing</b> can be used as a hegemonic means to uphold ideology even when it is used in law enforcement.

40|$|Abstract- Cloud {{computing}} {{is a novel}} computing paradigm {{that presents}} new research opportunities {{in the field of}} digital <b>forensics.</b> Cloud <b>computing</b> is based on the following principles: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured service. These principles require that cloud computing be distributed internationally. Even if the cloud is hosted locally, it is based on multi tenancy, which is a challenge when using an advanced "dead" forensic approach. For these reasons, digital forensic investigations in cloud computing need to be performed on live systems. There are challenges in cloud forensics itself, as there are no standardised digital forensic procedures and processes. This paper is part of an effort by the authors to standardise the digital forensic process, and we therefore focus specifically on live <b>forensics.</b> Since cloud <b>computing</b> services are provisioned over the Internet, live forensics and network forensics form an integral part of cloud forensics. In a bid to standardise a digital forensic process in cloud computing, {{there is a need to}} first focus on live forensics and network forensics.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a relatively}} new technology which is quickly becoming {{one of the most important}} technological advances for computer science. This technology has had a significant growth in recent years. It is now more affordable and cloud platforms are becoming more stable. Businesses are successfully migrating their systems to a cloud infrastructure, obtaining technological and economic benefits. However, others still remain reluctant to do it due to both security concerns and the loss of control over their infrastructures and data that the migration entails. At the same time that new technologies progress, its benefits appeal to criminals too. They can not only steal data from clouds, but they can also hide data in clouds, which has provoked an increased in the number of cybercrimes and their economic impacts. Their victims range from children and adults to companies and even countries. On the other hand, digital forensics have negatively suffered the impact of the boom of cloud computing due to its dynamic nature. The tools and procedures that were successfully proved and used in digital investigations are now becoming irrelevant, making it an urging necessity to develop new forensics capabilities for conducting an investigation in this new environment.

In addition, an outstanding ontology was implemented that describes typical mission activities, their relationships, required resources, and constraints.

30|$|Cloud Forensics (CF) covers {{more than}} one area of knowledge, and can be {{referred}} to as the application of digital <b>forensics</b> in cloud <b>computing</b> environments [8]. Another definition introduced by the newly established NIST Cloud Forensic Working Group, states that “Cloud <b>Computing</b> <b>Forensic</b> science is the application of scientific principles, technology practices and derived and proven methods to process past cloud computing events through identification, collection, preservation, examination and reporting of digital data for the purpose of facilitating the reconstruction of these events” [1]. Consequently, cloud forensics is more complicated due to the default nature of its characteristics such as multi-tenancy, multi-jurisdiction, data duplication and high degree of virtualization. Similarly, the chain of dependency or the trade of services among CSPs have made it difficult to follow the continuity of digital evidence in cloud. Therefore, in the case of cloud, the traditional forensic process models that were applicable in non-cloud environments are no longer practical. As a result, those traditional methods can be modified so as to adapt to the cloud environments or else cloud specific steps may precede existing methods in order to utilize such methods in cloud environments [9 – 11]. In general, the digital forensic investigation process is a post incident activity as it is mostly initiated after an incident happens. It follows few pre-defined steps, and in a cloud environment, can be implemented in two areas, that is, CSCs side forensics and CSPs side forensics.|$|R

The second course was a laboratory course with extensive experiments including forensic analysis of mobile phones. We give an overview over these courses and pay special attention to the reports resulting from the exercises which clearly document the ubiquity of data available to forensic analysis. ...|$|E
