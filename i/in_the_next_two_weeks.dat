Davis relented on January 30, allowing Seddon to replace Northrop with Breckinridge's friend, Eli Metcalfe Bruce, on an interim basis; Breckinridge accepted Davis's appointment the next day.|$|E

2500|$|Lietuvos rytas {{qualified}} to the EuroCup Top 16 phase with a 3–5 record, {{in large part}} due to incredible efforts from Drew Gordon, David Logan and the rising Artūras Gudaitis. Many troubles started {{before the start of}} the top 16, as Gudaitis and Gailius suffered injuries. Rytas lost a very close game to Hapoel Jerusalem at the start in Vilnius, losing 76–80 in a game Rytas led by as much as 20 points, with the fans and coaching staff blaming the referees after the game. In the second round, Rytas lost to BC Zenit Saint Petersburg 79–88 in an away game, though fought hard and erased a bigger deficit before the end. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> Rytas faced BC Nizhny Novgorod, blowing out their opponents both times – 97–63 away, and 99–73 at home, with chances to reach the playoffs returning. After a tough game, and a loss, to Hapoel in Jerusalem 77–84, Rytas faced Zenit at home – David Logan scored 28 points in the deciding game, with Rytas winning 86–84, but just narrowly missing the playoffs, as Zenit won the first game by 9 points. After the failure to progress into the EuroCup Playoffs club announced addition of guard Jimmy Baron from local rivals Neptūnas. On February 10, Tomas Pačėsas decided to leave the club and was replaced by Rimas Kurtinaitis, who coached Rytas to most of its titles previously. The coaching change, however, did not save Rytas from one of the most shocking losses in the season – in the first round of the King Mindaugas Cup, Rytas, the defending champion, lost to Juventus Utena 84–87. The loss also became the last game of David Logan, who after weeks of rumors left to sign with Sidigas Avellino. On 25 February, club signed a contract with forward Taylor Brown from the Polish Basketball League. In the LKL, with coach Pačėsas, the team fell to third place for much of the season, only getting second place by the last weeks in the regular season under coach Kurtinaitis. Rytas split the season series with new rivals Neptūnas Klaipėda, and with the rising Lietkabelis Panevėžys team. Against BC Žalgiris, however, this was not the case, Lietuvos rytas were swept in the season series 0:4. In the LKL playoffs, Rytas faced, and swept BC Pieno žvaigždės in the quarterfinals 3–0. In the semifinal, Rytas faced Lietkabelis – in the regular season, both teams won at home, and fought for the second place and home court advantage, which Rytas won at the last game in Vilnius 92-60. Considered a fovorite, Rytas won the first game 96–85 in Vilnius, a game with many conflicts between both teams, in particular Drew Gordon and Lietkabelis forward Žygimantas Skučas. In the second game, Rytas lost in Panevėžys 73–90. With the series tied at 1–1, Rytas was the favorite heading in the third game in Vilnius - Lietkabelis had never won in Vilnius before. However, a shock happened – Rytas lost 73–81, and was down 1–2 in the series. Heading to Panevėžys, internal teams arose with the team in regards with discipline violations by Taylor Brown, Corey Fisher and Clevin Hannah, though no actions were taken by the team until after the series - the three players, along with Drew Gordon, were suspended for the rest of the season. All of them were denying the fact but the incontestable pictures were published, which shattered all the doubts. In Panevėžys, Rytas lost 77–86 and lost the series 1–3. This fiasco also meant that Rytas did not qualify for the LKL finals for the second time in a row - first time in history this has happened.|$|E
