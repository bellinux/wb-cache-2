50|$|The SBA111 is {{a forward}} control {{truck with a}} 6-cylinder Scania diesel engine, a six-shift Scania {{automatic}} gearbox integrated with a mechanical two-shift transfer case driving all axles, the winch and optional two other power-take-offs. Due to ample ground clearance, low centre of <b>gravity,</b> <b>locking</b> differentials on all axles and automatic transmission, it has very good cross-country mobility. It is fitted with an 87 kN winch.|$|E

At the end of the proceedings, all of Sarah Jane's strength returns to her as the stomach shrivels. The meteors disappear, much to the relief of Gita and Haresh. Sarah Jane sends Ruby back to her prison in space; Ruby vows to make the Earth suffer. The prison's <b>gravity</b> <b>lock</b> disengages, however, and the prison is sent hurtling into the sun. When Clyde walks up to the shrivelled stomach, it spurts pink goo in his face.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{effectively}} improve penetration rates and enhance wellbore quality for vertical wells, a new Automatic Vertical Drilling Tool (AVDT) based on Eccentric Braced Structure (EBS) is designed. Applying operating principle of rotary steering drilling, AVDT adds offset gravity block automatic induction inclination mechanism. When hole straightening happens, tools take essentric moment {{to be produced}} by gravity of offset <b>gravity</b> <b>lock</b> to control the bearing of guide force, so that well straightening is achieved. The normal tool's size of the AVDT is designed as 215. 9  mm，other major components' sizes are worked out by the result of theoretical analysis, including the offset angle of EBS. This paper aims to introduce the structure, operating principle, theoretical analysis and describe the key components' parameters setting of the AVDT...|$|R

Her dancers appear weightless, {{freed from the}} constraints of <b>gravity</b> and <b>locked</b> together in seemingly impossible configurations. The more incomprehensible the picture looked,the more successful it was in Greenfield’s eyes: [...] "What intrigues me is making images that confound and confuse the viewer, but that the viewer knows, or suspects, really happened ... I can't depict the moments {{before or after the}} camera's click, but I invite the viewer's consideration of that question." ...|$|R
40|$|Large Eddy Simulations {{are used}} to {{investigate}} the dynamics of gravity currents produced by the lock-release technique. Three simulations are carried out varying the initial reduced <b>gravity</b> of the <b>lock</b> fluid. The <b>gravity</b> currents develop two different flow regimes, a slumping phase followed by a self-similar phase, {{in agreement with the}} shallow water theory. When the dense fluid is released, a gravity current forms and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities develop at the interface between the two fluids, causing entrainment of ambient fluid. Two entrainment parameters, a bulk and a local one, are evaluated from an analysis of the instantaneous increase in volume of the gravity current. Entrainment of ambient fluid is found to occur in both the slumping and the self-similar phases. The analysis of the local entrainment parameter shows the determinant role of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the entrainment dynamics and mixing...|$|R
40|$|Faulting {{can result}} from either of two {{different}} mechanisms. These involve fundamentally different energetics. In elastic rebound, locked-in elastic strain energy is transformed into the earthquake (seismic waves plus work done in the fault zone). In force-driven faulting, the forces that create the stress on the fault supply work or energy to the faulting process. Half of this energy is transformed into the earthquake and half goes into an increase in locked-in elastic strain. In elastic rebound the locked-in elastic strain drives slip on the fault. In force-driven faulting it stops slip on the fault. Tectonic stress is reasonably attributed to gravity acting on topography and the Earth's lateral density variations. This includes the thermal convection that ultimately drives plate tectonics. Mechanical analysis has shown {{the intensity of the}} gravitational tectonic stress that is associated with the regional topography and lateral density variations that actually exist is comparable with the stress drops that are commonly associated with tectonic earthquakes; both are in the range of tens of bar to several hundred bar. The gravity collapse seismic mechanism assumes the fault fails and slips in direct response to the gravitational tectonic stress. Gravity collapse is an example of force-driven faulting. In the simplest case, energy that is released from the gravitational potential of the stress-causing topography and lateral density variations is equally split between the earthquake and the increase in locked-in elastic strain. The release of gravitational potential energy requires a change in the Earth's density distribution. Gravitational body forces are solely dependent on density so a change in the density distribution requires a change in the body forces. This implies the existence of volumetric body-force displacements. The volumetric body-force displacements are in addition to displacements generated by slip on the fault. They must exist if gravity participates in the energetics of the faulting process. From the perspective of gravitational tectonics, the gravity collapse mechanism is direct and simple. The related mechanics are more subtle. If gravity is not deliberately and explicitly included in an earthquake model, then <b>gravity</b> is <b>locked</b> out of the energetics of the model. The earthquake model (but not necessarily the physical reality) is then elastic rebound...|$|R
6000|$|The {{little girl}} {{offered me a}} chair, and then lingered a moment, as if she felt some {{disposition}} to entertain me if she could only {{think of something to}} say; and at last, looking up in my face, she said, in a confidential tone, [...] "Mother says she left Willie and me to keep house this afternoon while she was gone, and we are putting up all the things for Sunday, so as to get every thing done before she comes home. Willie has gone to put away the playthings, and I'm going to put up the books." [...] So saying, she opened the doors of one of the bookcases, and began busily carrying the books from the centre table to deposit them on the shelves, in which employment she was soon assisted by Willie, who took the matter in hand in a very masterly manner, showing his sister what were and what were not [...] "Sunday books" [...] with the air of a person entirely at home in the business. Robinson Crusoe and the many-volumed Peter Parley were put by without hesitation; there was, however, a short demurring over a North American Review, because Willie said he was sure his father read something one Sunday out of one of them, while Susan averred that he did not commonly read in it, and only read in it then because the piece was something about the Bible; but as nothing could be settled definitively on the point, the review was [...] "laid on the table," [...] like knotty questions in Congress. Then followed a long discussion over an extract book, which, as usual, contained all sorts, both sacred, serious, comic, and profane; and at last Willie, with much <b>gravity,</b> decided to <b>lock</b> it up, on the principle that it was best {{to be on the safe}} side, in support of which he appealed to me. I was saved from deciding the question by the entrance of the father and mother. My old friend knew me at once, and presented his pretty wife to me with the same look of exultation with which he used to hold up a string of trout or an uncommonly fine perch of his own catching for my admiration, and then looking round on his fine family of children, two more of which he had brought home with him, seemed to say to me, [...] "There! what do you think of that, now?" ...|$|R
40|$|Lovelock {{theory is}} the natural {{extension}} of General Relativity to higher di- mensions and can also {{be thought of as}} a toy model for ghost-free higher curvature gravity. These gravity theories capture some of the de ning fea- tures of higher curvature gravities, namely the existence of more than one (A) dS vacuum and an intricate dynamics, more general black hole solutions and instabilities; while avoiding some of their problems. In particular, Love- <b>lock</b> <b>gravities</b> yield second order eld equations so that they can be considered beyond the perturbative regime and are free of higher derivative ghosts. This provides an appealing arena to explore di erent gravitational and holographic aspects of higher curvature gravity. Most of the vacua of the theory support black holes that display inter- esting features. Besides, black holes with maximally symmetric horizons are subject to a version of Birkho 's theorem and their solutions can be found analytically. Most e orts in the literature have been devoted however to one particular branch of solutions, often restricted to a speci c combination of the Lovelock couplings. The branch usually chosen for the analysis is the so- called EH-branch, as it actually reduces to the general relativistic solution as we turn o the higher order couplings. In this thesis we have presented some tools that allow for the description of Lovelock black holes for arbitrary values of the whole set of couplings, dimensionality and order of the theory. Despite the fact of the solution being implicit, it is possible to extract most relevant information and discuss all possible cases in the general situation, analyze the number of horizons, the thermodynamic stability of the solution, phase transitions, etc. Furthermore, this approach has been generalized to the case of charged and cosmological solutions, and also to the so called quasi-topological gravities, that share the same functional form of the black hole solutions with the Lovelock family while being lower dimensional. Our method is very useful to gain intuition about physical processes in- volving black holes. One can easily visualize the evolution of the position and number of horizons as the mass of the solution varies, this providing crucial information about, for instance, the possible appearance of naked singulari- ties or the violation of the third law of thermodynamics. We have seen that the rigid symmetry imposed on the solution naively allows such problematic behavior which is avoided once the stability of the solution is taken into full consideration...|$|R
