During the last four years, RAVEM systems have been applied to measure pollutant emissions {{from a wide variety of}} mobile sources, ranging from transit buses in Mexico City 1 to ferryboats on San Francisco Bay 2. They have also been applied to the evaluation of emission control systems including selective catalytic reduction, diesel particulate filters, diesel oxidation catalysts, natural gas and LPG engines, and <b>emulsion</b> <b>fuels.</b> Principles of Operation The RAVEM system is described in two published papers 3, 4, so its operating principles are summarized only briefly here.

The number 6 oil had a sulfur content greater {{than one percent}} and experiments were conducted to remove the sulfur dioxide from the stack gases. Test findings include: (1) emulsion effected a reduction in soot at a low excess air levels; (2) a steam atomizing system will produce a water/oil <b>emulsion.</b> The <b>fuel</b> {{in the study was}} emulsified in the steam atomization process, hence, pre-emulsification did not yield a dramatic reduction in soot or an increase in thermal efficiency...|$|R

Whether the mine {{is on the}} surface or is buried underground, the detonation or deflagration of either a high or low explosive in a confined space {{can be used to}} liberate a fairly specific sub-volume of a brittle material in a much larger volume of the same or similar material. The mining industry tends to use nitrate-based explosives such as <b>emulsions</b> of <b>fuel</b> oil and ammonium nitrate solutions, mixtures of ammonium nitrate prills (fertilizer pellets) and fuel oil (ANFO) and gelatinous suspensions or slurries of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuels.|$|R

However, water emulsion of biodiesel was not properly explored in diesel engine. In this work, the effect of water concentration in palm oil diesel emulsions (POD) [POD is palm oil Methyl ester] on exhaust emissions of a four-cylinder diesel engine was investigated.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of NO/SO 2 on the emissions of N 2 O from diesel engine. A direct-injection diesel engine (model NF- 19 SK YANMAR) one cylinder was employed to test the emission. This engine works on four-stroke cycle and was operated at 2200 rpm by 25, 50, and 75 % engine load. The experiment by three level sulfur content of fuel by adding DBDS into MDO and experiment by <b>emulsion</b> <b>fuel</b> (90 % Heavy Liquid Fuel + 10 % Water) were conducted in the present work. The result shows that apart from homogeneous interaction between NO, SO 2, and N 2 O emissions, the temperature of exhaust gas has significant effect on N 2 O formation. Interaction fuel S through reaction N + SO → NO + S and NO + O 2 = NO 3 then NO 3 + SO 2 = NO 2 + SO 3 as would lead to increase in Nitrogen dioxide and Sulfur dioxide concentration. Furthermore in case of <b>emulsion</b> <b>fuel,</b> the correlation between fuel NO and N 2 O exhaust emissions was measured...|$|E

40|$|Emulsion is {{a mixture}} of two {{immiscible}} substances. For the emulsion, we have two types which are Oil-in water emulsions (O/W) and Water –in-oil <b>emulsions</b> (W/O). Diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>emulsions</b> are blended mixtures of diesel fuel, water, emulsifying agents and other additives, that reduce particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions, {{as a result of the}} added water. Addition of water to the emulsified fuel also reduces the energy content of the fuel, with corresponding reductions in fuel economy and engine power. Emulsified diesel fuel has been the subject of several studies, and for comparative purposes in several others. This emulsified diesel fuel is a combination of diesel fuel with 20 % water by weight, and an "additive package" for stabilizing the fuel-water emulsion. To mixed diesel with water we should add surfactants. The surfactants that we used are Sorbitan monoolate, NF,(Span 80), Polysorbate 60,NF,(Tween 60), Polysorbate 80,NF,(Tween 80), Triton X- 100. The components required for making emulsion are mechanical agitator, diesel, distillated water,surfactants, burette, and pipette...|$|R
