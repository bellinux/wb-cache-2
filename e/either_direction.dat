5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

5|$|The current bridge along Grand Avenue {{over the}} Colorado River and I-70 {{just east of}} the highway's western {{terminus}} dates to 1953. It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then has added a second lane in <b>either</b> <b>direction.</b> By the early 21st century it, like the Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it had ever been expected to and was in poor structural condition.|$|E

5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all platforms, as do displays {{on each of the}} platforms. All platforms are signalled for trains in <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station. Platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the platforms).|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Defender {{established}} scrolling in shoot 'em ups, offering horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later {{games in}} the genre, the player could move in <b>either</b> <b>direction.</b> The game's use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen, and though the game's minimap feature had been introduced before, Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Konami's Scramble, released in 1981, is a side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels. Atari's Tempest, released in 1981, {{is one of the}} earliest tube shooters and an early attempt to incorporate a 3D perspective into shooter games. Tempest ultimately went on to influence major rail shooters.|$|E
5|$|M-123 is {{designated}} as a Scenic Heritage Route north of M-28. Here it continues northwest to East–West Road and turns to run along the shores of Whitefish Bay and cross the Tahquamenon River near its mouth. Continuing along the bay as Whitefish Road, M-123 meets the community of Paradise, the northernmost point along the highway. It is here that M-123 intersects Whitefish Point Road, which continues north to Whitefish Point, home of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. In <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> M-123 runs southbound from Paradise, changing direction. Continuing east of Paradise, M-123 is the only paved road that serves the Tahquamenon Falls State Park and the Whitefish Point region.|$|E
5|$|The Mersea Week is {{a week-long}} August festival of boat racing {{organised}} by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat {{classes in the}} Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist dinghies to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where dinghies attempt to sail round the island in <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a greasy pole rigged {{over the side of}} the hosting Thames sailing barge.|$|E
50|$|Jogging {{and running}} are popular among the middle-aged and elder ones. Most of them jog or run {{early in the}} morning or in the evening along a public {{footpath}} surrounding the Guia Hill in the Macau Peninsula, which is well-known among the locals because of its ideal nature for running or jogging - no vehicle traffic, path surrounded by trees and bushes, loop-path, tarmac paving, path wide enough for <b>either</b> <b>directions.</b> Sometimes local running competitions are held up there.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} boundary stabilization of 3 × 3 linear first-order hyperbolic systems with one positive and two negative transport speeds by using backstepping. The main result of the paper is to supplement the previous works on how to choose multi-boundary feedback inputs applied on the states corresponding to the negative velocities to obtain finite-time stabilization of the original system in the spatial L 2 sense. Our method is still valid for boundary stabilization of general n × n hyperbolic system with arbitrary numbers of states traveling in <b>either</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R

5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely sealed {{in the fashion}} of {{the border between the}} two Koreas and could be crossed in <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> {{throughout}} the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The result {{confirmed}} the worries of some, including Spaak, {{that the vote}} would not be sufficiently decisive in <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold {{announced that he was}} willing to temporarily delegate his authority. Many within the PSC–CVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around the King as long as their Liberal coalition partners and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
