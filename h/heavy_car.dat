5|$|Massa made a {{pit stop}} on lap53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He {{subsequently}} set the fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able {{to close the gap}} on Räikkönen to under a second, before losing time by running wide at turn five on lap60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap65, Massa drafted down the straight and attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by driving to the right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn one, to take eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. Räikkönen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a <b>heavy</b> <b>car</b> and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th. Barrichello and Button took the next two positions; both drivers blamed their Honda cars for their uncompetitive performance at the Fuji circuit. Nakajima finished last, in 15th, unable to recover after his forced pit-stop early in the race.|$|E

25|$|Gothenburg, Sweden has a tram {{roundabout}} and tram stop at Korsvägen (the Crossroad).

Another one is located at Mariaplan in the inner suburb of Majorna. The trams makes a right turn, giving the roundabout an odd design.|$|E

25|$|The {{city council}} of Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen and the CSU faction {{in the town}} council of Karlsfeld {{proposed}} the above-ground extension of the U2 from Feldmoching to Karlsfeld as a measure to relieve the municipality of the <b>heavy</b> <b>car</b> traffic. Moreover, this should provide a greater incentive for the employees of the large companies MAN and MTU to use public transport for their work. After initial investigations had shown a low cost-benefit ratio for this route, it was not cost-effective and was abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|Brakes were {{hydraulically-operated}} [...] drums, {{which were}} generally considered the Toronado's weak link.

2500|$|The sixth {{generation}} Thunderbird {{debuted in}} the fall of 1971 as a 1972 model. With a [...] wheelbase, an overall length of [...] (growing to [...] by 1974), and a curb weight of [...] (over [...] when equipped with a [...] V8), it was the largest Thunderbird ever produced by Ford, sharing the body and frame of the Lincoln Mark IV. Matching the large size of the car were large engines, including a standard [...] V8 and an optional [...] V8 (standard after 1973). Though offering two of the largest displacement V8 engines ever installed in a production vehicle by Ford, the car's considerable weight combined with low horsepower output caused by restrictive emissions technology resulted in modest performance. As might also be expected from installing a large displacement V8 in a <b>heavy</b> <b>car,</b> fuel efficiency was poor. The big Thunderbirds were popular with sales peaking at over 87,000 units in 1973 in spite of the 1973 oil crisis, but sales had slumped to less than 43,000 by 1975. Finishing off the generation, sales saw an uptick to almost 53,000 units for 1976. Acknowledging increasing fuel prices and more stringent federal emissions standards, a new, down-sized Thunderbird would appear for 1977.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Panhard 24 {{had a new}} modern body, {{the engine}} was an old friend. The {{two-cylinder}} air-cooled boxer motor of 848 cc, harked back to the 850 cc engine that had {{first appeared in the}} Panhard Dyna X in 1952 (itself an enlarged version of Panhard's 610 cc boxer motor first seen in 1947). By 1954 when [...] they appeared in the then newly announced Dyna Z these engines had been developed {{to the point where they}} produced a claimed output of [...] or , according to version, and it was with these two output levels that the engine soldiered on in both the PL 17 and, subsequently, in the 24. The engines were compact and efficient, but they had originally been developed for aluminium bodied cars: [...] by the 1960s it was no longer economically practical to construct cars in this price bracket out of aluminium, and while the Panhard 24 was not a <b>heavy</b> <b>car,</b> it was heavier than earlier Panhard saloons. At the same time, the competition had not been standing still. The claimed maximum speed ranged from 135km/h (84mph) for the long-wheelbase [...] Panhard 24 to 150 for the short-wheelbase [...] version. A slightly faster Tiger 10 S-engined version was reportedly capable of 160km/h (100mph). The 24's performance was adequate, but probably fell short of the expectations triggered by the car's sporty profile. And power delivery from an air-cooled flat two-cylinder engine did not sound as effortless as from the four-cylinder water-cooled power units on which the European auto industry by this time was increasingly standardising for the middle market. It has also been suggested that engine reliability suffered because many of the younger generation of car mechanics were not fully familiar with all the eccentricities of the Panhard power plants.|$|E
