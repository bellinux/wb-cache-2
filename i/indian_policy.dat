5|$|Interior Secretary Carl Schurz {{carried out}} Hayes's American <b>Indian</b> <b>policy,</b> {{beginning}} with preventing the War Department from {{taking over the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hayes and Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture, educational training, and dividing Indian land into individual household allotments. Hayes believed that his policies would lead to self-sufficiency and peace between Indians and whites. The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators. Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations.|$|E

25|$|As Canadian {{ideas of}} {{progress}} evolved around {{the start of}} the 20th century, the federal <b>Indian</b> <b>policy</b> was directed at removing Indigenous people from their communal lands and encouraging assimilation. Amendments to the Indian Act in 1905 and 1911 made it easier for the government to expropriate reserve lands from First Nations. The government sold nearly half of the Blackfoot reserve in Alberta to settlers.|$|E

25|$|Collier {{believed}} that the general allotments of Indian Reservation land was a complete failure {{that led to the}} increasing loss of Native American land. He emerged as a federal <b>Indian</b> <b>policy</b> reformer in 1922, and strongly criticized the BIA policies and implementation of the Dawes Act. Prior to Collier, criticism of BIA had been directed at corrupt and incompetent officials rather than the policies. For the next decade, Collier fought against legislation and policies that were detrimental to the well-being of Native Americans and was associated with the American Indian Defense Association, serving as executive secretary until 1933.|$|E

25|$|The French and Indian War, the North American {{theater of}} the Seven Years' War, {{effectively}} ended in 1760 with the British conquest of New France. Indian allies of the defeated French soon became dissatisfied with the trading practices of the victorious British. General Jeffrey Amherst, the architect of British <b>Indian</b> <b>policy,</b> {{cut back on the}} provisions that the French had customarily given to the Indians, which he considered to be bribes. He also restricted the distribution of gunpowder and ammunition, supplies that the Indians needed for hunting and which had previously been provided by the French. Some Indian people believed that the British intended to subjugate or destroy them.|$|E
25|$|Co-existence {{was part}} of Johnson's other major {{historical}} legacy: the protection of British sovereignty and Anglo-American settlement as a bulwark against French control of northern New York State and the Great Lakes region more generally. Johnson was instrumental in sustaining British-Iroquois alliance through the Covenant Chain, which consolidated both Iroquois and British territorial and commercial interests against the rival Algonquin and French interests in New France before 1763. After Britain assumed control, Johnson eventually won a political dispute over <b>Indian</b> <b>policy</b> with Lord Jeffrey Amherst, who disdained the Iroquois alliance Johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending. It was to Johnson that Pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him.|$|E
25|$|Houston's <b>Indian</b> <b>policy</b> was to disband {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the regular Army troops, but muster four new companies of Rangers to patrol the frontier. Houston ordered the Rangers to protect the Indian lands from encroachment by settlers and illegal traders. Houston wanted to do away with the cycle of rage and revenge that had spiraled out of control under Lamar. Under Houston's policies, Texas Rangers were authorized to punish severely any infractions by the Indians, but they were never to initiate such conflict. When depredations occurred to either side, the troops were ordered to find and punish the actual perpetrators, rather than retaliating against innocent Indians simply because they were Indians.|$|E
40|$|THIS is {{the most}} {{important}} history ever published about the formulation of federal <b>Indian</b> <b>policies</b> in the United States. Drawing information from reliable sources, it surveys main themes and developments from early colonial years to the present. Where published materials permit, it describes policies designed for particular states and regions — espe-cially those in the trans-Mississippi West. It traces the course of cultural imperialism — called ""civilization for Indians " by policymakers. It deals adequately with treaties and unilat-eral "agreements " as vehicles for government-tribal relations. It monitors federal withdraw^al from responsibility for In-dian needs — which in recent years is labeled "Indian Self-Determination. " This two-volume work contains some infor-mation about every major theme in the formulation of fed-eral <b>Indian</b> <b>policies</b> throughout American history...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of contemporary <b>Indian</b> foreign <b>policy</b> {{from the vantage point}} of India’s recent engagements in the Arctic. By analysing what is argued to be an ‘Indian Arctic discourse’ that emerged between India’s first expedition to Svalbard in 2007 and the following accession to observer status in the Arctic Council in 2013, this thesis explores how this discourse frames the Arctic within a broader <b>Indian</b> foreign <b>policy</b> perspective. The <b>Indian</b> Arctic discourse establishes India as a stakeholder in the Arctic and envisages India as playing an active role in Arctic affairs. Studying this discourse unveils central principles and themes in <b>Indian</b> foreign <b>policy,</b> and offers new perspectives on contemporary <b>Indian</b> foreign <b>policy.</b> This is the first study to use soft power theory to discuss how the Indian Arctic discourse views India as an emerging power on the global stage and how India pursues its interests internationally, and in the Arctic region in particular. As this thesis shows, soft power has increasingly become a part of contemporary <b>Indian</b> foreign <b>policy,</b> both in official policy and in the academic discourse...|$|R

25|$|Public shock {{following}} the incident resulted in reassessment of the government's <b>Indian</b> <b>policy,</b> and a U.S. Peace Commission toured the Great Plains in 1867 {{to gather information}} to help bring about peace among the tribes and with the U.S. The Commission concluded Native Americans had been provoked by white encroachment and competition for resources and recommended assigning definite territories to the Great Plains tribes. In late summer 1867, the U.S. government changed its policy and {{decided to use the}} First Transcontinental Railroad to transport immigrants. The government decided that a military presence in the Powder River Country was too expensive and unproductive and agreed to abandon its forts and withdraw completely from Lakota territory.|$|E
25|$|To reiterate, Creelman and Turner, {{with equal}} vigor {{and scope of}} investigation, depict very {{different}} regimes; respectively, one progressive and the other oppressive. In spite of their strong commitment to their reporting, both journalists rarely mention the científicos. Regardless, these first-hand accounts reveal two foreigners’ perceptions of how <b>Indian</b> <b>policy</b> {{was carried out in}} the whole of Mexico, even if they were unaware of {{the inner workings of the}} regime. On the one hand, Creelman stresses the necessity of the Porfiriato’s harshness with which Indians continued to be subjugated and socially marginalized, as was suggested by Limantour, Bulnes, and Cosmes. This treatment, to Creelman, was a justified measure so that Mexico could be modernized. Turner, on the other hand, sees no benefit to such dehumanizing treatment when nearly one half of Mexico’s population is not profiting from the economic progress, but rather, they are suffering from it, even more than they had suffered under previous governments. This, for Turner, was the opposite of modernization. Despite their opposing interpretations of Díaz ’s regime, Creelman and Turner ultimately expose any pretense of a fair and just government as perpetrated by the científicos and Díaz through positivist doctrine. It is this last point that serves as the link to Díaz’s own perceptions and actions—or lack thereof—towards Mexico’s Indians.|$|E
