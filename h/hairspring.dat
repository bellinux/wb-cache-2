The Oyster Perpetual Date 34 (or simply Date 34) adds a date display and date movement, plus the options of a white gold fluted bezel and diamonds on the dial.|$|E

50|$|The Petrodvorets Watch Factory Raketa, {{is one of}} {{only five}} watch brands in the world {{producing}} their movements in-house from start to finish, including <b>hairsprings</b> and escapements. Most watch brands globally do not produce their own <b>hairsprings,</b> they generally order them from Nivarox, a subsidiary of Swatch Group. This enables the Russian military industry to be independent from western suppliers, especially for producing <b>hairsprings</b> needed in the military aviation industry.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{manufacture}} in the Swiss watch making industry refers to any firm {{that at least}} designs calibres, produces the movements parts thereof called ébauches, and assembles them into watches.

25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one <b>hairspring</b> (type of valve spring) to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
500|$|In 1675, Huygens and Robert Hooke {{invented the}} spiral balance, or the <b>hairspring,</b> {{designed}} {{to control the}} oscillating speed of the balance wheel. This crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible. [...] This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10minutes per day, similar {{to the effect of}} the pendulum upon mechanical clocks. The great English clockmaker, Thomas Tompion, {{was one of the first}} to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.|$|E
500|$|The duel {{began at}} dawn on July 11, 1804, {{along the west}} bank of the Hudson River on a rocky ledge in Weehawken, New Jersey. Coincidentally, the duel took place {{relatively}} close to the location of the duel that ended the life of Hamilton's eldest son, Philip, three years earlier. After the seconds measured the paces, Hamilton, according to both William P. Van Ness and Burr, raised his pistol [...] "as if to try the light" [...] and had to wear his spectacles to prevent his vision from being obscured. Hamilton also refused the <b>hairspring</b> set of dueling pistols (that would make the pulling of the trigger lighter) offered by Nathaniel Pendleton.|$|E
50|$|Gravity {{comes into}} play on the {{remaining}} effects. One of them is easily taken away, namely heavy points on the balance wheel. This leaves pinning point and terminal curve. Both of these add a lot of variation to the regulation of a watch; assembly, regulation adjustments by the watchmaker, positioning in the watch, and later position changes by the owner. As the balance wheel goes from one extreme position to the other in its swing back and forth, the <b>hairspring's</b> coils extend and contract a great deal, leading to problems that are extremely hard to counteract. Some have tried using <b>hairsprings</b> that are cylindrical or even spherical instead of flat as is prominent today. Some variations of Breguet's overcoil {{have been developed to}} counteract the effects of the terminal curve. As for the pinning point, Grossmann, Berthoud, Breguet, Caspari and Leroy tried many different possibilities, but not much improvement was gained.|$|R

2500|$|In 1660, Hooke {{discovered}} {{the law of}} elasticity which bears his name and which describes the linear variation of tension with extension in an elastic spring. [...] He first described this discovery in the anagram [...] "ceiiinosssttuv", whose solution he published in 1678 as [...] "Ut tensio, sic vis" [...] meaning [...] "As the extension, so the force." [...] Hooke's work on elasticity culminated, for practical purposes, in his development of the balance spring or <b>hairspring,</b> which {{for the first time}} enabled a portable timepiece– a watch– to keep time with reasonable accuracy. [...] A bitter dispute between Hooke and Christiaan Huygens on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both; but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the Hooke Folio (see External links below), describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, has been held to favour Hooke's claim.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{models from}} the Date and Datejust are almost identical, however the Datejust have 36mm and 41mm cases {{paired with a}} 20mm bracelet, {{compared}} to the Date's 34mm case and 19mm bracelet. Modern versions of the Oyster Perpetual Date and Datejust models share Rolex's 3135 movement, with the most recent change to the 3135 movement being the introduction of Rolex's [...] "parachrom bleu" [...] <b>hairspring,</b> which provides increased accuracy. As the Date and Datejust share a movement, both {{have the ability to}} adjust the date forward {{one day at a time}} without adjusting the time; this feature is not confined to the Datejust. Compared to the Date, the Datejust has a much wider range of customization options, including other metals beyond stainless steel, various materials for the dial, and optional diamonds on the dial and bezel. The Datejust II, which was released in 2009, has a bigger case (41mm diameter) than the standard Datejust and it also features an updated movement, being only available in steel with white, yellow or rose gold on an Oyster bracelet. In 2016, Rolex released the Datejust 41, which has the same 41mm diameter case as the Datejust II, however the Datejust 41 has smaller indexes and a thinner bezel compared to the Datejust II.|$|E
5000|$|When {{used for}} {{critical}} watch components, the alloy reduces errors due to temperature variation. <b>Hairsprings</b> made of this alloy have a spring constant {{which does not}} vary with temperature, allowing the watch's balance wheel, its timekeeping element, to keep better time.

5000|$|The first way {{consists}} {{of making the}} moving parts of alloys chosen to be insensitive to magnetic fields. These alloys include Invar (iron-nickel-carbon-chromium alloy), Glucydur (beryllium-bronze alloy), Nivarox (iron-nickel-chromium-titanium-beryllium alloy) and Elinvar (an alloy similar to Invar, though less resistant to magnetism and more resistant to thermal influence). These alloys are preferred by different watchmakers due to their differing properties. Since the 1950s, Nivarox and Glucydur were extensively used by watchmakers. In the 1960s, almost all Swiss watches had Glucydur balance and Nivarox <b>hairsprings.</b> The anchors, escape wheels and other watch mechanisms were also made of non-magnetic metals or alloys.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{a debate}} among watch enthusiasts {{as to whether the}} COSC {{chronometer}} certification for a Swiss watch is a meaningful test or a simple marketing gimmick.

5000|$|As a trade name, Nivarox is a German {{acronym for}} [...] "Nicht variabel oxydfest" [...] (G.) or [...] "Non-Variable Non-Oxidizing" [...] (E.).

5000|$|The first ohmmeters {{were based}} on a type of meter {{movement}} known as a 'ratiometer'. [...] These were similar to the galvanometer type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of <b>hairsprings</b> to supply a restoring force they used conducting 'ligaments'. These provided no net rotational force to the movement. Also, the movement was wound with two coils. One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply. The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test. The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils. This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test. The advantages of this arrangement were twofold. First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no zero adjustment was required. Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the full deflection range. By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided. This scale was reversed compared to the first. A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement). Ohmmeters of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a multimeter design. Insulation testers that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle. This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.|$|R
50|$|Early watches used a {{solid steel}} balance. As {{temperature}} increased, the solid balance expanded in size, changing {{the moment of}} inertia and changing {{the timing of the}} watch. In addition, the <b>hairspring</b> would lengthen, decreasing its spring constant. This problem was initially solved through the use of the compensation balance. The compensation balance consisted of a ring of steel sandwiched to a ring of brass. These rings were then split in two places. The balance would, at least theoretically, actually decrease in size with heating to compensate for the lengthening of the <b>hairspring.</b> Through careful adjustment of the placement of the balance screws (brass or gold screws placed in the rim of the balance), a watch could be adjusted to keep time the same at both hot (100 °F) and cold (32°) temperatures. Unfortunately, a watch so adjusted would run slow at temperatures between these two. The problem was completely solved through the use of special alloys for the balance and <b>hairspring</b> which were essentially immune to thermal expansion. Such an alloy is used in Hamilton's 992E and 992B.|$|E
5000|$|In general practice, {{the most}} common method of {{achieving}} isochronism is {{through the use of}} the Breguet overcoil, which places part of the outermost turn of the <b>hairspring</b> in a different plane {{from the rest of the}} spring. This allows the <b>hairspring</b> to [...] "breathe" [...] more evenly and symmetrically. Two types of overcoils are found - the gradual overcoil and the Z-Bend. The gradual overcoil is obtained by imposing two gradual twists to the <b>hairspring,</b> forming the rise to the second plane over half the circumference. The Z-bend does this by imposing two kinks of complementary 45 degree angles, accomplishing a rise to the second plane in about three spring section heights. The second method is done for aesthetic reasons and is much more difficult to perform. Due to the difficulty with forming an overcoil, modern watches often use a slightly less effective [...] "dogleg", which uses a series of sharp bends (in plane) to place part of the outermost coil out of the way of the rest of the spring.|$|E
