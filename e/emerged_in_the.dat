5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly {{attributed to the}} wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E

5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in what remained of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{consolidating}} Stalin's {{control over}} the Eastern Bloc, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beriya, supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc {{that were supposed to}} crush anti-communist resistance. When the slightest stirrings of independence <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.|$|E

5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is {{progressive}} metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{in the early}} and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E

These new promotions also brought back televised wrestling, which had been absent since the days of Rickard's On the Mat, with the debut of IPW Ignition and KPW's Off the Ropes.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, an Anti-Brahmin {{movement}} <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Madras Presidency. It {{was launched}} by E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker who, {{unhappy with the}} principles and policies of the Brahmin leadership of the provincial Congress, left the party to form the Self-Respect Movement. Periyar, as he was alternatively known, criticised Brahmins, Hinduism, and Hindu superstitions in periodicals and newspapers such as Viduthalai and Justice. He also participated in the Vaikom satyagraha, which campaigned for the right of untouchables in Travancore to enter temples.|$|E
5|$|Greek-style homes {{gave way}} to Gothic Revival in the 1830s, which {{emphasized}} pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. Italianate elements <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1840s including cupolas, verandas, ornamental brickwork, or corner quoins. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, Korea saw {{substantial}} industrial development, {{much of it}} {{centered in}} the Yeongnam region of which Gyeongju is a part. The POSCO steel mill in neighboring Pohang commenced operations in 1973, and the chemical manufacturing complex in Ulsan <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year. These developments helped to support the emergence of Gyeongju's manufacturing sector.|$|E
5|$|Instrument {{builders}} developed {{other features}} that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early fifteenth century. These stops {{were meant to}} produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time. Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes to properly blend into chamber music.|$|E
5|$|Loitering weapons first <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s {{for use in}} the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield systems that fit in a backpack.|$|E

5|$|Milton Friedman {{developed}} {{an alternative to}} Keynesian macroeconomics eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism {{is the idea that}} the supply of money matters for the macroeconomy. When monetarism <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the business cycle, and monetarism directly challenged those points.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds (also {{known as}} marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment. While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, {{behaviour}} and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, {{as the same}} environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Paleogene.|$|E
