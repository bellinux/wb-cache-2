40|$|In {{this study}} we propose {{statistical}} models to model the indexing of textual documents by human indexers in a hypertext environment. Previous research revealed that hypertext links connecting text indexed with the same subject <b>index</b> <b>term</b> assigned by a human indexer offer users {{an effective way to}} access information due to the structure, focus, and imbedded intelligence of a manually assigned subject index. We propose that for a document collection with an existing well developed subject index, the contingent relationship between subject <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> and words in the text can be used by a Bayesian inference rule in predicting which subject <b>index</b> <b>term</b> is relevant given the words occurring in a document. It was hypothesized that the indexing models (1) will be able to predict what <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> a human indexer will use, (2) serve as decision aids, and (3) will help users in information retrieval tasks. This problem area is approached by (1) direct comparison between the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> assigned by the indexing models and those assigned by a human indexer The overlap between the two sets of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> was measured by the proportion of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> in the intersection for each set. (2) expert ratings on the relevance of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> assigned by different means. The ratings as well as the quality of an <b>index</b> <b>term</b> (determined by the magnitude of the rating) were statistically analyzed. Potential errors made by the human indexer and the indexing models were estimated. (3) a controlled laboratory experiment in which users 2 ̆ 7 performance in information retrieval tasks using different indices was evaluated. Results obtained revealed that (1) a significant overlap exists between the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> assigned by the indexing models and those by a human indexer, (2) <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> suggested by the indexing models received significantly higher ratings than <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> randomly selected and the estimated number of errors made by the indexing models and the human indexer were similar, and (3) users performed better or equally well in information retrieval tasks using the subject index assigned by the indexing models than when using the index prepared by the human indexer. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the problems and}} the methods of finding relevant information in large collections of documents. The contribution of this thesis to this problem is to develop better content analysis methods {{which can be used}} to describe document content with <b>index</b> <b>terms.</b> <b>Index</b> <b>terms</b> can be used as meta-information that describes documents, and that is used for seeking information. The main point of this thesis is to illustrate the process of developing an automatic indexer which analyses the content of documents by combining evidence from word frequencies and evidence from linguistic analysis provided by a syntactic parser. The indexer weights the expressions of a text according to their estimated importance for describing the content of a given document {{on the basis of the}} content analysis. The typical linguistic features of <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> were explored using a linguistically analysed text collection where the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> are manually marked up. This text collection is referred to as an <b>index</b> <b>term</b> corpus. Specific features of the <b>index</b> <b>terms</b> provided the basis for a linguistic term-weighting scheme, which was then combined with a frequency-based term-weighting scheme. The use of an <b>index</b> <b>term</b> corpus like this as training material is a new method of developing an automatic indexer. The results of the experiments were promising...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{would expect}} {{information}} on adverse drug reactions in randomised clinical trials {{to be easily}} retrievable from specific searches of electronic databases. However, complete retrieval of such information may not be straightforward, for two reasons. First, not all clinical drug trials provide data on the frequency of adverse effects. Secondly, not all electronic records of trials include terms in the abstract or indexing fields that enable us to select those with adverse effects data. We have determined how often automated search methods, using <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> and/or textwords in the title or abstract, would fail to retrieve trials with adverse effects data. Methods We used a sample set of 107 trials known to report frequencies of adverse drug effects, and measured the proportion that (i) were not assigned the appropriate adverse effects <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> in the electronic databases, and (ii) did not contain identifiable adverse effects textwords in the title or abstract. Results Of the 81 trials with records on both MEDLINE and EMBASE, 25 were not indexed for adverse effects in either database. Twenty-six trials were indexed in one database but not the other. Only 66 of the 107 trials reporting adverse effects data mentioned this in the abstract or title of the paper. Simultaneous use of textword and <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> retrieved only 82 / 107 (77 %) papers. Conclusions Specific search strategies based on adverse effects textwords and <b>indexing</b> <b>terms</b> will fail to identify {{nearly a quarter of}} trials that report on the rate of drug adverse effects. </p...|$|E
