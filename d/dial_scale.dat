5000|$|In November 1957 {{the first}} of several {{transistorized}} Trans-Oceanics was introduced, the Royal 1000. As had always been the case, Commander E. McDonald helped {{in the design of the}} 1000. This was to be his last endeavor in the Trans-Oceanic radio, passing away soon after its introduction. The Royal 1000 had exactly the same frequency coverage as the A/B 600 series tube Trans-Oceanics with the addition of the 13/meter band. The new Royal 1000 also sported an all-metal cabinet design with the front cover opening to the down position. The log chart was located inside the flip-down door. Very early Royal 1000s sported a genuine leather covering marked as such. Another first for [...] radios was the unique <b>dial</b> <b>scale</b> used in the 1000 and later series of Trans-Oceanics. The 1000 was designed with a cylinder <b>dial</b> <b>scale</b> that would rotate with the band switch allowing only that particular band scale to show.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{continuous}} measurement of surgical blood loss has been devised {{and has been}} used clinically in some 400 cases. The method combines volumetric measure of the suction loss and gravimetric measure of the sponge loss. The volumetric device automatically deducts the volume of rinse water used and thus measures the amount of blood collected in a metering cylinder. The suction loss scale shows continuously the amount {{of blood in the}} metering cylinder. The gravimetric device requires counting sponges into the weighing pan, and turning a <b>dial</b> <b>scale</b> to deduct the initial weight of the sponges. The volume of blood in the sponges is then read directly on the <b>dial</b> <b>scale.</b> Use of the instrument, which is {{under the supervision of the}} anesthesiologist, adds about two minutes per hour to the time normally required for counting the sponges; and about three minutes per hour is required for tending the volumetric instrument...|$|E

This retrospective, comparative case series study aimed to analyze the rotational deviation, or cyclotorsion, of three corneal marking methods: VERION digital marker (VDM; reference), horizontal slit beam marking (HSBM), and subjective direct visual marking (SDVM) on the table (using a bevel knife tip). Subjects included 81 eyes of 61 patients (mean age: 65. 70 ± 13. 14 years; range: 32 – 91 years) undergoing scheduled cataract surgery. A preoperative reference image was taken of each eye. Subsequently, a slit lamp with the light beam turned to the horizontal meridian was used to align the seated patient’s head, and two reference marks were placed at the 3 - and 9 -o’clock positions of the corneal limbus using a 27 -gauge needle and marking pen (HSBM). Upon transfer to the surgical table, the VDM was used to display a real-time <b>dial</b> <b>scale</b> on the patient’s eye, with {{the entrance of the}} temporal clear corneal incision (CCI) at 0 ° (horizontal meridian). Simultaneously, a bevel knife tip was used to create a marker based on the surgeon’s visual determination of the temporal 0 ° point (SDVM). We used the VDM to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of axis alignment via deviation from the horizontal reference meridian. Compared with the reference meridian, the SDVM (– 3. 46 °± 7. 32 °, range: – 18 ° to 13 °) exhibited greater average relative cyclotorsion versus the HSBM (0. 41 °± 4. 92 °, range: – 10 ° to 10 °). Furthermore, the mean average misalignment was significantly less in the HSBM group versus the SDVM group (t= 4. 179, P< 0. 001). The VDM is likely a reliable marking method, similar to the HSBM. In contrast, the SDVM is not entirely reliable. The VDM usage may prevent inaccurate preoperative manual marking during toric IOL implantation.

It was however George Serles 1657 book, Dialling Universal, printed by R & W Leybourn that brought them to popular attention. These scales remained virtually unchanged for 250 years. E. C. Middleton, who had been engraving <b>dialling</b> <b>scales</b> from about 1895, supplied <b>dialling</b> <b>scales</b> accompanied by a typewritten instruction book from Birmingham in 1913- these were the scales calculated by Serle. The North American Sundial Society has printed facsimiles of both the Serle and Middleton books.The Middleton dial appeared without explanation in the 1994 Encyclopedia de Diderot et Alembert (French). Further work has done on these rulers by F.W. Cousins, and by Fred W Sawyer from 1997-2009.|$|R

5000|$|Sight setter : [...] Operates {{the sight}} setting equipment. In single mounts, he stands {{just behind the}} trainer (See the man with {{headphones}} in the Mk21 open mount picture), while in twin mounts he sits between the guns, just forward of the projectile hoists. The sight setter moves the sights' reticles relative to the barrel's axis. In early open mounts, this was done by moving the platforms to which the sights were bolted. Sights in enclosed mounts have movable prisms in their optical paths. [...] The sight setter has three dials, and two hand cranks. (pictured) The two right dials and right hand crank control the elevation reticle offset (called Sight Angle). The upper right <b>dial</b> is <b>scaled</b> in minutes of arc, and the lower right dial is in yards. The left dial and hand crank control the reticle's left and right offset (called Sight Deflection), and the <b>dial</b> is <b>scaled</b> in angular mils. When the mount is in Automatic Control, he turns his hand cranks to keep index marks on his dials matched to lines on the central disks of the dials. These disks are electrically controlled by the Fire Control System by synchro. This is called matching the pointers, and it allows the sights {{to remain on the}} target while the mount is controlled by the Fire Control System. In local control, he takes sighting orders from the Mount Captain in yards of range and mils of deflection.|$|R

It was a chain running alternately over and under a sequence of pulleys on movable shafts. The chain was fixed at one end, and the other (free) end was weighted to keep it taut. As each shaft moved up or down it would take up or release a corresponding length of the chain. The movements in position of the free (movable) end of the chain represented the sum of the movements of the different shafts. The movable end was kept taut, and fitted with a pen and a moving band of paper on which the pen plotted a tidal curve. In some designs, the movable end of the line was connected instead to a <b>dial</b> and <b>scale</b> from which tidal heights could be read off.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 72) Two {{laboratory experiments}} {{were conducted to}} estimate the strength of effect of eight independent variables, and some two-way interactions, on the speed and accuracy of reading moving-pointer, fixed-scale dials. Additional objectives were {{to determine if the}} black-white relationship of the <b>scale</b> markers and <b>dial</b> background affects dial-reading performance or subject preferences, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} screening designs in meeting the first objective. Eight subjects were assigned to each of two screening designs in each of the two experiments. Each screening design tested 16 out of a possible 256 conditions. Slides of <b>dials</b> with black <b>scales,</b> pointer, and other symbols against a white background were used in Experiment I. White-on-black dials were used in Experiment II. The results were very similar across screening designs and experiments. Scales which progressed in increments of 10 or 20 were read faster and more accurately than scales with progressions of 8 or 16. Also, dials were easier to read if no interpolation was required, but the effect of numerical progression was far stronger. There was a tendency for scales with scale unit lengths twice that of the recommended minimum to be easier to read than those of minimum recommended length. Scale orientation, marker width, pointer design, clutter, and scale number location had weak to trivial effects. Two-way interactions could not be isolated with confidence. It was concluded that the same factors affect the reading of black-on-white and white-on-black dials to about the same extent, and that the factors with the strongest effects (numerical progression, interpolation, scale unit length) should be included in a follow-on experiment. Also, screening designs like the ones used in these experiments can be used to estimate the strength of main effects but may not be as useful for isolating two-way interactions...|$|R

In this austral spring, measurements were performed {{in the vicinity of}} the polar vortex and inside it on some occasions; they revealed the variability in the potential vorticity (PV) of measured air masses. Comparisons between DIAL and MLS were performed between 6 and 100  hPa with 500  km and 24  h coincidence criteria. The results show a good agreement between DIAL and MLS with mean differences of ± 0. 1  ppmv (MLS − DIAL, n  [*]=[*]  180) between 6 and 56  hPa. MIROC-CTM also agrees with DIAL, with mean differences of ± 0. 3  ppmv (MIROC-CTM − DIAL, n  [*]=[*]  23) between 10 and 56  hPa. Both comparisons provide mean differences of 0. 5  ppmv (MLS) to 0. 8 – 0. 9  ppmv (MIROC-CTM) at the 83 – 100  hPa levels. DIAL tends to underestimate ozone values at this lower altitude region. Between 6 and 8  hPa, the MIROC-CTM ozone value is 0. 4 – 0. 6  ppmv (5 – 8  %) smaller than those from <b>DIAL.</b> Applying the <b>scaled</b> PV (sPV) criterion for matching pairs in the DIAL–MLS comparison, the variability in the difference decreases 21 – 47  % between 10 and 56  hPa. However, the mean differences are small for all pressure levels, except 6  hPa. Because ground measurement sites in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) are very sparse at mid- to high latitudes, i. e., 35 – 60 ° S, the OAPA site is important for evaluating the bias and long-term stability of satellite instruments. The good performance of this DIAL system will be useful for such purposes in the future...|$|R
