5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E
5|$|Browne was {{eventually}} exchanged for American general William Alexander (Lord Stirling), and was roundly criticized for <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the whole affair. Nassau remained relatively poorly defended and was again subjected to American rebel threat in January 1778. It was then seized by Spanish forces under Bernardo de Gálvez in 1782, {{and returned to}} British control after the war.|$|E
5|$|Keeler faced sharp {{criticism}} for <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> accusations {{of sexual abuse}} against the Rev. Maurice J. Blackwell, who was accused by Dontee D. Stokes of sexual abuse in 1993. Keeler first suspended the priest but later reinstated the priest as pastor of St. Edward in Baltimore, overruling a lay panel that had recommended against reinstatement.|$|E

5000|$|In 1883, Vermillion was {{involved}} with the Dodge City War. Sometime during Jack's stay in Dodge he killed a card cheat. This is when he appears on the wanted poster as Texas Jack Vermillion. Sometime between 1883 and 1889, perhaps due to this charge, <b>his</b> <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Texas Jack" [...] changed to [...] "Shoot-Your-Eye-Out-Jack" [...] Vermillion. Reportedly, he had shot {{a man in the}} eye.|$|R
5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel costs. Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation. Bo's government instead held a televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. <b>His</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.|$|E

5|$|Bo's populist {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition, and rising fuel charges.

Bo's government instead held televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. <b>His</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> situation earned him praise as a comparatively progressive leader. A businessman who was reportedly involved in organizing the strike was later sentenced on 20 years in prison for disrupting transport and gangsterism.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{was posted}} to No. 65 Squadron at RAF Hornchurch on 12 July 1940, {{arriving}} the next day, {{just as the}} Battle of Britain was getting under-way. No. 65 Squadron boasted several aces, including Bill Franklin who had destroyed 10 enemy aircraft. Finucane called him the scruffiest man in the squadron, but was envious of Franklin's skill and was keen to emulate him. Anxious to get more experience, Finucane loitered around dispersal hoping to build up flight time on the Spitfire by asking as many senior officers for as many hours practice as was possible. Finucane was granted a few flights to improve <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the fighter before {{he was assigned to}} B Flight or Green Section.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that General Nguyễn Khánh — who had deposed Minh in a January 1964 coup — offered Cẩn exile if he handed over his foreign bank deposits. Cẩn protested, {{saying that he had}} no money. Đôn later claimed that Khánh would have executed Cẩn anyway, as Cẩn would have known of the corruption that the generals were party to. During the Ngô era, Khánh commanded the ARVN II Corps, which had operated in the Central Highlands under Cẩn's supervision. Despite having helped to arrest Cẩn, Lodge advised Khánh to be restrained in <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the case for fear of stoking religious resentment or upsetting international opinion with a death penalty.|$|E

5|$|The king soon revoked the {{charters}} {{of freedom}} and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued {{in other parts of}} the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{main unit}} began its work in August 1976 in Sardinia. Don McLaughlan, {{then head of}} public {{relations}} at Lotus Cars, heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype Lotus Esprit with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences. While moving the car between shoots, Lotus test driver Roger Becker impressed with <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the car {{and for the rest}} of filming on Sardinia, Becker became the stunt driver.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, {{was one of the}} foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E
50|$|Bush at War is a 2002 book by Washington Post {{reporter}} Bob Woodward recounting President George W. Bush's {{responses to}} the September 11 attacks and <b>his</b> administration's <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the subsequent War in Afghanistan.|$|R

5|$|By 1166, Foliot {{had been}} {{presented}} with a petition for annulment of the marriage of Aubrey de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, and Agnes of Essex. On the couple's third appearance before the bishop in his episcopal court on 9May 1166, Countess Agnes appealed to the pope to affirm the validity of her marriage. Foliot enclosed her appeal in his own surviving letter setting out the salient features of the case. While the case was under papal consideration, Foliot reprimanded the earl for his treatment of his wife, reminding him that until the pope had ruled otherwise, Agnes was to be considered his wife in bed and board. When Pope Alexander III wrote to the bishop concerning the countess's maltreatment, and requiring Foliot to threaten the earl with excommunication, he also chastised the bishop for <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the case.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} four months of his premiership, Brown enjoyed a {{substantial}} lead in the polls. His popularity amongst the public may have been because <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> numerous serious events during his first few weeks as Prime Minister, including two attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow at the end of June 2007. However, between the end of 2007 and September 2008, his popularity fell significantly; two contributing factors were believed to be his perceived change of mind over plans to call a general election in October 2007 and <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the 10p tax rate cut in 2008, which led to allegations of weakness and dithering. His unpopularity led eight Labour MPs to call for a leadership contest in September 2008, less than 15 months into his premiership. The threat of a leadership contest receded due to his perceived strong handling of the global financial crisis in October, but his popularity hit an all-time low and his position became increasingly untenable after the May 2009 expenses scandal and Labour's poor results in the 2009 Local and European elections. Brown's cabinet began to rebel; there were several key resignations in the run up to local elections in June 2009. However, Brown was backed by his party. He faced a second attempt to launch a leadership challenge by former Cabinet colleagues Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt in January 2010, but the plot failed to gather momentum and Brown remained as both Labour leader and Prime Minister to lead his party into the 2010 General Election. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservative Party winning the largest number of seats. Brown remained as Prime Minister while the Liberal Democrats entered separate negotiations with Labour and the Conservatives with a view to forming a coalition government. He announced his intention to resign on 10 May 2010 to help broker a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. However, this became increasingly unlikely and on 11 May, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} {{was wrong with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of the most}} significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
25|$|A non-party {{dictator}} {{without a}} large body of supporters, Morínigo survived politically – despite many plots against him – because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> astute <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> an influential group of young military officers who held key positions of power.|$|R

50|$|In 1987, Young faced {{controversy}} over <b>his</b> alleged <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> campaign donations during the 1987 election. He subsequently resigned from parliament on 12 February 1988, sparking the 1988 Port Adelaide by-election, {{though he was}} later cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|R
5|$|Harley's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} {{influence on the}} club as captain was commended {{early on in the}} season after <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> teammate Steve Johnson's off-field discretions. Johnson was banished from the team during the pre-season and demoted to the reserves for the first five games of the season. However, he successfully returned to the team and finished the season as a Norm Smith Medallist and All-Australian. Harley's leadership influence on the team was reflected in his finishing fourth in the AFLPA Best Captain award during his first year at the helm. He was also awarded life membership of the Geelong Football Club following his 150th team appearance in the round sixteen win against the Western Bulldogs, and named in the end-of-season South Australian State of Origin team.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A {{month later}} the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without {{consulting}} the Swazis)—the South African Republic {{could build a}} railway through it to Kosi Bay {{on the condition that}} the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging.|$|E
5|$|Zombi 2 {{serves as}} a sequel to Zombi, a re-edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead; Zombi had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved {{successful}} upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it down as {{he did not feel}} he would be the right director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on <b>his</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino.|$|E
