However, this standard {{does not provide a}} recommendation for calculating the capacity of edge-lifting anchors (normally placed in the edge of thin wall elements) which are commonly used in the precast industry throughout Australia. These anchors may experience a load under tension or combined tension and shear during the lifting process. The American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318 - 08 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete [2], the Precast Concrete Institute (PCI) Design Handbook – Precast and Prestressed Concrete [3], and ComitéEuro-International Du Béton(CEB) Design of Fastenings in Concrete [4] include provisions for general anchorage configurations (such as multiple face lift anchors) rather than what are typically seen in edgelifting anchors.

40|$|Ph. D. In this thesis, {{our primary}} {{objective}} is to investigate the effects that various graph modifications have on the total domination number of a graph. In Chapter 1, we introduce basic graph theory concepts and preliminary definitions. In Chapters 2 and 3, we investigate the graph modification of edge removal. In Chapter 2, we characterize graphs for which the removal of any arbitrary edge increases the total domination number. We also begin the investigation of graphs for which the removal of any arbitrary edge {{has no effect on}} the total domination number. In Chapter 3, we continue this investigation and determine the minimum number of edges required for these graphs. The contents of Chapters 2 and 3 have been published in Discrete Applied Mathematics [15] and [16]. In Chapter 4, we investigate the graph modification of edge addition. In particular, we focus our attention on graphs for which adding an edge between any pair of nonadjacent vertices has no effect on the total domination number. We characterize these graphs, determine a sharp upper bound on their total domination number and determine which combinations of order and total domination number are attainable. 10 11 We also study claw-free graphs which have this property. The contents of this chapter were published in Discrete Mathematics [20]. In Chapter 5, we investigate the graph modification of vertex removal. We characterize graphs for which the removal of any vertex changes the total domination number and find sharp upper and lower bounds on the total domination number of these graphs. We also characterize graphs for which the removal of an arbitrary vertex has no effect on the total domination number and we further show that they have no forbidden subgraphs. The contents of this chapter were published in Discrete Applied Mathematics [14]. In Chapters 6 and 7, we investigate the graph modification of edge lifting. In Chapter 6, we show that there are no trees for which every possible <b>edge</b> <b>lift</b> decreases the domination number, and we characterize trees for which every possible <b>edge</b> <b>lift</b> increases the domination number. The contents of Chapter 6 were published in the journal Quaestiones Mathematicae [17].

Methods: Two hundred Asian subjects (400 eyes) were enrolled in this 1 -month parallel, bilateral, randomized study at ten investigative sites. Study lenses were dispensed at a screening/dispensing visit, and follow-up visits occurred at 2 weeks and 1 month. Lenses were worn on a daily disposable basis. Fit characteristics were evaluated at each visit, and slit-lamp evaluations were completed at each follow-up visit. Results: Of the 200 patients enrolled, 172 (344 eyes) completed the study. The proportion of eyes with fully centered lenses was statistically significantly higher for the hilafilcon B group at the 2 -week and 1 -month visits, P< 0. 05. Over all visits, 0. 6 % of hilafilcon B eyes demonstrated incomplete corneal coverage, whereas for the etafilcon A group, 8. 5 % of eyes demonstrated incomplete corneal coverage and/or <b>edge</b> <b>lift.</b> The proportion of eyes with adequate lens movement was statistically significantly higher for the hilafilcon B group, P< 0. 05.

40|$|The {{removal of}} rigid contact lenses from the eye, using the eyelids, is a {{relatively}} simple procedure. However, there is a sequence of biomechanical events underlying this procedure which are not well understood. By using high-speed videokeratoscopy (50 Hz), we have shown that during the lid-pull procedure the cornea typically shows {{a significant increase in}} with-the-rule astigmatism by an average of 2. 19 D (axial power). The average increase in steep K power was 1. 22 D (S. D. ± 1. 05 D) and the average decrease in flat K power was 0. 97 D (S. D. ± 1. 05 D). This change in corneal topography increases the <b>edge</b> <b>lift</b> of the lens at 12 and 6 O’clock locations of the lens, enhancing the removal process. When the subject blinks, as the lid margins reach the lens edge, the lens flexes and the eye retracts by an average of 0. 66 mm (S. D. ± 0. 27 mm).

40|$|A {{wingsail}} {{is a solid}} symmetrical aerofoil section {{which creates}} thrust {{in the same manner}} as a conventional sail. Wingsails may either be used as a sole power unit, e. g. for a yacht or catamaran, or as an auxiliary power unit on a larger craft, e. g. fishing vessels, cargo ships or passenger liners. To augment the thrust created by the wingsail, high lift devices are employed to increase both the maximum lift and the stall incidence of the aerofoil. A wingsail must be symmetrical and capable of creating an equal lift force with the flow approaching the leading edge from either side of the wing centreline, i. e. the wingsail surface must act as either the upper, or lower pressure surface. Initial experimental work proved that using a symmetrical slat as a leading <b>edge</b> high <b>lift</b> device both delayed the separation of flow over the wingsail upper surface and increased the effective camber of the aerofoil. To increase the thrust created still further, this leading <b>edge</b> high <b>lift</b> device was combined with a trailing <b>edge</b> high <b>lift</b> device, a symmetrical single slotted flap. Due to the large number of possible model configurations, a commercially available CFD package was introduced to assist with the design.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} number of ordered lenses {{required}} to achieve an optimal lens fit between three-point-touch and apical touch fittings in keratoconus subjects with nipple and oval cones using the first definite apical clearance lens (FDACL) as a starting point. Methods: First trial lens was selected following manufacturer’s guidelines and the back optic zone radius (BOZR) was flattened or steepened in 0. 10 mm steps until a FDACL was found. Subsequently, subjects were randomly allocated to three-point-touch (BOZR 0. 10 mm flatter than FDACL) and apical touch fittings (BOZR 0. 40 mm flatter than FDACL). Changes were made solely in total lens diameter, <b>edge</b> <b>lift,</b> and/or back vertex power until an optimal lens fit was achieved. Differences between fitting approaches were compared in terms of optimal lens fit rates defined {{as the percentage of}} subjects successfully fitted with the first lens ordered from the manufacturer. Results: Sixty-one subjects (109 eyes) were randomly allocated to threepoint- touch and apical touch fitting approaches. An average of 2. 3 trial lenses were necessary to achieve the FDACL. An optimal lens fit rate was achieved with the first lens in 84 of 109 eyes (77 %). No statistically significant differences in optimal lens fit rates were found between three-point-touch and apical touch fitting approaches (83 % and 71 %, respectively; P = 0. 12) and between nipple and oval cones (81 % and 68 %, respectively; P = 0. 12). Conclusions: The use of the FDACL provides a systematic, reliable, and repeatable starting point for Rose K 2 contact lens fitting in keratoconus.
