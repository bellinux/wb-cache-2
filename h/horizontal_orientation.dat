In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E

40|$|The Baram Delta System, Brunei, NW Borneo, is a Tertiary delta system {{located on}} an active {{continental}} margin. Delta top regions in many Tertiary delta systems (e. g.

A total of 890 borehole breakouts and 608 DITFs were interpreted in the Cooper Basin. The approximately east–west maximum <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>orientation</b> is consistent {{over much of the}} basin, except in the Patchawarra Trough where maximum horizontal stress rotates to a northwest–southeast orientation. This rotation in maximum <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>orientation</b> is consistent with in situ stress data to the northwest of the Cooper Basin. The stress field in the Cooper Basin appears to mark the apex of a major horseshoe-shaped rotation in maximum horizontal stress direction across central eastern Australia. Finite element modelling of the in situ stress field of the Indo–Australian Plate (IAP) using a range of plate-scale tectonic forces is able to match the regional maximum <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>orientation</b> over most of Australia reasonably well, including the mean east–west maximum <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>orientation</b> in the Cooper Basin. However, plate boundary–scale modelling does not adequately match the horseshoe-shaped stress rotation across central eastern Australia. The average east–west maximum <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>orientation</b> in the Cooper Basin indicates that stresses from tensional forces acting along the Tonga–Kermadec subduction zone are not transmitted into the interior of the Australian plate. The majority of the tensional forces associated with the Tonga–Kermadec subduction zone are most likely accommodated along the numerous spreading centres within the Lau–Havre backarc basin. A number of more localized stress anomalies have also been identified. These cannot be explained by plate-scale tectonic forces and are possibly a result of geological structure and/or density contrasts locally perturbing the stress field. Scott D. Reynolds, Scott D.

40|$|The {{details of}} {{oriented}} visual stimuli are better resolved {{when they are}} horizontal or vertical rather than oblique. This “oblique effect ” has been confirmed in numerous behavioral studies in humans {{and to some extent}} in animals. However, investigations of its neural basis have produced mixed and inconclusive results, presumably due in part to limited sample sizes. We have used a database to analyze a population of 4, 418 cells in the cat’s striate cortex to determine possible differences as a function of orientation. We find that both the numbers of cells and the widths of orientation tuning vary as a function of preferred orientation. Specifically, more cells prefer hor-izontal and vertical orientations compared with oblique angles. The largest population of cells is activated by orientations close to hori-zontal. In addition, orientation tuning widths are most narrow for cells preferring <b>horizontal</b> <b>orientations.</b> These findings are most prominent for simple cells tuned to high spatial frequencies. Complex cells and simple cells tuned to low spatial frequencies do not exhibit these anisotropies. For a subset of simple cells from our population (n 104), we examined the relative contributions of linear and nonlinear mechanisms in shaping orientation tuning curves. We find that linear contributions alone do not account for the narrower tuning widths at <b>horizontal</b> <b>orientations.</b> By modeling simple cells as linear filters followed by static expansive nonlinearities, our analysis indicates that horizontally tuned cells have a greater nonlinear component than those tuned to other orientations.
