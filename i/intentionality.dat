5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} of inquiry that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines of inquiry, in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of <b>intentionality</b> ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} has {{the properties of}} productivity and displacement, and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication. Language {{is thought to have}} originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared <b>intentionality.</b> This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as social grooming and entertainment.|$|E

5|$|<b>Intentionality</b> is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conceived {{on the premise}} that a good evaluation plan for a program begins with explicating the program 2 ̆ 7 s essential conceptual underpinnings, namely the program theory. Theory-based evaluation is generally recognized as enhancing the quality of evaluation. However, the theory-based approach remains underutilized in evaluation of federal competitive grants programs. The goal of the {{research was}} to depict a coherent description of program theory for the Higher Education Challenge (HEC) grants program grounded on core aspects of theories developed in two studies. The research used quantitative content analysis to systematically study the texts of Request for Application (RFA) for the HEC grants program. The analysis centered on examining linear changes and continuity in emphasis during eleven years of the HEC 2 ̆ 7 s implementation. Eight themes were identified indicating trends toward continuity and changes. These themes were used to draw inferences about the HEC 2 ̆ 7 s program theory. The research also employed an oral history study to describe the HEC program developers 2 ̆ 7 assumptions about a rationale for the way this program was structured. Utilizing narrative analysis, six program 2 ̆ 7 s <b>intentionalities</b> were identified. These <b>intentionalities</b> were used to describe the HEC 2 ̆ 7 s program theory and map eight chains of positive consequences to explain how the HEC grants program was intended to bring about its effects. The findings of both studies were used to construct a coherent depiction of the HEC 2 ̆ 7 s program theory and develop recommendations to inform this program 2 ̆ 7 s evaluation.;Keywords. agricultural education; competitive grants program; content analysis; evaluation; oral history; program theory; US Department of Agricultur...|$|R

Using three aspects of phenomenological theoryâ the movement of the mind out towards an entity and then back in an act of reflection, multiplicities within unity, and the sharing of <b>intentionalities</b> within a communityâ the discussion suggests that both tagging systems and the Semantic Web foster an intersubjective domain for the sharing and use of information resources. The Semantic Web, however, resembles traditional library systems, in that it relies for this intersubjective domain on the conscious implementation of domain-centered standards which are then encoded for machine processing, while tagging systems work on implied principles of emergence...|$|R

(Indeed, The Novel and the Police exposed these celebrations as “perpetuating the novel’s ruse.”) Against this “subversion hypothesis,” Miller called for attention to the novel’s ability effectively to produce subjects, its capacity to form “a subject habituated to psychic displacements, evacuations, reinvestments, in a social order whose totalizing power circulates all the more easily for being pulverized.” ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this article}} is to establish that the full range of meanings in this field and consequently, the confusion regarding formative statements of value, can be approached through the comprehension of the different paradigmatic fields on which science constructs its own areas of knowledge and intrinsically or extrinsically assigns values to different cognitive processes. Conciliating paradigms is not easy as each body of knowledge implies an understanding of the world under certain cognitive structures, each with its own set of values. These are not necessarily universal insofar as the object of knowledge in itself includes or excludes fields of values by which the scientific statement takes on meaning.

40|$|Abstract Background Prevalence {{rates for}} {{long-term}} {{injection drug users}} in some localities surpass 60 % for HIV and 80 % for HCV. We describe methods for developing grounded hypotheses about how some injectors avoid infection with either virus. Methods Subjects: 25 drug injectors who have injected drugs 8 – 15 years in New York City. 17 remain without antibody to either HIV or HCV; 3 are double-positives; and 5 are positive for HCV but not HIV. "Staying Safe" methodology compares serostatus groups using detailed biographical timelines and narratives; and information about how subjects maintain access to physical resources and social support; their strategies and tactics to remain safe; how they handle problems of addiction and demands by drug dealers and other drug users; and how their behaviors and strategies do or do not become socially-embedded practices. Grounded theory and life-history analysis techniques compare and contrast doubly-uninfected with those infected with both viruses or only with HCV. Results Themes and initial hypotheses emerging from analyses included two master hypotheses that, if confirmed, should help shape preventive interventions: 1) Staying uninfected {{is not simply a}} question of social structure or social position. It involves agency by drug injectors, including sustained hard work and adaptation to changing circumstances. 2) Multiple <b>intentionalities</b> contribute to remaining uninfected. These conscious goals include balancing one's need for drugs and one's income; developing ways to avoid drug withdrawal sickness; avoiding situations where other drug users importune you to share drugs; and avoiding HIV (and perhaps HCV) infection. Thus, focusing on a single goal in prevention might be sub-optimal. Other hypotheses specify mechanisms of enacting these <b>intentionalities.</b> One example is finding ways to avoid extreme social ostracism. Conclusion We have identified strategies and tactics that some doubly-uninfected IDUs have developed to stay safe. Staying Safe methodology develops grounded hypotheses. These can be tested through cohort studies of incidence and prevention trials of hypothesis-based programs to help drug injectors make their injection and sexual careers safer for themselves and others. This positive deviance control-case life history method might be used to study avoiding other infections like genital herpes among sex workers. </p...|$|R

Methodologically, we base our paper on a longitudinal in-depth case study that focussed on the teaching, learning and assessment practices in Greek public sector universities. Based on our Greek case example we specifically focus on how the delegation of plagiarism detection to a technical actor produces a particular set of agencies and <b>intentionalities</b> (a politics one might say) which unintentionally and unexpectedly conspires to constitute some students as plagiarists (who are not) and others as not (who are). We suggest that this is best explored by looking exactly at what is rendered visible and invisible in such imbrications.

30|$|As I {{mentioned}} above, in meditative practice, bhāvana especially is invoked {{as a way}} of interfacing {{between a}} material, physically present reality and a non-corporeal spirit-based reality. Bhāvana draws from our familiar solidity of physicality, familiar images and objects as a springboard for an imaginative entrance into a kind of space that houses <b>intentionalities</b> and entities lacking the kinds of bodies we are used to. The bhāvana one carries, an emotion-laden affect, can push in one direction or another the shape and quality of the subtle body, which then eventually shows up in the comport of the physical body. The idea here is that the subtle body carries with it the signatures, the traces of our various life experiences. The body is not just a physical object unconnected to the mind or to one’s memories. Rather the body, especially the second, subtle body, carries with it a history of the person’s experiences, emotional and physical. The bhāva is the mood or affect this embodied condensation of a life-history generates. A place can also have a particular mood or affect, a bhāva. And this also becomes an important term for art; a bhāva can describe the mood of a scene in a play.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the following, we {{take into}} consideration, firstly, the {{specifics}} on the phenomenological analysis of conscience {{by referring to}} the thematic offered by Descartes, Kant and Fichte, namely by those who influenced Husserl in favouring “the transcendental reason” in the philosophical research. For Husserl, the subjective conscience is intentional conscience, and existence is assumed as an existential phenomenon, as an objectual set with sense in conscience. Under these conditions, {{one of the fundamental}} preoccupations of pure phenomenology lies in the explanation of sense from the constituent <b>intentionality's</b> perspective that characterizes both the personal transcendental ego and the transcendental intersubjectivity: in fact, the objective sense of the world is intersubjectively developed, only that the transcendental intersubjectivity, as an originary structure for all that exists as a sense, has its focus in the self, in any self, which means that in order to thematize it methodically, it is necessary to start from the transcendental ego. In addition, as the philosopher will state in later works, the world, as an existential phenomenon, is rich in significations that the subject perpetuates or transforms: there is always, for everyone, a predetermined horizon of sense, and on the other side, our subjective conscience always comes with an excess of sense...|$|R

This allows thinking the places as well as the movement, and I will insist upon the notion of experience and the symbolic charge of movement. Secondly, by showing how mobility takes a more and more important part of contemporary arts of dwelling. Finally, by raising the question of how mobile dwelling implies the deployment of geographical competences.
