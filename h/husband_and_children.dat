5|$|Anne {{was buried}} beside her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> in the Henry VII Chapel on the South Aisle of Westminster Abbey on 24 August. The Electress Sophia had died on 28 May, {{two months before}} Anne, so the Electress's son, George, Elector of Hanover, {{inherited}} the British Crown pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701. The possible Catholic claimants, including Anne's half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, were ignored. The Elector's accession was relatively stable: a Jacobite rising in 1715 failed. Marlborough was re-instated, and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs.|$|E

5|$|Brian meets Arielle at {{the hotel}} and asks her to marry him, giving her a ring. Brian insists that he is truly in love with her, and Arielle accepts his proposal, telling him to meet her the next day {{at the hotel}}. Valéry shows up at Brian's {{apartment}} that night; he slaps Brian and expresses anger at Brian's betrayal of the rules and boundaries of an open marriage. He then gives Brian a check for $250,000 for Brian to give Arielle the life she deserves and leaves. The next day, the hotel doorman gives Brian a letter from Arielle in which she explains that although she loves him deeply, she cannot leave her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> and asks him not to contact her again.|$|E
5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess in terms of her relationship with her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1901, at 19, {{she married}} Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately {{believed}} {{by family and}} friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, {{with whom she had}} fallen in love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse at the front and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled to the Crimea with her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> where they lived under the threat of assassination.

5|$|Olga and {{her husband}} refused to leave Russia, and {{decided to move to}} the Caucasus, which the White Army had cleared of revolutionary Bolsheviks. An {{imperial}} bodyguard, Timofei Yatchik, guided them to his hometown, the large Cossack village of Novominskaya. In a rented five-room farmhouse there, Olga gave birth to her second son, Guri Nikolaevich, on 23 April 1919. He was named after a friend of hers, Guri Panayev, who was killed while serving in the Akhtyrsky Regiment during World War I. In November 1919, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia. Just ahead of revolutionary troops, they escaped to Novorossiysk, and took refuge in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of the Dowager Empress's safe arrival in Denmark. After a brief stay with the consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where Olga, her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were evacuated to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes where she was visited by Regent Alexander Karadjordjevich, later King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Alexander offered the Grand Duchess and her family a permanent home, but Olga was summoned to Denmark by her mother. On Good Friday 1920, Olga and her family arrived in Copenhagen. They lived with the Dowager Empress, at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvidøre, where Olga acted as her mother's secretary and companion. It was a difficult arrangement at times. The Dowager Empress insisted on having Olga at her beck and call and found Olga's young sons too boisterous. Having never reconciled with the idea of her daughter's marriage to a commoner, she was cold towards Kulikovsky, rarely allowing him in her presence. At formal functions, Olga was expected to accompany her mother alone.|$|E

40|$|Vol. 37, No. 2, 157 - 167 Data from 252 female primary caregivers, their <b>husbands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> {{living in}} multigenerational {{households}} {{were used to}} create family typologies based {{on the extent of}} similarity among reports of elder behaviors. Analysis of variance indicates that families characterized by high agreement and those characterized by low agreement were significantly different from one another on a number of dimensions. When the relationship between caregiver-reported stressors and mental health was examined as a function of family typology, results indicate that for high agreement families there were significant correlations between the caregiver's report of the elder's behaviors and her burden; satisfaction with caregiving; relationships with her <b>husband,</b> <b>child,</b> <b>and</b> elder; and depression. Similar relationships characterize data reported by <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> in high agreement families. For families characterized by low agreement, the majority of these relationships were not significant...|$|R

The original program she designed was for registered nurses, R.N.'s, without a university degree, to complete a Bachelor of Science in nursing. The transition of nursing education from that of R.N.'s trained in non-university programs, to 4-year B.S.N. programs or their equivalent {{was a matter of}} advocacy for Woolley as well as profession, and she subsequently published a number of pieces demonstrating the benefits of university-based nursing programs.|$|E
