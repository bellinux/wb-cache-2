5|$|Before her {{presentation}} to Charles, Isabeau visited Hainaut <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> staying with her granduncle Duke Albert I, ruler {{of some of}} Bavaria-Straubing and Count of Holland. Albert's wife, Margaret of Brieg, replaced Isabeau's Bavarian style of dress, deemed unsuitable as French courtly attire, and taught her etiquette suitable to the French court. She learned quickly, suggestive of an intelligent and quick-witted character. On 13July 1385 she traveled to Amiens to be presented to Charles.|$|E

The Japanese had held this hilltop {{in the second half}} of 1942 and showered artillery fire on American troops at the Henderson airfield below the hill. Eventually the hill was captured but the Japanese held on to the Gifu, Sea Horse, and Galloping Horse ridges <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Most of the Japanese died of starvation, banzai assaults or direct killing.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus {{stayed with}} Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), {{when he left}} the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the {{kindness}} of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.|$|E
5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E

5|$|After six weeks' {{training}} in the capital, the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914. During its stopover in Bulawayo, it paraded in front of about 90% of the town's population; Plumtree, the last stop before crossing the border, provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet. Notwithstanding these grand farewells, the Maritz Rebellion was all but over {{by the time the}} Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at Bloemfontein. The vast majority of South African troops, including most of Boer origin, had remained loyal to the Union government, and the uprising had been quashed. The Rhodesians garrisoned Bloemfontein <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> then redeployed to Cape Town, where they underwent further training for the South-West Africa Campaign as part of South Africa's Northern Force, which Botha personally commanded.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} Leptospirosis, notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{the ride}} {{received}} a new {{coat of paint}} with Victorian-style architecture around the station. In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Giant Dipper was almost completely untouched. The ride was closed <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> to be inspected. The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake. In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters {{leading up to the}} event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid his father's wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> When he {{returned}} to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found a shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the Bishop of Assisi, Francis renounced {{his father and his}} patrimony.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, in the Fifth Period (27 January 1945 - 13 February 1945), the Soviets mustered {{their forces}} to {{eliminate}} the besieged defenders in the city. The German troops fought <b>for</b> <b>about</b> half <b>a</b> <b>month</b> more before surrendering on 13 February 1945, ending four months of bloody fighting in the Budapest area. Out of the estimated 150,000 defenders less than 1,000 managed to avoid death or captivity.|$|R
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, {{although it was not}} entirely within his control. The more success Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February, Totti was sidelined <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> after {{sustaining}} {{a bruised}} right buttock. He {{returned to the}} pitch on 17 March against Udinese, scoring the first goal of the match as he helped his team to a 3–2 win. Eight days later, Totti celebrated 700 overall appearances with Roma against Torino. On 2 April, he scored his 20th career goal against Parma (a personal record against any side) in a 4–2 victory. He finished the season with eight goals and ten assists, ending the year as the top assist provider of the 2013–14 Serie A season.|$|E
5|$|Still {{opposed to}} the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the {{government}} of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine's third son, Prince Paul, who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state. Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated in a general election. On 17 November, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, regent {{since the death of}} Alexander, retired and the new prime minister, Dimitrios Rallis, asked Olga to assume the regency. She served as regent <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after a referendum in his favor.|$|E

First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> {{and then returned to}} Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in , written in Swedish.

5|$|The Allied {{air forces}} carried out several bombing raids on Mimoyecques between November 1943 and June 1944 but caused little damage. The bombing {{disrupted}} the construction {{project and the}} initial raids of 5 and 8 November 1943 caused work to be delayed <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> The Germans subsequently decided to abandon the western site, where work had not progressed very far, and concentrated on the eastern site. On 6 July 1944 the Royal Air Force began bombing the site with ground-penetrating Tallboy bombs. One Tallboy hit the concrete slab on top of Drift IV, collapsing the drift. Three others penetrated the tunnels below and substantially damaged the facility, causing several of the galleries to collapse in places.|$|E

50|$|Politics {{provides}} an excellent setting {{for the study of}} reinforcement theory. The statistics on undecided voters indicate that most people have pre-existing beliefs when it comes to politics. Relatively few people remain undecided late into high-profile elections. <b>For</b> example, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> prior to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, less than one-fifth of likely voters claimed to be undecided (Sidoti, 2008). Much political advertising is targeted at these individuals not only because of their importance in the overall result, but also because they are the most susceptible to political persuasion (Johnson-Cartee & Copeland, 1997).|$|R

5|$|When he {{graduated}} from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum. He received a scholarship to study at Government Arts College, Kumbakonam, but was so intent on mathematics {{that he could not}} focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process. In August 1905, Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam, and stayed in Rajahmundry <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> He later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras. There he passed in mathematics, choosing only to attempt questions that appealed to him and leaving the rest unanswered, but performed poorly in other subjects, such as English, physiology and Sanskrit. Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam in December 1906 and again a year later. Without a FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.|$|E
5|$|John the Fearless accused Isabeau and Orléans {{of fiscal}} {{mismanagement}} and again demanded money for himself, in recompense {{for the loss}} of royal revenues after his father's death; an estimated half of Philip the Bold's revenues had come from the French treasury. John raised a force of 1,000 knights, and entered Paris in 1405. Orléans hastily retreated with Isabeau to the fortified castle of Melun, with her household and children a day or so behind. John immediately left in pursuit, intercepting the party of chaperones and royal children. He took possession of the Dauphin, and returned him to Paris under control of Burgundian forces; however, the boy's uncle, the duke of Berry, quickly took control of the child at the orders of the Royal Council. At that time Charles was lucid <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> and able to help with the crisis. The incident, that {{came to be known as}} the enlèvement of the dauphin, almost caused full-scale war, but it was averted. Orléans quickly raised an army while John encouraged Parisians to revolt. They refused, claiming loyalty to the King and his son; Berry was made captain general of Paris and the city's gates were locked. In October Isabeau became active in mediating the dispute, in response to a letter from Christine de Pizan and an ordinance from the Royal Council.|$|E
