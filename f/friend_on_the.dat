Even after protests from students, players and alumni, university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team and they roomed together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team {{in response to the}} university's decision, but eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.|$|E

When she looks for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then spends much of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E

5|$|Fatale {{observes the}} actions of the New Champions as its newest member.

Fatale's closest <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that made her a cyborg, with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans.|$|E

25|$|The defence {{opted for}} Einem {{to give an}} unsworn {{statement}} from the dock, rather than given sworn evidence from the witness box. In his unsworn statement, Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened between 5 June and 11 July 1983. He again claimed that on 5 June he had picked up Kelvin in North Adelaide, had driven him to his home, and later had dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu {{for the next week}} after that and did not return to work until 14 June. Einem was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did remember what he did on 10 July, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that he was at a relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way home, had gone straight to bed and then to work the next day. He also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which Einem had sold on 16 July 1983, purportedly to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. He closed his unsworn statement by again claiming his innocence.|$|E

500|$|Sanosuke's {{role in the}} live-action films {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} {{commentary}} by writers. Munetaka Aoki's acting was praised by Ko Ransom from Anime News Network, finding it faithful to the original character. Nick Creamer from the same site also noted how in the first live-action film, Sanosuke's characterization was identical to the original series as he is initially an enemy to Kenshin but later becomes his <b>friend.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, Creamer criticized Sanosuke's portrayal in the second film as he stated that he [...] "tends to chew the scenery in his appearances" [...] to the point he found him less realistic. For the liveaction film , David West from Neo enjoyed Sanosuke's fight against Anji but felt it was too similar to his fight against the Christian priest from the first film.|$|E

[...] Wheatley had the responsibility of driving his brother, Leslie Mongo, to his school that opened at 8:15 and {{thought he was}} the victim of New Jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9:00a.m. team meetings.

500|$|During 1861, botany {{became a}} preoccupation for Darwin, and his {{projects}} became serious scientific pursuits. He continued {{his study of}} orchids throughout the summer, writing to anyone {{who might be able}} to supply specimens he had not yet examined. Field naturalists, botanists, and country gentry sent specimens from across the British Isles. Darwin also tramped around the countryside with tin cans and biscuit boxes, collecting specimens which his gardeners potted up for him. His family joined in, and neighbours contributed to the research. As he had only a cold greenhouse, a <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the village who had a hot-house allowed him to use that, and offered the services of his gardener to look after the delicate specimens. Darwin's aim was to show how the complex structures and life cycles of the plants could be explained by natural selection rather than by the handiwork of God; he saw the huge variety of flowers as a collection of ad hoc evolutionary adaptations. In June he described his examination of bee orchids as a passion, and his findings on insect fertilisation of orchids as [...] "beautiful facts".|$|E
500|$|An only child, Brooks {{was born}} in Crewe, England, before {{migrating}} to Western Australia when he was four, along with his working-class parents Mick and Norah. His first aquatic adventure was almost his last. Aged seven, he was playing with a <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore of the Swan River when they climbed into a boat that drifted deeper into water and overturned. Brooks was forced to cling to the boat as his friend swam ashore to seek help. His parents immediately enrolled him in swimming lessons at the Marylands Swim Club. Shortly after, he switched to the tutelage of Kevin Duff, who coached him for the next fifteen years. After just six weeks under Duff, Brooks came third in the 50m breaststroke at the State Age Championships. Despite coaching the likes of Olympic medallists Kevin O'Halloran, Lyn McClements, David Dickson and Lynne Watson, Duff was virtually unknown outside Western Australia. Brooks {{was known for his}} rebellious nature, and had a glowing assessment of his coach, opining that [...] "He's not pushy like many other Australian coaches and he's not in the politics of Australian swimming".|$|E

Double Dash also received a perfect score from GamePro, who commented that the gameplay remains [...] "fast and furious". The feature of having two riders per kart was praised by Justin Leeper and Andy McNamara of Game Informer; McNamara stated: [...] "Giving the player control of two different characters is pretty cool in single-player, but add a <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of your kart in multiplayer and it opens the game up like never before." [...] GameSpy called Double Dash!! a [...] "great-looking, great-playing game that most gamers will instantly warm to."

Electronic Gaming Monthly said that the game's [...] "pure, exhilarating glee will envelop your soul".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1952 season, López was {{acquired}} by the Philadelphia Athletics from the Drummondville Cubs of the Class-C Provincial League for $1,500 ($ today). [...] In 1954, López won baseball's Triple Crown in the Winter League. [...] Throughout his professional career, {{he played in the}} Panama winter league where he won three batting titles and regularly led the league in home runs. López developed in the A's farm system, and when the team relocated to Kansas City in 1955 he was recalled to the major league club. López made his major league debut in 1955. [...] That season he finished second to Carlos Paula among rookies in batting average and was overshadowed by American League strikeout-leading pitcher Herb Score for the Rookie of the Year. He usually played second or third base during his time with the Athletics. During his rookie season, he finished third on the team in home runs, trailing only Gus Zernial (30) and Vic Power (19). He tied Jim Finigan for third on the team in RBIs with 68, trailing only Zernial and Power, who had 84 and 76, respectively. López was the team's regular third baseman, and was the youngest regular starter on the team. In 1956, the team finished with a 52102 record, but López had a career-high 153 hits. He also set then-career highs in home runs (18) and runs batted in (69). [...] In his early years, black and white players did not room together on the road, so he roomed with Vic Power even though Power's closest <b>friend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team was Clete Boyer. In 1957, he had a 22-game hitting streak, that is the All-time Kansas City Athletics team record for the thirteen seasons the franchise played there.|$|E
