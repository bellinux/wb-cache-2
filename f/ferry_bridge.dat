5|$|The A354 road is {{the only}} land access to Portland, via <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge,</b> {{connecting}} to Weymouth and to the wider road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester. It runs from Easton, splitting into a northbound section through Chiswell and a southbound section through Fortuneswell, then along Chesil Beach and across a bridge to the mainland in Wyke Regis. Formerly a branch line railway, connecting to the South West Main Line near Weymouth railway station, also crossed to the island. The corridor is now a cycle path connecting Fortuneswell with Weymouth and a wider network of traffic-free cycle paths.|$|E
5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock {{has been replaced by}} a sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between the owners of the Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now a lift bridge but once a <b>ferry</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Where {{it passes}} through Bristol the river was prone to flooding, but the Northern Stormwater Interceptor, running from Eastville Sluices to the River Avon {{downstream}} of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground culvert, emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), but only {{when there is a}} risk of flooding. The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's Culvert into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour.|$|E
50|$|Port Morris <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridges,</b> {{also known}} as the 134th Street <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridges,</b> are two {{historic}} bridges located in the Port Morris neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City. They were built in 1948 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, and are constructed of steel and copper in industrial-style truss construction. Each bridge stands four- to five-stories tall and covered in corrugated steel metal. They feature wire rope pulley systems, wooden gangways, and pontoons. They were constructed to hoist the bases of ferry boats {{in and out of the}} river as they came into dock.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Ferry</b> Street <b>Bridge</b> or <b>Ferry</b> Street-Thorofare Canal <b>bridge</b> is a <b>bridge</b> {{located at}} <b>Ferry</b> Street over the Thorofare Canal in Grosse Ile, Michigan. It was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 2000.|$|R
5|$|More {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 2007. Replacing the bridge would cost $7–8 million and take two years to complete. Rehabilitation would require bringing the bridge up to code so it could carry loads of up to 40 tons (36 tonnes). A preservation group formed to oppose a replacement. Its founder compared the bridge to the Dingmans <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge</b> on the Pennsylvania–New Jersey border, which carries similar traffic loads. One possibility is to replace the bridge, and move the antique structure elsewhere in Sullivan County, since it is a popular tourist attraction. In June 2008, a compromise was made defining {{the possibility of a}} $12 million bridge to replace the 104-year-old deteriorating structure. PennDOT has suggested that they will let anyone preserve the bridge by taking it somewhere else. However, there has been no response, and plans for the new bridge were initially scheduled to begin by 2010.|$|E
5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a <b>ferry</b> <b>bridge,</b> which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E
25|$|Witt {{then went}} to work as a {{paymaster}} and engineer for the Juniata Bridge Company on the Clark's <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge</b> in Duncannon, Pennsylvania. Work began on the bridge, which spanned the Juniata River just before its confluence with the Susquehanna River, in 1939 and was completed later that year.|$|E

25|$|At Stapenhill near Burton, {{there were}} similar {{calls for a}} new bridge, a tally of usage showed that the foot ferry was being used 700 times per day. The new <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge</b> was opened in 1889, {{although}} it needed the financial support of the brewer and philanthropist Michael Bass {{to pay for the}} construction, and later in 1898 to purchase the existing ferry rights so that it became free of tolls.|$|E

Dubbed the Philadelphia & Chester Branch, the line {{extended from the}} Gray's <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge</b> across the Schuylkill River in West Philadelphia to Ridley Creek in Ridley Junction in Delaware County. The segment included 4.9 miles of double track and 16.7 miles of single track, including sidings and turnouts.|$|E
25|$|Chesil Beach is {{a popular}} {{location}} for sea angling, with access at Chiswell, <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Abbotsbury, Cogden, Burton Bradstock and West Bay. Angling is also allowed in the lower Fleet from the shore. Commercial fishing, which often involved seine nets, has now virtually disappeared from Chesil Beach compared {{with the level of}} activity a century ago. Within the Fleet there is still a small controlled fishery for eels using fyke nets. The grey mullet is a common fish of the Fleet, occurring in large numbers along its entire length.|$|E
25|$|A rifle range, {{built around}} 1907, is {{situated}} on Chesil Beach, near <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge.</b> It had 100 yard increments up to 800 yards, and some remains of this structure {{can still be}} seen today. The Royal Navy operated a minesweeping trials range off West Bexington for many years following World War II. It was abandoned in the mid-1980s. The cables came ashore under the beach at the West Bexington car park, and today the range control building can still be seen behind the car park, while one of the theodolite stations is located {{near the entrance to}} the Cogden Beach car park.|$|E

25|$|The river {{continues}} north-east, {{passing the}} village of Walton-on-Trent until it reaches the large town of Burton upon Trent. The river in Burton is crossed {{by a number of}} bridges including the ornate 19th-century <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge</b> that links Stapenhill to the town. To the north-east of Burton the river is joined by the River Dove at Newton Solney and enters Derbyshire, before passing between the villages of Willington and Repton where it turns directly east to reach Swarkestone Bridge. Shortly afterwards, the river becomes the Derbyshire-Leicestershire border, passing the traditional crossing point of King's Mill, Castle Donington, Weston-on-Trent and Aston-on-Trent.|$|E
25|$|From West Bay to Cliff End {{the beach}} is piled up against the cliff. At Cliff End a hollow forms behind the beach and at Abbotsbury a stretch of saline (or brackish) water called the Fleet Lagoon begins. The Fleet is home to many wading birds and Abbotsbury Swannery, and fossils {{can be found in}} the sand and mud. The Fleet connects to Portland Harbour at <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Initially a ferry boat was used to connect Portland to the mainland, until the first bridge was {{constructed}} in 1839. An iron bridge replaced this in 1896, and this was in turn replaced with a concrete bridge in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The Weymouth to Portland Railway {{line was}} opened in 1865, and built along the {{southern}} end of the beach. It closed to passengers in 1952 and finally closed to all traffic in 1965. The line included a viaduct across <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Over the last 150 years there have been a number of proposals to build a line from Weymouth to Bridport running the length of Chesil Beach. A line was built from Upwey to Abbotsbury but could not be continued through lack of money. A line was also built from Maiden Newton to Bridport and then onwards to West Bay. A more recent proposal was to build a light railway between Weymouth and West Bay.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, Burnsville was {{considered}} a long distance from downtown Minneapolis. Rail access came in 1864 and Burnsville became a resort town, with cottages along Crystal Lake as well as Orchard Lake and Marion Lake in nearby Lakeville. The Bloomington Ferry provided river crossings until 1889 when the original Bloomington <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge</b> was built. By 1920, the Lyndale Avenue Drawbridge opened next to Black Dog Lake, extending Minneapolis' first north south highway to the rural communities of southern Minnesota. Later the bridge, upgraded several times, would {{be replaced by the}} I-35W Minnesota River bridge. In 1950, just before the World War II postwar housing boom, Burnsville was still a quiet township with a population of 583 people. School was taught in a one-room schoolhouse containing eight grades.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, {{with renewed}} {{conflict}} with the Ojibwa nation, Chief Cloud Man relocated his band of the Mdewakanton Dakota from Lake Calhoun, Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis to an area named Oak Grove in southern Bloomington, close to present-day Portland Avenue. In 1843, Peter and Louisa Quinn, the first European settlers to live in Bloomington, built a cabin along the Minnesota River in this area. The government had sent them to teach farming methods to the Native Americans. Gideon Hollister Pond, a missionary, who had been following and recording the Dakota language from Cloud Man's band, relocated later that year, establishing Oak Grove Mission, his log cabin. Pond and his family held church services and taught the local Dakota school subjects and farming. Passage across the Minnesota River in Bloomington came in 1849 when William Chambers and Joseph Dean opened the Bloomington Ferry. The ferry remained operational until 1889, when the Bloomington <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge</b> was built.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, the United States, {{having failed}} to obtain from Colombia the right to build a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, {{which was part of}} that country, sent {{warships}} in support of Panamanian independence from Colombia. This being achieved, the new nation of Panama ceded to the Americans the rights they wanted in the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty. Over time, though, the existence of the Canal Zone, a political exclave of the United States that cut Panama geographically in half and had its own courts, police, and civil government, became a cause of conflict between the two countries. Demonstrations occurred {{at the opening of the}} Thatcher <b>Ferry</b> <b>Bridge,</b> now known as the Bridge of the Americas, in 1962 and serious rioting occurred in January 1964. This led to the United States easing its controls in the Zone. For example, Panamanian flags were allowed to be flown alongside American ones. After extensive negotiations, the Canal Zone ceased to exist on October 1, 1979, in compliance with provisions of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.|$|E
