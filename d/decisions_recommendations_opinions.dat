40|$|International audienceMany {{directors}} of chemicals companies see {{the proliferation of}} standards and norms as prejudicial to long-term business performance. Although there {{can no longer be}} any doubt that the motivational character of these standards and norms means that they are focused on the future and open the way to innovative research, manufacturing companies in this industry feel surrounded and beset by a constant stream of health, financial, environmental and other directives, tangled up in the obscurity of an excessively complex norm-setting environment and are torn between the contradictory positions taken by a multitude of normative institutions, certification organizations and local, national, European and international accreditation agencies. These three images are an accurate reflection of what is really felt within companies. On this basis, we may attempt to rank these European Union-style norms, which we can recognize as such from the multiplicity of terms used to describe them - rules, directives, obligatory <b>decisions,</b> <b>recommendations</b> and non-binding <b>opinions.</b> For this purpose, we will use the words "standard" and "norm" in their broadest sense, whilst emphasising that in the chemicals industry, notwithstanding the celebrated precautionary principle and aversion to risk-taking at every level of responsibility, standards and norms are regulatory in nature or form the basis for legislation, and are therefore legally-enforceable. They therefore come into the category of obligatory exogenous standards and norms, and are focused on four major areas: 1) commerce and trade, 2) accounting and financial information, 3) quality, safety and the environment and 4) labour relations and social issues at large...|$|R

40|$|Background: Auditing {{can support}} {{national}} democratic processes, national development and government good will. Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI), such as offices of Auditor General, publish consolidated reports on audit outcomes for local authorities, government departments, parastatals and related public entities. These reports identify broad areas analysed during audit exercises that often include financial management, governance, asset management, risk management, revenue collection and debt recovery. They highlight trends that were detected during audit exercises {{at the end}} of a financial year. The reports further show how records and records management affect audit exercises as well as financial management within the audited institutions. Objectives: The intention of the research was to ascertain the contribution of records management to audit opinions and accountability in financial management in Zimbabwean government entities. Method: A document analysis of Comptroller and Auditor General of Zimbabwe (CAGZ) ’s reports was used to identify the types of <b>decisions</b> and <b>recommendations</b> (audit <b>opinions)</b> issued, in juxtaposition to the records management issues raised. Results and Conclusion: This study shows that there is a strong correlation between records management concerns and audit opinions raised by the CAGZ’s narrative audit reports. Inadequate records management within government entities was associated with adverse and qualified opinions and, in some cases, unqualified opinions that had emphases of matter. There was a causal loop in which lack of documentary evidence of financial activities was the source cause of poor accounting and poor audit reports. Errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate records meant that government entities were not showing a true picture of their financial status and their financial statements could be materially misstated. As an important monitoring and control system, records management should be integrated into the accounting and auditing processes of government entities. </p...|$|R

The recognition of this fact has spurred the development of multicriteria methods which are capable of admitting and synthesizing incomplete preference information in hierarchical weighting models. These methods share similarities in that they (i) accommodate incomplete preference information through set inclusion, (ii) offer <b>decision</b> <b>recommendations</b> based on dominance concepts and decision rules, and (iii) support the iterative exploration of the decision maker’s preferences. In this Chapter, we review these methods which are jointly referred to by the term ‘preference programming’.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preference ratios in multiattribute evaluation (PRIME) method which supports {{the analysis of}} incomplete information in multiattribute weighting models. In PRIME, preference elicitation and synthesis is based on 1) the conversion of possibly imprecise ratio judgments into an imprecisely specified preference model, 2) the use of dominance structures and decision rules in deriving <b>decision</b> <b>recommendations,</b> and 3) the sequencing of the elicitation process {{into a series of}} elicitation tasks. This process may be continued until the most preferred alternative is identified or, alternatively, stopped with a <b>decision</b> <b>recommendation</b> if the <b>decision</b> maker is prepared to accept the possibility that the value of some other alternative is higher. An extensive simulation study on the computational properties of PRIME is presented. The method is illustrated with a re-analysis of an earlier case study on international oil tanker negotiations...|$|R
