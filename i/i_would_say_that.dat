25|$|Conservative Judaism {{has always}} been premised on the total embrace of {{critical}} inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is a mitzvah {{to learn about the}} world and the way it works {{to the best of our}} abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.|$|E
25|$|In conclusion, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> however {{great the}} {{scientific}} {{importance of this}} discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, {{and that it will}} continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{this problem}} of AIDS cannot be {{overcome}} merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, {{that is to say}} a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.|$|E

At the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, Burgess said he favored covering fewer Americans with health insurance. Burgess said, “If the numbers drop, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that’s</b> a good thing, because we’ve restored personal liberty in this country.” ...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the start}} of her career, Brandy has named Whitney Houston as her most {{prominent}} music and entertainment influence. Early in her career, she would often describe Houston as her “idol”, crediting her voice, music, and performances as critical to her, both personally and professionally. In a 2014 interview, Brandy stated that, “as a professional musician, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Whitney Houston is the greatest voice of all time.” She elaborates, saying “She was always the idea for me. I {{wanted to be like}} her, sing like her, and do everything she was doing.” Beginning the late 90’s, Houston would evolve as a personal friend and mentor to Brandy, with Houston nicknaming herself as Norwood’s “godmother”.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: [...] "It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it's {{probably}} something that the kid made up, {{but at the time}} I believed him." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I wouldn't {{characterize}} it {{as a good}} PR move. What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> is <b>that</b> we are always concerned when someone takes his own life, because as Americans, we value life, even the lives of violent terrorists who are captured waging war against our country." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} instinct," [...] said the Lady; [...] "and from the gravity with which you mention it, my reverend friend, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you {{supposed}} this singular jealousy of my favourite Wolf, was not only well founded, but justifiable. But perhaps you speak in jest?" ...|$|R
500|$|Vows of {{resistance}} from the self-declared president of Anjouan were met with stern words from the AU envoy, saying [...] "He will be overwhelmed...I am afraid {{to say that if}} he tries to do that, it will be the end of him physically, if necessary." [...] In an interview with IRIN, Mohamed Bacar said: [...] " [...] Sambi does not know anything concerning the military, but if I had to advise him <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it's not the solution. The first time [...] the army came we kicked them out. The second time [...] the army came we kicked them out. That means that if they try to come a third time we will kick them out." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Raul Hilberg, Finkelstein {{displays}} [...] "academic {{courage to}} speak the truth when no one else is out there to support him... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> his place in the whole history of writing history is assured, and that those who in the end are proven right triumph, and he will be among those who will have triumphed, albeit, it so seems, at great cost." [...] In a peer review for Beyond Chutzpah, Avi Shlaim said that Finkelstein [...] "has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious American-Jewish scholarship on the Arab-Israeli conflict." [...] He praised Finkelstein for [...] "all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous: erudition, originality, spark, meticulous attention to detail, intellectual integrity, courage, and formidable forensic skills." ...|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} {{slightly}} more critical review, awarded it a [...] "B". He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes like this one in general and don't necessarily need the show to make me laugh, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> might <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the young}} French general praised {{me for my}} bravery in {{bringing}} the information; that I was complimented by all the officers for having shown so much of courage as to walk that short distance {{from the town of}} York to Williamsburg, and that my father clasped me in his arms calling me a hero; but I cannot tell such a story because nothing of the kind happened.|$|R
60|$|Before closing this sketch, however, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> briefly, <b>that</b> {{in all my}} {{writings}} I {{have always}} tried--how far successfully I know not--to {{advance the cause of}} Truth and Light, and to induce my readers to put their trust in the love of God our Saviour, for this life as well as the life to come.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{children}} later said: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a child's testimony {{in the company of}} Liz McLean at the time reliable. She was a very manipulativewoman, and she would write what she wanted to write. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> doubt any child supposedly making allegations in that situation."

500|$|In retrospect, Swift {{has stated}} that the song was {{something}} typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time, adding [...] "I didn't know anything then." [...] She explained, [...] "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, the way that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{and the way that}} I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Jackman {{confirmed}} that Aronofsky would direct the film. Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, {{going to be out}} of the box. It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E
500|$|Common law constitutionalism, a {{view that}} there are {{fundamental}} constitutional values that are protected even from interference by Parliament, had become increasingly popular {{at the time of}} Jackson. Four recent cases had found that [...] "in the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts [...] presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual". There had also been extrajudicial comments by serving judges that parliamentary sovereignty may not be absolute: Lord Woolf had written that [...] "if Parliament did the unthinkable, then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> courts would also be required to act in a manner which was without precedent" [...] while John Laws had argued that [...] "ultimate sovereignty rests ... not with those who wield governmental power, but in the conditions under which they are permitted to do so. The constitution, not the Parliament, is in this sense sovereign". However, Jackson contained the first express support from judges acting in their official capacity for the proposition that courts might have the authority to strike down an Act of Parliament if it violated fundamental constitutional principles (albeit obiter). This was a significant challenge to the orthodox view of parliamentary sovereignty, expressed by Albert Venn Dicey, that Parliament can make and unmake law on any topic and that no body can make a higher form of law than Parliament or set aside primary legislation.|$|E

5000|$|Zimeray has {{commented that}} he does not like the {{expression}} that France is [...] "the country of human rights" [...] and stated [...] "I know the state of French prisons... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>say</b> <b>that</b> France and Human Rights are like an old couple, and as with every couple there are ups and downs.|$|R

2500|$|President Barack Obama {{called the}} bomb attempt a [...] "sobering {{reminder}} of the times in which we live", and said that Americans [...] "will not cower in fear" [...] {{as a result of}} it. He telephoned Duane Jackson, one of the vendors, to thank him for alerting police. Attorney General Eric Holder called it a [...] "terrorist act". White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, similarly, said [...] "Anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in Times Square, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> was intended to terrorize, absolutely. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> whoever did that would be categorized as a terrorist, yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a New Scientist {{interview}} {{published on}} 21 January 2015, Wilson said that [...] "Religion 'is dragging us down' {{and must be}} eliminated '{{for the sake of}} human progress, and [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> for the sake of human progress, the best thing we could possibly do would be to diminish, to the point of eliminating, religious faiths." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I {{got into}} jazz when I got into Woody Herman's band because that band was sorta jazz-oriented. They had records. It {{was the first}} band I ever joined where the musicians carried records on the road... Duke Ellington records... Woody Herman discs [...] Charlie Barnet V-Discs... That's the first time I sort of got into jazz. The first time I sort of felt that I was {{anything}} remotely connected with jazz.|$|E
5000|$|Kool Moe Dee adds, [...] "in 2002 Eminem {{created the}} song that got the first Oscar in Hip-Hop history Yourself... and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> his flow is the most {{dominant}} right now (2003)".|$|R
40|$|Certain areas {{related to}} the topics under {{discussion}} here lie outside my field; for instance the evaluation of risk assessment and security deficiencies in the transport sector. What has convinced me {{of the importance of}} this subject are a few very general conclusions, indeed <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> impressions, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have drawn from the truly remarkable development of our powers to analyse the risk decision-making process over some years now.

2500|$|Journalist James Traub {{wrote that}} [...] "Manhattan is a remorseless place to which its {{citizens}} are peculiarly adapted. and of which out-of-towners seem unaccountably fond.

"During my 35 {{years of}} service, I've been {{fortunate}} in coming in contact with... practically all (of the leaders) of the Air Force during that period, and we've {{had a great}} number of very good ones. All of them of course, have made an impact, not only with me, but on everyone else that was in the Air Force at the time. If I had to single out any one, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Robert Olds made the greatest impact." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historian Diana Pinto, who is of Italian Jewish descent, wrote a {{rejoinder}} to Goldberg's {{article in}} The New Republic, arguing that his article is excessively dire. She wrote: [...] "If a plaster cast may {{be permitted to}} speak, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Goldberg and his colleagues aren’t describing my reality; the world I come from isn't already destroyed; {{and the story of}} the Jews in Europe isn’t yet ready to be relegated to museums or to antiquarian sites like Pompeii." ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial title, Ruddygore, was changed: {{because of}} claims that [...] "ruddy" [...] was too {{similar to the}} then-taboo curse word [...] "bloody", it was shortly changed to Ruddigore. [...] Gilbert's {{response}} to being told they meant the same thing was: [...] "Not at all, for {{that would mean that}} if I said that I admired your ruddy countenance, which <b>I</b> do, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> liked your bloody cheek, which I don't." ...|$|R

500|$|Israel sharply {{condemned}} {{the release of}} the Munich perpetrators and accused West Germany of having [...] "capitulated to terrorism". Prime Minister Golda Meir stated on the following day: [...] "We have been depressed since yesterday, aggrieved and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> insulted, <b>that</b> the human spirit, so weak and helpless, has surrendered to brutal force." [...] Foreign Minister Abba Eban filed an official protest note with the West German government, and the Israeli ambassador in Bonn was temporarily called back, officially due to consultations.|$|R
