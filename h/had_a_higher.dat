5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled {{where there was no}} radio playing.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated that it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, {{in view of the}} relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones.|$|E

A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs.

5|$|The Dutch Navy {{had already}} {{acquired}} {{a quantity of}} the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> rate of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for shipboard use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E

Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted in the nose. Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> rate of fire than the M39A2.|$|E

In addition, they carried an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class.
