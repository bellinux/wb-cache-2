40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the development of}} University education vis-à-vis the emergence and development of digital libraries in Nigeria Universities with specific reference to Northwest Nigeria. The concepts of digital library and as well its objectives in a university system, and services provided such as network services, digital preservation and quick reference were discussed. In addition prospects and benefits of digital library services like <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> content, access {{wide range of services}} and scholarly publishing among others were identified. The paper highlighted funding, infrastructure and technology as challenges facing the application of digital libraries in northwest Universities and concludes that, though they are faced with numerous challenges, however, the university libraries could gradually overcome such challenges in the course of time especially through library collaboration. Finally the paper recommends that the virtual library project of the Nigerian University Commission (NUC) should be well funded and managed to support the digital Libraries in various Universities. Also, there is need for CULNU to ensure a unify method of linking Nigeria University Libraries together through a particular network, among others...|$|R

The <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> <b>local</b> telecommunication network significantly improved {{the quality of the}} telecommunication networks, provided network subscribers with new services, and made it possible to organize high-speed dial-up internet {{for a wide range of}} users. The transport network of the company is organized on the basis of fiber-optic and microwave links, using advanced SDH network technologies that provide multilevel network control. The company provides internet access through the International Packet Switching Center to all internet providers in Uzbekistan. Internet and data network access is implemented by branches of the company via leased lines using xDSL technology and RadioEthernet or dial-up access. Uztelecom provides international telephone services via two international switching centers, maintaining partnership relations with over 20 international operators.

40|$|With the {{development}} of the process of transition to information society that emerged as a result of globalization, against the threat of loss of societies’ original identity, many local reflexes have developed. It became inevitable for many local institutions to take on responsibilities with these reflexes while saving cultural elements and values specific to the region, district and while transmitting them to the future. One of these institutions is the public libraries. This has become a necessity for public libraries, which are local cultural institutions, to take on important roles in the protection <b>of</b> their <b>local</b> culture and their provision of services as well as the mission of fulfilling the cultural and educational needs of the society in which they exist. Public libraries should stand against the cultural erosion caused by the information age, with the technology that again the information age offers. Digitization [...] .

40|$|Background: The {{nature of}} {{synaptic}} transmission at functionally distinct synapses in intestinal reflex pathways {{has not been}} fully identified. In this study, we investigated whether transmission between interneurons in the descending inhibitory pathway is mediated by a purine acting at P 2 Y receptors to produce slow excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs). Methodology/Principal findings: Myenteric neurons from guinea-pig ileum in vitro were impaled with intracellular microelectrodes. Responses to distension 15 mm oral to the recording site, in a separately perfused stimulation chamber and to electrical stimulation <b>of</b> <b>local</b> nerve <b>trunks</b> were recorded. A subset of neurons, previously identified as nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive descending interneurons, responded to both stimuli with slow EPSPs that were reversibly abolished by {{a high concentration of}} PPADS (30 mM, P 2 receptor antagonist). When added to the central chamber of a three chambered organ bath, PPADS concentration-dependently depressed transmission through that chamber of descending inhibitory reflexes, measured as inhibitory junction potentials in the circular muscle of the anal chamber. Reflexes evoked by distension in the central chamber were unaffected. A similar depression of transmission was seen when the specific P 2 Y 1 receptor antagonist MRS 2179 (10 mM) was in the central chamber. Blocking either nicotinic receptors (hexamethonium 200 mM) or 5 -HT 3 receptors (granisetron 1 mM) together with P 2 receptors had no greater effect than blocking P 2 receptors alone...|$|R
40|$|Objective To examine using surface {{electromyography}} whether stair climbing with abdominal hollowing (AH) {{is better}} at facilitating <b>local</b> <b>trunk</b> muscle activity than stair climbing without AH. Methods Twenty healthy men with {{no history of}} low back pain participated in the study. Surface electrodes were attached to the multifidus (MF), lumbar erector spinae, thoracic erector spinae, transverse abdominus- internal oblique abdominals (TrA-IO), external oblique abdominals (EO), and the rectus abdominis. Amplitudes of electromyographic signals were measured during stair climbing. Study participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for each muscle in various positions to normalize the surface electromyography data. Results AH during stair climbing resulted in significant increases in normalized MVCs in both MFs and TrA-IOs (p< 0. 05). <b>Local</b> <b>trunk</b> muscle/global trunk muscle ratios were higher during stair climbing with AH as compared with stair climbing without AH. Especially, right TrA-IO/EO and left TrA-IO/EO were significantly increased (p< 0. 05). Conclusion Stair climbing with AH activates <b>local</b> <b>trunk</b> stabilizing muscles better than stair climbing without AH. The findings suggest that AH during stair climbing contributes to trunk muscle activation and trunk stabilization...|$|R

40|$|Texture {{mapping of}} 3 D {{digitized}} data is a challenge. This arises mainly due to two factors: i) <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> geometry and ii) <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> textures.

Second, due to <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> textures, we get another basket of textures that represent the digitized texture of the whole object. Unfortunately, {{there is little or}} no correspondence between the digitized geometry and digitized texture. The challenge is to automatically identify the correspondence between the merged geometry and merged texture and then to perform an intelligent texture mapping.
