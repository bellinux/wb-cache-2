40|$|Commonly called “bubblegum coral’, Paragorgia is a genus of cold-water gorgonian coral {{that has}} a broad global {{distribution}} and is eurybathic from depths of meters to kilometers.

In this study we compare the genetic distances of various Paragorgia spp. across their distribution and depth range along the Canadian mid-Atlantic margin using 18 S ribosomal DNA sequences.   Morphometric and 18 <b>S</b> <b>evidence</b> show that although appearing similar, only one species of cold-water Paragorgia, called P. arborea, predominates in this region.   However, 18 <b>S</b> <b>evidence</b> from corals collected at deep depths located at one site, called the Stone Fence, indicate that a significant amount of divergence exists and other species may also be present.   Such new light provides a need for further genetic testing using alternative methods (e. g. microsatellites), which could reveal new lineages that may have considerable ecological and/or taxonomic importance. </p...|$|R

A large proportion of this discussion has focused on removing child witnesses from the courtroom and developing alternative arrangements by which children can give evidence (e. g., videotaped statements used as evidence-in-chief, closed-circuit television). There is no doubt that these arrangements have {{played a major role in}} reducing children 2 ̆ 7 s feelings of uncertainty and intimidation, and they have increased the ability of children 10 tell their stories and answer questions reliably (Cashmore 2002; Eastwood & Patton 2002).

40|$|Psalm 104 {{paints a}} picture of Yahweh dressed in the royal robes of both Aten and Baal. The variety of {{references}} to Ancient Near Eastern gods points to a rich and complicated history {{of the origins of}} Psalm 104, Israel and Israelite theology. The origins of Psalm 104 in all likelyhood include oral traditions, cultic contexts and years of redactional rearrangement and rewriting. Akhenaten used a centralised cult and monolatrism to achieve political stability in Egypt. Years later Hammurabi used Marduk as chief deity in Babylonia to centralise power and create political and religious stability in his kingdom. It is within this Ancient Near Eastern tradition of using religion and one specific deity to achieve political stability that Psalm 104 finds its origins and cultic context. The early Israelite monarchy finds itself amidst uncertain political circumstances. The early kings used a centralised monarchy and monolatrism to achieve economic and political stability. The early Israelite government also used other Egyptian influences including governing methods, policies and the use of Egyptian scribes. The monarchy used cultic personal to communicate politically sanctioned theology and contact between cultic personal and Egyptian scribes intertwined with a Canaanite heritage has a cosmopolitan and culturally diverse Psalm 104 at its end. The psalm is used as a war liturgy, with Chaoskampf-motifs to legitimise the Israelite <b>king</b> <b>s</b> military action and kingship. This is done by ritual re-enactment on cultic level connecting Yahweh s mythic action to that of the <b>king</b> <b>s</b> present conflict.

While Nash bargaining is sufficient to capture the labor share countercyclicality, we show that countercyclical markups are key to address the overshooting...|$|R
