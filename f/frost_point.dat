5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} <b>frost</b> <b>point,</b> as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

Type 1 PSCs show low depolarization ratios and scattering ratios which approach intermediate limiting values as ambient temperature decreases. These data suggest that Type 1 particles formed by rapid cooling may be nearly spherical and are restricted in size by partitioning of a limited HNO 3 vapor supply among many competing growth sites.

5000|$|The colorpoint {{pattern is}} most {{commonly}} associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter {{version of the same}} color {{on the rest of the}} body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal points (dark brown), chocolate points (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or <b>frost</b> <b>points</b> (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a temperature sensitive mutation in one of the enzymes in the metabolic pathway from tyrosine to pigment, such as melanin; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between the ice coatings and frost spicules arises {{from the fact that}} the crystalline spicules grow directly from desublimation of water vapour from air, and desublimation is not a factor in icing of freezing surfaces. For desublimation to proceed the surface must be below the <b>frost</b> <b>point</b> of the air, meaning that it is sufficiently cold for ice to form without passing through the liquid phase. The air must be humid, but not sufficiently humid to permit the condensation of liquid water, or icing will result instead of desublimation.

Such freezing may be promoted by effects such as flood frost or frost pocket.

40|$|International audienceWe compare Gravity Waves (GW) and Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) {{above the}} Antarctic Peninsula for winters (June to September) between 2006 and 2010. GW {{activity}} is inferred from stratospheric temperature and vertical winds from the Weather and Research Forecast mesoscale model (WRF), and documented {{as a function}} of time and geography for the studied period. Significant GW activity affects 36 % of days and follows the Peninsula orography closely. Volumes of PSC, composed of ice and Nitric Acid Trihydrate (NAT), are retrieved using observations from the spaceborne lidar CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization). They are documented against GW activity {{as a function of}} time and longitude. Sixty-three percent of ice PSC are observed during GW events, when the average volume of PSC per profile doubles. Maximum ice PSC volumes are seen directly over the Peninsula (65 °W), while maximum NAT PSC volumes appear downstream further East (~ 35 °W). Effects of GW events on NAT PSC are felt as far East as 40 °E. Our results support the importance of gravity waves as a major mechanism driving the evolution of ice PSC in the area, but the effects on NAT PSC are harder to detect. After a GW event ends, volumes of ice PSC get back to their usual levels in less than 24 h, while this process takes more than 48 h for NAT PSC. Daily profiles of H 2 O and HNO 3 mixing ratios, retrieved from MLS observations, are used to derive ice and NAT <b>frost</b> <b>points</b> with altitude and time. Combining these <b>frost</b> <b>points</b> with modeled stratospheric temperatures, the volumes of air able to support ice and NAT crystals are quantified and compared with PSC volumes. Correlation is high for ice crystals, but not for NAT, consistent with their much slower nucleation mechanisms. Observations of ice PSC over the domain are followed by a strong increase (+ 50 - 100 %) in NAT PSC formation efficiency 2 to 6 h later. This increase is followed by a steep drop (6 - 10 h later) and a longer period of slow decline (10 - 24 h later), {{at the end of which}} the NAT PSC formation efficiency is less than half its initial value. The fact that these effects tend to cancel each other out, coupled to the important lag in NAT PSC reaction to GW activity, suggest why it is especially difficult to quantify how GW activity impacts NAT PSC cover. © 2012 American Geophysical Union.

Cloud surfaces promote heterogeneous reactions that convert stable chlorine and bromine-based molecules into photochemically active ones. As spring nears, and the sun reappears and rises, photolysis decomposes these partitioned compounds into individual halogen atoms that react with and catalytically destroy thousands of ozone molecules before they are stochastically neutralized. Despite a generic understanding of the ozone hole paradigm, many key components of the system, such as cloud occurrence, phase, and composition; particle growth mechanisms; and denitrification of the lower stratosphere have yet to be fully resolved. Satellite-based observations have dramatically improved the ability to detect PSC and quantify seasonal polar chemical partitioning. However, coverage directly over the Antarctic plateau is limited by polar-orbiting tracks that rarely exceed 80 degrees S.

To avoid such risks, experimental data and modelling of solid-fluid equilibrium {{should be used to}} optimize the design and operations. The objective of this work was to get {{a better understanding of the}} fundamentals of solid-fluid phase equilibrium. The specific focus of this work was to study solid-fluid phase behavior in systems of solid CO 2, heavy hydrocarbons(HHC) and hydrate in equilibria with natural gas at low temperatures. Experimental methods for measuring solid-fluid equilibrium data in natural gas systems at low temperatures were extensively reviewed, and important and practical issues for designing experimental systems were summarized. The <b>frost</b> <b>points</b> in the CO 2 -methane systems (CO 2 mole fraction 0. 108 to 0. 542) were measured in this work. Meanwhile, in another experimental setup, the water content in the gas phase was measured in the hydratemethane and hydrate-natural gas systems down to temperature 238. 15 K. These data, together with data from other researchers, were used to verify the thermodynamic models. It is expensive and time-consuming to get experimental data at low temperatures, thus it is important to verify and use thermodynamic models to predict the solid-fluid phase behaviors. In the systems of solid CO 2 and HHC in equilibrium with natural gas systems, the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) Equation of State (EOS) and simplified Perturbed-Chain Statistic Associating Fluid Theory (sPC-SAFT) EOS were used to calculate the fugacities in fluid phases. For solid phase, one fugacity model based on sublimation pressures and one model based on subcooled liquid were used. For correlating and predicting the hydrate behaviors, the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) EOS was used to model fluid phases and the hydrate-forming conditions were modelled by the solid solution theory of van der Waals and Platteeuw. Examples of applications of this work in LNG plant were illustrated, and the applications in other gas processing technologies were introduced.
