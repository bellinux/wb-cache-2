The leaf chlorophyll content, mass loss (ML), relative water content (RWC), soluble sugars levels, reducings (RED), non-reducings and starch were determined. In leaves stored at 25 ºC, the ML was higher when leaves were hydrocooled. The highest RWC resulted from the use of plastic bag, which prevented the leaves from wilting for a longer period of time. The soluble sugars levels varied according to the increase or decrease in RWC. The contents of RED decreased with the time of storage at 25 °C. The cold storage increased the shelf life of ora-pro-nobis by 168 hours. The <b>hydrocooling</b> increased the RWC of leaves, although it did not influence the shelf life.

40|$|Due to {{the short}} post harvest life of {{tropical}} fruits like mangoes, precooling is an important post harvest unit operationr. There are several techniques commercially employed such as <b>hydrocooling,</b> mechanical cooling augmented by liquid nitrogen, air cooling. The precooling process should be as fast as possible, but the cooling should not result in any chilling injury to the fruit. Liquid nitrogen has high cooling capacity and due to the inertness of the vaporized nitrogen gas, is very much applicable for preccoling purposes. Its boiling point is – 195. 6 oC.

Os frutos foram analisados após 35 dias a - 0, 5 °C, mais dois e quatro dias a 20 °C. Verificou-se menor síntese de etileno nos frutos submetidos ao resfriamento lento e ao resfriamento com ar forçado, durante o período a 20 °C. Nesses frutos, a quantidade de suco livre foi significativamente menor após quatro dias a 20 °C, demonstrando uma aparente relação entre a reduzida síntese de etileno e a baixa suculência, o que é uma manifestação de lanosidade. Os frutos resfriados de forma lenta apresentaram firmeza da polpa mais elevada. Todas as formas de resfriamento com a água na temperatura de 1 °C resultaram em maior porcentagem de frutos com manchas na epiderme, possivelmente em razão da baixa temperatura da água do pré-resfriador, indicando que o resfriamento em água não é recomendado para pêssegos 'Chiripá'.

In separate experiments, cherries were also infested with codling moth larvae and subjected to similar hot water bath heating. The quality attributes showed different sensitivity to the combinations of temperature and time used for hot water bath treatment. Pitting was more common in fruit treated at lower temperatures for longer times, while stem browning was more common in fruit treated at high temperatures. Berry browning, stem color, and pitting were the quality attributes most affected by heat treatment. Browning of cherry stem color was a crucial factor in determining whether a combination of temperature and time for hot water bath treatment was successful. All cherries stored at 0 ◦C for 14 days to simulate sea shipment were of unacceptable quality after shelf life.

Detailed processing information was not published in order to avoid disclosure of individual operations. ● The total cost to produce an acre of fresh peaches amounts to approximately $ 4, 110 /acre (2). Total Cost Breakdown: ● Preharvest costs (pruning, thinning, pest control, mowing, and fertilizer) [...] $ 1, 000 /acre ● Harvest costs (assuming 450 boxes per acre) —$ 585 /acre ● Storage, <b>hydrocooling</b> and packing costs [...] $ 2, 025 /acre ● Overhead costs (varies depending on year) [...] $ 500 /acre Production Regions The peach growing regions were recently consolidated from six districts. This was due to a continual {{decline in the number of}} growers as well as the acres of trees grown. Currently, there are three general fruit producing areas in Virginia, the Northern, Central and Southern regions. The greatest number of peaches is produced within the northern region, followed by the central and then southern sections. Compared to the 1992 Virginia Apple and Peach Survey, tree numbers were up 9 % in 1997 in the area previously designated as District VI (Northern Piedmont) while declining in all other regions (1). The The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. state now has 1, 781 total acres of peaches, down 1, 563 acres from 1992...|$|E
40|$|Horticultural produce {{begins to}} {{deteriorate}} {{as soon as}} it is harvested. It begins to lose its flavour and texture, and it is susceptible to infection by pathogens. An effective method of slowing the loss in quality is to cool the produce as soon as possible after harvest. Many crops, such as pome fruits, asparagus, broccoli, peas and beans can be cooled within half an hour or so by drenching them with chilled water in a device known as a hydrocooler. The project described in this report was initiated by Mr Nick Christou of Christou Logistical Services. He was using a water chilling unit to cool water which he sprayed onto vegetables after which the water was discharged. This procedure was a waste of water and energy. He required a hydrocooler capable of cooling up to 6 tonnes per hour of produce, and that is transportable from growing region to growing region, and which is water-efficient. The Smart Water Fund grant enabled a hydrocooler that incorporated water recirculation to be developed and built jointly by Victoria University and Wobelea Pty Ltd. The strategy of recirculating water has reduced the water consumption from a required 60, 000 litres per tonne of broccoli cooled to about 75 litres per tonne. When round fruit such as apples are cooled the water consumption is estimated to be about 35 litres per tonne. Measurements show that broccoli cools by 80 % of its possible cooling range, i. e. from 30 ÂºC when sprayed with water at 0 ÂºC, in about 35 minutes. The total electricity consumption is 20 kWh and 16 kWh when the throughputs are 4 tonnes per hour and 6 tonnes per hours respectively. If the water were not recirculated the electricity consumption would be about 300 kWh per tonne. Outcomes of the project include: The design and operation of a recirculating <b>hydrocooling</b> system. A demonstration that the new system cools horticultural produce to temperatures that will maintain the shelf life and quality of the produce. A demonstration that the hydrocooler is capabale of eliminating contaminants from the recirculated water over brief periods of time. The identification of improvements that can be made to the design of the system. The hydrocooler is now being successfully operated in Wesley Vale near Devonport Tasmania in conjunction with Riverside Australia, Werribee...|$|E
