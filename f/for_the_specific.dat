5|$|Brown {{formally}} {{described and}} named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He {{did not identify}} a type specimen, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not explicitly give an etymology <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Incandescent {{lights are}} filled with argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It is used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers.|$|E
5|$|Abantiades latipennis {{is one of}} {{fourteen}} species currently identified within the genus Abantiades, {{all of which are}} found exclusively in Australia. The species was first described in 1932 by Norman Tindale, an Australian entomologist and anthropologist. Tindale described the species, under its current name, but provided no etymology <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> epithet latipennis. He based the species description on specimens from Lorne (including the holotype male and allotype female), Pomonal and Mount Mistake (in the Langi Ghiran State Park), Victoria, and from Zeehan, Eaglehawk Neck and Launceston, Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The Barons of the Cinque Ports {{also participated}} in the ceremony. Formerly, the barons were {{the members of the}} House of Commons {{representing}} the Cinque Ports of Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Reforms in the 19thcentury, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular constituency system applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, barons were specially designated from among the city councillors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the barons were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the sovereign during the procession to and from Westminster Abbey. The last time the barons performed such a task was at the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1821. The barons did not return for the coronations of WilliamIV (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and Victoria. At coronations since Victoria's, the barons have attended the ceremony, but they have not carried canopies.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper {{hijacking}} {{marked the}} beginning of the end for unfettered and unscrutinized airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal sky marshal program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.|$|E

5|$|Spreckels and his {{partners}} William G. Irwin and F. F. Low formed the Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin {{known to have been}} spent, a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It was placed in a pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good) was in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving the coins, and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, the coins traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.|$|E
