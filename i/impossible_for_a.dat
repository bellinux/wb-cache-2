5|$|By {{allowing}} u to vary {{over all}} possible integers, an infinite family of solutions {{can be generated}} from a single solution (x1,y1). If the solutions are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only {{a finite number of}} solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a {{circuitous}} route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved {{around the edge of the}} hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E
5|$|Katsufumi Sato, a Japanese scientist, did {{calculations}} using modern {{birds and}} concluded that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pterosaur to stay aloft. In the book Posture, Locomotion, and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs it is theorized {{that they were able}} to fly due to the oxygen-rich, dense atmosphere of the Late Cretaceous period. However, both Sato and the authors of Posture, Locomotion, and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs based their research on the now outdated theories of pterosaurs being seabird-like, and the size limit does not apply to terrestrial pterosaurs, such as azhdarchids and tapejarids. Furthermore, Darren Naish concluded that atmospheric differences between the present and the Mesozoic were not needed for the giant size of pterosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester {{has suggested that}} it may be yawning. Its mouth is open to a degree <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> human skull. The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, Untitled, c. 1943, which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than {{a small number of}} powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E
5|$|They had {{submitted}} to three reductions of wages in three years; {{that they would}} have acquiesced in a moderate reduction; that they were frequently sent out on a trip to Martinsburg, and there detained four days at the discretion of the company, for which detention they were allowed pay but two day's time; that they were compelled to pay their board during the time they were detained, which was more than the wages they received; that they had nothing left with which to support their families; that {{it was a question of}} bread with them; that when times were dull on the road they could not get more than fifteen day's work in a month; that many sober, steady economical men became involved in debt last winter; that honest men had their wages attached because they could not meet their expenses; that by a rule of the company any man who had his wages attached should be discharged; that this was a tyranny to which no rational being should submit, and that it was utterly <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> man with a family to support himself and family at the reduced rate of wages.|$|E

5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no connection between the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. At the Times Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. The pedestrian bridge is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Aquinas' {{argument}} from first cause {{started with the}} premise that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> being to cause itself (because {{it would have to}} exist before it caused itself) and that it is impossible for there to be an infinite chain of causes, which would result in infinite regress. Therefore, there must be a first cause, itself uncaused.|$|E

25|$|Dawkins {{does not}} claim to {{disprove}} God with absolute certainty. Instead, he suggests as a general principle that simpler explanations are preferable (see Occam's razor) and that an omniscient or omnipotent God must be extremely complex (Dawkins argues that it is logically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> God to be simultaneously omniscient and omnipotent). As such {{he argues that the}} theory of a universe without a God is preferable to the theory of a universe with a God.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} theism, God {{is characterized}} as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is {{devoid of any}} anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists {{do not believe that}} God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict the transcendent nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.|$|E
