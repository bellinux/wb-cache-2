40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the possibility, form and key {{features of a}} jurisprudence or theory of law based on the philosophy of Theodor W. Adorno. The theory of law I propose draws on Adorno's critique of the thoroughgoing abstraction of contemporary society, which considers existence {{only in terms of}} universal concepts. I contend that the field of law provides a paradigmatic example of the operation of identity-thinking. In making this argument I draw on the jurisprudential theories of Ronald Dworkin, Roberto Mangabeira Unger and Alan Norrie in particular. I also draw on the work of J. M. Bernstein in proposing an brand of normative ethics based on Adorno's philosophy. I argue that the space between law's abstract <b>itemisation</b> <b>of</b> situations and subjects over which it passes judgment and the full, non-identical particularity of those situations and subjects forms a gap between the operation of law and the possibility of justice. By training its gaze to the gap itself and maintaining a self-reflective attitude towards its own distorting effects, I argue that an "Adornian" jurisprudence can more successfully avoid doing "violence" to the world it seeks to adjudicate. In particular, this jurisprudence would need to negotiate the space between the law's current reliance on universal ethical principles and a more substantial engagement with the situation presented for judgment, so as to ask how such a situation might give rise to its own, particular ethical response...|$|R

30|$|Call networks: The Dataset 1 {{contains}} the number (and duration) <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between any pair of antennae for every hour during a five month period. We construct {{three types of}} networks: (1) G^n_a=(A, N_a) is a directed weighted network where N_a = {n(a_i,a_j)} denotes the total number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between a_i and a_j; (2) G^d_a=(A,D_a) is also a directed weighted network where D_a={d(a_i,a_j)} denotes the total duration <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between a_i and a_j. We further map antennae into different levels of administrative areas based on their geo-location and aggregate the mobile communication flow (in terms of numbers or duration <b>of</b> <b>calls)</b> between pairs <b>of</b> administrative areas. For instance, G^n_d=(D,N_d) is a directed weighted network of department-to-department communication, where N_d={n(d_i,d_j)=∑_(a_u,a_v):a_u∈ d_i∧ a_v∈ d_j n(a_u,a_v)} denotes the total number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between department d_i and d_j, aggregated from their antenna records. Here mobile communications within the same department are ignored. Similarly, we generate call networks G^n_r (region-to-region number <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> G^n_p (pole-to-pole call volume), G^d_d (department-to-department duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> G^d_r (region-to-region duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> and G^d_p (pole-to-pole duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> respectively.|$|R

40|$|The Cruise Itinerary Schedule Design (CISD) problem {{determines the}} optimal {{sequence}} {{of a given}} set <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> (a port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is an intermediate stop in a cruise itinerary) and the arrival and departure times at each port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{in order to maximize}} the monetary value of the utility at ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> minus the fuel cost. To solve this problem, in view of the practical observations that most cruise itineraries do not have many ports <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> we first enumerate all sequences <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> and then optimize the arrival and departure times at each port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> by developing a dynamic programming approach. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose effective bounds on the monetary value of each sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> eliminating non-optimal sequences without invoking the dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results showthat, first, using the bounds on the profit of each sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> considerably improves the computational efficiency; second, the total profit of the cruise itinerary is sensitive to the fuel price and hence an accurate estimation of the fuel price is highly desirable; third, the optimal sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is not necessarily the sequencewith the shortest voyage distance, especially when the ports do not have a natural geographic sequence.

40|$|A novel call {{admission}} control (CAC) scheme for an adaptive heterogeneous multimedia mobile network with multiple classes <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> is investigated here.
