40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} short- and long-term effects <b>of</b> <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enterohepatic circulation (EHC) on hepatic cholesterol metabolism and biliary secretion in rats. For this purpose, we employed {{a technique that}} allows reversible <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EHC, during normal feeding conditions, and excludes effects of anaesthesia and surgical trauma. [3 H]Cholesteryl oleate-labelled human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was injected intravenously in rats with (1) chronically (8 days) interrupted EHC, (2) interrupted EHC at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> LDL injection and (3) intact EHC. During the first 3 h after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EHC, bile flow decreased to 50 % and biliary bile acid, phospholipid and cholesterol secretion to 5 %, 11 % and 19 % of their initial values respectively. After 8 days of bile diversion, biliary cholesterol output and bile flow were at that same level, but bile acid output was increased 2 - 3 -fold and phospholipid output was about 2 times lower. <b>The</b> total amount <b>of</b> cholesterol in <b>the</b> liver decreased after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EHC, which was mainly due to a decrease in <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> cholesteryl ester. Plasma disappearance of LDL was not affected by <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EHC. Biliary secretion of LDL-derived radioactivity occurred 2 - 4 times faster in chronically interrupted rats {{as compared with the}} excretion immediately after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EHC. Radioactivity was mainly in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> bile acids under both conditions. This study demonstrates the very rapid changes that occur in cholesterol metabolism and biliary lipid composition after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EHC. These changes {{must be taken into account}} in studies concerning hepatic metabolism of lipoprotein cholesterol and subsequent secretion into bile...|$|R

The arterial, central venous pressures, arterial blood pH, blood suger, serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and leucine aminopeptidase values were measured at various intervals during the experiment. The arterial and central venous pressures and portal venous pressure rose abruptly during and immediately after the interruption. All the dogs were hemodynamically more stable in Groups II and IV than in Groups I and III. The arterial bllod pH levels fell to 7. 2 - 7. 3 during the interruption and reached their lowest values 60 minutes after release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interruption.</b> The SGOT, SGPT and leucine aminopeptidase increased after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portal vein, though these levels Were higher in Groups I and III than in Groups II and IV.
