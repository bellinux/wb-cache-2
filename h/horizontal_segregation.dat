25|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> {{refers to}} {{differences}} {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> is in our society.|$|E
25|$|Gender egalitarian {{cultural}} principles, {{or changes}} in traditional gender norms, are one possible solution to occupational segregation {{in that they}} reduce discrimination, affect women's self-evaluations, and support structural changes. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>segregation,</b> however, is more resistant to change from simply modern egalitarian pressures. Changes in norms may reinforce the impact of occupational integration in that once people see women in traditionally male-dominated occupations, their expectations about women {{in the labor market}} might be changed.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the under-researched institutional design of the educational system as an explanation for <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation.</b> We are {{particularly interested in the}} linkage between education and employment, {{as well as in the}} role played by vocational education and training (VET) in the transmission of gender segregation from education into the labour market. Previous research has shown that educational systems with strong vocational orientation exhibit stronger <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> compared to general educational systems (Reisel et al. 2015). We assume that in a country-context with extended VET the linkage between education and employment is especially pronounced, and that the gender segregation in education is therefore transmitted to a greater extent into the labour market.|$|R
40|$|School-to-work {{transitions}} {{are embedded}} in the institutional structures of educational systems. In particular, vocational education {{has been linked to}} greater <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> in employment. Similarly, research on higher education has uncovered how stratification at the tertiary level can promote gender segregation in the labour market. This paper investigates how gender typical employment is conditioned by the institutional features of the educational system in Bulgaria. Despite the post-socialist transformations of Bulgaria's educational system and its labour market, <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> has remained rather moderate from an international perspective. We use data from a 2012 nationally representative survey. We find that the educational system shapes the gendered occupational trajectories for men but it does not hold the same explanatory power for women. Neither vocational nor higher education has a significant effect for women. In contrast, men with vocational education are more likely to work in male-typed occupations and, in line with the literature, higher education steers men toward gender mixed and a-typical occupations. Our study points to the importance of educational institutional factors in shaping gender (a) -typical career paths. The Bulgarian case, in particular, offers insights into the mechanisms that can potentially decrease <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> in the labour market...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{describing}} {{shifts in}} <b>horizontal</b> sex <b>segregation</b> in the Swedish labour market between 1990 and 2003. The study adds to previous studies by exploring changes {{in three dimensions}} of <b>horizontal</b> sex <b>segregation,</b> i. e. in workplace, organizational and occupational sex segregation, and by using data including all Swedes over 15 years of age at each year of measurement. The focus is on changes in the sex distribution at workplaces and on the changes {{that occurred during the}} recession {{in the beginning of the}} 1990 s. The estimates show that there is hardly any change in the overall level of <b>horizontal</b> sex <b>segregation</b> in the Swedish labour market between 1990 and 2003. The trend towards a more equal sex distribution across occupations seems, however, to continue between 1990 and 2001, although the change between 2001 and 2003 is non-existing. Up until the recession in the mid- 1990 s, the level of workplace and organizational sex segregation decreased, but afterward it increased somewhat. Moreover, the greater outflow of men from the labour market during the recession can be one explanation to the decrease in share of employees at male dominated workplaces and increase in share of employees at highly female dominated workplaces at these time points. The study clearly shows that the political goals to sex integrate the Swedish labour market have not been realized. The Swedish labour market continues to be profoundly horizontally sex segregated to present day, and the analyses give no optimistic view on future changes towards labour market sex integration. labour market; sex segregation; Sweden; workplace; organization; occupation...|$|R

Further along in the research career, women represented 44% of grade C academic staff, 37% of grade B academic staff and 20% of grade A academic staff.11 These trends are intensified in science, with women making up 31% {{of the student population}} at the tertiary level to 38% of PhD students and 35% of PhD graduates. At the faculty level, they make up 32% of academic grade C personnel, 23% of grade B and 11% of grade A. The proportion of women among full professors is lowest in engineering and technology, at 7.9%. With respect to representation in science decision-making, in 2010 15.5% of higher education institutions were headed by women and 10% of universities had a female rector.|$|E
500|$|Despite women's {{increasing}} {{participation in}} the work force, a gender division of labor persist. There are a number of constraints in the labor market that contribute to the double burden. [...] "Women are disproportionately represented in informal work and concentrated among lower-quality jobs within self-employment." [...] The informal market is generally precarious and characterized by low wages, few benefits, and a lack of social protections that are offered in the formal market. Even within the formal market, there is occupational segregation and a gender wage gap. Occupational segregation can be either horizontal or vertical: <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> limits women to certain sectors and occupations, while vertical segregation restricts them to particular positions within occupational hierarchies. Men and women are even found at different levels of the occupational hierarchy. The [...] "glass ceiling" [...] is the relative absence of women in senior or managerial positions due to institutional barriers and norms. Even in female-dominated occupations, men often occupy the more skilled and better paid positions.|$|E

40|$|First {{published}} online: 19 June 2015 Using {{retrospective data}} from the Russian Education and Employment Survey (EES), we examine labour market entry in Russia in terms of changes in <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> and vertical gender inequalities {{before and after the}} collapse of the Soviet regime in 1991.

Moreover, horizontal differences seem to be driving vertical gender inequalities in terms of entry into authoritative positions. Accounting for heterogeneity in education and the entered branch, we find that despite gender equality principles and full-time employment for women, vertical gender inequalities had already existed under the Soviet regime. However, these increased during the liberalization reforms. These growing vertical gender inequalities can be traced back mainly to a worsening of female chances in an economic transition, whereas there was no significant change for male entrants. Furthermore, women seem to be particularly disadvantaged among highly qualified entrants.

50|$|Occupational gender {{segregation}} {{takes the form}} of both <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> (the unequal gender distribution across occupations) and vertical segregation (the overrepresentation of men in higher positions in both traditionally male and traditionally female fields).|$|E
5000|$|The gendered income {{disparity}} {{can also}} be attributed in part to occupational segregation, where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender. Occupational gender segregation can be understood [...] to contain two components or dimensions; <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> and vertical segregation. With <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregation,</b> occupational sex segregation occurs {{as men and women}} are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor. With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{distinction}} of qualification space (education systems with high vocational specificity), organizational space (educational systems that convey more general skills), and assumptions on how institutional dimensions impact on gender segregation in education and employment, we formulated and tested three hypotheses using data from national youth surveys. First, we assumed that overall <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> in education is higher in Switzerland than in Bulgaria due to the greater importance of vocational education in the former country. Dissimilarity indices have confirmed those assumptions about higher gender segregation rates in Switzerland.|$|R
40|$|Women {{managers}} are highly under-represented in the UK construction industry, which is typically considered as male-dominated, despite the various initiatives {{taken by the}} government and other organisations to improve the status of women in construction. The vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregations</b> in the industry are clearly evident for the less number of women in top managerial level and in mainstream construction respectively. The industry has been facing many challenges, including skills, labour shortages and recruitment difficulties, for many years now. Therefore widening the recruitment pool with potential candidates, targeting at non-traditional entrants, has become a necessity. This further emphasises to give more consideration on equality and diversity issues. But in reality little has been changed when looking at the number of women entering, retaining and progressing in the construction. Number of research studies conducted has focused on what industry could do for women in order to attract more women. On the other hand, this research intends to explore what women managers can do to the industry. In doing so, it tries to find out the ways in which women managers, despite their vulnerability, contribute, using their power, authority and leadership styles, to make the industry more attractive to women and other disadvantaged groups.

5000|$|Occupational {{segregation}} {{exists in}} all {{aspect of the}} Jordanian workforce as both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> is present. Vertical segregation refers {{to the concept of}} the glass ceiling, where women are concentrated in lower paying, lower-ranking jobs and cannot break through to the higher levels. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> occurs when certain occupations are more female intensive. For example, more Jordanian men are civil servants and fill high-ranking positions while Jordanian women are concentrated in middle-ranking jobs. The consequences of women’s limited economic advancement and low female participation in the workforce leads to low utilization of national production capacity (World Bank estimates it is currently at half its potential), lower average household income and lower per capita GDP. The greatest challenge to incorporating women equally into the workplace is overcoming traditional attitudes towards women and their expected duties as mothers and wives. A change in attitude will inevitably lead to the changing of [...] "gendered laws" [...] and the role of women as homemakers.|$|E

50|$|According to William A. Darity, Jr. and Patrick L. Mason, {{there is}} a strong {{horizontal}} occupational division in the United States on the basis of gender; in 1990, the index of occupational dissimilarity was 53%, meaning 53% of women or 47% of men would have to move to different career field in order for all occupations to have equal gender composition. While women have begun to more frequently enter traditionally male-dominated professions, there have been much fewer men entering female-dominated professions; professor of sociology Paula England cites this <b>horizontal</b> <b>segregation</b> of careers as a contributing factor to the gender pay gap.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, it can {{be assumed}} that there are {{different}} levels of <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> in the labour market in the two countries, although more recent comparative data on the question is sparse. Switzerland has risen to a middle position in occupational gender segregation among advanced industrial countries since the 1980 s, when it still {{had one of the}} highest levels of <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> (Charles 2004). Bulgaria, on the other hand, having transitioned to a (liberal) market economy with a leading role of services after 1989 exhibits a comparatively low level of gender segregation in international comparison (Bieri et al. 2016). This {{can be traced back to}} the fact that women are more likely to be found in male-typed jobs in IT and technology (World Economic Forum 2013). The Bulgarian share of women in IT professions (28.5 %) has been the highest in Europe (European Commission 2009). The lower gender segregation is partly a remnant from the time of state socialism where women’s labour force participation rate was among the highest in the world, and where occupational sex segregation did not reach the levels found in capitalist countries (Glass 2008). The socialist government guaranteed full employment to both genders in the 1980 s and sought to reduce social and economic inequalities between the sexes in the labour market (Paskaleva et al. 1998), although in reality job segregation still did disadvantage women (Stoilova 2007).|$|R
30|$|This study {{sought to}} {{formulate}} and empirically test education–institutional explanations for the relatively high <b>horizontal</b> gender <b>segregation</b> in the Swiss labour market through a country comparison with Bulgaria.

30|$|The period 2003 – 2007 was {{a period}} of {{economic}} and political changes for Ukraine. In 2005, following the Orange Revolution, the new government engaged in a series of economic reforms, among which was strengthening the legislation aimed at encouraging gender equality in the labor market. Using data from the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) I explore the impact of these economic and political changes on the gender wage gap. Policies for gender equality seem to be responsible for {{at least part of the}} reduction of the wage gap among the workers of the public sector, both through the reduction in the differences between the remuneration of observable characteristics for men and women and through the reduction in <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>segregation.</b> On the other hand, the impact of these policies among workers of the private sector (and especially among the informally employed) seems much smaller, especially as far as the impact on <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>segregation</b> is concerned.|$|R

Gender essentialist assumptions also pervade the distribution of roles and the allocation of work tasks.
