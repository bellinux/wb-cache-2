Time-dependent {{dielectric}} breakdown (TDDB) measurement of MOS capacitors on an n-type 4 ° off-axis 4 H-SiC(0001) wafer free from step-bunching showed specific {{breakdown in the}} Weibull distribution plots. By observing the as-grown SiC-epi wafer surface, two kinds of epitaxial surface defect, Trapezoid-shape and Bar-shape defects, were confirmed with confocal microscope. Charge to breakdown (Qbd) of MOS capacitors including an upstream line of these defects is almost the same value {{as that of a}} Wear-out breakdown region. On the other hand, the gate oxide breakdown of MOS capacitors occurred at a <b>downstream</b> <b>line.</b> It has revealed that specific part of these defects causes degradation of oxide reliability. Cross-sectional TEM images of MOS structure show that gate oxide thickness of MOS capacitor is non-uniform on the <b>downstream</b> <b>line.</b> Moreover, AFM observation of as-grown and oxidized SiC-epitaxial surfaces indicated that surface roughness of <b>downstream</b> <b>line</b> becomes 3 - 4 times larger than the as-grown one by oxidation process...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel form of single and three-phase Active Power Filter (APF) which require less components than normal. This is achieved by making use of energy storage components which are already present inthe system and at the load. The implementation of a single-phase APF, which requires just one bidirectional switch across the nonlinear load, is described. A simple control strategy is presented to reduce the current distortion to an acceptable level. Simulation and experimental results for a low power prototype circuit are included showing that current harmonic filtering using this APF circuit is effective. To achieve current harmonic filtering and compensate the negative and zero sequence current in three-phase four-wire systems, a new APF is presented. The proposed APF consists of four bidirectional switches connected in star at the AC terminals of the nonlinear load. A new control algorithm based on three-dimensional vector switch control is derived and implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP) to control the APF. Results from simulation and a 2. 5 kVA experimental set-up show the suitability of the proposed approach for the removal of current harmonics and for the compensation of fundamental unbalance currents and reactive power consumed by the load. It is proposed to use the new circuit in a commercial building installation, although {{there are a number of}} practical problems to be solved before this can become feasible. These practical problems are investigated in the thesis. The effect of the APF switching on power diodes in the nonlinear load is investigated. A simple model for reverse recovery in a power diode is used to predict the switching losses of the power diodes, and tested by experimental results. The other problem to be investigated is overvoltage across switches because of <b>downstream</b> <b>line</b> inductance between the APFlocation and the nonlinear load. It is shown that this problem can be solved by installing the APF across the biggest nonlinear load...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{penetration}} of distributed {{renewable energy sources}} such as PV may lead to voltage rise in the LV distribution networks. When local production exceeds local consumption, this voltage rise may lead to overvoltage, i. e. violation of the EN 50160 standard. A number of solutions {{have been developed to}} mitigate the over voltage, thus increasing the hosting capacity of the LV network without violating EN 50160. Equipping a distribution transformer with On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC), can also solve the overvoltage problem in the LV network.

This paper evaluates a classical OLTC-based control to mitigate the overvoltage problem and analyzes the possible voltage violation at downstream of the LV network in a rural European LV network. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{geological}} and geophysical {{data suggest}} that a 1  km thick ice shelf extended over the glacial Arctic Ocean during Marine Isotope Stage  6, about 140   000  years ago. Here, we theoretically analyse the development and equilibrium features of such an ice shelf, using scaling analyses and a one-dimensional ice-sheet–ice-shelf model. We find that the dynamically most consistent scenario is an ice shelf with a nearly uniform thickness that covers the entire Arctic Ocean. Further, the ice shelf has two regions with distinctly different dynamics: a vast interior region covering the central Arctic Ocean and an exit region towards the Fram Strait. In the interior region, which is effectively dammed by the Fram Strait constriction, there are strong back stresses and the mean ice-shelf thickness is controlled primarily by the horizontally integrated mass balance. A narrow transition zone is found near the continental grounding line, in which the ice-shelf thickness decreases offshore and approaches the mean basin thickness. If the surface accumulation and mass flow from the continental ice masses are sufficiently large, the ice-shelf thickness grows {{to the point where}} the ice shelf grounds on the Lomonosov Ridge. As this occurs, the back stress increases in the Amerasian Basin and the ice-shelf thickness becomes larger there than in the Eurasian Basin towards the Fram Strait. Using a one-dimensional ice-dynamic model, the stability of equilibrium ice-shelf configurations without and with grounding on the Lomonosov Ridge are examined. We find that the grounded ice-shelf configuration should be stable if the two Lomonosov Ridge grounding lines are located on the opposites sides of the ridge crest, implying that the <b>downstream</b> grounding <b>line</b> is located on a downward sloping bed. This result shares similarities with the classical result on marine ice-sheet stability of Weertman, but due to interactions between the Amerasian and Eurasian ice-shelf segments the mass flux at the <b>downstream</b> grounding <b>line</b> decreases rather than increases with ice thickness...|$|R

Due to the demand {{growth over the}} past years, Varian has been continuously improving its operations practices to increase the factory capacity without investing additional floor space or labor shifts. A hypothesis-driven analysis is used to identify, understand and formulate solutions for the issues that Varian faces {{in order to increase}} its production capacity. Based on the preliminary analysis, we develop a hypothesis tree and we identify effective operation time reduction and cycle time reduction to be the two root hypotheses. Inventory shortages increase the effective operation time of the production lines and lower Varian's production capacity, especially those high-volume low-variety assemblies built in supermarket build area. We present a consumption based assembly level inventory management system based on the base-stock model to reduce assembly shortages on <b>downstream</b> production <b>lines.</b> This system will be used to manage those finished goods inventory of supermarket assemblies on a make-to-stock basis for all downstream consumptions, and it will allow Varian to increase those assemblies' service levels while reducing finished goods inventory level of assemblies by 30 %. Supermarket piece parts are the components used to build assemblies; piece part shortages delay the scheduled delivery of assemblies to the <b>downstream</b> production <b>lines</b> thereby causing assembly shortages. For piece part shortages caused by inaccurate inventory records, Varian lacks an effective solution. We present two component level inventory management systems for reducing piece part shortages. In short to middle term, we present a secured tablet solution as a self-check-out terminal to provide better user experience aiming at reducing inaccurate inventory records by 50 %. In middle to long term, we present a Vertical Lift Module solution to completely eliminate inaccurate inventory record while reducing storage space. by Yiming Wu. Thesis (M.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} primarily with the investigation, both analytically and numerically, of instabilities in reverse- and forward-roll and slot coating flows. Consideration {{is restricted to}} Newtonian, incompressible fluids {{in the absence of}} inertial forces. The onset of the ribbing instability in inlet flooded, reverse roll coating is examined first by applying linear stability theory to a base flow formulated using lubrication theory. Regions of instability are established and found to be in accord with experimental observation. These results are then compared with predictions from a stability hypothesis based on a two-dimensional force balance argument. This simple criterion shows that the effect of various parameters on the stability of the downstream free surface can be ascertained by examining their influence on the pressure gradient and meniscus location. The stability hypothesis is shown to underpredict the critical capillary number and so is only sufficient for predicting stability. Results are also compared to ones obtained numerically by applying linear stability theory to finite element solutions for the entire flow field, the principal difference being that the analytical approach overpredicts the critical capillary number for the onset of instability. A variation of inlet flooded, reverse roll coating is then studied in which the nip is fed from above by a large reservoir of fluid (i. e. a hydrostatic head). The influence of this head on the base flow (obtained using lubrication theory) and its stability is then investigated. An improved model of the dynamic contact line, developed by Shikhmurzaev [1993 a] is described in which the dynamic contact angle is no longer kept constant, but is a function of various fluid and geometrical parameters. The limit of this theory for small capillary number is incorporated into the analytical model from which its effect on the base flow and stability is examined. Instabilities in forward roll coating are then investigated. The inlet flooded case is studied using linear stability analysis, a stability hypothesis and the finite element method. As in reverse roll coating, the stability hypothesis at the downstream free surface is sufficient for predicting stability only. The finite element method, on the other hand, leads to solutions that are in close agreement with linear stability theory, unlike the reverse roll case. Inlet starved forward roll coating is examined next and, as with the inlet flooded case, the ribbing instability can still manifest at the downstream free surface. The presence of an instability known as bead break, noted experimentally by Malone [1992] and Gaskell et al [1998], is verified analytically using linear stability theory. It is then shown that a stability hypothesis applied at the upstream free surface gives an accurate description of stability (unlike at the downstream free surface). Finally, the slot coating geometry is explored. A geometrically flexible finite element code is described for which it is possible to use various lip shapes and a roll of variable radius and location (with respect to the slot). Initially, as has always been the case in previous work reported in the literature, the numerical mesh incorporates a <b>downstream</b> wetting <b>line</b> pinned at the lip edge and the effect of the various fluid and geometrical parameters on the resultant pressure profile and upstream meniscus location is examined. These numerical results are seen to compare favourably with predictions obtained analytically using a model based on lubrication theory. However, Sartor [1990] showed that the <b>downstream</b> wetting <b>line</b> does not always remain pinned, but can climb up the die shoulder or regress into the coating gap. This has been confirmed experimentally by Kapur [1998] who also notes that ribs only appear when operating in the unpinned regime. Hence, the case in which the <b>downstream,</b> static contact <b>line</b> has retreated from the lip edge towards the inlet is studied. Pressure profiles and meniscus locations are compared with those for the case of a pinned <b>downstream</b> wetting <b>line</b> and the numerical linear stability analysis used to determine the effect of the fluid and geometrical parameters on the stability of the downstream free surface...|$|R
