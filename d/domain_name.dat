5|$|Beck filed a {{complaint}} to the WIPO under the Uniform <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), arguing the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> of the website was defamatory and asserted trademark infringement in its use of his name. Eiland-Hall filed a response brief to WIPO which cited the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, asserting the website's <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> {{was a form of}} free speech and satirical political humor.|$|E
5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a top-level domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered <b>domain</b> <b>name,</b> redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
40|$|With {{the arrival}} of global {{electronic}} commerce transactions on the Internet, new forms of intellectual property rights, such as Internet <b>domain</b> <b>names,</b> have emerged. Today, Internet <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> are some companies 2 ̆ 7 most valuable assets. Yet law professors, attorneys, and judges struggle with the legal nature of <b>domain</b> <b>names,</b> which is far from settled. Questions drawing recent attention include: How should <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> be valued? Can <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> be used as collateral in secured transactions, and how does one perfect a security interest in <b>domain</b> <b>names?</b> What will happen to <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> in bankruptcy...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Domain</b> <b>names</b> can be {{as short}} as one character. A premium of €500/yr applies to name {{registrations}} of one character in length, €250 for <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> of two-character length, and €30 per year for <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> of any other length, although alternate registrars have two-letter <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> available {{for the price of}} normal length names. In June, 2008, [...]NU Domain began permitting registration of all-numeric <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R
50|$|India {{plans to}} {{introduce}} internationalised <b>domain</b> <b>names,</b> that is <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> in 22 local languages used in India. These internationalised <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> will be used together with seven new top domains for India.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{registering}} a domain, {{the user}} signs a declaration {{that they are}} not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume full responsibility for any consequences of use of the <b>domain</b> <b>name.</b> The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> include infringements of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded the domain if the registration was solely made to sell the domain to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E
5|$|Registration {{takes place}} through a third party, a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registrar. The {{relationship}} between Norid, the registrar and the holder is regulated through civil legal agreements. The registrar registers the domain {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E
50|$|In November 2009, internationalized <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> (IDNs) became {{available}} for {{second and third}} level <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> IDNs are <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> that are represented by user applications in the native character set of a language.|$|R
50|$|Many pre-Nominet <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> {{had little}} or no contact information, as a result it has been hard to work out {{ownership}} of the <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> Nominet are running an internal project (the PreNom project) to clear out the remaining pre Nominet <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> so by the end all <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> would be under the new Nominet terms and conditions.|$|R
40|$|Dotcom <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> (. com) {{have become}} the most {{commonly}} used type of top-level domain (TLD). In fact, there are more. com <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> registered than the sum of all current “national” <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> There is a common perception that. com <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> are international. This perception may be based on the visual contrast of. com (or other gTLDs) with ccTLDs, such as. br for Brazil or. no for Norway. While ccTLDs seem to indicate that websites that are referred to by this type of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> are related to a specific country, “. com” <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> do not carry any such geographic distinction. This lack of location indicative in the TLD may give the impression that gTLDs are, indeed, not bound to a particular country. The scope of this work is to answer whether the international status of. com <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> is recognized through their contractual regulation and if courts recognize such status when dealing with disputes over <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> or takedown requests...|$|R
5|$|ScienTOMogy was a New Zealand-based parody site lampooning actor Tom Cruise's {{involvement}} with Scientology.

5|$|Windows Server 2012 has an IP address {{management}} role for discovering, monitoring, auditing, and managing the IP address space {{used on a}} corporate network. The IPAM {{is used for the}} management and monitoring of <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are fully supported.|$|E
5|$|A URL is a URI that, in {{addition}} to identifying a web resource, specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation of it, i.e. specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location. For example, the URL http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page refers to a resource identified as /wiki/Main_Page whose representation, {{in the form of}} HTML and related code, is obtainable via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http:) from a network host whose <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> is example.org.|$|E
50|$|It has {{full support}} for internationalized <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> (IDNs). You can enter <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> with native {{characters}} directly (no punycode conversion needed), {{and have an}} option to display native character or punycoded <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> anywhere in the user interface, and quickly switch between these modes.|$|R
50|$|The Internationalizing <b>Domain</b> <b>Names</b> in Applications (IDNA) {{system allows}} user applications, such as web browsers, map Unicode strings into the valid DNS {{character}} set using Punycode, {{which is called}} internationalized <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> However, to simplify implementations, internationalized <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> are not allowed in UTIDs.|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} web {{presence}} management is managing {{the collection of}} <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> registered to the person or business. Any entity may register multiple <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> for the same property. As a result, they can link alternative spellings, different top-level domains, aliases, brands, or products to the same website. Similarly, negative or derogatory <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> may also be registered. This is done to prevent certain <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> from being used against the person or business.|$|R
5|$|Mina became {{engaged to}} her current husband, {{cardiologist}} Eugenio Quaini, in 1981. They were married on 10 January 2006 in Lugano. She obtained Swiss citizenship in 1989. As required in that country, she took on her husband's last name and her legal name became Anna Maria Quaini. To her public, however, she still addresses herself as Mina Mazzini, also seen in her website's <b>domain</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 2009, Eiland-Hall {{wrote to}} Beck, giving him {{control of the}} domain free of charge, and {{providing}} Beck with its username and password. Eiland-Hall wrote {{that he had made}} his point, and the act of filing the complaint exacerbated the situation for the complainant. Eiland-Hall explained his rationale for giving away the <b>domain</b> <b>name,</b> citing his desire to protect the applicability of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been satisfied.|$|E
5|$|Operation Clambake {{was founded}} in 1996 by Andreas Heldal-Lund, an {{information}} technology manager in Stavanger, Norway, who administers the site at www.xenu.net.

In a notice posted {{to one of his}} other websites, Eiland-Hall wished Beck (then suffering from appendicitis) well, and characterized the conclusion of the case as a success. In a post on his blog, Eiland-Hall's lawyer Marc Randazza described the case as a victory for freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|The newspaper's website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacking {{group that}} {{supports}} the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

5|$|Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old {{computer}} science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried joke on Beck {{and created a}} website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. He chose not {{to identify with the}} WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted that it did not believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership.|$|E
50|$|For special purposes, such as network testing, documentation, {{and other}} applications, IANA also {{reserves}} {{a set of}} special-use <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> This list contains <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> such as example, local, localhost, and test.

50|$|<b>Domain</b> <b>names</b> {{are often}} seen in analogy to real estate in that <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> are {{foundations}} on which a website can be built, and the highest quality <b>domain</b> <b>names,</b> like sought-after real estate, tend to carry significant value, usually due to their online brand-building potential, use in advertising, search engine optimization, and many other criteria.|$|R
5|$|Since 1993, Curtis had {{frequently}} read {{morning news}} stories and exchanged them with friends. Although this {{would later become}} the inspiration for Fark, Curtis {{toyed with the idea}} of starting an online curry recipe database. In 1999, eighteen months after registering the <b>domain</b> <b>name,</b> he launched Fark as a way to share interesting news postings with his friends rather than sending them numerous emails. The first story posted was an article about a fighter pilot who crashed while attempting to moon another fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|Cohen {{thereafter}} {{launched a}} media offensive claiming the DRS was biased {{in favor of}} large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet. Cohen stated {{he believed that the}} DRS system was unfair {{for a number of reasons}} and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review. Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings for judicial review. The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service. Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a rehearing and, as that case progressed, the interim <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
