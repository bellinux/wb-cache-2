30|$|Recent {{increased}} {{water withdrawal}} from HD and adverse shifts in climatic trends, i.e., decrease rainfall and warming trends were {{also associated with}} worsening catchment’s salinity. While, rising ET and warming remove freshwater and leave behind concentrated salts, low rains reduce <b>dam</b> <b>volume,</b> mainly from salt-free mountainous areas which feeds the dam and the catchment.|$|E
30|$|A {{recent study}} also {{indicated}} a warming trend where between 1964 and 2014, T min increased for about 1.13  °C (Shemsanga et al. 2015). The warming in turn triggers more ET, which implies additional water losses and concentrating catchment’s salinity, including in HD. This could further explain recent HD salinity increases corresponding to increasing PET/T and decreasing rainfall. The local warming is crucial as, T and ET are highest in wet months hence more water losses (Ibid). This is especially worrisome since wind, another factor driving ET, is also highest during wet months and local rains are often interrupted by strong sunhours (Ibid). These characteristics explain {{the lack of}} permanent water bodies, except for HD which partly receives groundwater (Shindo 1991). These factors are argued to have reduced HD level to the average of 4.5  m compared to the original design of 9  m (personal communication with Mr. Ntuza). However, HD sediments account for {{large part of the}} <b>dam</b> <b>volume</b> which exposes enormous <b>dam</b> <b>volume</b> to direct ET forces/losses.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of available opportunities to revive irrigation {{on a long}} abandoned irrigation scheme in a dry region of Zimbabwe is presented by assessing water availability at catchment level. The aim is to enhance the livelihoods, income and nutrition of the communities that depend on the irrigation scheme through a sustainable management of revitalised irrigation infrastructure and ensure food security. Runoff generated in the catchment, with potential to flow into the dam that supplies water to the scheme, is estimated using the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) model. The model simulates runoff at catchment level using daily rainfall data. An overview of the methodology and the various steps followed are provided. Daily rainfall and dam water levels are the only measured data available for the catchment. The dam water levels are {{used to determine the}} <b>dam</b> water <b>volumes</b> using rating tables. The <b>dam</b> water <b>volumes</b> are used to calculate the daily water inflows into the dam and these are compared with simulated water discharge rates obtained from the model.

This reservoir controls the high part of Capibaribe river basin, area affected several actions that can compromise the reservoir water quality such as disposal of domestic sewage, industrial wastewater and agriculture with use of fertilizers. This study aimed to identify the factors that lead to water quality of the Jucazinho reservoir using a database containing information of nine years of reservoir water quality monitoring in line with a multivariate statistical technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To use this technique, it was selected two components which determine the quality of the reservoir water.

40|$|The {{secondary}} {{consequences of}} rock slope failure {{poses a threat}} to people living in Norwegian valleys. Blockage of rivers cause flooding upriver. Catastrophic breaching of the dam poses as major threat to people living beneath the dam. This master thesis introduces a tool that predicts dam height of future rock slope failures. The tool is created {{on the basis of a}} geomorphic analysis of rockslide dams in the southwestern parts of Norway (Jakobsen, 2015). The tool is an empiric equation that considers <b>dam</b> <b>volume</b> and valley width as major factors influencing dam height. The parameters used were chosen based on a 2 d covariance-analysis on the geomorphic parameters. The database used to determine the empiric equation contain 19 elements. dam height=(dam Volume) /(2, 76 E+ 05) e^(-(valley width) /(8, 03 E+ 02)) - (valley width) /(6, 66 E+ 01) + 31, 12 Dimensionless blockage index considers catchment area (Ab), <b>dam</b> <b>volume</b> (Vd) and dam height as the main factors that determine the stability of rockslide dams (Ermini & Casagli, 2003). The stability of future rockslide dams can be assessed by replacing dam height with the equation above. DBI=log⁡((A_b*(V_d/(2, 76 E+ 05) e^(W_v/(8, 03 E+ 02)) -W_v/(6, 66 E+ 01) + 31, 12)) /V_d) Other factors influence the stability of rockslide dams. The character of the carapace governs the resistance of the dam against continuous erosion (Weidinger, 2011). Grainsize analysis of the rockslide dams; Månavatnet and Gloppedalsura illustrate how the character of the carapace influences the stability, and hence the longevity of rockslide dams...|$|E
