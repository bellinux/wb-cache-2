500|$|Series co-creators, Dan Povenmire and Swampy Marsh, {{wrote the}} story for [...] "Flop Starz;" [...] Sherm Cohen and Antoine Guilbaud, meanwhile, {{constructed}} the storyboards. Povenmire directed the episode, which he did {{for the majority of}} the season. Povenmire and Marsh wrote the featured song, [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo," [...] like they <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of the music in the show. That song and Perry's [...] "secret agent theme" [...] were the first pitched to Disney, who enjoyed it so much they wanted the pair to write a song for every episode.|$|E

Gowing {{knew little about}} atomic energy; she once remarked {{that when she was}} appointed, she [...] "didn't know an atom from a molecule". [...] This was rectified, and she won the respect of Sir Christopher Hinton and Sir James Chadwick, and became friends with Nicholas Kurti, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Niels Bohr. At one point she asked Chadwick what he intended to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the documents in wooden filing cabinets in his attic, and he just said [...] "burn them". Such heart-stopping moments led her to help establish the Centre for Scientific Archives in 1972.|$|E

500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What {{are they going to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they would}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and {{alterations}} {{after the first}} performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, [...] "I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain {{at the end of}} Act II." [...] The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.|$|E
500|$|The Time for Timer {{character}} shown {{singing and}} dancing is a reference to public service announcements broadcast in the 1970s on ABC on Saturday mornings (referencing in particular the well-known [...] "I Hanker for a Hunk of Cheese" [...] episode). When Peter thought what he would <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his money from the MacArthur Genius Grant, he thought of legally buying Cloris Leachman, forcing her to juggle. Also on the Season 4 DVD commentary, Seth MacFarlane explained he wanted to hire Lennie Weinrib to reprise Timer for the gag, but Weinrib was suffering from failing health when [...] "Petarded" [...] was being produced and as MacFarlane explained, he [...] "didn't remember doing it." [...] Indeed, Lennie Weinrib died {{about a year after}} [...] "Petarded" [...] first aired.|$|E

500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Paige's first full studio album of new {{recordings}} in 12years was marked in 2006, titled Essential Musicals. The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, {{and she had}} been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. On 20 and 21 December 2006, she performed in concert in Shanghai, extending her concert tour to two dates to satisfy demand. With a noticeable absence from musical theatre, having not taken a role for many years, she explained in 2006 that [...] "there's been nothing that I've wanted to do, and if you're going to commit to a year at the theatre, six days a week, and have no life, then it's got to be something that you want to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> your heart". [...] She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.|$|E

2500|$|Her idiosyncrasies aside, de Leon {{used the}} phrase [...] "Kung ano ang kikita" [...] ("Whatever makes money") to justify the choices of scripts LVN adapted into film. As a result, she {{resisted}} making [...] "prestige films" [...] that delved into socially conscious issues. She was hesitant to produce Avellana's bleak drama Anak Dalita, and only did so {{at the insistence of}} her son, Manuel. The film earned poorly, but received several international awards which failed to mollify de Leon. She told her son, [...] "Ano ngayon ang gagawin ninyo sa mga kopang iyan? Makakain ninyo ba iyan?" [...] ("What will you <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> those trophies? Can you be fed with those?") ...|$|E
2500|$|The epithet Shouters was {{introduced}} in the early 1980s by the Three Self Patriotic Movement in Jeijing Province to suppress LC activity (as they sought to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> Christian groups who refused to join their movement). Over time the name Shouters has morphed in its usage by many Chinese to refer to all members of unregistered house churches, while still others use it to identify a small renegade group of people who claim to be followers of Witness Lee but have broken fellowship with the LC and distort the Bible and Leeâ€™s teachings in numerous cultic ways. The misidentification of the LC with this latter group of [...] "Shouters" [...] has plagued the LC in its dealings with the authorities.|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{voyage to}} Europe {{was made in}} January 1876. Pausing in London {{long enough to see}} Queen Victoria open Parliament in person for the first time after the Prince Consort's death, she hastened through Paris on her way to Rome to view old palaces, gardens, and galleries, touched to tears by Pope Pius IX's benediction, enjoying the {{hospitality}} of the studios of Elihu Vedder, John Rollin Tilton, and others, and of the gracious and charming social life of Rome. Her descriptions of all this, overflowing with the sensitiveness to beauty which was a part of her nature, made her Random Rambles interesting reading. After Rome, she visited Florence, and then Venice, and then again Paris, and again London and the London season. Entertained by Lord Houghton, she met Robert Browning and Algernon Charles Swinburne, George Eliot, Alexander William Kinglake, Theodore Watts-Dunton, and others, seeing especially a great deal of Browning who said, [...] "Her voice, wherein all sweetnesses abide," [...] having as much to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> this as her literary excellence.|$|E

2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, {{the more likely you}} will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a much better shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won the final moto.|$|E
