5|$|Tyldesley's first inns {{were the}} Flaming Castle built in 1778 and the <b>Green</b> <b>Dragon</b> of 1781. Fulwell House in Squires Lane {{was built in}} 1792 and {{occupied}} by local industrialists but was demolished in 1935. Towards {{the end of the}} 18th century rows of two-storey brick terraced houses were built at the west end of the town to house workers who had migrated there to work in the new factories.|$|E
5|$|In Adventure, the player's goal is {{to recover}} the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom {{and return it to}} the Golden Castle. The kingdom {{includes}} two other castles (White and Black) and various obstacles and mazes within them. Further, the kingdom is guarded by three dragons: Yorgle (yellow dragon), Grundle (<b>green</b> <b>dragon),</b> and Rhindle (red dragon who moves much faster than the other two), that protect various items in the game and will try to chase and eat the player's avatar. There is also a bat that can roam across the kingdom freely, carrying a single item (which can include the player's avatar or a dragon) around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name did not make it into the manual. The bat has two states, agitated and non-agitated; when in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not pick up an object. The bat continues to fly around even if not present on the player's current screen and may continue moving or swapping around objects.|$|E
5|$|Sparrow's {{weapons are}} genuine 18th century pieces: his sword {{dates to the}} 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London. Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived {{production}} of the first film. Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin. Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the <b>green</b> <b>dragon</b> ring recalls his adventures in the Far East. Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him, and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.|$|E

5000|$|Active public {{supporting}} of {{the club}} NK Olimpija began in 1986 and after the Pristina game in 1988 the supporters took on the name <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons.</b> When the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was falling apart the future {{of the club}} and its fans was unsure. Later a Slovenian league was formed. When the club finally joined this league it was left with no real rival. The first important game was played against Medvode. The <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons</b> came there by means of the players' bus which was lent to them, while the players themselves drove in their own cars. The peak of the season was marked by the [...] "legendary" [...] game against Maribor on the sixth of may in 1992. Nine hundred <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons</b> were present, considered a lot in those days. The opposing team of football enthusiasts had all of the banners they had brought to Ljubljana confiscated by members of the <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons.</b> The <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons</b> followed their favourite football club wherever it went. They also stated publicly that {{they are not going to}} physically attack anybody, but would still defend themselves if they were attacked and that they are going to respect others as much as others respect them. This golden season was followed by stagnation caused by the club management. This was followed by a year and a half strike by the <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons</b> until the director was changed. The next season was the leaping point of the Slovenian football star Sebastjan Cimirotič. The same autumn one of the largest incidents in Slovenian cheerleading history took place on the way to Maribor, at the train station in Štore, near Celje, considered mostly the fault of the Slovenian Police and weird coincidence. 74 Dragons were arrested. The last game of the season is remembered as the most crowded, featuring 1500 <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons,</b> resulting in lack of space for the viewers. Olimpija however lost the title to its rival, Maribor, by one point. The rise-up of the football club followed in the next two seasons. In the game against Liverpool a large number of fans was gathered again, a bit over one thousand, and completely overtook the eight hundred English ones. As interest in sports declined in Ljubljana, so did the football club that eventually fell apart. A minor football club named NK Bežigrad took the stick and was joined by the <b>Green</b> <b>Dragons,</b> trying to bring high-quality back into Slovenian sport.|$|R
