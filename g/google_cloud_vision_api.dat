40|$|Current neural network-based image {{classifiers}} {{are susceptible}} to adversarial examples, even in the black-box setting, where the attacker is limited to query access without access to gradients. Previous methods [...] - substitute networks and coordinate-based finite-difference methods [...] - are either unreliable or query-inefficient, making these methods impractical for certain problems. We introduce a new method for reliably generating adversarial examples under more restricted, practical black-box threat models. First, we apply natural evolution strategies to perform black-box attacks using two to three orders of magnitude fewer queries than previous methods. Second, we introduce a new algorithm to perform targeted adversarial attacks in the partial-information setting, where the attacker only has access to {{a limited number of}} target classes. Using these techniques, we successfully perform the first targeted adversarial attack against a commercially deployed machine learning system, the <b>Google</b> <b>Cloud</b> <b>Vision</b> <b>API,</b> in the partial information setting...|$|E
40|$|Google has {{recently}} introduced the Cloud Vision API for image analysis. According to the demonstration website, the API "quickly classifies images into thousands of categories, detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images. " It can be {{also used to}} "detect different types of inappropriate content from adult to violent content. " In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of <b>Google</b> <b>Cloud</b> <b>Vision</b> <b>API</b> to input perturbation. In particular, we show that by adding sufficient noise to the image, the API generates completely different outputs for the noisy image, while a human observer would perceive its original content. We show that the attack is consistently successful, by performing extensive experiments on different image types, including natural images, images containing faces and images with texts. For instance, using images from ImageNet dataset, we found that adding an average of 14. 25 % impulse noise is enough to deceive the API. Our findings indicate {{the vulnerability of the}} API in adversarial environments. For example, an adversary can bypass an image filtering system by adding noise to inappropriate images. We then show that when a noise filter is applied on input images, the API generates mostly the same outputs for restored images as for original images. This observation suggests that cloud vision API can readily benefit from noise filtering, without the need for updating image analysis algorithms...|$|E
