We shall be almost neighbours, and I will most assuredly hie me as promptly as possible across the scant interspace of the Channel, the Pas-de-Calais &c: where the very first question on which I shall beset you will be your adventure and impression of Nohant--as to which I burn and yearn for fond particulars. Perhaps if you have the proper Vehicle of Passion--as I make no doubt--you will be going there once more--in which case do take me! And such a suave and convenient crossing as I meanwhile wish you--and such a provision of philosophy laid up, in advance, for use in, and about, rue Barbet de Jouy! You will have finished your new fiction, I [...] "presume"--if it isn't presumptuous--before embarking? and I do so for the right of the desire to congratulate, in that case, and envy and sympathise--being in all sorts of embarras now, myself, over the finish of many things. I pant for the start of that work and languish to take it up. I think I have had no chance to tell you how much I admired your single story in the Aug.

All the same, with the rue de Varenne &c., don't go in too much for the French or the [...] "Franco-American" [...] subject--the real field of your extension is here--it has far more fusability with our native and primary material; between which and French elements there is, I hold, a disparity as complete as between a life led in trees, say, and a life led in--sea-depths, or in other words between that of climbers and swimmers--or (crudely) that of monkeys and fish. Is the Play Thing meanwhile climbing or swimming?--I take much interest in its fate. But you will tell me of these things--in February! It will be then I shall scramble over. I go home an hour or two hence (to stay as still as possible) after a night--only--spent in town. The perpetual summonses and solicitations of London (some of which have to be met) are at times a maddening worry--or almost. I am wondering if you are not feeling just now perhaps a good deal, at Lenox, in the apparently delightful old 1840 way--a good snowstorm ending, and the Westinghouse colouring, as I suppose, a good deal blurred. But how I want to have it all--the gossip of the countryside--from you! Some of it has come to me as rather dreadful ... and that is what some of the lone houses in the deep valleys we motored through used to make me think of!...|$|E

40|$|Judge Edwards 2 ̆ 7 lively essay declaims what {{he regards}} as the {{increasing}} disjunction between {{the substance of}} modem legal education and scholarship and the needs and interests of the judiciary and the practicing bar. According to Judge Edwards, law schools and law firms are moving in opposite directions. Law schools have increasingly abandoned real world legal problems in favor of abstract interdisciplinary theory, with a consequent diminution in their contribution toward solving problems faced by the judiciary. At the same time, law firms are becoming increasingly profit oriented, without regard to pursuing broader social interests. To combat these developments, Judge Edwards proposes that legal education be substantially reformed: he proposes greater production of 2 ̆ 2 practical 2 ̆ 2 —by which he means more purely doctrinal and noninterdisciplinary—scholarship, greater credit to practical scholars, more explicitly doctrinal teaching, and greater attention {{to the teaching of}} legal ethics, defined not simply as mastery of the canons, but as the understanding of the law as an instrument to promote the public interest. Judge Edwards views me as a particularly pernicious advocate of the developments he seeks to reverse. In talks given some years ago, I described the increasing influence upon legal scholarship and teaching of interdisciplinary research in the social sciences and humanistic studies—philosophy and interpretation. I described the modem law school as itself coming to resemble a university, with a curriculum consisting of minigraduate courses in applied economics, social theory, and political science. To me, these developments implied, first, a challenge to the distinctive significance of law as a subject of study and, second, an increasing division between the academy and the bar.
