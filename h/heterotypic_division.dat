The ovule has a massive nucellus with two integuments. According to Guerin (1913, 1915) {{there is a}} remarkable {{development of}} the nucellar vascular bundle in {{a few members of}} the Thyme¬laeaceae, namely, Dieranolepi 8, Cratero 8 iphon and Synaptolepis. The arche¬sporium consists of a single cell which divides to give rise to a parietal cell and the megaspore mother cell. The development of the embryo sac follows the normal type. The antipodals are variable; they are small in Wickstroemia indica, W. cana 8 cen 8, Gnidia carinata and Daphne alpina, but show an increase in number in Daphne odora (three to six), Blagayana p 8 eudomezereurn, Thymelaea passerina, Dirca palustris (numerous) and Daphnop 8 i 8 Schwartzii (many or three). In most species an obturator develops {{at the base of the}} stylar canal for the conduction of the pollen tubes towards the micropyle. The endosperm is free nuclear. Abnormalities occur in the family : the phenomenon of sterility in Daphne &lora (Osawa, 1913) and somatic parthenogenesis and associated nucellar embryony in Wicicstroemia indica. ...|$|E

Failure to repair these DSBs can lead to programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Caenorhabditis elegans, {{a member of the}} phylum Nematoda, is a model organism for the study of meiosis due to the temporal-spatial pattern of its gonad. gpx- 8, homologous to human gpx- 4, codes for a member of the glutathione peroxidase family, a group of proteins involved in the detoxification of peroxides. This project examined the effects of a homozygous deletion of the gpx- 8 gene on the C. elegans germ line. The primary focus was on its presumed correlation to elevated apoptosis, as noted during the counting of RAD- 51 foci. The effects of the deletion on brood size and gonad length were also explored. The deletion was discovered to have no effect on apoptosis levels in the C. elegans germ line; however, the project’s results did suggest that a gpx- 8 deletion is correlated to larger brood sizes and comparatively smaller gonads. The overall results were inconclusive and difficult to interpret; future studies on this topic might explore a link between RAD- 51 levels and gpx- 8 ’s function in oxidative damage repair...|$|R
