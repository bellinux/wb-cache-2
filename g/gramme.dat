5|$|Variations {{are also}} found with the {{spelling}} of unit names in countries using the same language, including differences in American English and British spelling. For example, meter and liter {{are used in the}} United States whereas metre and litre are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term metric ton is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled <b>gramme</b> in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.|$|E

Compound winding, which gave more stable voltage with load, improved operating characteristics of generators.|$|E

5000|$|The dirham is {{frequently}} mentioned in Jewish orthodox {{law as a}} unit of weight used to measure various requirements in religious functions, such as the weight in silver specie pledged in Marriage Contracts (Ketubbah), the quantity of flour requiring {{the separation of the}} dough-portion, etc. Jewish physician and philosopher, Maimonides, uses the Egyptian dirham to approximate the quantity of flour for dough-portion, writing in Mishnah Eduyot 1:2: [...] "...And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty dirhams of wheat flour, while all these dirhams are the Egyptian dirham." [...] This view is repeated by Maran's Shulhan Arukh (Hil. Hallah, Yoreh Deah § 324:3) {{in the name of the}} Tur. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (Eduyot 1:2, note 18), Rabbi Yosef Qafih explains that the weight of each Egyptian dirham was approximately 3.333 <b>grammes,</b> [...] or what was the equivalent to 16 carob-grains which, when taken together, the minimum weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to appx. 1 kilo and 733 <b>grammes.</b> Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, in his Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam (vol. 1, pp. 288-291), makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian dirham, saying that it weighed appx. 3.0 <b>grammes,</b> meaning the minimum requirement for separating the priest's portion is 1 kilo and 560 <b>grammes.</b> Others (e.g. Rabbi Avraham Chaim Naeh) say the Egyptian dirham weighed appx. 3.205 <b>grammes,</b> which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 <b>grammes.</b> Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of Bnei Barak) writes that the traditional weight used in Yemen for each dirham weighed 3.36 <b>grammes,</b> making the total weight for the required separation of the dough-portion to be 1 kilo and 770.72 <b>grammes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first {{successful}} arc lamp {{was developed by}} Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov, and used the <b>Gramme</b> generator. Its advantage lay {{in the fact that}} it didn't require the use of a mechanical regulator like its predecessors. It was first exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1878 and was heavily promoted by <b>Gramme.</b> The arc light was installed along the half mile length of Avenue de l'Opéra, Place du Theatre Francais and around the Place de l'Opéra in 1878.|$|E

25|$|Chemist Ernest Solvay and {{engineer}} Zenobe <b>Gramme</b> (École Industrielle de Liège) {{gave their}} names to the Solvay process and the <b>Gramme</b> dynamo, respectively, in the 1860s. Bakelite was developed in 1907–1909 by Leo Baekeland. Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave {{its name to the}} Solvay Institute of Sociology, the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management and the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry which are now part of the Université libre de Bruxelles. In 1911, he started a series of conferences, the Solvay Conferences on Physics and Chemistry, which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry. A major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a Belgian, Monsignor Georges Lemaître (Catholic University of Leuven), who is credited with proposing the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe in 1927.|$|E

500|$|... which {{revised the}} older {{system of units}} {{introduced}} by the French National Convention in 1793, where the gravet had been defined as weight (poids) of a cubic centimetre of water, equal to 1/1000 of a grave. In the decree of 1795, the term <b>gramme</b> thus replaced gravet, and kilogramme replaced grave.|$|E
500|$|Originally the kilogramme, {{defined as}} being one pinte (later renamed the litre) {{of water at}} the melting point of ice, was called the grave; the <b>gramme</b> being an {{alternative}} name for a thousandth of a grave. However, the word grave, being a synonym for the title [...] "count", had aristocratic connotations and was renamed the kilogramme. The name mètre was suggested by Auguste-Savinien Leblond in May 1790.|$|E

500|$|On 7 April 1795, the <b>gramme,</b> {{upon which}} the {{kilogram}} is based, was decreed to be equal to [...] "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a metre, and at {{the temperature of the}} melting ice". Although this was the definition of the gram, the regulation of trade and commerce required a [...] "practical realisation": a single-piece, metallic reference standard that was one thousand times more massive that would be known as grave. This mass unit, whose name is derived from the word [...] "gravitas", which was the Latin word for [...] "weight" [...] at the time, defined by Lavoisier and René Just Haüy had been in use since 1793. Notwithstanding that the definition of the base unit of mass was the <b>gramme</b> (alternatively [...] "gravet"), this new, practical realisation would ultimately become the base unit of mass. A provisional kilogram standard was made and work was commissioned to determine the precise mass of a cubic decimetre (later to be defined as equal to one litre) of water.|$|E
500|$|The law of 7 April 1795 (...) {{defined the}} terms <b>gramme</b> and kilogramme, which {{replaced}} the former terms gravet (correctly milligrave) and grave, and on 22 June 1799 (after Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre {{had completed the}} meridian survey) the definitive standard mètre des Archives and kilogramme des Archives were deposited in the French National Archives.
