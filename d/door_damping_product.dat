40|$|We {{report the}} {{measurement}} of Beliaev damping of bulk excitations in cigar shaped Bose Einstein condensates of atomic vapor. By using post selection, excitation line shapes {{of the total population}} are compared with those of the undamped excitations. We find that the damping depends on the initial excitation energy of the decaying quasi particle, {{as well as on the}} excitation momentum. We model the condensate as an infinite cylinder and calculate the damping rates of the different radial modes. The derived damping rates are in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones. The damping rates strongly depend on the destructive interference between pathways for damping, due to the quantum many-body nature of both excitation and <b>damping</b> <b>products.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Hecatombs of furniture, still piled and covered up, shrunk like imprisoned and forgotten men, and changed insensibly. Mirrors were dim as with the breath of years.

We compare the Dito-Turrubiates scheme with phase-space quantum mechanics (or deformation quantization) based on other star products, and extend it to incorporate Wigner functions.

Experimental tests are conducted with the aim of validating the predictive model. Testing includes monitoring system temperature in a wide range of internal configurations and external thermal environments. A good comparison is seen between experimental and model predicted results; increasing the mass of the chilled phase change material (PCM) in a system reduces the <b>damping</b> in <b>product</b> performance thereby reducing the product fluctuations or amplitude of the product performance curve.

50|$|The {{energy of}} the {{selected}} ions is increased by application of a supplemental resonance excitation voltage applied to all segments of two rods located on the X-axis. This increase of energy causes dissociation of the selected ions due to collisions with <b>damping</b> gas. The <b>product</b> ions formed are retained in the trapping field. Scanning {{the contents of the}} trap to produce a mass spectrum is accomplished by linearly increasing the RF voltage applied to all sections of the trap and utilizing a supplemental resonance ejection voltage. These changes sequentially move ions from within the stability diagram to a position where they become unstable in the x-direction and leave the trapping field for detection. Ions are accelerated into two high voltage dynodes where ions produce secondary electrons. This signal is subsequently amplified by two electron multipliers and the analog signals are then integrated together and digitized.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A shock {{absorber}} rod {{is located in the}} center of the absorber piston and is responsible for the reciprocating movement portion. If it has surface defects, the <b>damping</b> performance of <b>product</b> will be adversely affected. A rod surface has gloss by heat treatment. Therefore, it is difficult to find a defect, such as dust, imprints, and blowholes. Because a total inspection is achieved by visual inspection by workers, it causes eyestrain and the quality of the product is not constant. In this paper, a machine vision system was developed to find a defect using a line-scan camera. The machine can detect surface defects than 0. 3 ㎜. To minimize the occurrence probability of defects on the inspection process, the developed auto inspection system had an automatic feeding system and incorporated a protection system.

50|$|There are {{numerous}} other fission products that, {{as a result}} of their concentration and thermal neutron absorption cross section, have a poisoning effect on reactor operation. Individually, they are of little consequence, but taken together they have a significant effect. These are often characterized as lumped fission product poisons and accumulate at an average rate of 50 barns per fission event in the reactor. The buildup of fission product poisons in the fuel eventually leads to loss of efficiency, and in some cases to instability. In practice, buildup of reactor poisons in nuclear fuel is what determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor: long before all possible fissions have taken place, buildup of long-lived neutron-absorbing fission <b>products</b> <b>damps</b> out the chain reaction. This is the reason that nuclear reprocessing is a useful activity: solid spent nuclear fuel contains about 97% of the original fissionable material present in newly manufactured nuclear fuel. Chemical separation of the fission products restores the fuel so that it can be used again.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative methodology for evaluating air–sea fluxes related to ENSO from different atmospheric products. A statistical {{model of the}} fluxes from each atmospheric product is coupled to an ocean general circulation model (GCM). Four different products are evaluated: reanalyses from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), satellite-derived data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imaging (SSM/I) platform and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), and an atmospheric GCM developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) {{as part of the}} Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) II. For this study, comparisons between the datasets are restricted to the dominant air–sea mode. The stability of a coupled model using only the dominant mode and the associated predictive skill of the model are strongly dependent on which atmospheric product is used. The model is unstable and oscillatory for the ECMWF <b>product,</b> <b>damped</b> and oscillatory for the NCEP and GFDL products, and unstable (nonoscillatory) for the satellite product. The ocean model is coupled with patterns of wind stress as well as heat fluxes. This distinguishes the present approach from the existing paradigm for ENSO models where surface heat fluxes are parameterized as a local damping term in the sea surface temperature (SST) equation. 1...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Maresfield {{had given}} her boy a push in his plump back and had said to him, [...] "Go and speak to her now; it's your chance." [...] She had {{for a long time}} wanted this scion to make himself audible to Rose Tramore, but the {{opportunity}} was not easy to come by. The case was complicated. Lady Maresfield had four daughters, of whom only one was married. It so happened moreover that this one, Mrs. Vaughan- Vesey, {{the only person in the}} world her mother was afraid of, was the most to be reckoned with. The Honourable Guy was in appearance all his mother's child, though he was really a simpler soul. He was large and pink; large, that is, as to everything but the eyes, which were diminishing points, and pink as to everything but the hair, which was comparable, faintly, to the hue of the richer rose. He had also, it must be conceded, very small neat teeth, which made his smile look like a young lady's. He had no wish to resemble any such person, but he was perpetually smiling, and he smiled more than ever as he approached Rose Tramore, who, looking altogether, to his mind, as a pretty girl should, and wearing a soft white opera-cloak over a softer black dress, leaned alone against the wall of the vestibule at Covent Garden while, a few paces off, an old gentleman engaged her mother in conversation.

5000|$|In the {{standard}} steam locomotive firetube type boiler, the firebox {{is surrounded by}} water space on five sides. The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of {{the bottom of the}} firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash {{from the bottom of the}} fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that can't be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by <b>damper</b> <b>doors</b> above the ash collection pocket of the ash pan. A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually [...] "Bunker C" [...] fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox. The oil burner is a nozzle containing a slot for the oil to flow out onto a steam jet which atomizes the oil into a fine mist which ignites in the firebox. The oil burner nozzle is usually mounted in the front of the firebox, protected by a hood of firebrick, and aimed at the firebrick wall below the firebox door. Dampers control air flow to the oil fire.|$|R

The bound A* protein can religate the termini to form covalently closed single-stranded circles. To determine {{the nature of}} the covalent linkage and the amino acid involved, we used A* protein to cleave DNA synthesized in vivo with [α- 32 P]dATP to form the A*-single-stranded DNA complex. The complex was then digested with DNase I and the 32 P-labeled A* protein was isolated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. The isolated complex was digested with either trypsin or Pronase. Incubation of the tryptic digest with snake venom phosphodiesterase gave 32 P-labeled products that migrated on electrophoresis on cellulose plates to the cathode, indicating covalent linkage of 32 P-labeled dAMP residues to a tryptic peptide. High concentrations of snake venom phosphodiesterase released all of the 32 P label as free dAMP. Formic acid/diphenylamine depurination (Burton reaction) of the [α- 32 P]dATP-labeled peptide-oligonucleotide complexes caused a transfer of the labeled phosphate from dAMP to the peptide. The phosphorylated peptides were isolated on cellulose plates and shown to be sensitive to bacterial alkaline phosphatase, indicating that a phosphodiester bond linked the peptides to the <b>dAMP.</b> The phosphorylated <b>product</b> of the Pronase digest was identified as free phosphotyrosine by its mobility in three different chromatography systems. Likewise, acid hydrolysis (5. 6 M HCl, 110 °C, 2 hr) of the phosphorylated tryptic peptides revealed linkage of the phosphate to a tyrosine. Thus, A* protein cleaves single-stranded DNA and binds covalently to the 5 ′-phosphorylated terminus via a tyrosyl-dAMP phosphodiester bond...|$|R
40|$|For {{efficiency}} reasons {{many buildings}} are realized {{by using the}} lightweight design principles. The combination of fabric and lightweight structure plays a significant role. Although most lightweight materials, such as aluminum, are {{more expensive than the}} conventional materials concrete and structural steel, savings result due to the comprehensive cost analysis over the lifetime of a building. For example cost advantages can be achieved during the transport to the building site and in the dimensioning of the basement. Semi-finished aluminum foams, especially sandwiches are excellent for lightweight constructions. The applicability has already been proven in several serial applications for machine tools. In the building industry aluminum foam is still an almost unknown material. Due to ist cellular structure aluminum foam is very light. The material has also a high vibration <b>damping</b> capacity. Semi-finished <b>products</b> made from or made with aluminum foam are usually offered in shape of pure foam plates, sandwiches and foam-filled hollow structures. Large structures can excellently be produced by using prefabricated semi-finished aluminum foam. In this lecture the fabrication of the foams, their properties, available composite materials and opportunities for the machinability of the foams and their semi-finished products are shown and principles of lightweight design that can be realized with the new materials will be presented. Especially Aluminum foam combined with steel sheets - e. g. as a sandwich - is suitable for lightweight building structures. Particularly in industrial and hall construction these semi-finished products combine weight-bearing as well as stabilising functions. The lecture presents the first prototypical applications of aluminium foam semi-finished products in the building industry as well as ideas of future projects. Aim of currently running R&D - projects is to expand the property portfolio of aluminium foam semi-finished products significantly.

40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} initially {{relied on}} horsepower and speed performances as "standout qualities" {{to sell their}} products, but as time progressed, it became increasingly clear that customers were very much concerned about their comfort and safety while driving vehicles. In the late seventies, requirements for driver and passenger comfort were increased significantly, since-then, {{a large amount of}} effort has been invested into the vehicle improvement of noise and vibration reduction nevertheless enhancing the safety. Nowadays NVH performance is considered as a critical factor in the purchase decisions of many buyers. This work focusses on the development of a composite automotive door but, the methodology and materials applied could be extended for other panels, as there are several kinds in a typical vehicle whatever class or purpose it has. In the last years, furthermore, lightweight design imposed different design methodologies and materials like fiber reinforced plastics {{are becoming more and more}} used in the construction of vehicles for structural and non-structural parts. Reinforced plastics could perform higher performance and higher tailorable possibilities compared to conventional metallic materials, more and more composites are targeted toward structural applications involving combined dynamic, mechanical, thermal and hygral loading. Composite materials are principally preferred in such applications because of their advanced elastic properties and tailoring capability to individual design requirements. They also have the potential for incorporating significant and tailorable passive damping into the candidate structure. At the beginning, tests on two different viscoelastic materials are performed in order to identify mechanical characteristics necessary to provide valid data for numerical analysis of structures. ‘Oberst Beam Method' is the standard test method for measuring dynamic properties of materials (ASTM E 756 - 05). Mechanical characteristics of damping materials have been determined for different temperatures (SAE J 1637), frequencies and at different stage of aging (ISO 60068). Besides, low-velocity impact tests have been executed (ASTM 7136). After having post-processed the experimental data, the best material has been chosen. For each test, for each material and specimens topology a significant number of specimen has been tested for statistical purpose. ASTM 756 tests have been replicated virtually and to compare the results FRF Receptance, eigenfrequencies have been matched. Excellent correlation between simulation and experiment has been found. To evaluate the FEM virtual capabilities to reproduce and simulate the dynamic response of a real component and to validate correlation methodology, a first modal analysis has been carried out on a real automotive component. An innovative composite leaf spring is subjected to a free-free frequency response test, in which a series of accelerometers measures the response of the component to an excitation imposed by an electromechanical shaker. Moreover, LIPEZ methodology permitted to post-process data logged and to evaluate the characteristic vibrating modes of the structure. While the real component has been experimentally tested, FEM numerical simulation is reproduced. In the end, eigenfrequencies, eigenmodes (MAC) of experimental and virtual tests have been compared; excellent mode shape correlation has been found-out, errors on eigenfrequencies lower than 5 %. Last part of this dissertation is focussed on the design, testing, and development of a <b>damped</b> <b>door</b> by means of interlaminar materials. The activity has been performed in two stages: undamped door testing and correlation with FEM and then manufacturing, testing and correlation of the damped solution. LIPEZ modal extraction algorithm has been used to extract modal parameters for the two artifacts, as well. The undamped door has been tested, real and virtual receptance, eigenfrequencies, eigenmodes computed and correlated. Damped material patches have been dimensioned and positioned considering a trade-off between added mass, costs and vibro-reduction capabilities. Modal analysis executed on the door have demonstrated that high damping capabilities have been achieved with limited drawbacks on weight increase (+ 5 %) and inappreciable cost augmentation. In view of the scopes of the work, the results are deemed satisfactory...|$|R
