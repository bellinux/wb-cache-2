Russia-2 driven by Alexandr Zubkov, the <b>defending</b> four-man silver medalist and bronze medalist in the two-man event at these Games, crashed {{out in the}} first run when one of his steering ropes broke. Austria-1 and Slovakia-1 also crashed {{out in the first}} run, and neither sled started the second run with Russia-2. Second run crashes involved USA-2, Great Britain-1, and Japan-1. USA-2 did not start the third run. There were no crashes in the final two runs of the event. America's team of Holcomb, Steve Mesler, Curtis Tomasevicz, and Justin Olsen won the event.|$|E

40|$|In {{liability}} insurance, {{the duty}} to <b>defend</b> is broader than {{the duty to}} cover. Thus {{it is possible that}} an insurer that has a duty to <b>defend</b> a suit may not have the duty to cover the policyholder 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities in the suit. However, if the penalty for a breach of the duty to <b>defend</b> is limited to actual legal costs spent by the defendant, the insurer may have an incentive to refuse to <b>defend,</b> even when the duty to <b>defend</b> is clear. This occurs because the insurer will not internalize the consequences of an inadequate defense when it ultimately can avoid covering the claim. If the penalty for a breach of the duty to <b>defend</b> also includes a forfeiture of the right to contest coverage of the claim, the insurer will never refuse to <b>defend</b> when the duty to <b>defend</b> is clear, but such a penalty could induce an insurer to <b>defend</b> even when it has a good legal argument against the duty to <b>defend.</b> We argue that tying a forfeiture of the right to assert any defense of coverage to an unreasonable refusal to <b>defend</b> can give an insurer incentives to internalize the cost of an inadequate defense while allowing the insurer to make reasonable legal arguments challenging a duty to <b>defend...</b>|$|R
5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, <b>defending</b> team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an {{unlimited}} amount of time. In American professional basketball, <b>defending</b> team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the <b>defending</b> team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} argued that <b>defended</b> prey {{have tended to}} evolve {{conspicuous}} traits because predators more readily learn to avoid <b>defended</b> prey when they are conspicuous. However, a rival theory proposes that <b>defended</b> prey have evolved such characters because {{it allows them to}} be distinguished from undefended prey. Here we investigated how the attributes of <b>defended</b> (unprofitable) and undefended (profitable) computer-generated prey species tended to evolve when they were subject to selection by foraging humans. When cryptic forms of <b>defended</b> and undefended species were similar in appearance but their conspicuous forms were not, <b>defended</b> prey became conspicuous while undefended prey remained cryptic. Indeed, in all of our experiments, <b>defended</b> prey invariably evolved any trait that enabled them to be distinguished from undefended prey, even if such traits were cryptic. When conspicuous mutants of <b>defended</b> prey were extremely rare, they frequently overcame their initial disadvantage by chance. When Batesian mimicry of <b>defended</b> species was possible, <b>defended</b> prey evolved unique traits or characteristics that would make undefended prey vulnerable. Overall, our work supports the contention that warning signals are selected for their reliability as indicators of defense rather than to capitalize on any inherent educational biases of predators...|$|R

5|$|Preliminary {{studies for}} large destroyers capable of <b>defending</b> the French battleline against attacks by enemy destroyers and torpedo boats by the Naval General Staff (NGS) began before World War I, but were {{suspended}} {{when the war}} began. They resumed in 1917, but serious planning did not begin until after the war when the NGS decided to split {{the role of the}} destroyer in 1919. The smaller torpilleur d'escadre would have the role of attacking the enemy's battleline with torpedoes and <b>defending</b> that of the French from enemy torpedo craft. The primary role of the larger contre-torpilleur was scouting; <b>defending</b> the battleline was secondary and attacking the enemy battleline least important. This required high speed in all weather, good endurance and a powerful armament capable of engaging small cruisers.|$|E
