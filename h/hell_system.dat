40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the two current systems which are presently industry standards for judging test exposures which are used to determine an optimum exposure value for the Hell DC 300 B/L electronic dot generating scanner: 1. The <b>Hell</b> <b>System</b> 2. The Kodak System The <b>Hell</b> <b>System</b> uses aim density measurements of specific percent dot area 2 ̆ 7 s or integral dot densities to obtain an optimum exposure value. The Kodak System compares the dot shape and size of complementary 95 percent and 5 percent dots to obtain an optimum exposure value. The Hell computer program test tape number 149 is used to expose a variety of test patterns onto the film which is used to evaluate the dot structure and scanner calibration. Depending on the Kodak or <b>Hell</b> <b>system</b> for evaluation, the dot shape and size of a 95 percent and 5 percent dot or an integral dot density value is used to determine the correct light on film value for the correct exposure from the scanner. Light on film (LOF) is a relative value used to read the intensity or exposure of the laser light source. Six different film and developer combinations were evaluated using both systems {{to determine the effects of}} exposure on different films, developers, and at different screen rulings. An evaluation experiment was completed to determine whether the Kodak System or the <b>Hell</b> <b>System</b> is more precise for determining an optimum exposure value. Thirty viewers were asked to evaluate test exposures from a particlar film and developer combination (Kodak ES Scanner Film, Kodak Rapid Scanner Developer). Statistical analysis was used to find the variability of each system for determining the correct exposure value. The results from the testing concluded that different film, developer, and screen rulings have an affect on the optimum exposure value determined by the Hell and Kodak Systems. Secondly, the <b>Hell</b> <b>System</b> is more precise for determining an individual exposure value than the Kodak System. The Kodak System, however, was judged more versatile because it can also be used to evaluate changes in dot sharpness. A complete set of separations were also made. Kodak ES Scanner Film and Kodak Rapid Scanner Developer was used to make three separations with different exposure values to determine the effects of exposure on the printed separations. An evaluation experiment was completed to determine which separation gave the best results. Thirty viewers used a paired comparison evaluation procedure to determine which LOF value gave the preferred results. However, neither the Kodak or the Hell methods were valid according to the results. The printed separations indicated that exposure causes detectable differences between the printed separations. Based upon the results of the separations, neither the Kodak System or the <b>Hell</b> <b>System</b> to determine the correct LOF produced the optimum results on the Hell DC 300 B/L Scanner as determined by the control group of observers...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that the gravure process {{provides}} the best quality printed materials and the fastest production speed. The gravure process, {{as a matter of}} fact, is the only process which can utilize fully digital imaging technology. For instance, the Helio-Klischograph Model K 201 and K 202 incorporated with the <b>Hell</b> Chromacom <b>System</b> can engrave gravure cylinders directly without using any halftone films or bromides. Hell Co., Ltd., moreover, has been developing the electron beam engraving technique which employs digital imaging technology to engrave gravure cylinders. On the other hand, Crosfield Electronics Co., Ltd. introduced the Lasergravure process which also utilizes digital imaging technology to engrave gravure cylinders. However, these techniques represent very high costs for gravure printers. Only large companies can afford such investments. The gravure process, generally speaking, is the most expensive process, mainly due to the costs of printing cylinder preparation. To compensate for costly prepress, it is therefore used for high production runs. This constraint is the main disadvantage of the gravure process and has caused the gravure market to become smaller than its competitors web offset and flexography. Research in web offset and flexo has been successful in developing higher print quality, faster production speed and lower costs. Therefore, there are some companies which have been developing a method of making photopolymer-coated cylinders for gravure to reduce, not only the costs of the metal cylinders and the sophisticated equipment, but also the production time. The company that provided photopolymer material for this thesis claimed that its products can be commercially made as gravure cylinders. This photopolymer can be imaged by a conventional ultraviolet fluorescent lamp. Both the company and the author agreed that it might be feasible to utilize digital imaging technology to image this photopolymer. The author selected the Hell Chromagraph 399 ER Laser Scanner as a digital imaging source to image onto this photopolymer. After enormous efforts in the experiments, the argon ion laser on the Hell 399 ER was not able to image onto this photopolymer regardless of the laser intensity and the length of the exposure time because the spectral sensitivity of this photopolymer did not match the argon ion laser. The author, however, conducted further experiments to prove that this photopolymer can be imaged by a high-power UV-argon ion laser, but it is, at present, impractical for gravure printers. Some recommendations for further studies in this area are suggested...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The research scope and objectives are to investigate the use of 'geometric reasoning' using the knowledge based techniques established for expert systems. An Expert System is integrated within the SAMMIE (System for Aiding Man-Machine Interaction Evaluation) computer man modelling system and used for vehicle interior design. Vehicle design objectives are related to a rule base determined from national and international standards and legislation. Malaysia is now progressing towards becoming an Industrialised Country by the year 2020. In mid 1985 the Malaysian Motor Industry produced the Proton Saga which has since been exported to other countries. Although the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) is playing {{an important role in}} design activities and provision of standardisation information, some standards and legislation for vehicle interior design are not easily available. There is an important and urgent need for standards and legislation to facilitate vehicle design within Malaysia and Internationally. A literature survey on the relevance of ergonomics design to standards and legislation for vehicle interior design is presented. Knowledge and expertise required for the knowledge base were elicited from various resources; extracted from journals, research publications and standards reports from various international organisations. The SAMMIE system was used to develop a prototype design model for the vehicle interior and the KES expert <b>systems</b> <b>hell</b> was selected to develop the Ergonomics Design Knowledge Based Expert System (EDKBES). EDKBES has a modular structure for ease of software readability, editing and testing, and to readily facilitate further development. The knowledge base is divided into several sections related to the hierarchical structure of vehicle interior design...|$|R
