50|$|Despite {{emergency}} brake applications being made, the train eventually derailed on the trap {{points at the}} exit of the goods yard and continued for a further 70 yards before finally crashing into the Coton Hill South signal box, destroying it completely. The first 11 wagons followed the locomotive, but {{the destruction of the}} signal box opened a set of points which sent 24 further wagons into a siding, where they derailed and some collided with a second Class 47 diesel which was waiting to leave the yard. The destruction was widespread and the cleanup operation was further hampered by hydrochloric acid leaking from a <b>damaged</b> <b>wagon.</b> Normal service was not restored until 14 January.|$|E
50|$|A {{marshalling}} yard was {{opened to the}} west of the station on 30 July 1946. It was used for many years by the British Railways' Civil Engineer and was home to a Ruston and Hornsby 0-6-0 diesel shunter, PWM652. After the end of this permanent way work the sidings were little used, mainly being a place to store unwanted or <b>damaged</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 22 September 1921 a Plymouth to [...] {{passenger}} train collided with an [...] to [...] goods train that was shunting in the station.

50|$|In 1978, {{the track}} between the 24.6 km mark and Lottengrün station was dismantled. The {{remaining}} track from Falkenstein to the 24.6 km mark was still operated as a siding of the Wismut uranium mine.

50|$|The Mormon Battalion {{marched through}} the river valley in 1846, {{and the only}} battle the {{battalion}} fought in their journey to California occurred near the river. The battalion's presence had aroused curiosity {{among a number of}} wild cattle, and the bulls of these herds <b>damaged</b> <b>wagons</b> and injured mules. In response, the men shot dozens of the charging bulls. Mormon settlers later returned to this area in 1877 to found a settlement that became St. David, and logged the Huachuca Mountains to provide lumber for building Fort Huachuca and Tombstone.|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} {{from the}} SYJR {{would be the}} primary route to the facility, which would have 4 reception sidings and 5 handling sidings, {{as well as all}} distribution warehouses rail connected, with addition lines for <b>damaged</b> <b>wagons,</b> and locomotive storage. Gauging enhancements to loading gauge W10 are planned for connecting lines, with construction design allowing overhead electrification at a later date. The track plan allows train lengths of up to 775m, with siding lengths between 589 and 775m; trains over 450m would be handled by an on site shunter.|$|R

40|$|It {{is found}} {{that the cost of}} lost (<b>damaged)</b> <b>wagons</b> {{determined}} in accordance with the operating order of indemnity of losses differs considerably from the market cost. This difference is related to a discrepancy of normative prices on new wagons to the prices of manufacturers as well as to a gap of used method of account of wagon deterioration to the relation between the cost and the time of wagon operation, which is at the market. At the choice of money form of indemnity of losses, it is suggested to determine the wagon cost by independent (expert) estimate or the set norms at the discretion of railway administration-owner. In so doing, to change the method of determination of wagon deterioration from a rectilinear one on a method of decreasing rest.

50|$|The typical wagon with 40 to 50 in {{diameter}} wheels could easily move {{over rough ground}} and rocks without high centering and even over most tree stumps if required. The wooden wheels were protected with an iron rim (tire) typically about 1.5 in wide. These iron tires were installed hot so they would shrink tightly onto the wood wheel when they cooled. Nevertheless, it was often necessary to use wooden wedges to keep the iron rim on or soak the wheel in water. The dry desert air sometimes dried the tires so much the iron tire was prone to fall off. Wagon wheels could often be repaired by blacksmiths found along the way or replaced with an abandoned wagon's wheel but otherwise if <b>damaged</b> the <b>wagon</b> usually had to be abandoned. Some <b>damaged</b> <b>wagons</b> were salvaged by cutting the wagon in half and converting the front or rear half of the wagon into a two-wheeled cart. Most of the wagons had a large toolbox, mounted on the left side, usually containing an ax, wagon jack, ropes, short handled shovel, wheel chains for securing the wheels for steep descents and extra chain to hook up another team if double teaming was required for steep ascents and other tools often needed or used. The wagon jack was used for raising each wagon wheel. Then the large axle nut could be unscrewed and the wheel removed for greasing which was required periodically. The wheels were greased {{with a mixture of}} tar or pine resin and lard contained in a covered wooden bucket or large ox horn often hanging from the rear axle to keep its greasy contents away from other goods. Starting with at least one gallon of wagon grease was recommended. On a wagon there was essentially no reverse or brakes and the turning radius was nearly always greater than 125 ft so the teamsters had to think about how to extract the wagon and his team from wherever they went.|$|R
60|$|To prevent Billy doing <b>damage</b> to the <b>wagon</b> by {{twisting}} in {{the shafts}} or by kicking, Matt unharnessed him {{and pushed the}} wagon back a few feet into a somewhat open space. Here the rain came down heavier, but he felt safer than {{in close proximity to}} the tree.|$|R

50|$|For {{the next}} century the line was used for {{phosphate}} transport and for tourism purposes. In September 2009 there were massive rains in the area. The water flooded the plateau and by Selja Gorges found its way out to Gafsa valley. The railways was badly <b>damaged,</b> and train <b>wagons</b> on mines sidings were rolled over by water.The rail line was closed for about a year, until repairs were completed.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War the Allendorf {{explosives}} factories of Dynamit Nobel and WASAG {{were built}} {{and they were}} connected to the station {{with a total of}} 39 kilometres of track and 97 sets of points. As a result, the station was greatly expanded (ten new tracks) and provided with two signal boxes. In addition, the level crossing was removed and replaced by a pedestrian underpass, which still exists. In 1942, a connecting track was opened to the Kirtorf airfield, but this was closed in 1947. After the war, production was stopped in the explosives factories and the <b>damaged</b> rail <b>wagons</b> were scrapped. The sidings continued to be used (and sometimes they still are) by local companies and the Herrenwald barracks.|$|R
2500|$|Weare Giffard is {{situated}} near the tidal {{limit of the}} River Torridge, and coal and limestone had been brought up-stream by boat {{for a long time}} previously to the building of the Rolle Canal [...] in 1823 - 1827. Due to the corrosive properties of quick lime, the product of the kiln, it was essential that kilns should be situated as closely as possible to the agricultural fields on which it was to be spread. Should the quick lime become wet during transport by the farmer to his farm, it would corrode its container and <b>damage</b> the <b>wagon</b> or pack-animal on which it was being transported. [...] Culm, a form of imperfect anthracite, was mined in Devon at Tavistock and Chittlehampton as well as being imported from South Wales via Bideford. The limestone largely came from Caldey Island off the South Wales coast, although Devon had quarries at Landkey, Swimbridge, Filleigh, South Molton and Combe Martin.|$|R
5000|$|The Cow Creek Trail was {{far from}} ideal, and {{carrying}} freight to Fr. Benton was never an easy task. In the confines of Cow Creek's narrow but relatively flat creek bottom, the creek meanders from one steep coulee sidewall to the other. While traveling the 15 miles up Cow Creek the heavy freight wagons had to ford Cow Creek 31 times. The fords would wash out if the area had a heavy rain. In wetter weather heavy wagons could bog down at a creek crossing. After going 15 miles up the creek bottom, the freighters encountered long steep grades. The freighters had to stop, unhitch and [...] "double team" [...] or even [...] "triple team" [...] each of the wagons. In 1864 while ascending a steep grade on the trail, a wagon ran its outside wheels off the trail and went over, dragging the ox team with it. The descent of 300 feet killed the oxen, badly <b>damaged</b> the <b>wagon</b> and scattered its contents.|$|R
50|$|The {{field of}} battle was an almost featureless, flat plain. The French army, {{numbering}} between 3,000 and 4,000, confronted the much smaller English force who had set up defensive positions by drawing up the supply wagons into a makeshift fortification. The entire defensive formation was then further protected by the placement of sharpened spikes all around to prevent the French cavalry from charging, a tactic which had been employed, with great success, at the Battle of Agincourt. The French attack began with a bombardment using gunpowder artillery, a relatively new weapon for the time and one whose proper usage was not well understood although it was <b>damaging</b> to the <b>wagons</b> and caused English casualties.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{developed}} a parallel multiobjective optimisation methodology to enable fast optimisations of draft gear designs for heavy haul trains. Improvements were {{achieved in the}} development of deterministic white-box draft gear models to enable direct use of the results in product design. Draft gear model parameters such as spring stiffness, wedge angles, and preloads were used as optimisation variables. Two optimisation algorithms were used: Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation. All draft gear designs in the optimisations were constrained by impact tests to ensure the optimised designs also comply with current draft gear acceptance standards. Draft gear performance was assessed using whole-trip Longitudinal Train Dynamics (LTD) simulations and coupler fatigue damage calculations. Each simulation covered about 640 km of track and had about 10 hours of operational time. Three optimisation objectives were considered: minimal fatigue <b>damage</b> for <b>wagon</b> connection systems of loaded trains, minimal in-train (coupler) forces for loaded trains, and minimal longitudinal wagon accelerations for empty trains.

50|$|The Westerleigh {{goods train}} was still passing {{under the bridge}} {{at the time of}} the {{collision}}. The engine and eight Wagons were clear of the site when the collision occurred. The locomotive and front 6 wagons were undamaged, but the seventh and eighth were derailed, although they remained attached to the locomotive and upright, being dragged down the line until Honeyfield and Clarke realized what had occurred. The ninth wagon was derailed by the LMS mail locomotive, skidding into the down cutting by the bridge just ahead of the locomotive. The tenth wagon was hurled by the engine off the rails and collided with the down cutting of the bridge, coming to a halt close to the GWR Engine. The eleventh wagon followed the tenth, clipping the mail train's tender which stopped it. The twelfth wagon came loose from the eleventh after colliding with it and being pushed so it was facing opposite to the rails. The thirteenth wagon was derailed and collided with the rear of the twelfth wagon. The fourteenth wagon had been pushed by the LMS mail locomotive's momentum off the Rails, facing parallel to the down Line with minor <b>damage.</b> The fifteenth <b>wagon</b> had clipped the rear right-side of the fourteenth wagon and had derailed to the right of it. The sixteenth wagon was derailed at the front left side and the rear right side. The seventeenth wagon's coupling to the sixteenth broke in the collision and was slightly derailed. The eighteenth wagon had similarly been slightly derailed but was undamaged. The remaining 29 wagons and Callaway's van were undamaged and remained on the rails.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} laboratory {{investigation was}} carried out to assess the structural adequacy of a disused PHO Class Flat Bottom Rail Wagon (FRW) for a single lane low volume road bridge application as per the design provisions of the Australian Bridge Design Standard AS 5100 (2004). The investigation also encompassed a review into the risk associated with the pre-existing <b>damage</b> in <b>wagons</b> incurred during their service life on rail. The main objective of the laboratory testing of the FRW was to physically measure its performance under the same applied traffic loading it {{would be required to}} resist as a road bridge deck. In order to achieve this a full width (5. 2 m) single lane, single span (approximately 10 m), simply supported bridge would be required to be constructed and tested in a structural laboratory. However, the available clear spacing between the columns of the loading portal frame encountered within the laboratory was insufficient to accommodate the 5. 2 m wide bridge deck excluding clearance normally considered necessary in structural testing. Therefore, only half of the full scale bridge deck (single FRW of width 2. 6 m) was able to be accommodated and tested; with the continuity of the bridge deck in the lateral direction applied as boundary constraints along the full length of the FRW at six selected locations. This represents a novel approach not yet reported in the literature for bridge deck testing to the best of the knowledge of the author. The test {{was carried out}} under two loadings provided in AS 5100 (2004) – one stationary W 80 wheel load and the second a moving axle load M 1600. As the bridge investigated in the study is a single lane single span low volume road bridge, the risk of pre-existing damage and the expected high cycle fatigue failure potential was assessed as being minimal and hence the bridge deck was not tested structurally for fatigue/ fracture. The high axle load requirements have instead been focussed upon the investigation into the serviceability and ultimate limit state requirements. The testing regime adopted however involved extensive recording of strains and deflections at several critical locations of the FRW. Three locations of W 80 point load and two locations of the M 1600 Axle load were considered for the serviceability testing; the FRW was also tested under the ultimate load dictated by the M 1600. The outcomes of the experimental investigation have demonstrated that the FRW is structurally adequate to resist the prescribed traffic loadings outlaid in AS 5100 (2004). As the loading was directly applied on to the FRW, the laboratory testing is assessed as being significantly conservative. The FRW bridge deck in the field would only resist the load transferred by the running platform, where, depending on the design, composite action might exist – thereby the share of the loading which needs to be resisted by the FRW would be smaller than the system tested in the lab. On this basis, a demonstration bridge is under construction at the time of writing this thesis and future research will involve field testing in order to assess its performance...|$|R
