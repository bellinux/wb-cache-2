500|$|One of Australia's {{most highly}} {{regarded}} songbirds, the Australian magpie {{has a wide}} variety of calls, many of which are complex. Pitch may vary over up to four octaves, and the bird can mimic over 35 species of native and introduced bird species, as well as dogs and horses. Magpies have even been noted to mimic human speech when living in close proximity to humans. Its complex, musical, warbling call {{is one of the most}} familiar Australian bird sounds. In Denis Glover's poem [...] "The Magpies", the mature magpie's call is described as quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle, one of the most famous lines in New Zealand poetry, and as waddle giggle <b>gargle</b> paddle poodle, in the children's book Waddle Giggle <b>Gargle</b> by Pamela Allen.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1694, herbalist John Pechey {{described}} A.auricula-judae {{by saying}} [...] "It grows to the Trunk of the Elder-Tree. Being dried {{it will keep}} a good year.

And being infus'd in some proper Water, it is good in Diseases of the Eyes." [...] The species also saw use as an astringent due to its ability to absorb water. There are recorded medicinal usages from Scotland, where it was again used as a <b>gargle</b> for sore throats, and from Ireland, where, {{in an attempt to}} cure jaundice, it was boiled in milk. The medicinal use of A.auricula-judae continued until at least 1860, when it was still sold at Covent Garden; at the time, it was not considered edible in the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Japan, <b>gargling</b> is a {{generally}} accepted way of preventing {{upper respiratory tract}} infection (URTI). The effectiveness of <b>gargling</b> for preventing URTI {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial that compared incidences of URTI between <b>gargling</b> and control groups. From the perspective of the third-party payer, <b>gargling</b> is dominant {{due to the fact that}} the costs of <b>gargling</b> are borne by the participant. However, the cost-effectiveness of <b>gargling</b> from a societal perspective should be considered. In this study, economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of <b>gargling</b> for preventing URTI from a societal perspective. Methods Among participants in the <b>gargling</b> trial, 122 water-gargling and 130 control subjects were involved in the economic analysis. Sixty-day cumulative follow-up costs and effectiveness measured by quality-adjusted life days (QALD) were compared between groups on an intention-to-treat basis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was converted to dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) and probability of <b>gargling</b> being cost-effective were estimated by bootstrapping. Results After 60 days, QALD was increased by 0. 43 and costs were $ 37. 1 higher in the <b>gargling</b> group than in the control group. ICER of the <b>gargling</b> group was $ 31, 800 /QALY (95 %CI, $ 1, 900 –$ 248, 100). Although this resembles many acceptable forms of medical intervention, including URTI preventive measures such as influenza vaccination, the broad confidence interval indicates uncertainty surrounding our results. In addition, one-way sensitivity analysis also indicated that careful evaluation is required for the cost of <b>gargling</b> and the utility of moderate URTI. The major limitation of this study was that this trial was conducted in winter, at a time when URTI is prevalent. Care must be taken when applying the results to a season when URTI is not prevalent, since the ICER will increase due to decreases in incidence. Conclusion This study suggests <b>gargling</b> as a cost-effective preventive strategy for URTI that is acceptable from perspectives of both the third-party payer and society. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In early 1980, {{production}} on the pilot episode began on several fronts. [...] Rod Lord of Pearce Animation Studios directed a 50-second pilot, hand-animated, giving a 'computer graphic' feel to the Babel Fish speech {{of the first}} episode. Douglas Adams and Alan J.W. Bell were both pleased with the animation, and Lord was given the go-ahead {{to do all of}} the animation for Episode 1, and subsequently the complete TV series. Narration for the first episode was recorded by Peter Jones in March 1980. The filming of two green-skinned aliens reacting to Pan Galactic <b>Gargle</b> Blasters was done on 8 May 1980. Further filming of crowd reactions to the Vogons, location filming of Arthur's house and a scene in a pub were done between 11 and 16 May 1980. Scenes aboard the Vogon ship were recorded on 7 June 1980, in the BBC's TC1 studio. The final edit of the pilot episode was completed on 2 July 1980, and it was premiered for a test audience three days later (5 July 1980). Further test screenings were held in August 1980. Based on successful test screenings, the cast was reassembled to complete the six episodes of the series in September 1980. Production continued through the autumn, with filming and recording occurring out of order. Recording and production of the final episode continued into January 1981.|$|E

School-aged children {{play an important role}} in the infection and spread of influenza in the form of school-based outbreaks. Preventing influenza infection among students is essential for reducing the frequency of epidemics and pandemics. As a non-pharmaceutical intervention against infection, <b>gargling</b> is also commonly performed in Asian countries but has not yet been extensively studied. A randomized, open label, 2 -group parallel study of 757 high school students (15 to 17 years of age) was conducted for 90 days during the influenza epidemic season from December 1 st, 2011 to February 28 th, 2012, in 6 high schools in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The green tea <b>gargling</b> group <b>gargled</b> 3 times a day with bottled green tea, and the water <b>gargling</b> group did the same with tap water. The water group was restricted from <b>gargling</b> with green tea. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza using immunochromatographic assay for antigen detection. 757 participants were enrolled and 747 participants completed the study (384 in the green tea group and 363 in the water group). Multivariate logistic regression indicated no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza between the green tea group (19 participants; 4. 9 %) and the water group (25 participants; 6. 9 %) (adjusted OR, 0. 69; 95 %CI, 0. 37 to 1. 28; P =  0. 24). The main limitation of the study is the adherence rate among high school students was lower than expected. Among high school students, <b>gargling</b> with green tea three times a day was not significantly more efficacious than <b>gargling</b> with water for the prevention of influenza infection. In order to adequately assess the effectiveness of such <b>gargling,</b> additional large-scale randomized studies are needed. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01225770...|$|R

In a {{previous}} study, we {{have suggested that}} the salivary ATP swab test provides a simple and valid method to establish oral hygiene. (The assessment of oral hygiene with the ATP detection test : A comparative study of tooth brushing and garglerelated variation using the salivary ATP swab test) The purpose of the current study is to assess oral hygiene before and after tooth-brushing followed by either rinsing and <b>gargling</b> three times with 150 mL tap water or twice with 150 mL saline. Saliva ATP values were 4. 12 and 2. 98 times higher than the baseline after first rinsing and <b>gargling</b> with tap water and saline, respectively. In addition, after second rinsing and <b>gargling</b> either with tap water or saline, the ATP values were close to those of the saliva before tooth-brushing. Moreover, after third rinsing and <b>gargling</b> with tap water, the ATP value was lower prior to tooth-brushing. Significant difference was found in comparing the mean ATP values in saliva. First rinsing and <b>gargling</b> with saline increased ATP values, whereas, the second rinsing and <b>gargling</b> decreased ATP values to below the pre-rinsing baseline, although the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, the saliva was contaminated by tooth-brushing, however, it was considered possible that rinsing off with more than 300 mL liquid can remove debris stagnant in the oral cavity...|$|R

Upon these principles of human nature, Sir, is based the theory of the Charity Bazaar. People were doubtless charitably disposed.
