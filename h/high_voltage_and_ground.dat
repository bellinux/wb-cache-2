40|$|Electrical {{discharges}} {{in liquid}} radiate Aide-band high power ultrasound (HPU) pulses {{which are the}} result of the initial expansion and later collapse of a transient plasma/vapor-filled cavity located between the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> electrodes. The cavity may be formed by a process of a fast streamer breakdown, or by a slower Joule heating and evaporation mechanism which leads to the development of an initial inter-electrode gas bubble which subsequently breaks down. An alternative approach is to use fast Joule evaporation of a thin metallic wire placed between the electrodes. Compared with free discharge HPU sources this method could potentially provide a higher efficiency for the conversion of the electrical energy stored in the high-voltage, pulsed power supply into acoustic energy radiated into the liquid. This would be an advantage in practical applications of spark discharge HPU pulses. The present paper discusses the generation of acoustic pulses in water by wire-guided spark discharges. Wire-guided spark discharges with energies up to 1 kJ have been generated by capacitor-based pulsed power circuitry in a plastic tank filled with tap water. A ball deformation gauge has been used to estimate the peak pressure in the acoustic pulses by measuring the acoustically-induced mechanical deformation of a copper sphere.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of the efficacy of Zinc Oxide microvaristor compound for stress control on polymeric outdoor insulators. The preliminary work has involved a comprehensive literature survey, followed by extensive computational modelling and simulation studies as well as laboratory works covering experimental investigations and fabrication of insulator prototypes. The literature survey reviewed stress-induced degradations as the cause of ageing and insulation failures, the determination of electric field distributions, considerations for outdoor insulator modelling, and field-optimisation techniques for achieving stress relief. An 11 kV polymeric insulator has been modelled and simulated under dry-clean and wet-polluted surface conditions in order to obtain electric field distribution along the insulator creepage path. The critical high field regions on polymeric surfaces were identified. In addition, clean fog solid layer tests were carried out to experimentally examine dry band formation and electric discharges. Experimental investigations confirmed the results previously achieved from theoretical simulations. A non-linear pollution model has been developed for simulating polluted outdoor insulators. The field-dependent conductivity was derived from layer conductance measurements in a non-standard low voltage test. The proposed model was used to simulate insulators under fog and light rain conditions which respectively represent a uniform and non-uniform wetting action in practice. It was demonstrated that the nonlinear pollution model yields a more detailed and realistic field distribution compared with results obtained with models using constant/linear conductivity. Short-length microvaristor coating, having a cone-shaped structure, was introduced at both insulator ends for controlling high field, particularly near the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> terminals. The performance of field grading was evaluated through a number of simulation scenarios. The introduction of microvaristor material with an appropriate switching characteristic has led to a substantial improvement in the electric field and heat distributions along the insulator profile. The prototype of an 11 kV insulator with microvaristor grading material was fabricated in-house for preliminary tests. Lightning impulse (1. 2 / 50 μs) flashover tests were carried out using the ‘up and down’ method, and the flashover voltage was estimated by the 50 % probability breakdown, U 50. The results of the lightning impulse test have indicated a considerable increase in the flashover voltage up to 21 % when using microvaristor-graded insulator. Favourable field distributions obtained in the simulation study have indicated a strong correlation with the experimental results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} kinds of {{electrohydrodynamics}} (EHD) pumping based on Coulomb force: induction pumping, ion-drag pumping, and pure conduction pumping. EHD induction pumping relies on the generation of induced charges. This charge induction {{in the presence of}} an electric field takes place due to a non-uniformity in the electrical conductivity of the fluid which can be caused by a non-uniform temperature distribution and/or an inhomogeneity of the fluid (e. g. a two-phase fluid). Therefore, induction pumping cannot be utilized in an isothermal homogeneous liquid. In order to generate Coulomb force, a space charge must be generated. There are two main mechanisms for generating a space charge in an isothermal liquid. The first one is associated with the ion injection at a metal/liquid interface and the related pumping is referred to as ion-drag pumping. Ion-drag pumping is not desirable because it can deteriorate the electrical properties of the working fluid. The second space charge generation mechanism is associated with the heterocharge layers of finite thickness {{in the vicinity of the}} electrodes. Heterocharge layers result from dissociation of the neutral electrolytic species and recombination of the generated ions. This type of pumping is referred to as pure conduction pumping. This project investigates the EHD pumping through pure conduction phenomenon. Very limited work has been conducted in this field and the majority of the published papers in this area have mistakenly assumed that the electrostriction force was responsible for the net flow generated in an isothermal liquid. The main motivation behind this study is to investigate an EHD conduction pump for a two-phase loop to be operated in the microgravity environment. The pump is installed in the liquid return passage (isothermal liquid) from the condenser section to the evaporator section. Unique <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> electrodes have been designed that generate sufficient pressure heads with very low electric power requirements making the EHD conduction pumping attractive to applications such as two-phase systems (e. g. capillary pumped loops and heat pipes). Currently, the EHD conduction pump performance is being tested on a two-phase loop under various operating conditions in the laboratory environment. The simple non-mechanical and lightweight design of the EHD pump combined with the rapid control of performance by varying the applied electric field, low power consumption, and reliability offer significant advantages over other pumping mechanisms; particularly in reduced gravity applications...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of trifluoroiodomethane (CF 3 I) gas mixtures as an alternative for an insulation medium in high voltage applications. The work has involved a broad review of literature, followed by developing a test rig for carrying out experimental investigations, extensive computational modelling and simulation studies as well as extensive laboratory tests on CF 3 I gas and its gas mixtures. The literature survey reviewed the current trend of efforts taken by researchers to find solutions for minimizing the usage of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) as a gas insulator, focusing on CF 3 I and its mixtures. The physical properties of CF 3 I are investigated, along with thermal and electrical properties. A new test rig has been designed and constructed specifically to be used for gas insulation research. The test rig is integrated with wireless temperature and humidity sensors, as well as an electrode gap length control system. The test rig is completed with a gas recovery system to ensure proper gas handling is carried out after each test. Extensive laboratory experimental investigations on CF 3 I mixtures have been completed, focusing on the mixture of CF 3 I-CO 2 gas with a ratio of 30 %- 70 %. Standard lightning impulse of 1. 2 / 50 has been used, with both positive and negative polarity. The effects of electrode configuration, impulse polarity, electrode gap length, gas pressure, and CF 3 I content have been investigated. Insulation properties such as 50 % breakdown voltage (U 50) and V-t characteristics for each test condition are investigated and presented, as well as the electric field behaviour. Finite element method (FEM) has been used to determine the electric field behaviour of a given test condition. This study revealed that CF 3 I gas mixtures perform better under more uniform field condition. It was also found that an increase in gas pressure will increase the insulation strength and an increase in CF 3 I content is more likely to give benefit in conditions with a more uniform field when compared to less uniform field conditions. Also, relation between liquefaction temperatures of a CF 3 I-CO 2 mixture with varying CF 3 I content has been developed for various pressures based on literature. Observations on solid by-products of CF 3 I have also been carried out. It has been found that iodine particles are deposited on both <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> electrodes, which can affect the insulation properties of CF 3 I and its mixtures...|$|E

Bushings are used to insulate <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> conductors where they feed through steel tank of a power transformer. There are different sources of electric stress that may result in degradation of bushing. Partial discharges (PDs) are one of the main sources of electrical degradation. PDs occur due to defects in electrical insulations, and can lead to insulation failure. This thesis is composed of two parts. The first part deals with design of a 145 kV oil impregnated paper (OIP) bushing by using capacitive radial grading technique. In capacitive grading the foils of calculated length are placed at predetermined radial distance between the paper layers in order to distribute <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> electric field uniformly between <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> conductor <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> potential. A 145 kV OIP bushing was designed according to dimensions of ABB GOE type bushing. After calculations, the 145 kV bushing geometry was modeled in COMSOL Multiphysics in order to analyze the <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> electric field distribution in the bushing. In the second part of this thesis a scaled down model was designed using the capacitive radial grading technique. After designing, the scale down model was implemented in COMSOL {{in order to ensure that}} the <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> electric field distribution should be similar to the full scale model of bushing.

40|$|The {{effects of}} DC {{electric}} fields on non-premixed ethylene flames in a counterflow burner were studied experimentally {{with a focus}} on the reduction of soot particles. The experiment was conducted by connecting a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> terminal <b>and</b> a <b>ground</b> terminal to a lower (fuel) and upper (oxidizer) nozzle, respectively. We applied direct current (DC) potentials in a range of - 5 kV < Vdc < 5 kV. Uniform electric fields were then generated in the gap between the two nozzles. The experimental conditions were selected to cover both soot formation (SF) and soot formation oxidation (SFO) flames. The flames subjected to the negative electric fields moved toward the fuel nozzle because of an ionic wind due to the Lorentz force acting on the positive ions in the flames. In addition, the yellow luminosity significantly decreased, indicating changes in the sooting characteristics. To analyze the sooting characteristics under the electric fields, planar laser induced incandescence (PLII) and fluorescence (PLIF) techniques were used to visualize the soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and OH radicals. The sooting limits in terms of the fuel and oxygen mole fractions were measured. No substantial soot formation due to the effects of the DC electric fields for the tested range of <b>voltages</b> <b>and</b> reactant mole fractions could be identified.

The technique of dry-process-based plasma polymerization is appropriate for modifying the surface chemistry of a material because it is a versatile method and is applicable {{for a wide variety of}} substrate materials. This thesis presents the preparation and characterization of the surface coating of sealed microchannels for biomedical and microfluidic applications. During the first phase of this study, a low cost <b>and</b> low power, <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> plasma power supply was developed and tested by generating atmospheric pressure microplasma. A fast, sensitive and original overcurrent protection system was implemented to protect the power source in the case of short circuiting, and the microplasma reactor in the case of incidental arcing. In addition to this, the characterization of the atmospheric pressure microplasma was performed by measuring the spectroscopic and electrical parameters of the discharge. The parameters of the microplasma were also numerically computed. Predictions from the numerical simulations were found to be in close agreement with the experimental measurements. In the second part of this study, amino functional polymer films were deposited onto the inner surface of a glass microcapillary. The organic precursors allylamine, ethylenediamine, 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and hexamethyldisiloxane were used to perform the microplasma deposition. An original microplasma configuration which consisted of a perforated <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> electrode <b>and</b> a <b>ground</b> electrode with large surface area was implemented to sustain a uniform glow discharge. Microplasma copolymerization was also carried out by mixing ethylenediamine with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and hexamethyldisiloxane. The composition of monomers in the plasma co-deposition was precisely controlled using a new technique of liquid injection and helical mixing. The mixture of EDA and HMDSO has been copolymerized for the first time and the coatings obtained using this combination were found to be comparatively more stable. The resulting thin films were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, plasma emission spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, contact angle measurements and growth rate analysis. The third part of the thesis reports on a novel technique for coating in bonded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and hybrid (glass/PDMS) microchannels using atmospheric pressure microplasma. The PDMS microchannels were fabricated using soft lithography technique. The hybrid microchannels were prepared using a low cost fabrication method without the requirement of a clean room. Also, an inexpensive setup for the bonding of microchips was developed using a dielectric barrier air plasma.

40|$|In Australia {{and many}} other countries, power {{distribution}} lines are carried on wooden poles. These lines suspended on insulators, which are fixed to wooden poles, pass cities as well as bushlands. Under different weather conditions, insulators become contaminated, and in particular, with damp weather, these insulators lose their ability to provide a perfect insulation between the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> conductor <b>and</b> the <b>ground</b> (through high impedance objects such as wood). A leakage current, small in magnitude, starts flowing from the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> conductor to the ground across the polluted insulator and through the wooden pole. If this phenomenon continues over some time, the currents start heating the wood where there is an abundance of wood-to-metal contact. At a certain stage, it will start smoking and this {{may lead to a}} pole fire. The obvious consequences of this are the loss of power to customers, public safety hazards and potential disasters such as bushfires. This thesis aims at determining which measure or combination of measures of leakage current are best suited for creating a &lsquo;Leakage Current Health Index&rsquo; (LCHI) that can be later used to provide a power system operator with health status for a feeder or system, indicating how urgent a response is needed. To achieve this goal, the impedance characteristics of wooden poles altering the leakage current from insulators are investigated to better understand the role of wood in leakage current signatures. The effective impedance of wood used for poles in Victoria, Australia is established for the first time. Examining the impedance properties of typical Copper Chromium Arsenate (CCA) impregnated wood for 66 kV distribution poles shows dangerous conductance properties of wood at this voltage, providing an explanation for these poles catching fire at triple the rate of 22 kV distribution poles. After a systematic investigation of wood used for poles, a typical impedance characteristic is established for a weathered CCA impregnated wooden pole operating at 22 kV under both dry and wet weather conditions. Next, the leakage current from a single <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> insulator is examined for various contamination levels and under different weather conditions. A new nonlinearity measure is established which utilises the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the degree of leakage current nonlinearity and to build leakage current profiles of a single insulator under different conditions prior to flashover. Several fractal dimensions are also considered {{for the first time to}} measure characteristics of the leakage current profile of a single insulator. These measures are able to quantitatively differentiate between various levels of insulator contamination and different weather conditions, showing an enhanced level of nonlinear activity in the stage prior to insulator flashover. After developing an understanding of a single insulator, systematic modelling is used to build measure profiles of leakage currents for a simple power line, a lossless power line and a lossy power line. Finally, power utility zone substation data for a pole top fire are examined to verify the validity of the profiles observed utilising the measuring techniques determined suitable for establishing a LCHI...|$|R
