5|$|Anwar Sadat was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loyalty or nationhood. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment {{be sent to the}} Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E

The Wachowskis' direction was praised, being described as clever, sophisticated and stylish. Roger Ebert said that their skillful film making showed virtuosity and confidence. Marjorie Baumgarten writing for The Austin Chronicle called it an impressive debut saying that the Wachowskis have [...] "style to burn". James Kendrick called it a darkly comical and stunning film, saying it signalled {{the arrival of the}} Wachowskis on the film scene. Detractors of the film included Todd McCarthy for Variety, who said that the directors <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and lacked depth, that the film was pretentious, superficial and heavy-handed.|$|E

500|$|Ba Cụt {{joined the}} Hòa Hảo militia {{when it was}} formed in 1943–44, and became a {{commander}} within a year. He was feared by his enemies, and was described as [...] "a sort of lean Rasputin" [...] {{who claimed to be}} immortal. According to historian and writer Bernard Fall, [...] "The hapless farmers who were under the rule of the maniacal Ba Cut fared worse , for the latter [...] was given to fits of incredible cruelty and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> public duty." [...] American journalist Joseph Alsop described Ba Cụt as [...] "war-drunk". Ba Cụt was famous for inventing a torture contraption that drilled a steel nail through the victim's ear, a device he used to extort villagers and wealthy landlords to fund his forces. He was said to have [...] "arranged temporary marriages between his troops and village girls". He raised a large amount of funds for the Hòa Hảo and himself personally by charging traders and landlords high prices to stop pirates in the local area. The severed heads of the pirates were subsequently impaled on stakes and put on public display.|$|E
500|$|She is {{also known}} for {{changing}} her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to {{all aspects of the}} album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To Bring You My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed [...] "Joan Crawford on acid" [...] in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that [...] "it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." [...] However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, [...] "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Rangel became {{chair of}} the Select Committee on Narcotics, which {{solidified}} his position as a leading strategist on this perennially important issue to him. [...] Rangel kept the committee going, {{in the face of}} the usual pressure to disband special committees. [...] He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, and advocated increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement were included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. [...] He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; Ebony magazine termed Rangel [...] "a front-line general in the war against drugs." [...] Rangel said [...] "We need outrage!", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of crack cocaine, heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. [...] He believed that legalizing drugs would represent [...] "moral and political suicide". [...] Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self-preservation, and that drug dealers were so stupid that they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. [...] By 1988, Rangel was saying that President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan's [...] "Just Say No" [...] campaign had been quite valuable. [...] The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. [...] The Washington Post said Rangel was [...] "in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation's agenda." [...] He would remain as {{chair of the}} committee through 1993, when it was abolished along with other House select committees.|$|E

Rabbi Menachem Meiri, a famous Catalan Talmudic commentator and Maimonidian philosopher, considered all people, who sincerely profess an ethical religion, {{to be part of}} a greater [...] "spiritual Israel". He explicitly included Christian and Muslims in this category. Meiri rejected all Talmudic laws that discriminate between the Jews and non-Jews, claiming that they only apply to the ancient idolators, who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> morality. The only exceptions are a few laws related directly or indirectly to intermarriage, which Meiri did recognize.|$|E

In Cloak of Deception, she is described as having [...] "a slight figure and a lovely, feminine face as easily the most beautiful, feminine women in Star Wars. She was remarkably solemn for one so young. It was clear that she took her responsibilities with the utmost seriousness." [...] Terry Brooks details the alien Nute Gunray's reaction to her appearance: [...] "She was considered beautiful, Gunray had been told, but he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> human beauty and by Neimoidian standards she was simply colorless and small-featured." [...] Brooks writes that she is [...] "young, beautiful, and serene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luo Guanzhong, {{who wrote}} the 14th-century {{historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, distorted the exact words Cao Cao said after he killed Lü Boshe's family. The most significant change is the replacing of [...] "others" [...] (人; literally [...] "people") with [...] "world" [...] (天下人; literally [...] "people under Heaven"). Yi Zhongtian, a Xiamen University history professor, speculated that Cao Cao was probably trying to console himself after mistakenly killing Lü Boshe's family by speaking in a regretful tone ("heartrendingly remarked"). Yi believed that Luo Guanzhong had deliberately changed {{the words in the}} quote to reflect that Cao Cao <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> remorse because [...] "world" [...] carries greater weight than [...] "others", so as to enhance Cao's image as a villain in his novel.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Dutch Republic the land of the Low Countries had been inhabited by a number of disparate peoples who migrated from other lands and left only traces of their culture on the territory of the Low Countries. In the 10th century the Franks, Frisians and Saxons who lived in the territory of the Low Countries <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> common identity or unifying factors. The name “Dutch” that binds the people together as a single, unified group was not yet in use. [...] Instead, the inhabitants of the lands were loyal to local lords, the territory that they lived on and to the towns of which they were burghers. In the early stages of existence, [...] the concept of national identity had not been developed as a way by which a group of people could self-identify as such. Instead, they were labeled according to the place that they live and by their professions. Over time, these independent towns were subordinate to German, French, Roman or Spanish rule.|$|E
