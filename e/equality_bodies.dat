40|$|Since 2003 {{there have}} been discussions over the {{creation}} of a single <b>equality</b> <b>body.</b> This will now become a reality following the passing of the Equality Act 2006 which provides for the creation of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR), therefore not just a single <b>equality</b> <b>body</b> but a human rights commission as well. This is similar to many other countries across the world which also have human rights and equality commissions, e. g. Australia, Canada and New Zealand to name but a few. In addition to introducing the creation of the CEHR, the Equality Act also extended the provisions on equality around certain strands, thus providing better protection to members of those groups...|$|R

40|$|Diploma thesis "The Public Defender of Rights as a Gender Equality Body" {{explores the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the ombudsman in the area of equal treatment and prohibition of discrimination (so-called <b>Equality</b> <b>Body).</b> The main focus of the work is the equality of men and women. The methodology used is theoretical-analytical legal analysis. The work starts with a theoretical analysis of basic terms and concepts relating to equal treatment and prohibition of discrimination. The institution and activities of the ombudsman are also defined in theory. This is followed by a legal analysis of three types. The first one is a procedural analysis of anti-discrimination laws (method of their enactment, past, present and proposed laws). This is followed by an institutional analysis of the Czech <b>Equality</b> <b>Body</b> and the impact of the ombudsman in the area of equal rights. The analytical research is concluded with a substantive legal analysis of selected cases decided by the ombudsman. Methods of feminist legal analysis have been predominantly used {{for the purposes of the}} analytical research.

40|$|Broad EU {{anti-discrimination}} law {{has only recently}} developed, with the impetus given by the Treaty of Amsterdam. From an institutional point of view, it has had a major impact, resulting in the setting up of many national specialized bodies {{for the promotion of}} equal treatment and the reshaping of existent agencies. Beyond the large spectrum of <b>equality</b> <b>bodies</b> found across Europe, this chapter highlights general trends and presents some models that were shaped prior to any European requirement and that have influenced policy makers (<b>equality</b> <b>bodies</b> established in Great Britain, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Ireland). It also underscores key challenges that these national institutions must address in order to improve effectively the implementation of equality norms and to achieve substantive equality.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the viability of}} intersectionality as an analytical and strategic tool {{within the context of}} recent UK equality initiatives, in particular expansion of the grounds upon which a discrimination claim can be based, the establishment of a new single <b>equality</b> <b>body,</b> the Commission of Equality and Human Rights (CEHR), and the anticipated streamlining of equality legislation.

25|$|In 2000, the Romanian Parliament {{enacted a}} law that {{explicitly}} outlawed {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation in a variety of fields, including employment, the provision of and access to goods and services, housing, education, health care, audiovisual programming, the justice system, other public services and social security. The law, which is among the most comprehensive in the European Union, has been successfully tested by the National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD), Romania's <b>equality</b> <b>body,</b> which has fined a number of individuals and firms for discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. An example of this was when TAROM, the national air carrier, was fined for refusing to allow same-sex partners to take advantage of its discounts for couples on Valentine's Day 2005.
