25|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> is {{commonly}} targeted by both anglers and spearfishermen, {{and is considered}} to be a gamefish. <b>Golden</b> <b>trevally</b> will take a variety of baits and lures and may be caught from both the shore and boats, making it a highly accessible species. Baits commonly employed for <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> include prawns and a variety of small fish or cut baits. The fish are known to follow a burley stream right up to the back of a boat, allowing for easy capture on unweighted baits. A variety of lures may be employed when targeting the species, including jigs, poppers, spoons, slices, and minnows, with large minnows trolled around reefs often accounting for larger specimens. The use of saltwater fly fishing to specifically target <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> has developed in recent years, especially over shallow, sandy flats. In these cases, a sinking line and leader is employed to not spook the fish in these shallow waters. Once hooked, <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> are known for fast runs and hard fights, especially when reef or other structures are present. <b>Golden</b> <b>trevally</b> are considered one of the best members of the trevally family for eating, with bleeding recommended. The fish has slightly translucent, dark-pink flesh while fresh, becoming white and juicy during cooking, although has a tendency to become dry, flaky, and fibrous. A rich, tangy fish flavour is noted.|$|E
25|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>{{trevally}},</b> Gnathanodon speciosus (also {{known as}} the golden kingfish, banded trevally and king trevally), is a species of large marine fish classified in the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, and {{the only member of}} the genus Gnathanodon. The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa in the west to Central America in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species predominantly occupies inshore waters where it inhabits both reef and sandy substrates. The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> is easily distinguished from its relatives by its fleshy, rubbery lips and unique colouration, which ranges from bright yellow with black bars as a juvenile to a golden-silvery colour as an adult. It is known to grow to 120 cm in length and 15 kg in weight. The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> schools as a juvenile, often closely following larger objects including sharks and jellyfish. The species uses its protractile jaws to suck out prey from the sand or reef, and consumes a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Spawning aggregations gather at night at different times of the year throughout its range. The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> is a considerable constituent of several Middle Eastern fisheries and being of minor importance to many others, with a worldwide annual catch of 1187 t to 3475 t recorded between 2000 and 2010. The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> is a popular gamefish, taken by bait, lure, fly and also spear throughout its range. Several Asian countries currently farm the fish in caged aquaculture. Due to their brilliant colouration, juveniles are popular in marine aquaria.|$|E
25|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, the species is distributed from South Africa along the east African coastline, including the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Its distribution extends east along the Indian and South East Asian coastlines, and south through Indonesia and northern Australia. <b>Golden</b> <b>trevally</b> are recorded from many Indian Ocean islands including Madagascar, The Seychelles and The Maldives. In the Pacific, the species is spread throughout the South East Asian and Indonesian archipelago north mainland China and Japan and south to eastern Australia and New Zealand. <b>Golden</b> <b>trevally</b> have been recorded from many central Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, with their distribution extending to central America. Here its range extends from the Gulf of California in the north to Colombia in the south.|$|E
25|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally's</b> colour is {{the species}} most {{prominent}} distinguishing feature, {{and for which}} it acquired its common names. Juveniles are a bright golden yellow colour over their entire body and all fins, with 7 to 11 black vertical crossbars all over their body. These bars generally alternate between broad and narrow. The caudal fin lobes have dark tips {{and there is a}} prominent black edge to the operculum. As the fish grows, the body becomes more silver to silvery golden and the cross bars fade or disappear, often replaced by dark blotches. The fins remain yellow, often with greenish tinges. The dark edge of the operculum also fades with age.|$|R
5000|$|The Warm Ocean: This section {{contains}} the largest aquarium in Blue Planet, the 4000000 L Ocean tank. It {{is home to}} sharks (zebra shark, blacktip reef shark, wobbegongs and young scalloped hammerheads), stingrays, eagle rays, guitarfish, moray eels, <b>golden</b> <b>trevallies,</b> groupers and more {{that can be seen}} through the 16 by 8 m main window, which is 45 cm thick. There is also a 16 m long shark tunnel. Opposite the Ocean Tank is the 16 m long coral reef with living corals and reef fish. There are also various smaller aquaria with species such as shrimpfish, weedy seadragon, seahorses, a Mediterranean aquarium, and the highly venomous stonefish, lionfish and olive sea snake.|$|R

25|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> {{predominantly}} occupies {{inshore waters}} of varying substrate, although {{is known to}} occur on deeper continental shelf reefs in Australia. In coastal areas the species inhabits rocky and coral reefs as well as open sand flats where it forages for food. A systematic study in northern Australia indicated it {{to be one of}} the only species to be approximately equally distributed in both reef and soft-bottom habitats. <b>Golden</b> <b>trevally</b> appear to prefer clear water to turbid waters, and thus is only encountered rarely in low turbidity estuarine environments. One known exception to this was the capture of several individuals in a shallow mangrove swamp in Baja California which appeared to be foraging for prey.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> {{are often}} used in marine aquaria due to their vivid yellow colour and black banding, with larger {{individuals}} also kept in larger tanks. The development of laboratory culturing specifically for the aquarium trade has been achieved in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Tailor {{is one of}} {{the more}} common species sought by anglers on Fraser Island and along the Queensland coast. Other fish caught on the eastern coast include jewfish, <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> and surf bream, while whiting, {{flathead}} and surf bream prefer the calmer western waters. Pilchards, bloodworms, yabbies, pipi and sandworms can all be used for bait. Fishing is banned in the island's creeks and lakes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> is a diurnal {{foraging}} carnivore which, {{unlike other}} carangids, does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth {{possessed by the}} species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and filtered through the gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped and swallowed. The species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. <b>Golden</b> <b>trevally</b> found inhabiting a mangrove swamp {{were found to have}} fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A laboratory study using only four individuals being fed found that one fish will take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> {{has long}} {{been used as a}} food fish by humans, with archeological sites in the United Arab Emirates {{yielding}} the remains of this species dating back to prehistory. The species is still fished for using many traditional methods in the Pacific Islands, where it is netted and speared when it moves to shallower waters. On a larger commercial scale, the species is often caught using gill nets and other artisanal fish-trapping methods. The FAO catch records for <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> indicate it forms a regular part of the fisheries of the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain and to a much lesser extent in Australia and Singapore.

The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> is also farmed in cage aquaculture by Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with spawning demonstrated in captivity in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> {{is found}} {{either as a}} solitary {{individual}} or in small schools as an adult.

In the Indian Ocean, in the southern Persian Gulf, spawning occurred in April and May, with defined peaks in recruitment of juveniles into the local fishery during September and October. The male:female sex ratio in this population was 1:1.01, close to parity. Growth rates were also studied using otoliths in this population, with an increase in growth rate during the winter (November to April).

The species' mouth {{is one of its}} defining features; the mouth is highly protractile and fleshy, with specimens greater than 90mm having no teeth on the jaws, vomer or tongue. Smaller individuals have a series of small villiform teeth in both jaws. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first with 7 spines, the second with 1 spine and 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 detached spines followed by 1 spine and 15 to 17 soft rays, while the pelvic fin consists of 1 spine and 19 to 20 soft rays. The curved part of the lateral line is moderately arched; containing 62 to 73 scales, and approximately equal in length to the straight section containing 15 to 27 scales and 18 to 25 scutes.

Sharks were tracked for up to 26 h and generally swam slowly at ≃ 0. 7 m s - 1 parallel to the reef edge; occasionally they swam in a wide arc adjacent to passes in the reef. All tracked sharks made regular dives through the water column, mostly from the surface to near the bottom.

The light and scanning electron microscopical examination {{made it possible to}} study in detail the morphology of this so far little-known species. Its pseudolabia were found to possess distinct anterior protrusions (protuberances), sublabia are absent, only four cephalic papillae are present, deirids are bifurcated, and the male possesses six pairs of postanal papillae. By its morphology, M. magnum seems to be most similar to species of Salvelinema Trofimenko, 1962, also from the swimbladder of fishes, differing from them mainly in the presence of median wedge-shaped outgrowths in the mouth, lateral alae, the longer spicule on the right side, and a fewer number of pairs of preanal papillae in the male.

40|$|Carangids are {{important}} ecological components of coastal and reef habitats, {{in addition to}} their economic significance as a target species for some fishers. Despite these important ecological and economic roles, little information is available on the movement ecology of these species. Passive acoustic monitoring was used to track the movements of 16 giant trevally Caranx ignobilis and 20 <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> Gnathanodon speciosus in Cleveland Bay off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Long-term observations of behaviour and movement were recorded via a network of acoustic receivers, and a network analysis approach (a novel, alternative approach to conventional movement analysis) was applied to the collected data. Tagged individuals were present in the study region between 30 and 394 d (mean +/- SD: 166 +/- 116 d) with a mean +/- SE residency index of 0. 7 +/- 0. 1. Notable inter-annual variation occurred with individuals that were detected on more days and more receivers, moved more frequently, and were more resident in some years than in others. In addition, movement patterns differed between species, with C. ignobilis being detected on fewer days by fewer receivers and moving less than G. speciosus. Network analysis revealed that a combination of factors including ontogeny, foraging niche, and habitat influences may explain differences in space use between the species.

40|$|Understanding {{movement}} {{is important for}} defining animal spatial ecology and ensuring effective management and conservation. Accordingly, data on animal movement patterns, connectivity and habitat use have become crucial elements in management and conservation decisions. Large-scale movements of marine individuals are monitored using new tracking technologies such as acoustic monitoring. These new technologies often produce large amounts of high quality data, so data generation {{is no longer a}} challenge, however, data analysis and modelling are emerging issues. Arrangement of acoustic receivers into arrays or grids (i. e., as a "network") fits well with the use of an innovative approach: Network Analysis. Network Analysis is a powerful tool for examining the structure of complex interacting systems that are represented as a network characterized by connections between nodes. The use of Network Analysis to look at animal spatial ecology in the marine environment is in its early stages with only a few studies completed. Consequently, the potential of Network Analysis in studying animal spatial ecology using acoustic monitoring data is largely unexplored. However, this approach has been intensely used in other areas, including landscape ecology, and the results have proven incredibly useful for management and conservation. By combining acoustic monitoring and Network Analysis, researchers may be able to study the spatial ecology of species in the marine environment. Therefore, this project aimed to determine the contribution of Network Analysis in understanding marine animal spatial ecology using acoustic monitoring data. Literature analysis suggested that Network Analysis can help characterise marine animal spatial ecology in new ways, providing many tools to understand the complex interaction between animals and their environment. The multi-disciplinary nature of Network Analysis provides the researcher with convenient tools to understand the complexity of movement at different scales, compare movements between individuals or between species, and investigate the effect of environmental factors on the movement. The reviewed techniques were tested on acoustic monitoring data from six predator species. Field work was conducted along the north-east coast of Queensland, Australia. Two arrays of 67 and 48 acoustic transmitters deployed in the central section of the Great Barrier Reef passively tracked six predator species from 2008 to 2014. Two nearshore sharks (pigeye shark (Carcharhinus amboinensis) and spottail shark (Carcharhinus sorrah)), two reef sharks (silvertip shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus) and grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos)), and two carangid teleosts (giant trevally (Caranx ignobilis) and <b>golden</b> <b>trevally</b> (Gnathanodon speciosus)) were selected to determine efficacy of the Network Analysis method to contribute to the understanding of marine animal spatial ecology. To investigate the utility of Network Analysis in identifying core use areas and compare the results with traditional analysis, a case study using C. amboinensis and C. sorrah was conducted. Comparison of traditional analysis (kernel utilization distribution, KUD) and Network Analysis demonstrated that both methods provided similar results for identifying core use areas (50...|$|E
