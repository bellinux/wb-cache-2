25|$|In the {{presidency}} of Daniel Willard, the motive power department, headed by Col. George H. Emerson, entered on {{a long series of}} experiments intended to improve the performance of the steam locomotive. Particular emphasis was placed on the water tube boiler, as opposed to the <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler used from the earliest days of steam. (In practice, only the firebox used water tubes.) The culmination of these experiments was the duplex #5600 George H. Emerson, the first of its kind. It was to be succeeded by a visionary locomotive of a unique design, of which very little was built before the whole project was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Precisely {{when the}} Chaplin Distiller was {{installed}} on Xantho {{is open to}} conjecture. It is known that from 1864 to 1870, Xantho operated out of Wick, West Sussex and was permitted to take excursions to sea. It is possible that this apparatus was installed {{during this period of}} time. It is more feasible however that this device was installed at a later date as part of the major refurbishing programme implemented by the metal merchant Robert Stewart, who, in 1871, completely and radically re-engineered the ship, replacing the original side paddlewheel steam propulsion with a new marine <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler and screw propulsion, utilising a secondhand Horizontal Trunk Engine designed by John Penn and Son.|$|E

50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. <b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|E

50|$|Wartime {{experience}} {{showed the}} 100 mm guns were inferior but the plans to re-equip the ship were turned {{down because of}} war troubles. In 1915 number of torpedo <b>firing</b> <b>tubes</b> was increased to 8.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, when metallurgists {{were able to}} better {{understand}} what properties and processes made good iron, it was being displaced by steel. Also, the old cylindrical boilers with <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> were displaced by water tube boilers, which are inherently safer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers {{were the}} main type used for early {{high-pressure}} steam (typical steam locomotive practice), but they were {{to a large extent}} displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications.|$|E
5000|$|She {{was fitted}} with a dual-furnace coal-burning Scotch (<b>fire</b> <b>tube)</b> boiler, 11 ft long by 9 ft diameter, with 0.712 in thick boiler plating. The boiler was rated for up to , but {{ordinary}} working pressure was [...] Coal capacity was 43 tons, and she burned about two tons per 24 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Boiler explosions {{are of a}} {{particular}} danger in (locomotive-type) <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers because {{the top of the}} firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown stays to the point of failure, even at normal working pressure.|$|E
50|$|Fire-tube boilers {{sometimes}} have water-tubes as well, {{to increase the}} heating surface. A Cornish boiler may have several water-tubes across {{the diameter of the}} flue (this is common in steam launches). A locomotive boiler with a wide firebox may have arch tubes or thermic syphons. As firebox technology developed, it was found that placing a baffle of firebricks (heat-resistant bricks) inside the firebox to direct the flow of hot flue gasses up into the top of the firebox before it flowed into the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> increased efficiency by equalizing the heat between upper and lower <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> To hold these in place, a metal bracket was used, but to prevent these brackets from burning and eroding away they were built as water tubes, with cool water {{from the bottom of the}} boiler moving upwards by convection as it heated, and carrying the heat away before the metal reached its failure temperature.|$|R
50|$|Unless the {{autoclave}} uses steam injection, {{the circulation}} fan carries {{the burden of}} assuring temperature uniformity throughout the working chamber. Since the heat flows from the source, whether electric resistance, steam coil, or <b>firing</b> <b>tube,</b> into the circulating air stream {{and then into the}} workload, the greater the airflow turbulence, the better the heat transfer, particularly with workloads that are heavy and dense.|$|R
50|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that it arose out {{of attempts to}} match the power of broad gauge locomotives within {{the limitations of the}} standard gauge of Stephenson railways. However, the patent originally arose from a problem which became apparent as trains travelled longer distances, specifically on the North Midland Railway in England around 1841, where <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> and smokeboxes were becoming destroyed by the heat.|$|R
50|$|In 1830 {{he invented}} an early form of storage room heater. It {{comprised}} a small <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler with a detachable flue {{which could be}} heated either outside or indoors with the flue connected to a chimney. Once hot the hot water container could be wheeled to where heat was required and the issuing heat could be altered using adjustable doors.|$|E
50|$|In about 1812, Trevithick {{designed}} the ‘Cornish boiler’. These were horizontal, cylindrical boilers {{with a single}} internal <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> or flue passing horizontally through the middle. Hot exhaust gases from the fire passed through the flue thus increasing the surface area heating the water and improving efficiency. These types were installed in the Boulton and Watt pumping engines at Dolcoath and more than doubled their efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Steam was {{initially}} supplied by 14 horizontal multi-tubular under-fired (Colonial) <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers by G. & C. Hoskins, Sydney. Each was rated at [...] and operated at a pressure of [...]The boilers were hand fired and had natural draught {{to a single}} chimney {{at the end of}} the building. Only twelve boilers were needed to provide sufficient steam for full capacity power generation, leaving two in reserve.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the Class 15, it was still early days for water {{treatment}} and enough trouble was experienced to result in their steel fireboxes being replaced with copper fireboxes. The locomotive's one flaw was excessively long <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> On later models like the Class 15A, Hendrie improved the boiler by adding a combustion chamber, which shortened the distance between tube plates from 21 ft to 19 ft.|$|R
50|$|Panzerfaust 150: {{this was}} a major {{redesign}} of the weapon, and was deployed in limited numbers {{near the end of}} the war. The <b>firing</b> <b>tube</b> was reinforced and reusable for up to ten shots. A new pointed warhead with increased armour penetration and two-stage propellant ignition gave a higher velocity of 85 m per second. Production started in March 1945, two months before the end of the war.|$|R
5000|$|An {{intercontinental}} missile, the R-39 had a three-stage solid-fuel boost {{design with}} a liquid-fuel post-boost unit carrying {{up to ten}} multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle warheads. Like other SLBMs the initial launch was powered by a gas generator {{in the bottom of}} the <b>firing</b> <b>tube.</b> During the missiles passage through the water additional motors produce a gaseous wall around the missile, reducing hydrodynamic resistance. The launch system was designated [...] "D-19".|$|R
50|$|Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted of Fredrikstad, Norway {{built the}} ship as the banana boat SS Honduras. She had two <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers with a {{combined}} heating surface of 3943 sq ft that supplied steam at 180 lbf/in2 to a three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine. There is some discrepancy over her nominal horsepower: a Norwegian source claims that her engine produced 258 NHP but Lloyds Register records it as 188 NHP.|$|E
50|$|The Franco-Crosti boiler is a {{modification}} of the conventional <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler design used on most steam locomotives. Unlike conventional boilers the heat remaining in the exhaust gases is used to preheat the water supply for the main boiler using a secondary heat exchange mechanism. This mechanism, known as the feedwater heater is essentially a secondary boiler. The preheated feedwater is fed at full boiler pressure into the main boiler via clack valves.|$|E
50|$|When the {{evacuation}} started, some people left via rear exits. The vast intake of oxygen turned the club's hall {{into a large}} <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> and boosted the spread of fire. As fumes and smoke overtook the air, panic erupted and patrons stampeded toward the exit. According to witnesses, one leaf of the club's double doors was sealed shut, and the public {{was unaware of the}} backdoor exit behind the stage not shown by emergency lighting.|$|E
50|$|The second {{locomotive}} of the class, No.2002 Earl Marischal {{was completed}} by 1935, also at Doncaster, and was fitted with Walschaerts valve gear, as used on Gresley Pacifics, and had a greater superheater heating area of 776.5 sq ft, obtained by using larger diameter <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> At low cutoffs smoke clearance on No.2002 was unsatisfactory: wind tunnel experiments led to an additional second pair of smoke deflectors being fitted inward of the first.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{pressurized}} container {{such as the}} waterside of a steam boiler ruptures, it is always followed by some degree of steam explosion. A common operating temperature and pressure for a marine boiler is around 950 P.S.I. (6.55 MPa) and 850 °F (454 °C) at the outlet of the superheater. A steam boiler has an interface of steam and water in the steam drum, {{which is where the}} water is finally evaporating due to the heat input, usually oil-fired burners. When a water tube fails due to any of a variety of reasons, it causes the water in the boiler to expand out of the opening into the furnace area that is only a few P.S.I. above atmospheric pressure. This will likely extinguish all fires and expands over the large surface area {{on the sides of the}} boiler. To decrease the likelihood of a devastating explosion, boilers have gone from the [...] "fire-tube" [...] designs, where the heat was added by passing hot gases through tubes in a body of water, to [...] "water-tube" [...] boilers that have the water inside of the tubes and the furnace area is around the tubes. Old [...] "fire-tube" [...] boilers often failed due to poor build quality or lack of maintenance (such as corrosion of the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes,</b> or fatigue of the boiler shell due to constant expansion and contraction). A failure of <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> forces large volumes of high pressure, high temperature steam back down the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> in a fraction of a second and often blows the burners off the front of the boiler, whereas a failure of the pressure vessel surrounding the water would lead to a full and entire evacuation of the boiler's contents in a large steam explosion. On a marine boiler, this would certainly destroy the ship's propulsion plant and possibly the corresponding end of the ship.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} power of the steam blast was {{discovered}} it became apparent that a smokebox was needed beneath the chimney, to provide a space in which the exhaust gases emerging from the boiler tubes can mix with the steam. This had the added advantage of allowing access to collect the ash drawn through the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> by the draught. The blastpipe, from which steam is emitted, was mounted directly beneath the chimney {{at the bottom of the}} smokebox.|$|R
5000|$|The sealed ultra-high-pressure circuit ran {{at between}} , {{depending}} on the rate of firing. The HP boiler worked at approx , and the low-pressure boiler at [...] The UHP and HP boilers were of a water tube design, while the LP boiler was a <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler typical for steam locomotives. The LP cylinders were driven {{with a mixture of}} the HP cylinder exhaust and the LP boiler output. Both HP and LP boilers had superheaters.|$|E
5000|$|Contracts {{for both}} yards and the ships was signed on December 20, 1940. All the ships {{to be built}} were collectively called the Ocean class and to be of an {{existing}} British design for 5-hatch cargo ships of about 10,000 tons' load displacement and 11 knots' service speed using obsolete, but readily available, triple-expansion reciprocating steam engine and coal-fired Scotch-type <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers. The first of these vessels, the [...] was launched at the Todd-California yard on October 15, 1941.|$|E
50|$|While {{a capable}} {{locomotive}} for the day, its technology was somewhat antiquated compared to George and Robert Stephenson's Rocket, {{the winner of}} the Rainhill Trials and the £500 prize money. Instead of the <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler of Rocket, Sans Pareil had a double return flue. To increase the heating surface area, the two flues were joined by a U shaped tube at the forward end of the boiler; the firebox and chimney were both positioned at the rear same end, one on either side.|$|E
50|$|A {{few hours}} later, she sighted two freighters and <b>fired</b> <b>tubes</b> 1 and 2 at the lead ship. Her No. 1 <b>tube</b> did not <b>fire,</b> and her No. 2 torpedo missed astern. Two more torpedoes were {{fired at the}} ships, but both missed. Enemy planes {{arrived on the scene}} soon {{afterward}} and for over two hours aerial depth charges in salvos of two and three were dropped. Despite water depth of , submarines were visible at any depth against the light colored bottom.|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessor}} Class 15 locomotives had one flaw, their excessively long <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> When more locomotives of {{the type}} were ordered, Hendrie improved the boiler by adding a combustion chamber in the firebox, which shortened the distance between tube plates from 21 ft to 19 ft. When the first five of these redesigned locomotives were delivered in 1914, they were designated Class 15A. Altogether 119 were ultimately built in ten batches by three manufacturers. Being wartime, initial production and delivery occurred in dribs and drabs.|$|R
25|$|At {{the front}} of the boiler is the smokebox, into which used exhaust steam is {{injected}} to increase the draught of smoke and combustion gases through the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> in the boiler and out through the chimney. The search for thermal efficiency greater than that of the typical fire-tube boiler led such engineers as Nigel Gresley to consider innovations such as the water-tube boiler. Although he tested the concept on the LNER Class W1, the difficulties during development exceeded the will to solve the efficiency problem at the time.|$|R
