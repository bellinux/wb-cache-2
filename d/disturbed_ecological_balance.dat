The {{results revealed that}} cold distilled water extracts of O. basilicum and E. globulus were the most effective ones for inhibiting the growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Butanolic and ethanolic extracts of the tested plants inhibited the pathogen growth to a higher extent than water extracts. Butanolic extract of O. basilicum completely inhibited the growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici at concentrations 1. 5 and 2. 0 % (v/v). Butanolic extracts (2. 0 %) of tested plants had a strong inhibitory effect on hydrolytic enzymes; β-glucosidase, pectin lyase and protease of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici.

40|$|Following an {{unsustainable}} development of industry resulting from human {{population growth and}} its corresponding demands, the concern for the environmental implication of natural and artificial pollutants stemming from human activities has increased. Environmental pollutants in air, water, soil, sediments, food and consumer products, {{can get into the}} body of organism through eating, breathing or be absorbed through the skin. They will be assimilated into the blood stream and have direct or indirect impact on their physiological performance. Among others, it seems that aquatic organisms are more exposed to the most pollutants so that aquatic environments are the ultimate destination of pollutants like industrial effluents, urban wastewaters and agricultural run-off. Pollutants such as heavy metals and chemical compounds are considered to be very toxic and their accumulations through biological magnification can damage the ecosystem and its biodiversity. Some of these pollutants which are known as â��Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) â�� can affect the endocrine system of aquatic organisms leading to problems in reproductive behaviors, reproductive organs, quality of sexual gametes, reproductive potential, growth and development and other related immunological issues for animals or even humans. These compounds can mainly interfere with the aquatic populations through disturbance in hormonal performance especially sexual hormones. This not only <b>disturbs</b> the <b>ecological</b> <b>balance</b> but also causes biodiversity reduction, unsustainable aquatic population and destruction of ecosystems, subsequently. This study aimed to investigate the role of environmental pollutants and their side effects on aquatic organisms and hence human health...|$|R

Moreover, continuing population growth make that more fertilizers are needed to the agriculture. To resolve these issues, {{a large number of}} researches related to ammonium and phosphate removal and recovery from wastewater have been carried out in the last years.

It was evaluate the sorption performance of these synthesized zeolites in ammonium single system and ammonium-phosphate binary system. Equilibrium and kinetic studies were performed through the batch experiments. Equilibrium experimental data was well fitted by Langmuir isotherm equation and reported sorption capacities of 109 mg·g- 1 and 21 mg·g- 1 for Na-Ze and 17 mg·g- 1 and 29 mg·g- 1 for K-Ze in single and binary system, respectively.

40|$|Vegetation and {{tropical}} forests {{in particular have}} {{a central role in}} mitigating the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric CO 2. Photosynthesis is the fundamental process during which CO 2 is taken up by plants and fixed into carbohydrates. The effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis in different plant species is directly related to degree-days (D-D) as well as the leaf area index (LAI). Throughout the dry season, the reduced net primary productivity is tightly correlated with increasing D-D, while the reduction in soil moisture leads to progressive canopy thinning, indicated by decreasing LAI. Forest degradation exacerbated by soil erosion and depletion of nutrients in response to high rainfall intensities during the rainy season further <b>disturbs</b> the <b>ecological</b> <b>balance</b> of the entire ecosystem, destabilising it beyond its natural resilience. Given this fact, ground-based evidence and remote sensing-based findings, we propose a climatically induced cascade of events leading to a gradual alteration of the tropical forest ecosystems on Borneo with a diminishing ability to absorb CO 2 and release O 2. Such a feedback loop, which is primarily triggered by increases in temperature, has potentially dangerous outcome for tropical ecosystems and has already been observed in the north-western state of Brunei Darussalam. The island of Borneo as a whole seems to have reached a level of forest degradation that is beyond a point of no return. In the worst-case scenario, the next niche of stability may be a destruction of tropical forests and the loss of a major proportion of Earth’s biodiversity.

As the movement gathered shape under its leaders, the name Chipko movement was attached to their activities. According to Chipko historians, the term originally used by Bhatt was the word [...] "angalwaltha" [...] in the Garhwali language for [...] "embrace", which later was adapted to the Hindi word, Chipko, which means to stick. [...] Over the next five years, the movement spread to many districts in the region, and within a decade throughout the Uttarakhand Himalayas. Larger issues of ecological and economic exploitation of the region were raised. The villagers demanded that no forest-exploiting contracts should be given to outsiders and local communities should have effective control over natural resources like land, water, and forests. They wanted the government to provide low-cost materials to small industries and ensure development of the region without <b>disturbing</b> the <b>ecological</b> <b>balance.</b> The movement took up economic issues of landless forest workers and asked for guarantees of minimum wage.

While visible damages are evident in the wildlife populations and marine estuaries, the most significant affect may be on the most basic level of the ecosystems: the bacterial and plankton populations. We present results from high throughput DNA sequencing of close-to-shore water and beach soil samples before and during the appearance of oil in Louisiana and Mississippi. Sixteen samples were taken over a two month period at approximately two week intervals from Grand Isle, LA and Gulfport, MS and were sequenced using the Illumina GAIIx platform. Significant genomic-based population fluctuations were observed in the soil and water samples. These included large spikes in the human pathogen Vibrio cholera, a sharp increase in Rickettsiales sp., and decrease of Synechococus sp. in water samples. Analysis of the contiguous de-novo assembled DNAs (contigs) from the samples also suggested the loss of biodiversity in water samples by the time oil appeared at the shores in both locations. Our observations lead us to the conclusion that oil strongly influenced microbial population dynamics, had a striking impact on the phytoplankton and other flora present prior to the appearance of oil, and that the microbial community had not recovered to pre-spill conditions by the end of our observational period...|$|R

The present study examined the effect of socio and psychogenic factors on environmental friendly behaviour among today’s youth. In order to make them realize their own responsibilities toward environment, this is a crucial time to realize that environmental sensitivity and environment friendly behaviour should be cultivated among masses particularly among youth. Environment friendly behaviour is any action of an individual or a group directed towards the remediation of environmental issues / problems. Thus, environmental education policies fund both teacher training and worker training initiatives. Teachers must be trained to effectively teach and incorporate environmental studies in their curricula. On the other hand, the current workforce must be trained or re-trained so that they can adapt to the new green economy.
