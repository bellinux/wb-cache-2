5|$|Some {{majors and}} minors offer special {{academic}} programs. Completion {{of these programs}} does not result in any minor or other recognition. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> wishes to enter a professional school after graduation, {{he or she may}} undertake one of the pre-professional programs offered. Internships are required for some majors, where students can experience life outside of the classroom, however any student can enroll in an internship for elective credit. Saint Anselm participates in an archaeological excavation program allowing students to travel to Italy and unearth ancient Roman treasures. For prospective engineers, the college has agreements with other schools through the cooperative engineering program.|$|E
5|$|According to its May 1853 {{advertisement}} in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, {{the institute}} provided instruction {{to the following}} grades during its summer session: fifth grade for $5, fourth grade for $8, third grade for $10, second grade for $12, and first grade (its highest grade) for $15. Boarding, including laundry, meals, and lighting, was $45, and music lessons with use of the piano were $25. An additional fee of 25 cents was charged <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> was suspended. The fifth grade was taught by the institute's Primary Department, and lessons included spelling, reading and elementary arithmetic. The fourth grade was taught by the institute's Junior Department and included courses in writing and preparatory English grammar and geography. The third grade was instructed by the English Department and offered studies in geography and English; and the second grade was also taught by the English Department with courses in history and natural philosophy.

5|$|The Aggie Ring {{cannot be}} {{purchased}} unless specific requirements are met: a current student {{must be in}} good standing with a minimum 2.00 GPA on a 4.00 scale. In addition, the student must have completed 90 hours of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A Graduate students may receive a Ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed. If your graduate degree requires a thesis, your Ring will be delivered on Aggie Ring Day if the thesis has been defended by the deadline set by the Office of Graduate Studies. If the thesis has not been defended by this date, the Aggie Ring will be held until the qualification is met. A Ph.D. student may receive their Ring if they have completed all formal coursework in the degree plan, has a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above, has successfully completed the residency requirement, has successfully passed the preliminary exam, and has an approved research proposal on file. A Ring may be purchased upon graduation <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student,</b> either undergraduate or graduate, did not meet these criteria while pursuing the degree.|$|E

5|$|The {{professorship}} {{was suspended}} for {{two years after the}} death of Robert Gandell in 1887. The electoral board had met to select a successor, but were unable to make a suitable appointment, and so obtained the permission of the university authorities to adjourn. When the board resumed in 1889, one of the previous applicants, David Margoliouth, re-applied for the position and was successful, even though none of the people recommending him made any mention of whether he knew any Arabic. As professor, Margoliouth taught the syllabus for the final examinations in lectures over two years, regardless of the stage that students had reached, and regarded it as bad luck <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> had to tackle the more difficult texts in one year and the easier texts in the next.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> has a {{paternal}} lineage at the college, he {{will join}} the house of his ancestry on {{becoming part of the}} school. Otherwise, house assignment is typically random.|$|E
25|$|Dependent upon funding, {{students}} {{also have the}} opportunity to attend the new four-year Tech Valley High School. Even <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> attends Tech Valley High School, the student still receives their diploma from their home school district.|$|E
30|$|<b>If</b> <b>an</b> answer {{comes out}} of an instructor’s mouth, the student assumes it’s correct and just write it down. They’ve learned very little. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>students</b> <b>if</b> forced to listen to another student’s {{explanation}} and decide if it is reasonable or not, then the student is using much higher-order cognitive skills in the exercise.|$|R
25|$|Burial of {{dependent}} children {{is limited to}} unmarried children under 21 years of age, or under 23 years of age <b>if</b> <b>a</b> full-time <b>student</b> at <b>an</b> approved educational institution.

25|$|Some {{students}} attend private schools through welfare subsidies. This {{is often the}} case <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{is considered to be a}} child at risk: students who have learning disabilities, special needs or come from dysfunctional home environments.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{vocational}} school courses: four-year courses and three-year courses. Three-year courses are crafts and <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> that has a craft diploma wants to attend a university, they must enroll in the fourth year of a four-year course inordinately.|$|E
25|$|However, {{from the}} autumn of 2011, a new grading scale has been {{introduced}} into the Swedish school system: A, B, C, D, and E as passing grades and F as failing. B and D work as filling grades, for when a student hasn't reached all objectives for C or A but has reached most of them. If the student can't be graded, e.g. extensive truancy, the student will receive a dash instead of an F. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{is on the verge}} of receiving an F in a certain subject/course, the teacher responsible for that subject will notify the student and the student's parents. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> is given an F, they will receive a written review of how to improve themselves.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} {{offers a}} variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility to participate is set by school board policies. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student's</b> cumulative or marking period grade drops below passing in more than one subject, the student is ineligible for participation in interscholastic athletic activities for a period of seven calendar days.|$|R
50|$|Some {{institutions}} {{may have}} {{restrictions on the}} number of hours per week that students can work. Also, there may be restrictions that pertain to the student's grade point average. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student's</b> grade point average slips below a certain point, the college may not allow the student to work through the FWS program.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student(s)</b> {{has been}} {{expelled}} from two schools, then any state school is legally allowed to refuse admittance of that student. (Schools on special measures may refuse to admit <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{who has been}} expelled from only one school.) Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>student</b> who has been expelled from two schools might be totally removed from the state education system. As a result, it is rare for a pupil to be expelled (or permanently excluded) in the UK's state sector.|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{does not}} have the feeling he wants to be tied to this teacher {{for the rest of his}} life, he may refuse to take dharma {{transmission}} from this particular teacher.

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> is not {{seated in}} his or her chair, with their bags off their desk when the bell rings, they must leave class and report to room 32, a {{detention}} room, and miss that class for that day, receiving a 0. This policy is designed to teach students the importance of punctuality.|$|E
25|$|WPI's student {{performance}} evaluation system uses grades A, B, or C. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{were not to}} satisfactorily complete the course or they elect to drop the course, they would receive a No Record (NR). The NR designation is used {{since there is no}} differentiation between a dropped course or an unsuccessful attempt to complete it.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, the National Criminal Justice Reference System {{published}} a report defending {{the use of}} corporal punishment in schools, in which a school administrator noted that he documented 200 cases, over his 13-year career, of using corporal punishmenting, noting [...] "That's not just using paddles in every instance, but <b>if</b> you shake <b>a</b> <b>student,</b> <b>if</b> you grab <b>a</b> <b>student,</b> <b>if</b> you wash <b>a</b> <b>student's</b> mouth out with soap, that's corporal punishment under {{the definition of the}} law".|$|R
50|$|Bishop Kenny {{places a}} {{particularly}} {{strong emphasis on}} community service, encouraging their students to serve the community. All {{students are required to}} fulfill community service requirements of 20 hours per academic year. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>students</b> fails to complete the service requirements, then they will face an academic penalty. During the 2011-2012 academic year the student body performed 25,043 hours of community service.|$|R
50|$|The {{academics}} {{are followed}} {{by the laws of}} the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>students</b> happens to fail either Math, English or French they {{would have to go to}} summer school <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>students</b> fails all they would have to repeat the school year. The mid-term exams take place in January and the final exams take place in June. They are three types of courses enriched, regular, and special ed (special ed is only for secondary one and two.) Enriched are for those who get above 75% the first half of the school year they learn academic in their level and the second half the level next. Regular are for students who learn academics in their own level throughout their whole school year. Special ed are for those with learning disabilities and those who get lower than a 65% average. In order for <b>a</b> <b>student</b> to graduate they need 54 credits. Students can work hard and get the credits in secondary three, four and five.|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{wishes to}} be trained {{in a car with}} an {{automatic}} transmission and takes the road test on such a car, a code or note will be added to the licence and the holder may not drive cars with a manual transmission. A test passed on a manual transmission car also gives qualification to drive automatic transmission cars.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{in grade}} 8 or below takes Algebra I, Geometry, or Algebra II before grade 9, the student {{must take the}} {{respective}} end of course STAAR assessment {{as well as the}} standard STAAR tests given, but {{it is up to the}} school districts to determine if the student should take the STAAR Mathematics test or not; it is completely optional in this case.|$|E
25|$|Education {{outcomes}} {{can lead}} to a constrained nature of teaching and assessment. Assessing liberal outcomes such as creativity, respect for self and others, responsibility, and self-sufficiency, can become problematic. There is not a measurable, observable, or specific way to determine <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> has achieved these outcomes. Due to the nature of specific outcomes, OBE may actually work against its ideals of serving and creating individuals that have achieved many outcomes.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student's</b> {{loan debt}} is high but their income is modest or zero, they may qualify for an income-driven {{repayment}} (IDR) plan. Most major types of federal student loans—except for PLUS loans for parents—are eligible for an IDR plan. Income-driven plans allow borrowers to cap their monthly payments to 10%, 15%, or 20% of disposable income {{for up to}} 20 or 25 years, after which the remaining balance is forgiven.|$|R
5000|$|Uniquely, {{although}} {{classified as}} a separate course, the SEBS program is more commonly {{known to be a}} school within a school, rather than offered courses. Students must register into SEBS program. It is expected of all SEBS students to stay within an unweighted Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher. Managers, advisors, and/or counselors may recommend other courses <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student's</b> grade does not meet the above criteria.|$|R

25|$|The University {{has five}} {{conventional}} residence halls. A {{record number of}} applicants is now requiring Student Life and the Department of University Housing to contract with nearby apartment complexes and hotels. The housing shortage creates student wait lists and financial aid complications. Private rooms typically are not available even <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> {{is willing to pay}} significantly higher rates. Students seeking exemption from the living on campus requirement have to fill out and return paperwork.|$|E
25|$|Teaching machines, {{though perhaps}} rudimentary, were not rigid {{instruments}} of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved {{based upon the}} students' performance. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.|$|E
25|$|The exams {{somewhat}} overlap, {{with the}} medium-hard AMC 10 questions being {{the same as}} the medium-easy ones on the AMC 12. Since 2002, two administrations have been scheduled, so as to avoid conflicts with school breaks. Students are eligible to take an A exam and a B exam, and may even take the AMC 10-A and the AMC 12-B, though they may not take both the AMC 10 and AMC 12 from the same date. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> takes both exams, they may use either score towards qualification to the AIME or USAMO.|$|E
2500|$|School {{counselor}} interventions include {{individual and}} group counseling for some students. [...] For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>student's</b> behavior is interfering {{with his or her}} achievement, the school counselor may observe that <b>student</b> in <b>a</b> class, provide consultation to teachers and other stakeholders to develop (with the <b>student)</b> <b>a</b> plan to address the behavioral issue(s), and then collaborate to implement and evaluate the plan. They also provide consultation services to family members such as college access, career development, parenting skills, study skills, child and adolescent development, and help with school-home transitions.|$|R

One of Rotary's primary goals is promoting peace around the world, and through the Rotary Youth Exchange, it aims {{to make the world a}} more peaceful place one exchange at a time. This rationale follows the logic that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>students</b> experience different cultures and meet people from all around the world, they will be more understanding of foreign people and countries in the future.
